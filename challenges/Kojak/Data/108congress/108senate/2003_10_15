This year marks the 20th \nanniversary of Dr. Bluford's first flight into space, the first African \nAmerican in space. He is a native Philadelphian, of which I am very \nproud. I am equally as proud that he is also a fellow Penn State \ngraduate.\n  He has distinguished this country in his 29 years of service in the \nU.S. Air Force. I will enter into the Record his long list of \naccomplishments in the Air Force, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nthis printed following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. He has won numerous medals and commendations. His first \nflight in space was on August 30, 1983. He became the first African \nAmerican to fly in space. Subsequent to that, he went on three missions \nin space in the shuttle and logged over 688 hours in space. In 1997, he \nwas inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame. Since his \nretirement, he has continued to excel in private enterprise since 1997 \nand is now president of the Aerospace Technology Group.\n  As I mentioned, one of his greatest accomplishments is graduating \nfrom Penn State University, my alma mater. He has an aerospace \nengineering degree from Penn State. He has a master's degree of \nscience, Ph.D. degree in aerospace engineering from the Air Force \nInstitute of Technology, and an MBA degree from the University of \nHouston. His education is phenomenal. His accomplishments in the \nmilitary and space and now in the private sector are something of which \nto take note.\n  We recognize today his great contribution to this country. The \nexample he sets is as a terrific role model for young people of all \nethnic and racial backgrounds. He is a man who has accomplished a \ntremendous amount in\n\n[[Page S12566]]\n\nhis life and obviously has a lot more to contribute. He and his wife \nLinda are here today, and we will have a reception for them starting at \n10 a.m. in one of the reception rooms behind me. I invite my colleagues \nto stop by and meet Dr. Bluford and his wife Linda.\n  I thank him for his tremendous service. I know my colleagues join me \nin recognizing his great accomplishments and great service to this \ncountry.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                       Guion S.

Mr. President, I will state some of my principles as we \ndebate the supplemental appropriations on Iraq.\n  One year ago, America was on the brink of war. Congress debated then \nwhether America should go it alone to confront Saddam Hussein or get \ninternational support to bring the world with us. This week, Congress \ntakes up a nearly similar debate: Do we go it alone or do we find a way \nto share the burden and the cost of the war?\n  Who should pay for the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq? \nAccording to the Bush administration, the answer is the American \ntaxpayer, to the tune of $87 billion.\n  I agree that as we consider this debate, we should have four \nprinciples to guide our thinking. First, there must be international \nburden sharing. If the stability of Iraq is in the world's interest, \nthen the world should help pay for the reconstruction. The \nadministration must be more aggressive in the pursuit of reconstruction \nfunds from other countries and other international institutions.\n  Second, wherever possible, American aid should be loans, not \ngiveaways. Iraq has the world's second largest oil reserves. These oil \nfields are capable of pumping out millions of barrels a day. That \nshould translate into billions of dollars. Those profits should help \nwith the reconstruction.\n  Third, we must always be clear that we support our troops. These are \nordinary men and women called to do extraordinary and dangerous and \ndifficult missions. They put their lives at risk to serve our country. \nOur troops need the equipment, the gear, the backup. And their families \nneed financial support. Military families, with loved ones are in Iraq, \nneed financial support to make ends meet and the health care they \nshould get.\n\n  Third, the administration must lay out its plan to end the occupation \nof Iraq. There was a plan for the war. Now we need a plan for the \npeace. The American people deserve full disclosure: a real assessment \nof where we are going, how long we will be there. Iraq must not turn \ninto a quagmire. We cannot pour in our funds and send more troops with \nno end in sight.\n  Last year, when we debated about the war, I said if it is important \nenough to the world to go, the world should go with us. I voted to go \nto the U.N. to have international legitimacy and international burden \nsharing, to share the dangers along with our troops as well as to share \nthe cost of rebuilding Iraq.\n  During the debate I said: What is going to happen to our troops? And \nI asked it in classified situations and other briefings we received. I \nwanted to know if our troops were going to be greeted with a landmine \nor with a parade. Well, now we know the answer to that.\n  Our troops need all the support they can get. I believe we need more \ntroops, but I do not think we need more American troops; they should \ncome from other countries.\n  I believe there is money that needs to be spent in Iraq but not only \nour money. I think there needs to be international money. We had a \ncoalition of the willing. Now we need a coalition of the wallet. Let \nthem step to the plate to share the financial responsibility to create \nstability and a democracy in Iraq.\n  You bet I am behind our troops. And we want to vote to make sure they \nhave the help and the assistance they need, not only the right gear. We \nunderstand they do not even have the proper body armor they need.\n  We also want to support their families here at home. They come back \nfor 2 weeks for a breather, but their families' hearts are broken as \nthe men and women go back to the war. We need to support those families \nfinancially, and we need to support those things in terms of health \ncare.\n  When it comes to burden sharing, we now know the other countries are \nnot stepping up. They are tepid. They were timid about the war, and \nthey are tepid about reconstruction. Only 61 countries have committed \nto helping. They have committed $1.5 billion to the reconstruction of \nIraq, according to Ambassador Bremer's testimony. That is not enough.\n\n[[Page S12567]]\n\n  But we were also assured by Secretary Rumsfeld that we could get the \nmoney for reconstruction from Iraqi oil. Well, let's get it. I support \nthe kind of thinking that Senator Dorgan has presented, which is to \nreplace the $20 billion in grants for Iraqi reconstruction with loans, \nand to also create a framework for other nations to participate in \nthose loans.\n  On a bipartisan basis, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison is working on an \namendment to make $10 billion in American aid work via a loan through \nthe World Bank, a $10 billion loan through the World Bank, with other \nnations contributing to the World Bank's Iraq reconstruction trust \nfund. That is the kind of thinking we need, and we need to work on a \nbipartisan basis. America needs to know we are trying to work on \na bipartisan basis. But I repeat: We need loans, not giveaways.\n\n  Now, there are others who say: Oh, my gosh, Iraq is shackled with \ndebt.\n  That debt was created by an illegitimate government in Iraq. And who \nis the money owed to? Well, the money is owed to Russia, to Saudi \nArabia, to France. Why can't they forgive the debt? Make that their \nshare. Just forgive the debt. Rather than giving more money, let France \nforgive the debt. Let Russia forgive the debt. Let Saudi Arabia forgive \nthe debt. Let Iraq start with a clean slate and pay back America for \nwhat it is doing.\n  My constituents in Maryland are very patriotic, and they will do \nwhatever is necessary to defend this Nation. But they have families and \nchildren to educate, mothers and fathers who are grappling with the \nhealth care costs of being older, retirement plans to do, and homes to \nbuy. It is not fair to ask the American taxpayer to share the full \nburden of fighting this war.\n  While we are worried about Russia's debt, what about our debt? If we \nare worried about Iraq being too burdened with debt, what about our \ndebt?\n  Now we need a debt of gratitude for what we are doing around the \nworld. I think the way it can be repaid is to forgive the Iraqi debt. \nLet them start with a clean slate just as they are starting with a \nclean government, and move on.\n  When you look at the way they are spending money on reconstruction, \nthey have money for schools, they have money for tech centers, they \nhave money for job training and job centers, water and sewer grants--\nall of what we need in our own communities.\n  We know the people in Iraq have suffered. They have suffered under \nSaddam Hussein. They are now suffering under what looks like an \ninternal civil war going on now among the different tribes.\n  I know the children need health care, the communities need \nelectricity, and they need to have an economy to get back on their \nfeet. But, my gosh, I sure wish some of this money was also being spent \nhere at home.\n  The request for Iraq includes 250 tech centers with 20 laptop \ncomputers each, and computer training. They are going to build seven \ncommunities, with 3,500 units of affordable housing. And--guess what--\nwe are going to build a primary school, two secondary schools, a health \nclinic, a place of worship, and a market in each community.\n  Yet at the same time, HOPE VI and other programs to revitalize \nAmerican cities have been zeroed out. Technical centers to get our kids \nready for the new century is sharply reduced. Infrastructure that we \ndesperately need to protect public health and the environment, such as \nwater and sewer grants, is so spartan and skimpy in my own VA-HUD bill.\n  So we have to look at where we are spending our money, and we have to \nlook at where we are creating debt. If we are creating debt to improve \nour economy, to get our jobs going, I think we know that a little \nborrowing today might create jobs tomorrow. But now we are doing \nmassive borrowing to rebuild Iraq, while others tell us they cannot \nafford to send troops and they cannot afford to spend money. I am \nsaying we are beginning to not be able to afford this war in Iraq.\n  So I hope we can work on some solutions to have Iraq emerge as a \ndemocracy and bring our troops back home. We have to concentrate on how \nwe can have our national honor abroad but restore our national \nTreasury.\n  I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis with my colleagues. \nWe have to get down to business and get strategy on how we are getting \nout of Iraq, and also how we are getting out of debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12567-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12567-S12569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senate knows, 5 years ago I was the \nsponsor in the Senate of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. This is law that \nwas designed to ensure that the Internet be free of discriminatory \ntaxes on Internet commerce and a variety of Internet activities. And it \nwas designed to encourage the growth of the Internet.\n  The law has unquestionably worked. There is absolutely no evidence of \nanyone who has been harmed by the inability to discriminate against \nelectronic commerce.\n  For many months now, Senators of both political parties have been \nworking together to try to ensure the law that expires shortly would be \nreauthorized, and Senators have been working on a cooperative and \nbipartisan basis to go forward and reauthorize this law that has \nworked.\n  I had been under the impression that we were just about ready to \nbring this bill to the floor, but in the last few days a proposal that \nI find truly alarming has been brought forward by some of the State and \nlocal officials. I come to the floor this morning to make sure the \nSenate is actually familiar with the language that is being brought \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this legislation I am \ngoing to discuss be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Non-Texas Markup\n\n\n                      moratorium on internet taxes\n\n       Pub.

Mr. President, what some State and local officials now \nseek to do is to change the definition of ``Internet access,'' which, \nunder current law, cannot be taxed. In doing so, what it would do is \ngive States and localities explicit permission to tax what Internet \nusers do once they get on line. That would mean you could have games, \nmusic, magazines, newspapers, information services, financial services, \nresearch services, or other products of services, in effect, facing a \nbarrage of new taxes.\n  The phrase ``you've got mail'' would be replaced with ``you owe \ntaxes.'' That is what this proposal would mean to 142 million Americans \nwith household Internet access. Under this proposal, the consumer could \nbe taxed every time they send an e-mail, every time they read their \nlocal newspaper online or check the score of a football game.\n  Those who are making this proposal are not going to come out publicly \nand talk about their ideas for taxing e-mail. There isn't a headline in \nthe language that I have put into the Congressional Record today that \nsays: Watch out, our plan is going to tax e-mail. But there is no \nquestion that a clear reading of this legislative language will mean \njust that. Consumers could be taxed every time they check a bank \nstatement online. They could be taxed for paying their bills online. \nThey could be taxed each time they check the sports scores online or \nlisten to the weather on streaming radio. Every time a consumer turns \nto Google research service, they could be taxed for each key stroke. If \nthat happened, no question, some in my office would just go bankrupt.\n  As the Chair knows, being so instrumental in working with me and \nmembers of the Senate Commerce Committee, this law has worked. It has \nbeen a bipartisan law based on the simple proposition that you would \ntreat activity online just as you treat activity online. Some made dire \npredictions about the law originally that States and localities would \nbe denied the opportunity to gain revenue for essential services. It \nhas been clear that they have been proven incorrect. Internet commerce \nis now just a small part of our economy. In fact, what we have seen is \na merger of what I call bricks and clicks, traditional commerce with \nInternet commerce. We have not seen problems under current law.\n  But by redefining the definition of Internet access, as the proposal \ndoes that I have put into the Congressional Record today, in effect you \ngive a green light to State and local authorities all across the \ncountry to tax services that are integral to Internet access, including \ne-mail.\n  I believe this proposal would make wider the digital divide in this \ncountry. I think the new taxes would restrict growth in the Internet. \nThe American consumer needs to know exactly what some of these taxing \nauthorities are really up to. What they really want is either to stop \nthe ban on Internet access taxes from becoming permanent or they are \nlooking for statutory language which would stick consumers with \nhundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes each year.\n  In my view, either option would be unacceptable to a majority of \nSenators. I hope, as the negotiations originally proceeded in the \nCommerce Committee and now in the Finance Committee, that there would \nbe an effort to make the ban on discriminatory taxes on Internet \ncommerce permanent and, in particular, let us ensure that the hard hit \nAmerican consumer is protected from unfair tax schemes such as those I \nhave outlined this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that our side \ntook 3 minutes early. So how much time is remaining on the other side?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has 26 minutes 58 seconds. \nThe minority has 13 minutes 34 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will proceed. If a Member of the \nother side comes, I will be happy to yield to them under their time. \nBut I will start with the majority time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator from Texas \nis recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12569-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12569-S12570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SCHOOL FOR IRAQ'S CHILDREN\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, one of the biggest successes in Iraq \nin the past month has been the first day of school for millions of \nIraqi children. America's service men and women worked with local \npartners to refurbish the schools that were destroyed under Saddam \nHussein's regime so these children could experience the freedom that \ncomes with learning. One example of this progress involves soldiers \nfrom the 1st Armored Division's 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment, who \ndid an immense amount to improve the quality of life for Iraqi \nchildren. Led by Squadron Commander LTC Charles Williams, the soldiers \nfocused their efforts on 25 schools around the rim of Baghdad. The \nschools had been neglected by the former regime.\n  They were in a sad state when 1AD forces arrived in Baghdad several \nmonths ago. The desks were in pieces. The blackboards were broken. \nThere were no doors on the rooms and there were no ceiling fans. There \nwas very poor lighting or no lighting at all. The squadron took charge. \nTheir engineers came forward. American contractors and local Iraqi \ncontractors worked together to repair the schools.\n  Over the past few months the schools underwent a dramatic change: \nWalls were painted. Electrical wiring and plumbing were fixed. Glass \nwas replaced. Security bars were installed in windows and school \nsupplies were issued.\n  I have some pictures that show better than any words could some of \nthe progress that is being made. This is a picture of Mahmoud Al-\nJabouri, a former Iraqi Army general who worked with the 1st Squadron, \n1st Cavalry Regiment, 1st Armored Division in repairing the schools in \nBaghdad. He is giving a speech for the first day of classes at Dufaf \nAl-Neil primary school. The progress our troops have been making in \nworking with Iraqi citizens enabled this school to open. It was a joint \neffort. We can see the children at the opening day of the school with \nour soldiers and the former Iraqi general.\n  Look at the excitement on the Iraqi faces as soldiers from the 1st \nSquadron,\n\n[[Page S12570]]\n\n1st Cavalry Regiment helped an Iraqi schoolgirl cut the ribbon at a \nceremony celebrating the first day of school. These children are so \nexcited, as they see their world opening up. Iraqi children at Dufaf \nAl-Neil school hold up the markers they received along with other gifts \nfrom soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Regiment. Everyone can see that these \nschool supplies have opened a new world for these children. Their \nliberation cannot be overemphasized.\n  Aside from the new facilities, there is something else the American \nforces have provided for these children. They have ended the fear and \nterror that Saddam Hussein instilled in Iraqi schools. I want to read \nan excerpt from a National Review article from October 13. This is \nstunning.\n\n       . . . there will be no mysterious disappearances from the \n     classrooms. No teachers and pupils will be found dead in \n     school doorways. . . . Teenage school girls will not be \n     abducted and taken to one of the many harems maintained by \n     Uday, Saddam's sadistic elder son. . . .\n\n  We could hardly imagine how these children went to school living in \nfear that they might be abducted and taken into Uday's harem; that \ntheir teachers might be killed in the doorway for something that they \ncould not even imagine they had said or done wrong. Not only are we \nopening these schools with new school supplies and painted walls and \nlighting, but we have taken the fear from these children that when they \ngo to school, something horrible will happen.\n  Our Armed Forces are performing heroic acts every day, trying to \nensure that the Iraqi people are free and working toward self-\ngovernment. Step by step, normal life in Iraq is being established as \nbasic services are restored and hope is reborn.\n  What we are doing in Iraq is going to change the Middle East. It is \ngoing to give people in this country a taste of freedom, and others \nwill see it. It will be a message bigger than anything we could say \nwould happen. It is the results that we are working for, and the \nPresident is committed to that result.\n  That is why we are debating a supplemental appropriation that would \nbring freedom to this country and begin to spread it throughout the \nMiddle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina). Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12570-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12570-S12571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATION BUILDING IN IRAQ\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wanted to add a couple of thoughts \nthis morning regarding the plan for nation building in Iraq. I had \nsupported vigorously the amendment by Senator Dorgan last evening, but \nbecause of the time constraints I was not able to speak on that \nparticular amendment. I plan to offer a similar amendment--and there \nare others--that will try to help the Senate focus again on the \nopportunities and possibilities for sustaining a successful effort in \nIraq--a successful effort of nation building--by shifting the burden \nfrom the American taxpayers to the Iraqi people and their great \nresources.\n  As you know, Mr. President, I supported the use of force; I supported \nthe overthrow of that regime. I believe that a lot of the information \nthat was given to us has proven not to be true and accurate; \nnonetheless, I support the effort because this was a regime that needed \nto be overthrown. I am also here to say and agree that in order to be \nsuccessful we have to sustain a long-term commitment, not cut and run, \nnot window dress, not put lipstick on a pig, not pretend that things \nare going well--but have things really go well. The verdict is still \nout. I am sure it is not as bad as it is portrayed by the media. \nUsually nothing is as bad as that. The stories tend to be one-sided in \nmany instances. The fact is, this is a very difficult undertaking. We \nhave undertaken it only seven times since World War II.\n  There is a very interesting report that I want to mention at this \ntime. I will give more detailed comments about it later. It is an \nextensive Rand report just finished on nation building. The title is, \n``The Inescapable Responsibility of the World's Only Superpower.'' This \nis bipartisan; it is not a Republican plan, not a Democratic plan. This \nis a bipartisan American view of this issue, a very balanced approach. \nIt says, basically, there are seven lessons that we have learned since \nGermany and our successful Marshall plan effort. I will read excerpts \nfrom them quickly and talk about it later.\n  It says that:\n\n       Multilateral nation-building is more complex and time-\n     consuming than a unilateral approach. But the multilateral \n     approach is considerably less expensive for individual \n     participants.\n\n  So there are tradeoffs. We are doing this in a more unilateral way. I \ndon't necessarily have a problem with that. I understand we have made \nefforts to reach out to our multinational partners, and we have not \nbeen able to reach agreement. Sometimes the United States has to lead \nalone and lead decisively. I am, for one, not opposed to that. I just \nunderstand that it is more expensive. So let's find a way to pay for \nit. Further, the report says:\n\n       Multilateral nation-building can produce more through \n     transformations and greater regional reconciliation than can \n     unilateral efforts.\n\n  That is an argument for multilateral involvement. It also says:\n\n       Unity of command is essential. . . .\n\n  I believe unity of command is one element we have to preserve in \nIraq. It seems as though we are on the path to that end. There are \nproblems, though, that this report points out. One of them is:\n\n       There appears to be an inverse correlation between the size \n     of the military stabilization force and the level of \n     casualties.\n\n  In other words, the more troops and peacekeepers you have on the \nground, the less soldiers you lose. One of the objectives I have as a \nSenator from Louisiana is to lose as few soldiers as possible.\n  I want to show you a picture--of course, we are touched by many \npictures that we see, but I hope the cameras can pick up SGT Rich \nArmstrong of Lynchburg, VA. This man is not from Louisiana but from \nVirginia, right across the river. He is a staff sergeant who is saying \ngoodbye to his wife Beth and his 8-month-old daughter Olivia. I hope \nthis soldier can be brought back home so he can spend the rest of his \nlife with his daughter and wife.\n  This is not about campaigns or politics. This is about trying to lay \ndown the best plan to bring these soldiers home. The more troops you \nhave there and the more police you have there, the less soldiers will \ncome home either wounded or ``not'' at all.\n  This reports goes on to say:\n\n       Neighboring states can exert significant influence, for \n     good or bad. It is nearly impossible to put together a \n     fragmented nation if its neighbors try to tear it apart.\n\n  One of the amendments in the House, I thought, took us a step \nbackward. It took aid away from neighboring states, when we need to \nencourage them to help in this effort.\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       Accountability for past injustices can be a powerful \n     component of democratization. Such accountability can be \n     among the most controversial aspects of any nation-building \n     endeavor, however, and therefore should be attempted only if \n     there is a deep and long-term commitment to the overall \n     operation.\n\n  My contention is that we are going to be there as long as we need to \nbe, but the American people are not going to sacrifice their children \nor grandchildren's education, or the solvency of the Social Security \ntrust fund, unless we find a better way to pay for it. If we do, then \nwe can be there not just for 2 or 3 years, but like this Rand study \nsays:\n\n       None of our cases were successfully completed in less than \n     seven years.\n\n  So one of my questions is, How many times is the administration going \nto come back and ask us to forego college education for our children, \nsupport for public schools, and the establishment of a good health care \nsystem in Louisiana to rebuild Iraq, when we have the resources in Iraq \nto do it; when the people of Iraq, in partnership with the United \nStates--friends and allies in a strong partnership--using our know-how \nand their resources, can rebuild the country? This is not new; this is \nnot Mary Landrieu's idea. We did this during the Marshall plan. We used \nGermany's coal reserves. It was one of the principles of the Marshall \nplan--how to rebuild Europe. Thank goodness we were dealing with a \ncountry--Germany, the aggressor in that situation--that had vast coal \nreserves. It was one of the reasons we could build the Marshall plan. \nThat was very different\n\n[[Page S12571]]\n\nfrom this. The Marshall plan said that for every dollar the donor \nnation put in, the recipient nation would put up one. It structured a \nbipartisan, comprehensive, sustainable program.\n  What this administration is doing, even if this bill passes this \nweek, is not sustainable because the people in your States and in my \nState are not going to dig down, putting the debt on the American \ntaxpayers to pay for this. The one way to do it correctly is to use the \ngreat oil resources. This is not my idea. This is not just something \nbased on the Marshall plan.\n  I will show you what Paul Wolfowitz said. Paraphrasing, he said the \noil revenues of that country could bring between $50 billion and $100 \nbillion over the course of the next 2 or 3 years. He said that we are \ndealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, \nand relatively soon. This is not the Democratic leadership, Mr. \nPresident, and this is not Senator Landrieu saying that; that is Paul \nWolfowitz, on March 27, 2003.\n  Let's see what Vice President Cheney said only a year ago. People \nsay, what is the confusion? Why are we not using the oil resources? It \nis not because it was a bad idea. The administration put forward this \nidea. Yet for some reason they have changed their minds.\n  Paraphrasing this, Tim Russert said every analysis said this war \nwould cost about $80 billion for the recovery of Baghdad, perhaps of \nIraq, about $10 million. Vice President Cheney said he can't say that, \nand that in Iraq we have a nation that has the second largest oil \nreserves in the world, second only to Saudi Arabia. He said it would \ngenerate billions of dollars a year in cashflow if they get back to \ntheir production of roughly 3 million barrels a day in the relatively \nnear future.\n  That was before the war. That is the plan the people were told. We \nwould use the oil. Now we have to use our kids' trust funds for \ncollege. It is not right.\n\n  Let me show the amount of oil that is in Iraq. I know something about \nthis because Louisiana produces a lot of oil. If we export from Iraq 1 \nmillion barrels a day, that is $8 billion a year at $22 a barrel. The \nrange for OPEC is $22 to $29. These are using the most conservative \nfigures. If we would get up to 10 million barrels a day--it is not only \npossible, it is likely--we could be generating in Iraq $80 billion.\n  Why would the American people be picking up the tab when the Iraqis \nhave their own resources, building pride, dignity, independence? Why? I \ndon't understand it. Maybe someone else has their eyes on the profit.\n  I think the Iraqi people should benefit from their reserves. I think \nthe American taxpayers should benefit from these reserves, not a \nhandful of companies, if that is the idea. I am not saying it is, but \nwe are very confused about why the administration said they wanted to \nuse oil and now they don't.\n  I have an article titled ``Iraqi Plans to Increase Oil Output in \n2004.'' This article was in the Wall Street Journal this morning. This \nis quicker than they thought. Trust me, horizontal drilling and new \ntechnologies can produce a lot of wealth.\n  I am going to finish this speech later in the day. The question \nLouisianans have is, Why can't we use the resources and riches of that \nnation to help rebuild it and stabilize democracy in a part of the \nworld that desperately needs it?\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the two \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 20 minutes 53 seconds. The \nminority has 2 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Does the Senator from Louisiana wish to finish with \nthe 2 minutes?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield to the other side, and I reserve the 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes for closing this morning on our side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, what I will do is allow the Senator \nfrom Louisiana to have the 2 minutes or the minority side to have the 2 \nminutes after Senator McConnell, but then I am going to yield, because \nwe have the last 30 minutes, to the Senator from Montana. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana can take the time now or take it after Senator \nMcConnell.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If that is the understanding, I have to ask the Chair--\nI know the time was equally divided--was it also established which side \nwould speak in the last 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order previously agreed to was for the \nminority to consume their time first.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Then I will take those 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator from Louisiana wishes to reserve her \ntime after Senator McConnell, I am going to yield up to 10 minutes to \nSenator McConnell, after which, she can speak; is that acceptable?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is acceptable. The next 10 minutes will be for \nSenator McConnell, and I will then take the 2\\1/2\\ minutes that is \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12571-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12571-S12574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIP TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just returned from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I was accompanied on that trip by Senator Conrad Burns of \nMontana, Senator Larry Craig of Idaho, Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming, \nand Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. I wish to share with the \nSenate some of my observations about the trip.\n  First, I am pleased to report that patriotism among United States \ntroops is alive and well in Iraq and Afghanistan. Soldiers on the \nfrontlines of the global war on terrorism--be they with the 101st \nAirborne Division in Iraq or the 10th Mountain Division in \nAfghanistan--serve America with honor and distinction.\n  This Senator is more grateful than words can express for the \nprofessionalism and dedication of our Armed Forces as America continues \nto bring the war on terrorism to the terrorists. We are fighting this \nwar on our terms--and on their turf.\n  My hat is off to the President--our capable Commander in Chief--for \nhis stalwart leadership throughout this war. There is no better man \nthat could be at the helm during these dangerous times.\n  In Iraq, our service men and women are proud to have liberated an \noppressed nation and are bound and determined to finish the job they \nstarted by turning over Iraq to the Iraqi people as soon as is \npossible. The bill before us will allow them to do just that--so long \nas the requested reconstruction funds are fully provided. It might \ninterest my colleagues to know that the Screaming Eagles view these \nfunds just as important as ammunition in destroying the enemy.\n  In Afghanistan, United States troops continue to pay back al-Qaeda \nand Taliban forces for the September 11 attacks on our shores. Morale \nis high, and our soldiers take great pride in constituting a new Afghan \narmy that are already proving to be more formidable fighters than the \nterrorists they face on fields of battle.\n  Second, despite news reports to the contrary, America is making \nsignificant progress in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In Iraq, U.S. troops and civilians with the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority, CPA, are perplexed by the lack of attention paid to \naccomplishments made on a near daily basis. More than 13,000 \nreconstruction projects have been completed in Iraq, with electricity \ngeneration exceeding prewar levels and a free press already exceeding \nthose in neighboring countries. By one recent count, 170 newspapers are \nbeing published in Iraq. Baghdad residents have access to more local \nprint media than residents of Louisville, KY.\n  Some 60,000 Iraqi security forces have been trained, and those that \npatrol jointly with U.S. troops are often cheered by their compatriots. \nAmerican military and CPA officials are working tirelessly to work \nthemselves out of a job in Iraq as quickly as possible. The shared \nobjective of the interim Iraqi Governing Council, IGC, and the CPA is \nto draft and ratify a constitution and hold national elections, perhaps \nwithin the next year.\n  In Afghanistan, international efforts are ongoing to build security \nforces and a new Afghan army. While Provincial Reconstruction Teams and \nhumanitarian organizations have access to most of the country, Taliban \nremnants, al-Qaeda fighters, and local militias\n\n[[Page S12572]]\n\ncontinue to pose challenges to development activities in the \nsoutheastern part of the country. Afghan President Karzai and his \ncabinet are determined to lead the country out of decades of warfare \nand instability into a new era of prosperity and economic and social \nopportunity. They have America's support and assistance in this \nendeavor.\n  Funding in the supplemental bill is key to improving the lives of \nordinary Iraqi and Afghan citizens and providing for the tools and \ntechnical training so that they guarantee their own security. Our \nreconstruction efforts in both countries can be best described as a \npartnership--one that is mutually beneficial to the security interests \nof Iraq, Afghanistan, and the United States.\n  Third, it is clear from talking to Iraqis and our forces on the \nground that providing reconstruction assistance to Iraq in the form of \na loan would be counterproductive and downright dangerous.\n  I do not doubt for a single moment that those elements that today \nattack coalition forces, the United Nations, and foreign missions in \nBaghdad would spin the extension of loan to Iraq as proof positive that \nthe coalition toppled Saddam Hussein's regime for oil. This could spark \na firestorm against the United States throughout the entire Islamic \nworld--from Indonesia to Saudi Arabia--that even the most effective \npublic relations campaign would fail to extinguish.\n  Further, the interim IGC is in no position to assume debt on behalf \nof the Iraqi people, much less award or manage reconstruction \ncontracts. The CPA rightfully seeks to continue momentum in the \nreconstruction of Iraq, which will directly impact the ability of the \nU.S. military to bring our troops home. By saddling the Iraqi people \nwith a loan--one that no one believes they are capable of repaying--we \nstymie such momentum and set a precedent for other potential donors to \nextend aid in the form of loans.\n  Fourth, we must do more to enlist the cooperation of Islamic nations \nin the global war on terrorism.\n  Jordan has long been an ally in this war, and its recent decision to \ntrain Iraqi police and military officials is yet another indication \nthat the Hashemite Kingdom seeks peace and stability in the region. \nJordan serves as a stellar example of the constructive role an Islamic \nnation can play in defeating the cancer of terrorism.\n  Turkey, too, deserves recognition for its recent approval to deploy \narmed forces to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. While many \nof us wish Turkey had been more supportive prior to the initiation of \nhostilities, this news is welcomed and underscores a regional \nappreciation for the need to defeat terrorism in Iraq. Just last week, \nthe Turkish Prime Minister acknowledged that terrorism has ``no race, \nreligion, or creed'' and that we ``need to take all necessary steps \nagainst terrorism.''\n  While Pakistan has also been a solid ally in the war on terrorism, it \nis only recently that Pakistani military forces have begun to crack \ndown on al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters in remote provinces bordering \nAfghanistan. Pakistan must do all it can--in full cooperation and \nconsultation with Afghanistan--to seek out and destroy domestic and \nforeign terrorists on its soil. Indeed, Pakistan should consider \nfollowing the lead of both Jordan and Turkey and provide support for \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq.\n  Let me close with a final observation that America and its allies \nwill win the war on terrorism, including ongoing battles in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We will do so because of our military superiority and \ndiscipline of well-trained and motivated troops. We will do so because \nour cause is just and because it is in the interests of freedom loving \npeople across the globe. And we will do so because America's greatness \nis rooted in the universal principles of liberty, justice, and human \nrights that two previous world wars have failed to extinguish.\n  President Bush is right that ``[a]s long as the United States of \nAmerica is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror; \nthis will be an age of liberty, here and across the world.'' I say to \nour Commander in Chief that this Senator is determined to provide \nwhatever assistance is requested and needed to win the global war on \nterrorism. I ask my colleagues to join me in this important endeavor.\n  I think they taught journalists in journalism school that good news \nis not news; that only bad news is news. We have sort of gotten \naccustomed to that in the United States. I would argue that in Iraq \ngood news is news because prior to the fall of Saddam Hussein, almost \nnothing good ever happened. So the unusual in Iraq is something good \nhappening. Clearly, 9 out of 10 things in Iraq are going in the right \ndirection, contrary to the impression one would get from reading the \ndaily newspaper or watching television news.\n  Speaking of newspapers, there are 170 newspapers being published in \nIraq. That is certainly more choice than we have in my hometown of \nLouisville, KY, I can tell you that. Some of these papers are probably \neven more credible than the New York Times. So there is opinion being \nexpressed all across Iraq, particularly in print media springing up \neverywhere, as they enjoy this new freedom they were previously denied.\n  In terms of security, the toughest issue, 60,000 Iraqis have been \ntrained by us to begin to provide security, and some of those Iraqi \nsecurity forces have thwarted some of these bombing attempts in the \nlast 2 days. They are learning how to do it, and they are getting \nbetter. That security force is growing on a daily basis. When they \nconduct joint exercises with American troops, the patrols are \nfrequently cheered by people in the countryside. They are happy they \nare there. They are excited by that.\n  Reconstruction: There have been 13,000 reconstruction projects \ncompleted to date, actually finished.\n  Schools: Back during the Saddam Hussein regime, they used schools to \nstore ammunition. Today they are being used to educate young Iraqis. \nThe schools are open. They opened a little over a week ago, and at \nleast 1,500 of those schools--we are not anywhere near finished, but at \nleast 1,500 of those schools have been refurbished by us.\n  We had a chance to visit a school in Baghdad--actually several \nschools. At one of them, I had a chance to talk with the principal. \nThere is no way I can overstate how excited they are to, first of all, \nhave their school fixed up and, second, have an opportunity to begin to \nteach these youngsters once again and to teach them in a more open and \neffective manner, unsupervised by some tyrant and his thugs in Baghdad.\n  Power: We finally have been able to get power production back to \nprewar capacity. That is still not nearly enough, but it is heading in \nthe right direction. The ingenuity of the American commanders on the \nground is really something to behold. General Petraeus, who is the \ndivision commander of the 101st Airborne, which is up north in Mosul, \nwho, interestingly enough, has a Ph.D. from Princeton, has negotiated \nagreements with Turkish and Syrian officials to bring power from those \ncountries into northern Iraq to help them meet their power needs.\n  New currency: I managed to pick up as a souvenir, as I left the \ncountry, an example of the old currency. This may be worth something \nsomeday. It has, of course, Saddam Hussein's face plastered on the \nfront. These are no more. New currency is in the process of being \nissued in Iraq this week, and it begins the process of changing over to \na different kind of currency. By the way, I think it is appropriate to \nnote there will not be a single image of Saddam Hussein on any of these \npieces of currency.\n  Going back to the 101st Airborne for a minute, they, of course, were \nalso in Bosnia. The commander of the 101st said to us--and he was quite \nfrustrated, as many of the soldiers were, about the perception that \nnothing was being accomplished there, that we were not heading in the \nright direction--he was in Bosnia as well, and we made more progress in \nIraq in 6 months than we have made in Bosnia in 6 years. That is \nsignificant progress.\n  When he was talking about progress, he was not talking about the \nmilitary part of it--that ended back in May; at least the intense \ncombat portion ended--but he was talking about their efforts to deal \nwith local people and these myriad of projects in which they are \ninvolved.\n  In northern Iraq, they had the first monitored provincial election in \nthe Ninawa province. We had a chance to\n\n[[Page S12573]]\n\nmeet with the local council that had been elected in that province. \nThere was an election held since Saddam Hussein fell from power.\n  With regard to security, there is no question that security is still \na serious problem in Iraq. Regrettably, we see it on an almost daily \nbasis. But I bet not many Americans know that more Iraqis have been \nkilled during this period than people from outside the country.\n  What does that mean? It means that the Baathists, who are probably \nthe principal organizers of these violent activities, are trying to get \npower back. They are not just after the Americans. They want to get \npower back. They are going to try to kill anybody in the way. Frankly, \nif we left tomorrow, they would be after whatever Iraqis were in charge \nbecause they want to get the power back. They want to control the \ncountry. They want to go back to their abusive tactics that they \nengaged in for 25 years.\n  So they are indiscriminately attacking anybody who is directly \ninvolved in replacing them: the Iraqi Governing Council, the Turks \nafter saying they would send in 10,000 troops--there was an attempt on \ntheir embassy yesterday. There was an attack on the Jordanian Embassy \nand the U.N. earlier. This is not just an attack against Americans but \nagainst anybody who is helping the Iraqis move in the direction of \nhaving a normal, democratic, responsible country.\n  There have been some demonstrations. People have said this is \noutrageous; it must mean they do not like the fact that Saddam Hussein \nis gone. Well, these demonstrations--which by the way could not have \noccurred under Saddam Hussein because he would not have allowed it--are \nrelated to unemployment and delayed pay. Sounds like the sort of thing \nthat would demand a demonstration in this country. Those are some of \nthe conditions obviously that need to be dealt with.\n  So let's put everything in perspective. One would be hard pressed to \nfind an Iraqi who would say they were better off under Saddam than they \nare now.\n  I have heard some reporters suggest that maybe we were sold a bill of \ngoods while we were over there and only heard what people wanted us to \nhear. Let me say to that, it would be impossible to organize all of the \nyoungsters we passed in the streets who were waving at us--not because \nof us but because of the American soldiers we were with--giving a \nthumbs up and smiling. Nobody could have organized all of that. \nClearly, the young people, who are a reflection of their parents' \nviews, are excited that the American troops are there and happy that \nSaddam Hussein is gone.\n  Another noteworthy observation that certainly could not have been \ncreated in order to give us a good impression of what was happening is \nthat commerce is springing up everywhere. Business men and women are \nselling their wares along the sides of the streets. The Iraqis are not \nonly well educated, they are quite entrepreneurial. These are the kinds \nof talents that are going to give them an opportunity to build an Iraq \nof which their citizens can be proud. We have a free Iraq now but we do \nnot have everything we need to have.\n  I conclude by making an observation about the package that we have \nbeen debating. Twenty billion dollars of the $87 billion is for \nreconstruction. At some point I know we are going to have amendments \nrelated to what conditions ought to be placed on that $20 billion, but \nlet me say how important that is.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If we look at the $87 billion, $66 billion of it is \nfor troops. The stationing of troops overseas is very expensive. So I \nsay to our colleagues who are concerned about the costs, the sooner we \ncan get the troops home, the sooner it will cost us dramatically less. \nThat is why the reconstruction project part of it is so important. \nGetting the country structured in such a way that they have adequate \npower, clean water, and are able to move forward with their \ninfrastructure is the key to getting the troops home. So the $20 \nbillion part of this package is critically important.\n  I know we will be having amendments about whether it ought to be \nconditioned. I think the President is correct. I think it ought to be a \ngrant. I think we ought to make it clear that we did not go in there to \nput them in debt beyond where they are already. But we will have that \ndebate in the coming days on the supplemental.\n  I am thankful for the opportunity to share my observations about my \nrecent trip with Members of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 2 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, there is hardly any point that my \ncolleague from Kentucky so ably made this morning that I disagree with, \nor that most people on this side--not all but most--would disagree \nwith. The issue is not whether we can stay and finish the job. \nObviously, we have to do that, for any number of reasons, for our own \nsecurity, for the stability of the region. We are a powerful nation \nthat makes promises and keeps promises. That is not the question.\n  The question is, How should we pay for it? This administration has \nbasically said it is our way or the highway: no loans, no modification \nof the tax cut, and no oil revenues can be used. The President is \ntelling the American people, and the Republican leadership is saying to \nthe American people, basically, that there is only one way to pay for \nthis, and it is to dig deeper into our own basic deficit: borrow \nagainst our children's trust funds, borrow against paying for schools, \nhospitals, or colleges, and pay for it by increasing the deficit to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Some of us are saying there is a better way. We could lend the money \nand establish a way for Iraq to build itself out of its own situation \nwith our help and support, not by indebting Iraq, but by freeing up \ntheir natural resources to pay for a reconstruction that can sustain \nitself.\n  The point I want to make is there is no quick fix for nation \nbuilding. The Rand study, a balanced independent study--they are not \nDemocrat or Republican--says no previous case of nation-building was \nsuccessfully completed in less than 7 years.\n  We will need something that we can sustain. This is a democracy in \nthe United States, not a dictatorship. The people will need to support \nthis effort. They are not going to support going into greater debt. \nThey are not going to support having our children make sacrifices for \nIraq's reconstruction. If someone has to make sacrifices, let the \nadults in this country make the sacrifices, not the children. And our \ngreatest generation has already made enough sacrifices, let's not rob \ntheir social security trust fund.\n  This is a chart depicting Iraq. This is the southwestern portion of \nthe country. We have not even explored for oil there and the experts--\nagain, Louisiana knows something about oil because we have a lot of \nit--say there is more oil in the southwest section than here. Here are \nthe fields. They are not even fully developed. This has not even been \nexplored, yet the President wants us to use the Social Security trust \nfund instead of these reserves. I think that is wrong. I think there is \na better way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas controls the time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes forty-six seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield the entire time to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from Texas. I also \nthank my friend from Louisiana because I think she brings up some very \nvalid points.\n  If one visits Iraq--especially the neighborhoods, which are just like \nsome of the neighborhoods across this country--one will see poverty \nthat is rampant, as well as poor living conditions. These neighborhoods \nare no place that I know that any American, having the choices we have \nin this country, would choose to raise their children. But they will \nget better because of the benevolence of a great country, the United \nStates of America. We opted to make that choice after\n\n[[Page S12574]]\n\nWorld War II in the rebuilding of a destroyed axis, both east and west. \nAs it turned out, it was a very wise investment.\n  We have the same opportunity now in a part of the world where great \nchanges are starting to take place. Because of our presence in Iraq and \nthe actions we are taking there, Saudi Arabia is for the first time in \nits history going to offer elections. Have they done that because of \nwhat we didn't do in Iraq? I think one would have to question that.\n  I congratulate my friend from Kentucky. When he goes on a working \ntrip--we had 8 days in the field. I mean it is getting up early in the \nmorning, catching an airplane, and flying into an area where let's say \nmost of the action was centered, working all day, and then flying back \nand getting a hotel even without dinner. That is all right. I can \nafford to miss a dinner or two. I can afford to miss a few meals. But \nwe were ground level.\n  Central services are being reestablished in Iraq way ahead of \nschedule and are now at the same level or beyond what they were prewar. \nThe plan that has been laid out--and everybody knows it and everybody \nreads it--is working. Fifteen hundred schools have now been refurbished \nand another 1,500 will be finished by the first of the year. We now see \nschools open, with kids and parents very happy. An Iraqi contractor \nused 30,000 Iraqi carpenters, painters, and people who refurbish in \nthat endeavor. Iraqi people are picking up their own neighborhood \nbecause they have the freedom to do so and telling us that if we leave \nnow, they cannot go with the job only partly done.\n  Is there a timeline? There is never a timeline for this kind of an \noperation. That is kind of like me going out and saying I am going to \nbuild a fence until the 10th day of November. Bad weather comes, and a \nlot of things intervene. I don't get the fence done. Come the 15th of \nNovember, am I going to quit building the fence? I don't think so.\n  So timelines on projects such as this are very slow but they are \nmoving forward.\n  Are we talking about a lot of money? You bet we are. It is money that \nsometimes we think we don't have. But sometimes we make investments in \nthings with money which we don't think we have either.\n  There is a powerplant that would be shut down in this country in a \nNew York minute. There are six turbines and only two are operating. It \nwas built in 1928, and not a nickel was ever invested in the O of \nthat plant. There are no computers nor control rooms; it is entirely \nmanually operated. Efficiency of producing electricity and even \nconserving electricity is not there. Central services of water, \ntelephone, and even health care are back beyond what they were prewar.\n  We found out one thing: Saddam Hussein did two things really well. He \nbuilt great palaces. We were in a couple of them. They are pretty good \ndigs. He also built a good road system. But that is where it stopped. \nIrrigation systems around Mosul and along the Euphrates River are \nfalling apart--not because of damage in an armed conflict but because \nof no investment in O Now we are restoring those irrigation systems; \npeople will be able to feed themselves.\n  We are making an investment in people who are educated and motivated \nand who want to have something to say about their own fate when it \ncomes to the economy and to their political freedoms. That is what this \nis about.\n  Is this about establishment of a government that will look like ours? \nNo. It will not look like ours. But at least it will be a \nrepresentative form of government--another one in that region that \nchanges the mindset of the entire Middle East. Elections in Saudi \nArabia are just part of that. This is the cradle of terrorism. This is \nwhere it starts. This is where it is planned, and this is where it is \nfinanced. But with economies of scale, as they grow, terrorism \ndiminishes. We take the fear out of doing business or going to school \nor doing shopping or even in recreation.\n\n  It will be Americans who will do that. Money is just a tool. It can \nbe used for good. It can be used for evil. We have chosen to use it for \ngood.\n  Talk to the parents of those children going to school. I talked to a \nlad of about 10 or 11 years. I asked him if there is any difference \nthis year. He said: Yes; there are a lot of girls in my class. He had \nnever experienced that before. Their eyes are bright; they are eager to \nlearn; and their parents are happy that we are there. That is at the \nneighborhood level. It is not in some headquarter being briefed by the \nState Department or the military people.\n  Talk to the soldiers on the street. Do they understand what the \nmission is? Yes, they do. Are they motivated to carry it out? Yes. They \nunderstand that there is great risk, but there is always great risk \nwith freedom. We have assumed that risk in this country. We assume a \nhigh level of risk for that very precious thing called freedom.\n  We have to rebuild the infrastructure with these appropriations, get \ntheir economy going, and then bring our troops home. They can come home \nfaster than if we say we are just going to leave them alone. What kind \nof a signal does that send to the meeting next week in Madrid where we \nare calling the world's nations together to participate with us in \nrebuilding an infrastructure for a people who actually deserve it and \nwhich was denied by a tyrant for the last 25 or 30 years?\n  This is what America is about. I am proud to be a part of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12574-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12574-S12579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN SECURITY \n                      AND RECONSTRUCTION ACT, 2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the Corzine \namendment No. 1811.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this amendment I have offered, along with Senators \nLautenberg and Durbin, would reduce the retirement age for members of \nthe National Guard and Reserve from 60 to 55. This change would allow \nan estimated 92,000 reservists currently age 55 to 59 to retire with \nfull benefits, honoring their service and respecting the drastic\n\n[[Page S12575]]\n\ndemands we put on them in the post-cold-war era and the age of \nterrorism.\n  As we reflect on the demands placed on our soldiers in Iraq and other \nparts of our world because of terrorism, particularly our reservists--\nroughly 20,000 are in the theater--it is time we actually make this \nimportant change in the benefits that our reservists and guards \nreceive.\n  This chart shows how we were deployed in 1992. We had 1 million total \nman-days per year from reservists and guards. It jumped to 13 million \nin 2001. It was 41 million in 2002. It will be up again in 2003. We are \nusing our reservists dramatically differently than in previous years. \nIt is time to recognize that and make sure they are treated \nappropriately.\n  This request is at the top of the requests of the Reserve Officers \nAssociation, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Air Force Sergeants Association, \nAmerican Legion, a variety of folks. It will make a difference in \nmaking sure our people want to continue their career as reservists and \nguards. It will potentially reduce the cost of declining enlistment and \nretention forces, promote an overall package of incentives to meet \nrecruiting and retention goals. It will make a difference in our \npeople's lives.\n  We need to move forward on this parity between reserve and civilian \nretirement age. I hope my colleagues will join in supporting this \nimportant amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I share the Senator's concerns that \nNational Guard and Reserves troops are not being treated equitably when \nit comes to retirement benefits. This is particularly unfortunate at a \ntime when we are relying more than ever on these brave men and women. \nThe retirement rules need to be changed.\n  While I agree with this amendment in principle, I regret that I \ncannot support it at this time because of its large budgetary impact. \nWith our Federal deficit spiraling out of control, we need to make sure \nthat we offset--i.e., pay for--large spending measures. Unfortunately, \nthis amendment does not contain an offset.\n  We must also make sure that this important amendment, one with such a \nlarge fiscal impact, is thoroughly evaluated. The Congress has \nrecognized the importance of the problem brought to our attention today \nby the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine, and has \nordered that the issue be studied as part of a review of reserve \ncompensation. We should allow for the completion of this study as part \nof our commitment to good stewardship of taxpayers' money.\n  The Senator from New Jersey was right to bring this debate to the \nfloor. The Guard and Reserves have been, and continue to be, heavily \nrelied upon by our country, and we owe it to them to fully address the \ninequity in retirement rules. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the near future to fix this retirement eligibility issue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again, I apologize to the Senator from New Jersey. Our \nposition on this amendment is it is an amendment that should not be \nbrought up in connection with an appropriations bill when changing the \nreserve compensation system in a very drastic way. As a matter of fact, \nCBO scored this provision as follows for mandatory/direct: First year \nspending at $1.486 billion; the 5-year cost, $8.349 billion; and the \n10-year cost, $16.466 billion.\n  Both the House and the Senate have passed a provision that requires a \nstudy of this compensation, in part to determine whether retirement \nsystems should be changed in view of the modern requirements and in \nview of the total force of the United States. The requirement to wait \nuntil age 60 to collect reserve pay has long been in effect and there \nis no basis right now to claim that any reservists who stay for a \ncareer have been misled about the level or timing of the compensation \nthey receive. However, it is a matter of fact that we all want to have \nthis changed. Any changes to the Guard and Reserve retirement benefits \nneed to be assessed for the long term, not just in relationship to the \ncurrent deployment.\n  I am constrained to point out that the pending amendment 1811 offered \nby the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine, increases spending by $2.3 \nbillion in the fiscal year 2004. This additional spending would cause \nthe underlying bill to exceed the Defense subcommittee's section 302(b) \nallocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment \npursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of the act for \npurposes of the pending amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nFitzgerald) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, \nthe yeas are 47, the nays are 49. Three-fifths of the Senators duly \nchosen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is \nrejected. The point of order is sustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I have the attention of the Senate \nfor a moment. There is another scheduled amendment to be voted on right \nnow. I ask Members of this side who have not come forward and offered \ntheir amendments--we have a series of amendments filed by Republican \nMembers: Senators Hutchison, Specter, and Graham. We have notice that \ntwo or three other Senators--Senator Warner and Senator Brownback--have \npotential amendments. We have heard from the other side with amendments \nso far. We agree we should consider amendments offered on this side if \nanyone is ready to offer an amendment.\n  I urge during this vote that Members consult with me and the staff to \nsee what amendments they are willing to raise now. We are still \ncommitted to finishing this bill, and my colleagues are going to have \nto raise them sometime, so I hope they will consider raising them now.\n  Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Chair indicate how long the last \nvote took?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-eight minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to everyone here, we are trying to \nfinish the\n\n[[Page S12576]]\n\nbill this week. Over the last several days, these votes have gone on \nand on. We cannot finish this bill if the votes take more than 20 \nminutes. Everyone should be on notice. We have many amendments. This \nwould have been an opportunity, during the extra 20 minutes on this \namendment, for someone to have offered their amendment and then \ncompleted the vote on the next amendment. We cannot finish the bill if \nwe continue having 38-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada is absolutely \nright. I recall the other day when a number of us were missing. The \nlast person had not voted and I asked his assistant where the person \nwas. They said he was at the airport. An hour and 40 minutes later, I \nsaid: What airport? They said: Philadelphia.\n  The Member who just voted last was on the subway. I thought that was \nthe subway of the Capitol. I apologize to the Senator.\n  I put the Senate on notice that we will observe the 20 minutes. In \nfact, as we get through this bill toward this evening, I hope to have a \nseries of stacked votes, with the first vote being 20 minutes and all \nthereafter being 10 minutes. We have to stop wasting time on the voting \nprocess and get this bill finished by Friday, as we will try to do.\n  I thank the Chair and ask for the regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1834\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 7 minutes \nfor debate in relation to the Reed amendment No. 1834, with 5 minutes \nunder the control of the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, and 2 \nminutes under the control of the chairman prior to a vote on or in \nrelation thereto.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would raise the end strength of the U.S. \nArmy by 10,000 soldiers. It is fully paid for this year through the \nIraqi freedom fund.\n  In the process of rebuilding Iraq, we have to be very careful not to \ndemolish our Army. It is stretched thin across the globe, with 320,000 \nsoldiers in over 120 countries. They are serving us today. They will \nserve us tomorrow. They will do it with great distinction and fidelity \nto their service and to the country, but we have to make sure they have \nadditional men and women to do the job.\n  We are already beginning to see the cracks. In Iraq, there are 1 \nmillion tons of ammunition that are not fully secured. Thousands of air \ndefense shoulder-fired missiles are unaccounted because we simply do \nnot have the troops to cover all the places.\n  If we want more forces in Iraq, then we have to have more forces in \nour end strength. Even if you do not want more forces in Iraq, we have \nto have an end strength that will support our deployment policy, and we \ndo not right now.\n  This stress will show up in training opportunities missed, in \nretention and recruitment objectives missed, and a lack of flexibility \nto respond. It will be particularly important to our National Guard and \nReserves because if we do not increase the Active Forces, the burden \nwill fall more and more on Reserve Forces, and that burden over time is \nunsustainable.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure to help the \nsoldiers. If we do not pass this measure, the next time you see your \nGuard men and women and reservists, you can tell them their bag better \nbe packed because they will be going again and again.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Biden and Senator Nelson of \nFlorida as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I advise my colleagues to support Senator \nReed's amendment. I rise to support the Reed amendment because, in \nfact, everything he has said about why it is important to enhance and \nenlarge our force structure is exactly right. Force structures are not \ndeveloped over a year, 2, 3, or 4. Force structures are developed over \na long period of time.\n  When we are looking at 125,000 activated National Guard and Army \nReserve units now, and probably more to be activated, we cannot sustain \nthat kind of activity for the long term. That means we are going to \nhave to face up to reality--what the Senator from Rhode Island is \ntalking about--and that is enlarge that force structure.\n  Currently in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Balkans, almost in the entire \nmilitary police force, our civil affairs force is made up of National \nGuard and Army Reserves. We cannot sustain that situation. We need more \nlight infantry; we need more special forces; and we cannot do this on \nthe cheap. As the President of the United States has said, this is a \nlong-term commitment, not just in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the \nchallenges that face us in the 21st century are new challenges, \ndifferent kinds of challenges that will require different force \nstructures. That means we cannot use just laser-guided munitions. \nSomeone has to govern--nation building--exactly what we are doing in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  I know this is imperfect. This maybe is not the exact way to do this, \nbut it is something this body, this Congress, this Nation needs to face \nup to, and they need to face up to it now.\n  I hope my colleagues take a serious look at this amendment. As my \ncolleague from Rhode Island said, this does not come out of the \nPresident's $87 billion package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, current law allows the services to exceed \nend strength by 3 percent. Currently, there are about 9,000 soldiers \nwho already exceed the end strength. They have another 5,000 that they \ncan increase. This will take money from the amount they need. I \nstrongly understand the Senator's request, as well as Senator Hagel, \nbut I would like to yield 45 seconds to Senator McCain and 25 seconds \nto Senator Sessions and then be recognized to make a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I share the view of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and the Senator from Nebraska that we need more troops in the \nmilitary. We have authorized that in the Defense authorization bill. I \nagree that there are specific needs in Iraq and our Guard and Reserves \nare overstressed. I believe this is not the appropriate vehicle. I \nbelieve it is an earmark of the $87 billion, and at this juncture it \nwould take away from the flexibility that is necessary for the spending \nof this money. I hope we could address this issue in the fashion which \nit deserves both in Defense authorization and Defense appropriations \nbills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have given a lot of thought to this, \nand I believe that we should not pass the Reed amendment at this time. \nI have spoken with General Schoomaker, Chief of Staff of the Army on \nthis subject. He says: Give me time to study what we need, to study \ntransformation, to review our MOS structure, and then I will make a \nrecommendation. General Abizaid also clearly says that we do not need \nmore troops in Iraq. We are beginning to reduce our troop presence in \nIraq. We are presently at 138,000 down from 250,000.\n  CBO has said increasing our end-strength is not an answer to current \nstress. It will take 2 years to get the troops proposed in this \namendment trained and fielded. I urge us not to go forward with this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Army has 501,000 soldiers serving on \nactive duty. Not only is this above the authorized end strength of \n480,000, it is also above the 3 percent variance rate. The Army \ndesperately needs troops, and we can provide them these troops today. \nThis is funded through the Iraqi freedom fund, a $1.9 billion \nunrestricted account that the Secretary of Defense has. In fact, as I \nunderstand it, the Secretary of Defense could turn around tomorrow and \nuse this money for these troops. We can do it today. We should do it \ntoday. We cannot stand these stresses much longer. We can give General \nSchoomaker more time, but the troops that are today in Afghanistan, in \nIraq, and around the globe need to know that we are going\n\n[[Page S12577]]\n\nto send them the reinforcements they need through the active services.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it will take 3 to 5 years to train those \nadditional soldiers. I do not know from where the Senator is getting \nhis information. I get mine in writing from the Department of Defense, \nand I stated the figures as we understand them. We do not need any more \ntroops. General Abizaid testified he has troops he does not need, and \nhe is going to start bringing some home.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor of the amendment still has 25 \nseconds. Does the sponsor of the amendment yield time?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield back his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The time \nis yielded back.\n  The yeas and nays have been requested. Is there a sufficient second? \nThere appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n1834.

(a) Restoration of Full Retired Pay Benefits.--\n     Section 1414 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 1414. Members eligible for retired pay who have \n       service-connected disabilities: payment of retired pay and \n       veterans' disability compensation\n\n       ``(a) Payment of Both Retired Pay and Compensation.--Except \n     as provided in subsection (b), a member or former member of \n     the uniformed services who is entitled to retired pay (other \n     than as specified in subsection (c)) and who is also entitled \n     to veterans' disability compensation is entitled to be paid \n     both without regard to sections 5304 and 5305 of title 38.\n       ``(b) Special Rule for Chapter 61 Career Retirees.--The \n     retired pay of a member retired under chapter 61 of this \n     title with 20 years or more of service otherwise creditable \n     under section 1405 of this title at the time of the member's \n     retirement is subject to reduction under sections 5304 and \n     5305 of title 38, but only to the extent that the amount of \n     the member's retired pay under chapter 61 of this title \n     exceeds the amount of retired pay to which the member would \n     have been entitled under any other provision of law based \n     upon the member's service in the uniformed services if the \n     member had not been retired under chapter 61 of this title.\n       ``(c) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply to a member \n     retired under chapter 61 of this title with less than 20 \n     years of service otherwise creditable under section 1405 of \n     this title at the time of the member's retirement.\n       ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) The term `retired pay' includes retainer pay, \n     emergency officers' retirement pay, and naval pension.\n       ``(2) The term `veterans' disability compensation' has the \n     meaning given the term `compensation' in section 101(13) of \n     title 38.''.\n       (b) Repeal of Special Compensation Programs.--Sections 1413 \n     and 1413a of such title are repealed.\n       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of such chapter is amended by striking the items \n     relating to sections 1413, 1413a, and 1414 and inserting the \n     following:\n\n``1414.

Madam President, if the Senator will allow me to state what \nI think is in the process of happening, the Senator from Nevada is \ngoing to take about 5 minutes, and the Senator from West Virginia would \ntake the remainder of the time until 12:30. He is going to offer an \namendment. Senator Byrd is going to offer an amendment, if that is \nappropriate with the manager.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the amendment be called up at that time?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Senator Ensign would like to be recognized to speak \nfor 5 minutes on his amendment, and Senator Byrd has an amendment. We \nunderstood, based on previous conversations, that the majority was \ngoing to offer amendments. We were of the impression there was no one \nhere to offer one before 12:30, other than the Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nEnsign.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the Senator is correct, although we are \nworking on that. As I understand it, does the Senator from Nevada \nexpect to go to a vote right away?\n  Mr. REID. Whenever the Senator wants to go to a vote. I know \nleadership wants a vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have two other Senators who are ready on this side.\n\n[[Page S12578]]\n\nSenator Warner and Senator Graham of South Carolina are ready to offer \namendments on this side.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Byrd was only doing this out of his normal \ncourtesy. He had other things to do. He was willing to come here and do \nthis at this time because we thought there was no one to offer an \namendment on that side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator's amendment already offered?\n  Mr. REID. No. So if you have people here ready to go, I ask Senator \nByrd, would that be OK that they go?\n  Mr. BYRD. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I could take a minute, Madam President.\n  I know this last vote was a close vote. There was some trouble in \ndetermining the final outcome of the vote. But I do say this, speaking \nfor me and for the Democratic leader, we are doing our best to \ncooperate, but things are not going very quickly here, and I am not \nconfident, at this stage, we can complete this bill. We want to. We \nhave every intention of doing so. But, as I indicated a few minutes \nago, when a vote takes 38 minutes and this one takes--how long has this \nvote taken, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-eight minutes.\n  Mr. REID. How long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-eight minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I think that speaks for itself. I hope we can move along \nmore quickly. It is not anything that we are doing that is slowing this \ndown. We have a number of Senators over here who wish to offer \namendments. I know the majority has some. So I think tonight and \ntomorrow night could be very late nights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I confess I was in another meeting when \nI got the word that the vote was not as I expected it. As manager of \nthe bill, I am obligated to take the time to try to achieve the goal \nthat has been set by the administration and by the majority. So I do \napologize. But that was an extra amount of time needed to determine \nwhat tactic I should use to try to achieve the goal I think the Senator \nfrom Nevada would use if he were in my shoes. So we respect one \nanother.\n  He is right; we went over and we said, just minutes ago, we would \nnot. But a contingency developed that I do not think I need to \napologize for. I just need to explain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1839\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1839.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the amount available for reconstruction in Iraq by \n     the amount that is used to repay bilateral debts owed by Iraq)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. 2313. (a) Not later than April 30, 2004, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit a certification to Congress of the \n     amount that Iraq will pay, or that will be paid on behalf of \n     Iraq, during fiscal year 2004 to a foreign country to service \n     a debt incurred by Iraq during the regime of Saddam Hussein, \n     including any amount used for the payment of principal, \n     interest, or fees associated with such debt. Such \n     certification shall include--\n       (1) the actual amount spent for such purpose during the \n     period from October 1, 2003 through March 31, 2004; and\n       (2) the estimated amount that the Secretary reasonably \n     believes will be used for such purpose during the period from \n     April 1, 2004 through September 30, 2004.\n       (b) On May 1, 2004, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall administratively reserve, out of \n     the unobligated balance of the funds appropriated in this \n     title under the subheading ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction \n     Fund'' under the heading ``OTHER BILATERAL ECONOMIC \n     ASSISTANCE FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT'', the amount \n     that is equal to the sum of the amount certified under \n     paragraph (1) of subsection (a) and the estimated amount \n     certified under paragraph (2) of such subsection. The amount \n     so reserved may not be obligated or expended on or after such \n     date.\n       (c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n     shall impose such restrictions and conditions as the Director \n     determines necessary to ensure that, in the apportionment of \n     amounts appropriated as described in subsection (b), the \n     balance of the total amount so appropriated that remains \n     unobligated on May 1, 2004, exceeds the amount that is to be \n     reserved under subsection (b).\n       (d) It is the sense of Congress that each country that is \n     owed a debt by Iraq that was incurred during the regime of \n     Saddam Hussein should forgive such debt, including any amount \n     owed by Iraq for the principal, interest, and fees associated \n     with such debt.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we don't intend to stay in Iraq forever. \nAnd we don't intend to rebuild Iraq--that is a task for the Iraqi \npeople.\n  Our exit strategy--the way to get our troops home--is to make sure \nthat Iraq's economy can produce sufficient revenue to pay for its own \nreconstruction--so Iraq is not dependent on International assistance.\n  Our exit strategy is to help train Iraqi police, border patrol, and \nits armed forces and civil defense forces so Iraq is not dependent on \nforeign troops for its own security.\n  The President's request is designed to help Iraqis get on a path to \nself-reliance, so U.S. forces can come home, and so the U.S. taxpayer \ndoes not have to foot the bill for Iraq's reconstruction.\n  Unfortunately, it is going to be difficult to kick-start Iraq's \neconomy--even with a generous U.S. aid package--because Iraq is saddled \nwith an enormous amount of debt from Saddam Hussein's regime.\n  For example, according to the White House, the bi-lateral debt owed \nby Iraq includes:\n  $8.9 billion to Japan;\n  $6.9 billion to Russia;\n  $6 billion to France;\n  $4.8 billion to Germany;\n  $30-50 billion to Gulf countries;\n  $8.2 billion to Kuwait;\n  $18 billion to Non-Paris club countries like China, Korea, and \nTurkey.\n  Mr. President, I realize that none of the funds appropriated by this \nbill may be used to service a debt that is owed by Saddam Hussein's \nregime. So I am not worried that any of the $20 billion the President \nhas requested for Iraq will directly end up in the pockets of the \nFrench.\n  But money is fungible. If we pass this bill, as it stands right now, \na future Iraqi government could use new oil revenues to pay back France \nbillions of dollars while accepting billions in U.S. foreign aid. After \nall, Iraq has already sold about $1.6 billion in oil exports since they \nresumed this summer.\n  Americans are a generous people. We are willing to make sacrifices.\n  But we are not going to spend our hard-earned tax dollars to bail out \nFrance--money France lent to Saddam Hussein.\n  My amendment is simple. It reduces the amount available for \nreconstruction in Iraq by the amount that is used to repay bilateral \ndebts owed by Iraq. So for every dollar that goes to a country like \nFrance, a dollar is subtracted from the U.S. foreign aid package.\n  This is a commonsense way to make sure that U.S. funds are spent \nwhere they are needed--in Baghdad--instead of Paris, Moscow, or Berlin.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I have examined the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Nevada and it has two basic requirements. One is a \ncertification of the amount Iraq will pay or that will be paid on \nbehalf of Iraq, during fiscal year 2004 to a foreign country to service \na debt incurred by Iraq, including any amount used for the payment of \nprincipal, interest, et cetera. This deals with the amounts that were \ndebts of the former regime of Iraq. It states:\n\n       On May 1, 2004, the Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget shall administratively reserve, out of the \n     unobligated balance of the funds in this title under the \n     subheading Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund\n\n[[Page S12579]]\n\n     . . . the amount that is equal to the sum of the amount \n     certified under paragraph (1). . . .\n\n  Namely, it is the amount that has been used from any source to \nservice the debt that Iraq owed under the Saddam Hussein regime.\n  Madam President, we take the position there will be no such payment. \nIn any event, we don't see any harm in finding out if there is such a \npayment and dealing with that subject accordingly. Therefore, I am \nprepared to state to the Senator from Nevada we have no objection to \nthe amendment of the Senator under the circumstances right now, and I \nwill rely upon the statement of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia to determine whether there is objection from his side of the \naisle. It is not an amendment I really seek to have enacted. In all \nprobability, it may be substantially changed in conference if it does \nsurvive. But it is not something that offends the process we are \ninvolved in now. We don't know of any payments that would be made by \nany country on behalf of the former regime of Saddam Hussein to deal \nwith the debt that existed under that regime.\n  Therefore, I will not oppose the amendment. I seek the advice of the \nSenator from West Virginia as to what they intend to do concerning this \namendment. Does the Senator wish some additional time to consider this \nmatter? Would he like to take the recess now and come back and deal \nwith this after our weekly luncheon?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, it is my information that this side has \nnot yet adequately followed this amendment and has not seen it until \nrecently to the extent that we are prepared to accept it. It appears to \nbe a good amendment, but we may or may not want to accept it. Will the \nSenator allow us a little time for further study?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I think the \nSenator will remember, as we wound up the session just prior to the \nrecess, there were a series of amendments that were under \nconsideration. Senator Ensign's was one of those. I think Members of \nour side checked with staff on the Senator's side, but we are probably \nnot dealing with the right people. We had to pull the Ensign amendment \nat the last minute because we didn't have the clearance we thought we \nhad.\n  I suggest we just stand in recess now and address this matter when we \ncome back after the scheduled recess.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12579-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Madam President, there is at this moment in \norbit the first Chinese astronaut. Their successful launch of a piloted \nspacecraft marks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of human \nexploration of space. Just the third nation to accomplish such a feat, \nI am happy on behalf of the Senate to welcome China into an elite group \nof nations that can independently send humans to explore the heavens.\n  The United States and Russia established manned space programs \ndecades ago and are pleased to have a new ally--we hope a new ally--in \nthe quest to explore space.\n  China's program will provide additional resources, I hope fresh \nideas, and renewed enthusiasm for space exploration. My hope is that \nChina will become a partner in our ongoing international efforts, such \nas the International Space Station, to make technological advances and \nto help solve mysteries of outer space.\n  As China undertook its first such mission, my thoughts were with the \nfirst taikonaut who is the sole space flyer on Shenzhou 5. Americans \nknow all too well the potential risk of space flight, and we commend \nthis astronaut's courage.\n  Americans also know that the benefits of space exploration outweigh \nthe risks. We expect that the Chinese will reap rewards that space \nmissions offer--to learn and to explore, to advance technology, and to \nuplift the human spirit.\n  Now that China has opened a new chapter in human space flight \nhistory, it is fitting that America refocus our own goals on \nexploration. Now is the time to renew our commitment to space \nexploration with a vision that will capture the imagination and the \nsupport of the people on planet Earth.\n  Congratulations to the Chinese. We look forward to a successful \nreturn, as he reenters, starting about 5 o'clock, as that reentry falls \nthrough space for about 30 minutes, and then as he starts encountering \nthe upper atmosphere about 30 minutes from landing, which is a very \nperilous part of the journey, as we have very painfully learned as \nAmerican citizens in the experience we had last February.\n  I am very confident our future missions at NASA will be quite \nsuccessful. I again commend Admiral Gehman and his commission for the \nexcellent report of the Gehman Commission. I commend NASA and I \nencourage NASA to adopt all of the recommendations of the Gehman \nCommission. We again welcome the Chinese into this select fraternity of \nspace-faring nations from planet Earth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

My understanding was it was time for us to start moving \nsome of the amendments on our side.\n  Mr. REID. We understand.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Graham of South Carolina, Senator Warner, and \nSenator Domenici are coming. So I hope to proceed then. I have no \nobjection to the Senator from New Mexico\n\n[[Page S12580]]\n\nproposing his amendment and making a statement. We will set that aside \nwhen the other Senators appear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1842\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I do send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1842.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require reports on the utilization of the National Guard \n                             and Reserves)\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following:\n       Sec. 316. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The National Guard and Reserves have served the Nation \n     in times of national crises for more than 200 years. The \n     National Guard and Reserves are a critical component of \n     homeland security and national defense.\n       (2) The current deployments of many members of the National \n     Guard and Reserve have made them absent from their \n     communities for an abnormally long time. This has diminished \n     the ability of the National Guard to conduct its State \n     missions.\n       (3) Many members of the National Guard and Reserves have \n     been on active duty for more than a year, and many more have \n     had their tours of active duty involuntarily extended while \n     overseas.\n       (b) Report on Utilization of National Guard and Reserves.--\n     (1) Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives a report on the utilization of the National \n     Guard and Reserves in support of contingency operations \n     during fiscal year 2004.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) Information on each National Guard and Reserve unit \n     currently deployed, including--\n       (i) the unit name or designation;\n       (ii) the number of personnel deployed;\n       (iii) the projected return date to home station; and\n       (iv) the schedule, if any, for the replacement of the unit \n     with a Regular unit.\n       (B) Information on current operations tempo, including--\n       (i) the length of deployment of each National Guard and \n     Reserve unit currently deployed, organized by unit and by \n     State;\n       (ii) in the case of each National Guard and Reserve unit on \n     active duty during the two-year period ending on the date of \n     the report, the aggregate amount of time on active duty \n     during such two-year period; and\n       (iii) the percentage of National Guard and Reserve forces \n     in the total deployed force in each current domestic and \n     overseas contingency operation.\n       (C) Information on current recruitment and retention of \n     National Guard and Reserve personnel, including--\n       (i) any shortfalls in recruitment and retention;\n       (ii) any plans to address such shortfalls or otherwise to \n     improve recruitment or retention; and\n       (iii) the effects on recruitment and retention over the \n     long term of extended periods of activation of National Guard \n     or Reserve personnel.\n       (3) The report under this subsection shall be organized in \n     a format that permits a ready assessment of the deployment of \n     the National Guard and Reserves by State, by various \n     geographic regions of the United States, and by Armed Force.\n       (c) Report on Effects of Utilization of National Guard and \n     Reserves on Law Enforcement and Homeland Security.--(1) Not \n     later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in \n     consultation with the chief executive officers of the States, \n     submit to Congress a report on the effects of the deployment \n     of the National Guard and Reserves on law enforcement and \n     homeland security in the United States.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) The number of civilian first responders on active duty \n     with the National Guard or Reserves who are currently \n     deployed overseas.\n       (B) The number of first responder personnel of the National \n     Guard or Reserves who are currently deployed overseas.\n       (C) An assessment by State of the ability of the States to \n     respond to emergencies without currently deployed National \n     Guard personnel.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this amendment relates to the \nutilization of the National Guard and Reserve as part of our military \nactivities and presence around the world. I think we have all been \nstruck by the fact that in the current conflicts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and in many other instances, we are seeing a greater \nutilization of reservists and National Guard personnel by the Pentagon. \nI am not being critical of that, but I do think this is a new reality \nwe need to adjust to and understand better.\n  Since the founding of our Nation we have relied upon the services of \ncitizen soldiers. The National Guard and Reserves have a proud \ntradition of setting aside their civilian lives to serve our country in \ntimes of conflict. Recently, the need for this service has \nsignificantly increased. Today, the National Guard and Reserves' \ncommitments overseas are critical to the resolution of several \nconflicts around the world. The almost 400 soldiers deployed to keep \nthe peace between Israel and Egypt along the Sinai peninsula are \nmembers of the Oregon National Guard's 1-186th Infantry Battalion. The \nonly Fighter Squadron operating from Iraq is an A-10 unit from \nMissouri's 442 Fighter Wing stationed at Tallil Airbase in Southern \nIraq. This Reserve unit is the only A-10 Warthawg unit in the Air Force \nwith Precision Guided Munitions delivery capability. Much of the air \ndefense of Washington, D.C., is the responsibility of the D.C. Air \nNational Guard's 113th Fighter Wing and air defense forces of the New \nMexico National Guard.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to require the Departments of \nDefense and Homeland Security to provide a report to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and House Armed Service Committee that contains the \nfollowing:\n  No. 1, an assessment of the levels utilization of the Guard and \nReserves component in the manning of contingency operations, \ndomestically and overseas.\n  No. 2, Recruitment and retention plans for the National Guard and \nReserves in light of increased commitments.\n  No. 3, and finally, a report from the Department of Homeland Security \non the effects of National Guard and Reserves deployments on Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Last week I had the opportunity and honor to meet with families of \nthe 717th Medical Company of the New Mexico National Guard. I cannot \ntell you how moved I was by the patriotism and commitment of these \nfamilies and guardsmen. Despite the increased operations tempo members \nof the New Mexico National Guard remain as dedicated as ever to saving \nlives in New Mexico and overseas.\n  For example, last year, CPT Paul Saiz deployed to Kosovo in support \nof KFOR for 6 months flew dozens of aeromedical airlift missions \nthroughout Kosovo in support of U.S. military and the civilian \npopulace. Upon returning from his deployment he participated in several \ncivil search and rescues in the New Mexico mountains, and when \nAlbuquerque, NM was ravaged by wildfires, Captain Saiz and others flew \nfirefighting missions, dumping water with pinpoint accuracy. I have \nbeen told that many firemen were convinced that had it not been for \nCaptain Saiz's efforts, firefighters would have perished. Currently, \nCaptain Saiz and 35 others are deployed to Afghanistan providing \nAeromedical Airlift for the entire country. The 717th Medical Company's \nCommander, MAJ James Fishbourne writes:\n\n       The soldiers of the 717th Medical Company (AA) are doing \n     extremely well. We are very busy and have completed 43 combat \n     medevac missions to date. I am so proud of our soldiers and \n     how they are performing in this environment. We are non-stop \n     here with urgent and priority medevac missions. Last week one \n     of our crews was called to rescue an infantryman from a 180-\n     ft canyon near the Pakistan border. Our crews were able to \n     hoist the soldier to safety and bring him back to the level 1 \n     hospital.\n       We have also been called to evacuate many mine blast \n     victims throughout Afghanistan. It is very sad to say, but \n     most of the mine victims are children. One patient we evaced \n     to Bagram was a 12-year-old girl with both legs amputated. \n     The night she was in surgery, the hospital was running low on \n     O- blood and one of our pilots (CW4 Atkinson) donated several \n     pints to save her life. Just last night I transported two \n     children involved in a rollover. What a sight it was seeing \n     two small Afghan children lying on a stretcher together being \n     cared for by SSG Esqueivel and CW2 Medina. These children are \n     very sick or hurt when we are called to rescue them.\n       I can't tell you about all the missions our fine soldiers \n     have accomplished but I will say that there is no medevac \n     mission that we\n\n[[Page S12581]]\n\n     have had to turn down and no better soldiers than those of \n     the 717th. Our soldiers were involved with the bomb that went \n     off near Bagram, we did assist the hospital with recovery of \n     the local nationals and assisted the doctors and medical \n     personnel here at the hospital. Please do all you can to tell \n     the people back home that the soldiers of the 717th Medical \n     Company are doing great things for the soldiers, airmen, and \n     marines here in Afghanistan. They are making great sacrifices \n     being away from their families and jobs back in New Mexico.\n\n  Guardsmen and reservists all over the country are making great \nsacrifices. We need to examine the long-term impact that prolonged \nactivation has on recruitment and retention of the National Guard \nReserves. We must ensure that the administration has a plan to not only \nretain qualified guardsmen and reservists, but to also attract new \nmembers. I find it very hard to believe that the increased operations \ntempo the Guard and Reserves are experiencing will have no effect on \nrecruitment and retention. I fear that if we ask too much of these men \nand women, many will decide to leave military service. Therefore, we \nmust ensure that the Department of Defense has prepared an effective \nstrategy to maintain the National Guard and Reserves. it is quite \npossible that the Department of defense has such a plan, but I am not \naware of it.\n  We must also closely look at the impact that long deployments have on \nsecurity at home. Many of the young men and women serving overseas as \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserves work as first responders at \nhome. How has the absence of Guardsmen and reservists who are civilian \npolicemen, emergency medical technicians and other first responders, \nhampered the ability of states to respond in times of natural disaster \nor homeland security emergencies? How will the absence of Guard and \nReserves personnel who may ordinarily serve in these capacities as part \nof their service when they are not otherwise deployed affect these \noperations? These are questions that must be answered.\n  There is no doubt that the utilization of National Guard and \nReserves, at least at current rates, will continue well into the \nfuture. The information these reports will provide will be critical as \nwe move ahead with decisions about manning, procurement, and security.\n  I understand that portions of this report may have some sensitivity. \nIf there is a requirement for portions or all of this report to be in \nclassified format, then it should be submitted at the appropriate level \nof classification.\n  Let there be no doubt that the men and women of the National Guard \nand Reserves are doing their part to protect us at home and overseas. \nWe must ensure that analysis has been conducted, and plans are in place \nto preserve the integrity, readiness and force levels necessary for \nthis period of long-term activation.\n  At the appropriate time I hope we can adopt this amendment--by voice \nvote, if possible. I do not know a reason why it should be objected to \nby any Member of the Senate, but obviously I await the opportunity for \nall Members to review the amendment before I call for a vote.\n  Madam President, with that, I see nobody else seeking the floor so I \nyield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the Bingaman \namendment in order that the Senator from South Carolina can offer his \namendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1805\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that my amendment No. 1905 be called.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1805.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that arbitrary deadlines \n  should not be set for the dissolution of the Coalition Provisional \n   Authority or the transfer of its authority to an Iraqi governing \n                               authority)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 2313. (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) in a speech delivered to the United Nations on \n     September 23, 2003, President George W. Bush appealed to the \n     international community to take action to make the world a \n     safer and better place;\n       (2) in that speech, President Bush emphasized the \n     responsibility of the international community to help the \n     people of Iraq rebuild their country into a free and \n     democratic state;\n       (3) French President Jacques Chirac has proposed a plan for \n     Iraqi self-rule within a period of months;\n       (4) for a plan for Iraq's future to be appropriate, the \n     provisions of that plan must be consistent with the best \n     interests of the Iraqi people;\n       (5) the plan proposed by President Chirac would impose \n     premature self-government in Iraq that could threaten peace \n     and stability in that country; and\n       (6) premature self-government could make the Iraqi state \n     inherently weak and could serve as an invitation for \n     terrorists to sabotage the accomplishments of the United \n     States and United States allies in the region.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) arbitrary deadlines should not be set for the \n     dissolution of the Coalition Provisional Authority or the \n     transfer of its authority to an Iraqi governing authority; \n     and\n       (2) no such dissolution or transfer of authority should \n     occur until the ratification of an Iraqi constitution and the \n     establishment of an elected government in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Madam President, this is a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment. I think it is very important, as we deal with the \nIraqi situation, for us to address as many issues as we can about the \nnature of how this is going to unfold. The President has asked for $87 \nbillion. I am glad to support the funding. Most of it, two-thirds of \nit, I guess, goes to the men and women in uniform to make sure they \nhave the assets necessary to protect themselves and do their job.\n  This resolution speaks to the idea of when the mission is complete, \nand this resolution addresses the French position. The French have \nproposed as recently as September 16 that within a month--a matter of 1 \nmonth and no later than 2--all authority be turned over to the Iraqi \npeople and that the umbrella we have today cease to exist.\n  Not only is this irresponsible but the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority ruling the country is a necessary entity until we can get a \nconstitution written, voted on, and a government elected. But if we did \nwhat the French are suggesting, we would take a country that has been \nbrutalized and raped--literally and figuratively--with Saddam Hussein \nstill on the loose, and basically say, Here.\n  I think that would not only be a disservice to the Iraqi people but \nit would undermine the reason we went to war to begin with; that is, to \ntake tyranny and turn it into stability.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate resolution says in no uncertain terms that \nit would be irresponsible to follow the French proposition--to turn \nback over to the Iraqi people the country while it is still in \ntransition. In going from tyranny to stability, there will be a certain \namount of chaos.\n  We are training the Iraqi police. We are training the army. They are \nhaving elections at the local level. There are a lot of good things \ngoing on. Schools are now open. Schools used to house weapons. Now they \nare housing kids. No young girl has to worry about being taken out of \nschool and taken to one of Saddam's sons because she strikes his eye.\n  Iraq is a better place. But the French position of just leaving and \nturning it over within 30 days would undo the recent accomplishments. \nIt is irresponsible.\n  I think it would be in order for the Senate to speak on this matter. \nThe United Nations rejected an amendment that set a hard and fast \ndeadline in terms of when control will be given to the Iraqi people. \nThis makes good sense. Let us give them a chance to write a \nconstitution, give them a chance to ratify a constitution, give\n\n[[Page S12582]]\n\nthem a chance to have a national election, get some infrastructure in \nplace, and allow the rule of law to be in place. Then, at the \nappropriate time, we will be glad when it comes time to leave Iraq. \nMost Americans who have family members in the military can't wait for \nthat day to come. We can't wait to be able to bring our troops back \nhome.\n  Having said that, most Americans understand that if you leave before \nthe job is done, the problems will come back to haunt you. After \nSeptember 11, the easy way out is no longer the right way--to shoot a \nmissile or two and say, Boy, did we deal with that group which led to \n9/11.\n  There are people who are infiltrating Iraq who are trying to \ndestabilize the efforts of the Iraqi people to become a free democracy. \nThere are people in the region who hate the idea that Iraq may be a \nfree country with a democratic system. We need to stand shoulder to \nshoulder with the Iraqi people and fight those forces, not only for the \ngood of the Iraqi people but for our own security.\n  This resolution I think is very appropriately timed. The United \nNations has rejected the hard and fast deadline. This resolution \nbasically says we are going to stay until the country is stable, we are \ngoing to stay until the job is done.\n  Having said that--by making that statement--it means more Americans \nare going to die. The forces in Iraq are small in terms of the \npopulation as a whole, but they are committed to creating chaos.\n  It breaks my heart--and every Member of this body and all Americans--\nto have a soldier, sailor, airman, or marine lost in this conflict. But \njust as surely as I speak, losses will come and more money will be \nspent. The day has not yet arrived when we can, in good faith and good \nconscience, turn all matters over to the Iraqi people. They need help. \nThey need money. They need assistance. They need our support. But we \nneed to do it for ourselves. If we cut and run, and if we take the \nFrench position to get out of there before the infrastructure is in \nplace, we will take one form of tyranny and replace it with another. It \nis an irresponsible position.\n  I hope this body in a unanimous fashion will agree with the \nproposition that we should not leave Iraq until the job is done--until \na constitution is written and ratified, until a government has been \nelected and the people have a chance to have a secure environment for \ntheir new nation that is emerging out of the ashes of Saddam Hussein's \nregime.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution saying we will not \nleave until the job is done. Leaving in the next month is \nirresponsible. Reject the French position because the French position \nis irresponsible and undermines our national security.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I have notified members of the minority \nthat we are prepared to accept the Bingaman amendment and also the \namendment of Senator Graham. While we await their response, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be set aside temporarily so the Senator from \nArkansas can offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1829\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve tax \n         equity for military personnel, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, yesterday I submitted an amendment to \nthe supplemental spending bill which I do hope the Senate will consider \nfavorably. I know it is going to be difficult because of the issue I am \nbringing up. The amendment primarily consists of the Military Tax \nFairness Act and the acceleration of the refundable child credit. Both \nof these bills have passed the Senate overwhelmingly.\n  We have been talking and talking and talking about them over the past \nmany months, and I know there will be thousands of excuses we will be \nhearing telling us why we should not include this tax relief bill on \nthe supplemental spending bill.\n  I know this is a tax bill on an appropriations bill. I know we have a \nchild credit in two different conferences. I know the Military Tax \nFairness Act has been going back and forth between the two Chambers. I \nknow all of these excuses I am going to hear. I know there will be \ntremendous numbers of those who will come forward and opportunities to \ntry to stop what I am trying to do.\n  But, Madam President, I am truly exhausted. I am truly exhausted with \nall of the excuses we have had. And I know the hard-working American \nfamilies are just as exhausted as I am with the inability of us to be \nable to move forward these two very simple acts within the Congress \nthat would be such a tremendous help to the working families of \nAmerica.\n  The death gratuity paid to the survivors of a military member has \nhistorically been exempt from taxation. In 1986, the amount of the \ndeath gratuity benefit was $3,000. In 1991, the payment was raised from \n$3,000 to $6,000 in connection with the Persian Gulf conflict. But the \nTax Code was not adjusted accordingly.\n  Currently, the military survivor must pay taxes on the $3,000 \nincrease to the death gratuity payment. This is a very simple problem \nto fix. And I do not want any more excuses of why we cannot do it. I \nsimply want to get it done.\n  In 1997, Congress passed legislation revising the taxation of capital \ngains on the sale of an individual's principal residence, providing up \nto a $250,000 exclusion, $500,000 per couple, on their home sale if the \nindividual owned and lived in the house for at least 2 of the 5 years \npreceding the sale. Congress failed to provide a special rule for \nmembers of the uniformed service and Foreign Service who are required \nto periodically move either within the United States or abroad, making \nit difficult to meet those exclusion requirements.\n  The proposal in this amendment would permit military and Foreign \nService men and women to suspend the 5-year period for a maximum of 10 \nyears while away from home on assignment. In other words, those years \naway would count toward neither the 2-year lived-in-home nor the 5-year \nperiod.\n\n  Most American homeowners have the opportunity to build equity in \ntheir homes and are afforded this great tax benefit to do so. Members \nof the uniformed and Foreign Service who serve our country are \ndeserving of no less. This should be an easy fix. It is something we \ncan do; we should do; we have all agreed upon many times over. Why can \nwe not do it? I do not want to hear the excuses. And I certainly do not \nwant to present these excuses to my constituents.\n  Again, under the current law, military personnel located in a combat \nzone are provided an extension for filing taxes until 180 days after \nthey return from the combat zone. This provision does not currently \napply to contingency operations where military personnel are confronted \nwith demanding circumstances similar to those faced by members in a \ncombat zone.\n  Contingency operations we have seen recently include Operation Just \nCause in Panama in 1989, Operation Restore Hope in Somalia in 1992, and \nOperation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in 1994.\n  Right now, for example, an airman who is currently deployed overseas \nin a contingency operation in support of our troops in Afghanistan or \nIraq combat zones happens to be left out.\n  This, again, is a simple fix, something we can do for the hard-\nworking military service men and women who are there serving our \nNation, putting their lives on hold here at home to protect our \nfreedoms, and to be a part of the overall war on terrorism. It is \nsomething very simple that we could fix if we just took the time to do \nit.\n  Some reservists must travel away from home to perform mandatory \nweekend drill one weekend per month and may incur significant travel \nand lodging expenses. Under current law,\n\n[[Page S12583]]\n\nthese are deductible as itemized deductions, as unreimbursed business \nexpenses, to the extent they exceed 2 percent of the member's adjusted \ngross income. Most lower income, junior reservists do not itemize \ndeductions, so they receive no tax benefit for their expenses. For \nthose who do, the 2 percent floor limits the amount of benefit of the \ndeduction. For young reservists, their expenses may cost them as much \nas their entire take-home pay for that weekend.\n  This is a real-life issue for working men and women who are there \nserving each and every one of us in the military of this great Nation.\n  Why can't we just get it done? These are issues on which we have all \nagreed. It makes so much sense for us to come forward now, as we are \ntalking about the issues that affect our service men and women who are \nstationed abroad. Let us give them the tools to be able to keep their \nfamilies together here at home, to provide for their children, to make \nsure their families are going to stay together no matter how long they \nmay be deployed.\n  Under current law, a veterans organization is exempt from taxation if \nit meets the requirements of section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue \nCode. However, this status is in jeopardy. Many of these veterans \norganizations, such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, could face losing their tax-exempt status if the Congress and the \nadministration do not act to change the technical requirements of the \nInternal Revenue Code.\n  We have to get these things done. We are talking about wrapping up \nour business here in the next month or so. We have ample opportunity to \nmove these issues. We have come to agreement on all of them. We have \nmoved them in years past. Why can't we make them happen?\n  I could go on and on, describing all of the varied Tax Code fixes for \nveterans and military families that should have been enacted months \nago. They are all included in this amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Now is the time to act. We talk about how valuable our service men \nand women are to us, how much they mean to us, the sacrifices they are \nmaking, and how much that means to us as a nation and as individuals. \nLet's move on our Military Tax Fairness Act now. Let's make sure we see \nthis legislation through and that we enact it before we leave here.\n  The last provision of this amendment I would like to speak about is \nsomething I have talked a great deal about because I feel very strongly \nabout it. I feel strongly about it because I am a mother. I am trying \nto keep my family together, working hard with my husband as a dual-\nparent household, recognizing the real challenges that American \nfamilies face in raising children today. That is the child tax credit, \nits impact on military families and all of our working families.\n\n  The President promised America's families an advanced payment of the \n$400 increase in the child tax credit. These checks were sent out to a \nchosen few Americans earlier this summer. However, for millions of \nworking and military families, hard-working military families, this \npromise was not fulfilled. The families of 12 million children did not \nreceive the full child credit check this summer. By now they all know \nwho they are.\n  We should extend the child tax credit to the other working families \nwho were left out. These are people who work hard every day to provide \nfor their children and their families, to keep their families together. \nThese are hard-working families who have a family member, a father or \nmother, who may be stationed abroad or is in training now, someone who \nis out there who they have been dependent on who we are not going to \ngive the same opportunity to in the refundability of a child tax credit \nsimply because they make less money. Please remember, you are not even \neligible for this child credit unless you are working and unless you \nhave children.\n  This is not a giveaway. These are working families who are paying \ntaxes every day, whether it is sales tax, payroll taxes, excise taxes, \nto get themselves to and from work. Why wouldn't we want to give these \nfamilies the same ability, as they are working hard to preserve their \nfamilies, why wouldn't we want to give them the same advantage we give \nother higher income working families to take care of their children and \nfamilies?\n  I believe we need to extend that child credit to working families, \nall working families, and we need to do it now. A family with two \nparents making minimum wage and two children would not receive any \nincrease in the child credit under the bill signed by the President. \nThey would not receive any check this summer. Did they not work hard \nenough for this Congress? Did they not work hard enough for this \nadministration? Did they not work hard enough to be a part of trying to \nrevive this economy and strengthen the fabric of our Nation?\n  It isn't just minimum wage workers who were left out. These children \nin the shadows are living on our military bases as well. Roughly \n200,000 military personnel have incomes between $10,500 and $26,000, \nand most of these families will not receive the increased child tax \ncredit. In addition, roughly 100,000 military personnel stationed in \ncombat zones will be ineligible to receive the full credit because they \nwere called to duty. They did not receive a check this summer. Did they \nnot work hard enough? Wherever they were stationed in uniform to \nprotect our freedoms, did they not work hard enough for this Congress \nand this administration to get the same fair treatment as a working \nindividual in this country to take care of their children and their \nfamilies? The blue jeans, the milk, the loaf of bread, or anything else \nthey buy, was it any less expensive than what other working families \nare dealing with?\n  I think they worked hard enough. I am ashamed that we have been \nhiding from these families, hiding behind our rhetoric, hiding behind \nour process. This great institution is full of processes that are here \nto make the effort more reasonable, to make sure that what we are doing \nis right, that it can be dealt with in an appropriate way. But these \nprocesses are not here for us to hide behind. These are working \nfamilies in our military and in our communities that deserve the same \nfair treatment.\n\n  I, for one, am tired of telling them that if they will just wait a \nlittle bit longer, we will finally get around to them--maybe somewhere \ndown the road. We could have done this 6 months ago. We could have done \nit 4 months ago. We could have done it 2 months ago before we left on \nour break. But we didn't. We have not and we probably will not.\n  It is so important that we address this issue. It is important we \ntell these people that they are a priority, not only because they are \nthe fighting military men and women of this country but because they \nare the salt of the earth, the working families putting the fabric of \nthis Nation back together, one family at a time. We owe it to them to \ngive them the same opportunity to invest in their families, to reinvest \nin the economy, and to help make us strong so we can be and will remain \nthe superpower of the world that is there to reach out to other nations \nto help them through liberation and rebuilding and a multitude of other \nissues. But we are only as strong as each of the individual families of \nthis Nation that make up our whole.\n  I am ready for the excuses that my colleagues may throw at me. I am \nsure there are going to be many. I hope those families who got nothing \nfrom the trillions of dollars in tax cuts that we have shoved out of \nthe door are listening, too. I hope they are listening, but I doubt \nthat they are. These are the men and women who are too busy, too busy \nat work, too busy in the trenches and in the desert, too busy raising \nthose children and working hard at one or two jobs to make sure their \nfamilies will stay home, regardless of whether we find them as a \npriority in this Nation. They are too busy for our excuses.\n  I hope for just once my colleagues will join me in doing what is \nright on behalf of the working families in this great country and the \n12 million children who are our future.\n  Madam President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1829.\n\n\n[[Page S12584]]\n\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of October 14, 2003 under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise to express my support for the \neffort of my colleague from Arkansas relative to the $87 billion \nsupplemental appropriations request for Iraq that is currently pending \nbefore the Senate. I am very supportive of the President's $65 billion \nor roughly $67 billion level of funding for our troops. If we had an \nup-or-down vote on just that component of the President's request, I \nhave no doubt it would pass 100-0. No question. Regardless of what you \nthink about whether we should be in Iraq, I think this body will \noverwhelmingly be supportive of making sure our troops in Iraq have all \nthe resources they need to safely and efficiently and properly do the \ncourageous and extraordinary work they have done. We are proud of the \nmembers of our United States military who are currently operating under \nvery difficult circumstances, but doing the very best they can and \ndoing a very good job under the circumstances.\n  The portion of the request from the President, however, for the $20 \nbillion, roughly, for construction and various needs in Iraq is \nentirely a different matter. That calls for $100,000-$200,000 \nconsultants for tens of millions of dollars of study for the Iraqi \npostal service; $10 million for a new ZIP Code; new cities; new high \nschools, new hospitals--things that never existed in their history. \nThis is not for damage done in the war; this is establishing a whole \nnew infrastructure that never existed before.\n  It is hard to tell our military veterans that we cannot find $1.8 \nbillion so everyone gets access to a VA hospital, and then turn around \nand spend $20 billion on construction and other needs in Iraq; or tell \nAmerica's teachers and kids and parents that we cannot find $8 billion \nfor Leave No Child Behind, but we are going to build a new school \nsystem abroad that never existed before, and $20 billion will go out \nthe door for that.\n  Now we found this last weekend references in the Washington Post \nfinding that one of the problems the Bush administration is having is \nphysically moving so much American cash to Iraq. They started out \nputting the money into huge bags and putting it into aircraft at \nEdwards Air Force Base, but it got to be so cumbersome to send out \nthese billions of dollars that now they are shrink-wrapping American \nmoney into these huge cubes and pushing them into airplanes and sending \nthem to Iraq. But one of the problems we have is we are shrink-wrapping \nthese mountains of American taxpayers' money, and they shift in the \nplane and sometimes fall apart, and we are having problems physically \nmoving all this American cash to Iraq.\n  I asked my constituents in South Dakota over the past week what we \nshould be doing about this. A number of suggestions came up from South \nDakota constituents. A gentleman from Sioux Falls suggested since the \ncombat phase of the Iraq war is over and we have all these \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, we ought to load the cash into the \nwarheads of these missiles and fire them into Iraq. Since we are not \nkeeping track of how the money is used there anyway--there is no \nauditing; we just hand it over to people and hope they spend it right--\nthe missiles could explode and the money would sort of fall all over \nIraq. That is one idea. The problem is sometimes these rockets explode \non a launch pad, and there is a great risk some of that money might \nfall on an American school or daycare center. That is a risk the Bush \nadministration would not tolerate. That would probably not work.\n\n  Another suggestion was since we take all the oil from the Middle East \nin the huge tankers to the U.S., perhaps once they come here and \nunload, they can fill the tankers full of American cash and send that \nto Iraq. Once again, the ports there are not capable of unloading that \nmassive amount of American cash, and we would probably have ships \nbacked up to Egypt if we did that.\n  One of the suggestions came from a gentleman from Aberdeen, SD. He \nsuggested we use our B-52 and B-1 fleets to bomb Iraq with American \ncash--borrow it from the Social Security trust fund, as the President \nrecommended--and drop this money over Iraq; some would land in good \nplaces and some in bad, but no doubt it would probably be used as \nefficiently as what the administration's plan calls for.\n  There are interesting ideas out there. I hope people will contact the \nWhite House with their ideas about how best to disburse these huge \nmountains of cash--more than any one of us here or any citizen will \never see in a lifetime--$20 billion. We have been spending $1 billion a \nweek up until now. That is before you get to this provision. So at a \ntime when we are having a hard time funding our own water projects, our \nhospitals, and we have nursing homes on the cusp of closure because of \nMedicare reimbursement problems, at a time when the White House is \ncutting back on Pell grants, college grants for young people, and \nnontraditional students who want to go to college, when we are $1.8 \nbillion short for our veterans to get access to VA hospitals, and when \nour troops come home, one of the things they will be presented with is \nthe bill for the borrowing that is going into this $20 billion package.\n  We are not going to cut and run. We do have a role to play in helping \nIraq. No doubt, some expenditure is required. But $20 billion, when \nthere is very little help coming from our allies at this point, is a \nmassive expenditure.\n  The newspapers reported we are shoving this money out the door so \nfast they are unable to audit the disbursal of the money. It goes to a \nhandful of Iraqi leaders and they hope they will get it to the right \nplace. Yes, right. I can imagine where this money is winding up in many \ninstances.\n  At the same time, to the degree we hire American corporations to do \nwork there, I hope we will end this business of no-bid contracts going \nto a few well-positioned corporate entities and make sure it is an \nopen, clear, transparent process so the American public at least has \nthe consolation of knowing these tons of dollars going into Iraq are \ngoing for some constructive purpose rather than to line the pockets and \nbolster the profitability of a few. We can at least do that.\n  Madam President, we have a role to play, that is for certain. But \nthis level of expenditure is almost mind-boggling, breathtaking--$20 \nbillion. That is on top of the $79 billion just approved in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill last April, and, heavens knows, this \nis not the last of it. This could be going on for a long time. We are \ntold the construction projects that have been suggested for Iraq would \nrun easily into the $50 billion or $60 billion range and that somehow \nour allies are going to pay for that. Well, that doesn't appear to be \nwhat is happening.\n\n  We may very well be seeing future requests as well for this kind of \nmoney. We don't have $20 billion laying around. If we had $20 billion \nlaying around, that might be another matter. But we will have to borrow \nit to give to Iraq. Iraq sits on the first or second biggest supply of \noil in the world. There is no question that they cannot pump it out \nquickly enough now because their infrastructure is not what it was 10 \nyears ago; but the oil is still there, there is no question about that.\n  Why couldn't we come up with a mechanism for helping Iraq borrow \nagainst their own oil? Why should they not borrow against one of the \nworld's biggest mountains of gold in the world, as opposed to us \nborrowing from our Social Security trust fund? This is not rocket \nscience. We have already paid a billion dollars a month for the \nmilitary operation, with virtually very little help from our allies. We \nhave had some help from the Brits and modest amounts from others. We \nare paying a dear price for a doctrine of unilateral preemptive war \nnow, but we are in it and we have to find a way to get out.\n  It seems to me that, while we will support our troops--and there will \nbe\n\n[[Page S12585]]\n\nsome effort, no doubt, toward reconstruction in Iraq; but $20 billion, \nat a time when we are finding ourselves in record budget deficits in \nthe United States, is not a good use of our taxpayers' money. It is a \ndisservice to the American taxpayers, and it is a precedent we will rue \nfor years to come.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, will the Senator withhold his request \nfor a quorum call?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I listened with interest to the \nstatement of the Senator from South Dakota. It is a very interesting \nproposition that we should support the military budget and not support \nthe budget that is designed to bring our troops home. The $20.3 billion \nis a lot of money, there is no question about that.\n  I am informed there are about 22 million people in Iraq. They lived \nunder a despotic regime, and we have destroyed that regime. There are \nstill pockets of terrorists, pockets of resistance to the change to a \nnew form of government. But those who support only the military \nexpenditures are telling us: Let's just occupy Iraq. No one is saying: \nLet's go home. No one is saying: Let's just bring our forces out and \ncut and run. We are not going to do that.\n  If we put in the money, $66 billion for the year 2004, that is the \namount of money that was calculated that we need for the military, \nprovided we start bringing them home--we have already brought some \ntroops home, and I am one who hopes we will be bringing more troops \nhome this year and early next year. But they will be replaced by \nsecurity forces, those trained in the Iraqi Army, those trained to be \nsecurity forces. We do not want to train people to be forces of \noccupation. That has not been our way of life. Even in Bosnia and \nKosovo we used forces who were trained combat soldiers, combat \npersonnel to carry out a lot of functions, but we did not train people \nto just be forces of occupation.\n  Our people are trained combatants. They proved they are the best in \nthe world in this current Iraq campaign. There are still threats \nagainst this country throughout the world. We do not want them left in \nIraq in the numbers that are there now. They must start coming back to \nmeet any contingency to defend this country and our interests at home \nand abroad.\n  To say we can just get by with the $66 billion for military begs the \nquestion: What do you want us to do? Send more forces over there? \nShould we increase the cost militarily and send more combat forces over \nthere or should we provide forces, as has been suggested in one \namendment, to train constables for maintaining the peace, people in \nuniform but not trained to be combat forces, not trained to fight wars, \nbut just trained to be policemen at the corner or to guard schools or \nguard the churches or guard the shopping centers. We can do that. We \nhave been in Kosovo. We have been in Bosnia for over 4 years doing \nthat. We are trying to avoid that in this country.\n  I hope everyone in the Senate understands this is a unique, new \napproach to the concept of changing an administration, a nation-\nbuilding concept, letting them build their own nation as quickly as \npossible. The $20.3 billion is a great deal of money, there is no \nquestion about that. It is an enormous amount of money. It represents a \ncost to this country, however, that is far less than maintaining our \nforces there for 3, 4, or 5 years at a rate of $66 billion plus a year \nfor military.\n  I want to see the scales compared. I want people to understand that \nthe $20.3 billion is going to mean we do not have to increase the \ndefense costs in the years ahead as we occupy Iraq until they finally \nfind some way to create their own government. We are trying to build up \ntheir forces so we can bring our troops home, and I believe we will \nsucceed.\n  There are some people making a little bit of mirth over some of the \nproblems of dealing with a new country. It has its own currency now, \nand we are trying to convert our money to their money so they can start \nspending and generating their economy. It is going to cost a great deal \nto do that; a lot less, however, than occupying that country for a \nperiod of 4 more years. We have not been in any of these countries we \nhave been involved with in recent years less than 4 years. We hope to \nbe out of this situation in less than 4 years, and that is why I \nsupport the $20.3 billion the President requested.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas is a revenue bill. It cannot originate under our \nconstitutional concepts in the Senate. It would create a blue-slip \nsituation in the House of Representatives. I do not want to put the \nentire bill at risk by trying to include a tax bill in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  Therefore, I make the point of order it violates the pay-go \nprovisions of the Budget Act and ask that it be stricken.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I simply wish to say, prior to the Chair \nruling, that the Senator from Arkansas is a member of the Finance \nCommittee. She has studied this long and hard. I think it appropriate \nshe brought this before the Senate. I compliment and applaud her for \nbringing this to the Senate's attention.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, there are similar provisions in the \npending bill before the Senate. I renew my point of order.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Making my request more specific, I make the point of \norder that the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas is in violation \nof section 302(f) of the Budget Act and I ask that it be stricken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1846\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Clinton, and Ms. Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Reed, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. \n     Clinton, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1846.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the report requirements with respect to the \n                    Coalition Provisional Authority)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec. 2309.

Madam President, 1 year ago this week, the President signed \nthe congressional resolution authorizing him to go to war against Iraq. \nThat signing was a historic moment for the United States. For the first \ntime in our history, the President asked Congress for authority to \nlaunch an invasion against a sovereign nation that did not constitute a \nclear and imminent threat to the safety of the American people. And for \nthe first time in our history, the President demanded that Congress \ngive him unconditional power to initiate war whenever he wanted, \nlimited by nothing but his own judgment. The President wanted war on \nhis own terms, and Congress granted him everything he asked for.\n  For the next 5 months, the President and his top advisors turned a \ndeaf ear to growing concerns about the administration's judgment. When \nintelligence analysts warned that the White House was acting on \nquestionable conclusions, those analysts were ignored. When Members of \nCongress dared to ask questions about the President's war plans, they \nwere branded as unpatriotic. When our oldest allies disagreed with the \nargument that immediate war was the only answer, they were dismissed \nand called irrelevant. Top administration officials who publicly \ncontradicted the President's rosy predictions were fired, and the \nAmerican public was kept in the dark about what Iraq would look like \nafter the war.\n  On several occasions, I stood on the floor and asked: After Iraq, \nwhat? What shall we expect the morning after the war?\n  Confident that the reconstruction of Iraq was a job that could be \nhandled without involving Congress too much or the United Nations, \nPresident Bush delegated the task to retired GEN Jay Garner, who \nquietly went to work with support from the Pentagon. The American \npeople were not told much about General Garner or what he was doing in \nIraq. Most Members of Congress didn't know anything more about him than \nwhat they read in the papers. So when General Garner was given his \nwalking papers and replaced with Ambassador Paul Bremer without \nexplanation or fanfare, Congress had no real information to judge what \nthe shake-up would mean for the United States occupation of Iraq.\n  In the days after President Bush made his flamboyant landing on the \naircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to announce to the world that the \nUnited States had accomplished its mission in Iraq--that was the banner \nheadline over and above his head--most of the country was too \ndistracted celebrating the military triumph to think much about the \nPresident's appointment of Paul Bremer to serve as a Presidential envoy \nin Iraq. With the President declaring victory and the administration \ncontinuing to assure the public that we would be welcomed as \nliberators--a la Vice President Cheney--and that Iraq's oil revenues \nwould pay for reconstruction, the administration hoped that no one \nwould bother to notice the management changes it was making in Iraq.\n  The administration moved quickly to set up a reconstruction team on \nthe ground in Iraqi that would answer only to the President and the \nSecretary of Defense. In May, the President issued a classified \nNational Security Directive creating the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority, CPA. That document remains classified, and the \nadministration has provided very little public information about the \npowers and authorities of the CPA. All we really know from the White \nHouse is that Ambassador Bremer, as administrator of the CPA, reports \nto the President through the Secretary of Defense. But after the recent \nannouncement that National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice will be \ncoordinating reconstruction policy from within the White House, who \nknows what the chain of command looks like today or will look like \ntomorrow? Getting a clear picture of how the CPA operates has proved to \nbe difficult, but it is clear Ambassador Bremer wields an extraordinary \namount of power and independence in Iraq. And, if you don't believe it, \nlisten to this. On May 16, the CPA issued its first regulation in Iraq \nin which it spelled out its authority in no uncertain terms. Section 1 \nof that regulation stated:\n\n       The CPA is vested with all executive, legislative, and \n     judicial authority necessary to achieve its objectives, to be \n     exercised under relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, \n     including resolution 1483, and the laws and usages of war. \n     This authority shall be exercised by the CPA Administrator.\n\n  That is broad, broad, virtually without limitation, if the reading \nmeans what it says. Let's read that again.\n\n       The CPA is vested with all executive, legislative, and \n     judicial authority.\n\n  Take a look at the Constitution of the United States. Let's see what \nit says, in the very first article, the very first section of that \narticle, and then compare that authority with the authority I have just \nread. Here is what article I, section 1, of the Constitution says about \nthe legislative authority.\n\n       All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  That is one sentence, and it vests all legislative powers in a \nCongress of the United States.\n  Well, section 1 of the regulation, which I have just read, says it is \nthe CPA that is vested with all executive, legislative, and judicial \nauthority necessary to achieve its objectives. My, what authority that \nis. It does not stop with just legislative authority. It talks about \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial authority.\n  Read that again.\n\n       The CPA is vested with all executive, legislative, and \n     judicial authority necessary to achieve its objectives, to be \n     exercised under\n\n[[Page S12587]]\n\n     relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, including \n     resolution 1483, and the laws and usages of war. This \n     authority shall be exercised by the CPA Administrator.\n\n  There is a man mountain for you, with all that authority. That is a \npowerful statement, especially for an agency that has never been \nauthorized by Congress and an administrator who was not confirmed by \nthe Senate for his position. How about that?\n  The CPA under Paul Bremer has the power to run the Iraqi Government \nministries, the power to appoint Iraqi officials, the power to award \nlucrative private contracts for reconstruction. The CPA also oversees \nlocal police and even sets public curfews in Baghdad.\n  Now the CPA is looking to further consolidate its powers with an \nunprecedented request to spend over $20 billion of your money. I say to \nyou out there who are looking at this Chamber through those electronic \nlenses there: It is your money, your money. But here we are going to \nconsolidate the powers of the CPA with an unprecedented request to \nspend over $20 billion of the American taxpayers' money, your money, \nwith little oversight by the Congress.\n  Until now, the CPA has financed its various activities from a number \nof different sources, including billions of dollars in seized Iraqi \nassets. The CPA was not accountable to Congress for much of this \nspending, and it made very little effort to keep Congress and the \npublic informed about the administration's reconstruction plans.\n\n  So, the White House let Paul Bremer maintain a low profile for months \nin Iraq before the President finally spoke to the American people about \nwhat was happening on the ground in Iraq.\n  But now the President has admitted that rebuilding Iraq will be a \nmuch tougher job than he had promised, and it will come with a bigger \npricetag. I must say, however, the pricetag had never been mentioned. \nWe attempted to find out from the administration what the pricetag \nwould be, but the administration chose to stay mum about that. But now \nwe find this business of rebuilding Iraq is going to come with a big, \nbig pricetag. That means Paul Bremer needs more money, more of your \nmoney. It is your money that Paul Bremer needs. So the administration \nwas forced to loosen its grip of secrecy, just long enough to send \nAmbassador Bremer to testify before Congress about the need for \nadditional funding. And in one instance, when I asked Mr. Bremer when \nhe was before the Appropriations Committee, ``Will you find it possible \nto appear before this committee again if the chairman so directs,'' \nwhat was Mr. Bremer's answer?\n\n       I'm too busy. I am too busy. I'm too busy.\n\n  I regret we don't have those hearings printed, but the transcripts \nare around and those were his words:\n\n       I'm too busy.\n\n  Don't be fooled. The public relations campaign with Congress will \nlast only as long as it takes to get this massive bill pushed through \nboth Houses in one piece. In typical fashion, the administration has \nbeen willing to say whatever Congress wanted to hear in order to get \nits way. We heard a lot of talk about plans and accountability, but the \ninformation given to Congress was long on rhetoric, short on substance.\n  After all of the detailed spending requests and so-called plans from \nthe CPA, what we are left with today is a bill before the Senate that \ngives Paul Bremer a blank check. Did you hear it? Did you hear it? A \nblank check, that is what it is. Give to Mr. Bremer a blank check, a \nblank check to spend $20 billion as a start. However, once this bill \nleaves Congress, the administration can throw its plans out the window \nand restore tight controls over information to prevent any meaningful \noversight or scrutiny of its activities.\n  Is that the way you want your money managed? Congress cannot simply \ntrust the CPA to voluntarily cooperate with oversight of reconstruction \nspending. This administration has a long track record. It would not \neven take an elephant to remember how long that track record is. It has \na long track record of stonewalling Congress. And, so far, Iraq has \nbeen no exception. The CPA took over the reins of Iraq's government 5 \nmonths ago, yet Congress still has very little useful information to \nevaluate its progress in Iraq thus far, let alone the merits of future \nspending needs. If Congress has any hope of holding the administration \naccountable for the reconstruction plans it is proposing today, \nCongress needs a mechanism to ensure accountability from the CPA.\n\n  Ambassador Bremer testified before Congress that the activities of \nthe CPA will be fully transparent and accountable, but some of his own \nstatements suggested that he was reluctant to cooperate with committee \noversight. In particular, I was troubled by comments he made about \ncongressional access to the CPA's financial records. When he testified \nbefore the Appropriations Committee, Ambassador Bremer told the \ncommittee that the CPA had detailed records of all of its receipts and \noutlays that could be audited by Congress. However, when he appeared \nbefore the Armed Services Committee only 3 days later, he said the \nOffice of Management and Budget was responsible for maintaining those \nrecords, and Congress would have to go to the White House for access to \nthe CPA's records.\n  Throughout my long years in Congress, I have seen the White House \noccupied by Presidents of both parties, and I know from experience that \none needs to be skeptical when referred to the White House for \noversight information. There is no reason why any arm of the executive \nbranch charged with making such significant spending decisions should \nnot be working directly with Congress. When we are talking about \nhanding over another $20 billion to the CPA, there is a real need for \nCongress to confirm that the CPA has its finances in order and that the \nCPA is managing the taxpayers' money--your money--responsibly.\n  The amendment that I and other Senators are offering will require the \nCoalition Provisional Authority to report to Congress--how about that? \nThat is not asking too much--on its receipts and expenditures as the \nreconstruction efforts move forward in Iraq.\n  Let me say that again.\n  This amendment will require the Coalition Provisional Authority, the \nCPA, to report to Congress--yes; the people's branch of government--to \nreport to Congress on the CPA's receipts and expenditures as the \nreconstruction efforts move forward in Iraq. These reports will be \nsubmitted on a quarterly basis beginning on January 1, 2004. Building \non the reporting requirements already in the bill, this amendment calls \nfor an accounting of both appropriated funds and other sources, such as \noil revenues and foreign contributions. This is information that the \nCPA is already tracking. So it shouldn't be too much of a burden to \nshare that information with Congress, especially given the CPA's \nextraordinary flexibility in spending taxpayer dollars. Ambassador \nBremer assured the committee during the committee hearing that he would \ncomply with any reporting requirements Congress chose to include in \nthis legislation.\n  This amendment also directs the Comptroller General of the United \nStates to audit the spending records of the CPA. What is wrong with \nthat? How about that? The amendment also directs the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States to audit the spending records of the CPA--\nwe should all be for that--so that the General Accounting Office can \nprovide Congress with a clear understanding of how reconstruction \nactivities are being managed in Iraq. In its report to Congress, the \nGeneral Accounting Office must outline the authorities and organization \nof the CPA, the CPA's relationship to the White House and other \nexecutive agencies, and the CPA's use of private contractors to perform \ncritical reconstruction services in Iraq.\n\n  I think most people would agree with the purpose here. Let me say it \nagain.\n  In its report to Congress, the GAO must outline the authorities and \norganizations of the CPA, the CPA's relationship to the White House and \nother executive agencies--and get this--and the CPA's use of private \ncontractors to perform critical reconstruction services in Iraq.\n  The most important power vested in Congress by the Constitution is \nthe power over the purse. Englishmen spent centuries and shed blood to \nwrest that power from tyrannical monarchs and vest it in the people's \nbranch, the House of Commons. And our forbearers in our own country \nbrought with them that legacy, brought with them to these shores that \nprinciple, that power over the purse vested in the people's\n\n[[Page S12588]]\n\nbranch. So they wrote it in this Constitution which I hold in my hand. \nOur Framers wrote it in there. Article I, section 9 of this \nConstitution vests the power of the purse in this branch. That is where \nit has been. That is where it is.\n  This power carries with it the duty to ensure that the people's \nmoney--your money--is being spent wisely. Congress must be able to \nfollow that money wherever it goes, but right now our money may soon \ndisappear into a whirling storm of White House rhetoric and wartime \nprofiteering.\n  Without this amendment, following the money will only get harder as \nthe President continues to reorganize the chain of command in Iraq and \navoid straight answers to tough questions about the success of our \nreconstruction efforts.\n  If the constitutional power of the purse means anything at all, it \nmust at least require that the people's elected representatives here in \nCongress have a right to know how the Government is spending the \nNation's treasury. I urge the Senate to protect its own powers and live \nup to its oversight responsibilities, and I urge Senators to support \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are a series of reporting \nrequirements in this bill already. I have conferred with the \nleadership. We don't have any objection to this amendment by the \nSenator from West Virginia. I am certain that in conference the House \nis going to insist on consolidating some of these reports. We will be \nglad to review that matter with the Senator when that occurs. But we \nare happy to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. May we have a vote on \nit?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator want a rollcall vote?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I would like a rollcall. It shows that it is a serious \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator wants a vote on this \namendment, he is entitled to a vote. I shall not object to that. But I \nwant the Senate to know we have a Boxer amendment to require a report \non replacing troops with Iraqi forces or other non-U.S. forces to \nsecure areas in Iraq. We have an amendment by Mr. Feingold to provide \ntransparency and accountability with respect to the Coalition \nProvisional Authority. He wishes to have an office of inspector general \nin the Coalition Provisional Authority. As I understand it, he will \noffer that amendment. We have an amendment offered by Senator McCain \nand Senator Biden. They wish to have a GAO review on the effectiveness \nof the Coalition Provisional Authority relief and reconstruction \nactivities, and a report quarterly to the congressional committees on a \nsimilar matter to that suggested by Senator Byrd's amendment.\n  So if the Senator wishes a vote on his amendment, I am prepared to \nagree to that; that will be the case. It would be my intention to \naccept all of these amendments and take them to conference and see what \nwe can do to come out with a concept of a process of having adequate \ninformation and transparency in the Coalition without burdening the \nCoalition with a series of different types of reports and different \ntypes of officers who will be looking over their shoulders and \ndemanding access to their offices and interviews of their personnel \nwhen we are trying to get the business done over there.\n  I do not think a provisional authority, within an area with the kind \nof suicide bombers we are seeing there on a daily basis, is something \nwe have to burden with a series of duplicating types of reports and \ninspectors general and the comptroller general and his people there at \nthe same time.\n  So again I state to my friend I will not oppose the amendment. I will \nvote for it. I assume it will get 100 votes. But in conference I intend \nto see it to these reports are consolidated, and we have a concise--\nconcise--concept of the type of reports Congress needs to oversee the \nactivities of the Provisional Authority.\n  Does the Senator wish to renew his request for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. May I say, prior to doing that, this is not just one \nmore report. It is like the making of our laws, Mr. President. We have \nthe books full of laws, but we always see the need for enacting more \nand more laws.\n  There are Ten Commandments. If we listen to the argument of the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska--and he is a very distinguished \nSenator--then one Commandment should have been enough; the others would \nhave been repetitive. That is not the case.\n  This is an important reporting requirement. I hope the Senate will \napprove it. We are talking about $20 billion here. So I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I state again, I have serious question of \nwhether the Comptroller General of the United States is a replacement \nfor the Inspector General. That, in effect, is what the Senator's \namendment does. It creates the comptroller general as a constant \ninspector general of everything that is going on under the Coalition \nProvisional Authority.\n\n  I am going to reserve my opportunity to consolidate all of these \nreports in conference. But I do agree we have the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Comptroller General, General Accounting \nOffice is an arm of the Congress. Let the Congress carry out its proper \nrole of oversight under the Constitution. That is all I am asking for \nhere.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do not want to belabor the point. It is \nan arm of the Congress, but this is an executive function concerning an \naudit. We have created offices of the inspector general. Two Senators \nhave suggested inspectors general. I do not think this is the place for \na continuing presence of an arm of the Congress. But I will vote for \nthe Senator's amendment to take it to conference. As the Chair said, \nthere is a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment? If not, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 97, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 383 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--97\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n  The amendment (No. 1846) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in view of the vote on the Byrd \namendment, I announce that we have a Durbin amendment, a Corzine \namendment, a Boxer amendment, and a Feingold amendment that pertain to \nreporting. If those Senators are willing to offer\n\n[[Page S12589]]\n\nthem now, I am prepared to accept them, and we will put them all \ntogether when we get to conference. They have not been filed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two \nlists of amendments I now send to the desk be the only remaining first-\ndegree amendments in order to the bill other than those pending at the \npresent time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. And provided that second-degree amendments be in order \nand they be relevant to the amendment to which they are offered.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I thought we had on this \nlist--and I may have a different list--Senator Leahy has an amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There are two Leahy amendments here.\n  Mr. REID. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. In just a moment we will ask for a rollcall vote on \nSenator Graham's amendment, but I would like to yield to my friend, \nSenator Feingold, to introduce an amendment, then to approve a series \nof reporting amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair, to my friend from \nWisconsin, it is my understanding the Senator has two amendments.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. One is a reporting amendment and one is on another subject. \nI ask, since he has been waiting for such a long time, that he send his \nreporting amendment to the desk. Then it is my understanding there are \na number of matters you wish to dispose of dealing with reporting \namendments. Then he would like to offer his amendment. If there is a \nvote, we would vote on that and the Graham amendment at the same time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not sure about voting on his amendment until we \nknow what it is. Is it on the list?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. At least he could offer it and we could vote later. He \nhas been waiting a long time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have a series of issues I wish to handle before we get \nto any votes.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me yield for the Senator to introduce his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1847\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I offer an amendment to the bill \nconcerning the inspector general for authority for Iraq. My \nunderstanding is it is going to be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1847.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide transparency and accountability with respect to \n                  the Coalition Provisional Authority)\n\n       On page 22, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       Sec. 316.

I now call up amendments Nos. 1844, 1847, and 1851: \nSenator Feingold's amendment, the Boxer amendment, and Senator \nCorzine's amendment. They are all reporting amendments, requiring \nreporting. I ask unanimous consent that they be considered en bloc and \nagreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to en bloc.\n  Amendment No. 1844 is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require a report on replacing U.S. troops with Iraqi \n        forces or other non-U.S. forces in secure areas of Iraq)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC  . REPORT ON REPLACEMENT OF U.S. TROOPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The Coalition Provisional Authority states that 80 \n     percent of Iraq is a permissive environment with people \n     returning to a normal pace of life, while 20 percent is less \n     permissive with entrenched Saddam loyalists, international \n     terrorists and general lawlessness hindering recovery \n     efforts.\n       (2) On September 9, Deputy Secretary of Defense John \n     Wolfowitz testified, ``. . . the predominantly Shia south [or \n     Iraq] has been stable and I would say far more stable than \n     most pre-war predications would have given you. And the mixed \n     Arab, Turkish, Kurdish north has also been remarkably stable, \n     again, contrary to fears than many of us had that we might \n     face large-scale ethnic conflict.''\n       (3) On September 14, Secretary of State Colin Powell \n     stated, ``We see attacks against our coalition on a daily \n     basis . . . but in many parts of the country things are quite \n     secure and stable.''\n       (4) The Coalition Provisional Authority states that a major \n     focus of its security efforts has been to increase Iraqi \n     participation in and responsibility for a safe and secure \n     Iraq.\n       (5) On September 14, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \n     stated, ``90 percent of the people in Iraq are now living in \n     an area that's governed by a city council, or a village \n     council.''\n       (6) The Coalition Provisional Authority reports that 60,000 \n     Iraqis are now assisting in security, including 46,000 Iraqi \n     police nationwide.\n       (7) Of the 160,000 coalition military personnel serving in \n     Iraq, 20,000 are comprised of non-U.S. forces.\n       (b) Report.--Beginning 30 days after the enactment of this \n     Act, the President or his designee shall submit a monthly \n     report to Congress detailing--\n       (1) the areas of Iraq determined to be largely secure and \n     stable; and\n       (2) the extent to which U.S. troops have been replaced by \n     non-U.S. coalition forces, U.N. forces, or Iraqi forces in \n     the areas determined to be largely secure and stable under \n     this subsection.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1805, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I call up an amendment numbered 1805 introduced by \nSenator Graham and send a modification of that amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1805), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 2313. (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) in a speech delivered to the United Nations on \n     September 23, 2003, President George W. Bush appealed to the \n     international community to take action to make the world a \n     safer and better place;\n       (2) in that speech, President Bush emphasized the \n     responsibility of the international community to help the \n     people of Iraq rebuild their country into a free and \n     democratic state;\n       (3) for a plan for Iraq's future to be appropriate, the \n     provisions of that plan must be consistent with the best \n     interests of the Iraqi people;\n       (4) premature self-government could make the Iraqi state \n     inherently weak and could serve as an invitation for \n     terrorists to sabotage the development of a democratic, \n     economically prosperous Iraq.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) arbitrary deadlines should not be set for the \n     dissolution of the Coalition Provisional Authority or the \n     transfer of its authority to an Iraqi governing authority; \n     and\n       (2) no such dissolution or transfer of authority should \n     occur until the ratification of an Iraqi constitution and the \n     establishment of an elected government in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1805), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1836\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that Senator Reid's amendment No. 1836 be laid \nbefore the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the adoption of that amendment. \nIt is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nnumbered 1836.\n  The amendment (No. 1836) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1842, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that the Senate consider amendment No. 1842 from \nSenator Bingaman, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1842), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following:\n       Sec. 316. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The National Guard and Reserves have served the Nation \n     in times of national crises for more than 200 years. The \n     National Guard and Reserves are a critical component of \n     homeland security and national defense.\n       (2) The current deployments of many members of the National \n     Guard and Reserve have made them absent from their \n     communities for an abnormally long time. This has diminished \n     the ability of the National Guard to conduct its State \n     missions.\n       (3) Many members of the National Guard and Reserves have \n     been on active duty for more than a year, and many more have \n     had their tours of active duty involuntarily extended while \n     overseas.\n       (b) Report on Utilization of National Guard and Reserves.--\n     (1) Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives a report on the utilization of the National \n     Guard and Reserves in support of contingency operations \n     during fiscal year 2004.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) Information on each National Guard and Reserve unit \n     currently deployed, including--\n       (i) the unit name or designation;\n       (ii) the number of personnel deployed;\n       (iii) the projected return date to home station; and\n       (iv) the schedule, if any, for the replacement of the unit \n     with a Regular or multinational unit.\n       (B) Information on current operations tempo, including--\n       (i) the length of deployment of each National Guard and \n     Reserve unit currently deployed, organized by unit and by \n     State;\n       (ii) in the case of each National Guard and Reserve unit on \n     active duty during the two-year period ending on the date of \n     the report, the aggregate amount of time on active duty \n     during such two-year period; and\n       (iii) the percentage of National Guard and Reserve forces \n     in the total deployed force in each current domestic and \n     overseas contingency operation.\n       (C) Information on current recruitment and retention of \n     National Guard and Reserve personnel, including--\n       (i) any shortfalls in recruitment and retention;\n       (ii) any plans to address such shortfalls or otherwise to \n     improve recruitment or retention; and\n       (iii) the effects on recruitment and retention over the \n     long term of extended periods of activation of National Guard \n     or Reserve personnel.\n       (3) The report under this subsection shall be organized in \n     a format that permits a ready assessment of the deployment of \n     the National Guard and Reserves by State, by various \n     geographic regions of the United States, and by Armed Force.\n       (c) Report on Effects of Utilization of National Guard and \n     Reserves on Law Enforcement and Homeland Security.--(1) Not \n     later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in \n     consultation\n\n[[Page S12591]]\n\n     with the chief executive officers of the States, submit to \n     Congress a report on the effects of the deployment of the \n     National Guard and Reserves on law enforcement and homeland \n     security in the United States.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) The number of civilian first responders on active duty \n     with the National Guard or Reserves who are currently \n     deployed overseas.\n       (B) The number of first responder personnel of the National \n     Guard or Reserves who are currently deployed overseas.\n       (C) An assessment by State of the ability of the States to \n     respond to emergencies without currently deployed National \n     Guard personnel.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for consideration of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd be added as a \ncosponsor of the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1842), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1838\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that the Senate consider Senator Reid's amendment \nnumbered 1838.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment offered by my friend from \nNevada increases spending by $3.4 billion that causes the underlying \nbill to exceed the subcommittee allocation under section 302(b). \nTherefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to \nsection 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Chair rules, I would simply say I \nam willing to let this go without a recorded vote. The reason for that \nis I have spoken to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Warner, and I have spoken to the ranking member, Senator Levin, \nand Senator Warner has told me he has had a number of high-level \nmeetings with leadership in the House and people from the Pentagon, and \nthat there is every intention of being able to help American veterans.\n  There has been in existence now for more than 100 years a law that \nsomeone who is disabled as a result of military service and also draws \nretirement pay from the military cannot draw both. This is unfair.\n  I have worked on this issue now for several years, and we now have it \nso people who are Purple Heart veterans are able to draw both their \ndisability and their retirement. What is contemplated by Senator \nWarner, Senator Levin, and others is that that will be increased to up \nto 50 percent--those who would be able to draw both their disability \nand their retirement.\n  I hope that comes to be, as it is so important to the American \nveterans. This is something that is bipartisan in nature. This \namendment before the Senate is sponsored by the Senator from Nevada, \nthe senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the senior Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and it is an issue that has bipartisan \nsupport.\n  If we had a vote on it here, as we have had on a number of occasions, \nregardless of the cost, as indicated on a number of other occasions, it \nwould pass. I think the incremental steps are something I do not \nrelish, but I am willing to accept that. And I do hope those who have \npromised us action will be taken in the immediate future will do so. \nOtherwise, I will be back with Senator McCain and Senator Lincoln at a \nsubsequent time and cause a vote to occur on this Senate floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. In the \nauthorization conference, this matter is being considered. That is one \nreason I said it is with reluctance I make a point of order. But I ask \nthe Presiding Officer to rule on my point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order has been made, and the \npoint of order is sustained. The amendment falls.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will consult with the distinguished \nacting leader on the other side. Senator Graham does wish a rollcall \nvote on his amendment No. 1806.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, \nI would ask that during the time we review that--it will take just a \nfew minutes--the Senator from Wisconsin be allowed to offer his \namendment. He has literally been here for hours.\n  If I could ask what the subject matter is of the amendment, through \nthe Chair to my friend from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Absolutely. Extending FMLA benefits to families of \nNational Guard members.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There are people leaving, and I do wish we would get an \nagreement on when we could call for a rollcall vote on----\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Wisconsin told me earlier today he would \ntake no more than 15 minutes to discuss his amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Can we establish a vote on the Graham amendment at 6 \no'clock?\n  Mr. REID. The only reason I am stalling a little bit here is I do not \nknow the subject matter of the Graham amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The amendment was cleared, but because of a change he \nwishes a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we would agree when the Senator from \nWisconsin completes his statement, which would be 15 minutes from the \ntime I give the floor to him, that there be a vote in relation to the \namendment of the Senator from Wisconsin, with no second-degree \namendments in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Graham had a chance to explain the amendment to \nus, but he has not explained it on the floor yet. He would like 5 \nminutes before the vote, and I would ask that the Senator be allowed 5 \nminutes after the Senator has completed his speech, and then following \nthat, we vote, as indicated by the Senator from Nevada, with no further \namendments in order.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask through the Chair to my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska, are we going to vote only on Graham, \nnot on Feingold? Are we going to have two votes now?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We do not know anything about Senator Feingold's \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. So I would ask that my unanimous consent request apply only \nto the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Subject to the 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We do not want time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We join in that request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Alaska state his \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when Senator \nFeingold has completed his remarks, the Senator from South Carolina be \nrecognized to speak for not more than 5 minutes on his amendment No. \n1806, and following that time, there be no further amendments in order, \nand we have a rollcall vote on amendment No. 1806.\n  Mr. REID. And I would ask for the modification, the amendment of the \nSenator from South Carolina, as modified.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1806, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send the modification to the desk so \nthere will be no misunderstanding about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered. The amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1806), as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that the removal of the \n Government of Saddam Hussein has enhanced the security of Israel and \n                      other United States allies)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 3002. (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) Israel is a strategic ally of the United States in the \n     Middle East;\n       (2) Israel recognizes the benefits of a democratic form of \n     government;\n       (3) the policies and activities of the Government of Iraq \n     under the Saddam Hussein regime contributed to security \n     concerns in the Middle East, especially for Israel;\n       (4) the Arab Liberation Front was established by Iraqi \n     Baathists, and supported by Saddam Hussein;\n       (5) the Government of Iraq under the Saddam Hussein regime \n     assisted the Arab Liberation Front in distributing grants to \n     the families of suicide bombers;\n       (6) the Government of Iraq under the Saddam Hussein regime \n     aided Abu Abass, leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front, \n     who was a mastermind of the hijacking of the Achille Lauro, \n     an Italian cruise ship, and is responsible for the death of \n     an American tourist aboard that ship; and\n       (7) Saddam Hussein attacked Israel during the 1990-1991 \n     Persian Gulf War by launching\n\n[[Page S12592]]\n\n     39 Scud missiles into that country and thereby causing \n     multiple casualties.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the removal of the \n     Government of Iraq under Saddam Hussein enhanced the security \n     of Israel and other United States allies.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1852\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Wyden, and Senator Dayton, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Wyden, and Mr. Dayton, proposes an amendment numbered 1852.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To enable military family members to take leave to attend to \n                 deployment-related business and tasks)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new title:\n\n                 TITLE III--LEAVE FOR MILITARY FAMILIES\n\n     SEC. 3001. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Military Families Leave \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 3002.

Mr. President, my amendment would bring a small measure \nof relief to the families of our brave military personnel who are being \ndeployed for the ongoing fight against terrorism, the war in Iraq, and \nother missions in this country and around the world.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces undertake enormous sacrifices \nin their service to our country. They spend time away from home and \nfrom their families in different parts of the country and different \nparts of the world and are placed into harm's way in order to protect \nthe American people and our way of life. And, of course, we owe them a \nhuge debt of gratitude for their dedicated service.\n  The ongoing deployments for the fight against terrorism and for the \ncampaign in Iraq are turning upside down the lives of thousands of \nactive duty, National Guard, and Reserve personnel and their families \nas they seek to do their duty to their country and honor their \ncommitments to their families, and, in the case of the Reserve \ncomponents, to their employers as well. Today, there are more than \n164,000 National Guard and Reserve personnel on active duty.\n  Some of my constituents are facing the latest in a series of \nactivations and deployments for family members who serve our country in \nthe military. Others are seeing their loved ones off on their first \ndeployment. All of these families share in the worry and concern about \nwhat awaits their relatives and hope, as we do, for their swift and \nsafe return.\n  Recently, many of those deployed in Iraq have had their tours \nextended beyond the time they had expected to stay. This extension has \nsometimes played havoc with the lives of those deployed and their \nfamilies. Worried mothers, fathers, spouses, and children expecting \ntheir loved ones home before Thanksgiving must now wait until months \nafter Christmas before their loved ones' much-anticipated homecoming. \nThe emotional toll is huge. So is the impact on a family's daily \nfunctioning as bills still need to be paid, children need to get to \nschool events, and sick family members must still be cared for.\n  Our men and women in uniform face these challenges without complaint. \nBut we should do more to help them and their families with the many \nthings that preparing to be deployed requires.\n  Often, military personnel and their families are given only a couple \nof days' notice that their units will be deployed. These dedicated men \nand women then have only a very limited amount of time to get their \nlives in order. For members of the National\n\n[[Page S12593]]\n\nGuard and Reserves, this includes telling their employers that they \nwill be deployed for, in many cases, up to a year and a half. I commend \nthe many employers around the country for their understanding and \nsupport when an employee or a family member of an employee is called to \nactive duty.\n  In preparation for a deployment, military families often have to \nscramble to arrange for child care, to pay bills, to contact their \nlandlords or mortgage companies, and take care of other things that \nmany of us, of course, deal with on a daily basis.\n  The amendment I offer today would allow eligible employees whose \nspouses, parents, sons, or daughters are military personnel who are \nserving on or called to active duty in support of a contingency \noperation to use their Family and Medical Leave benefits for issues \nrelating to or resulting from that deployment.\n  These instances could include preparation for deployment or \nadditional responsibilities that family members take on as a result of \na loved one's deployment, such as child care.\n  Let me make sure there is no confusion about what this amendment does \nand does not do. This amendment does not expand eligibility for FMLA to \nemployees not already covered by FMLA. It does not expand FMLA \neligibility to active duty military personnel. It simply allows those \nalready covered by FMLA to use those benefits in one additional set of \ncircumstances--to deal with issues directly related to or resulting \nfrom the deployment of a family member.\n  I was proud to cosponsor and vote for the legislation that created \nthe landmark Family and Medical Leave Act during the early days of my \nservice to the people of Wisconsin as a Member of this body. This \nimportant legislation allows eligible workers to take up to 12 weeks of \nunpaid leave per year for the birth or adoption of child, the placement \nof a foster child, to care for a newborn or newly adopted child or \nnewly placed foster child, or to care for their own serious health \ncondition or that of a spouse, a parent, or a child. Some employers \noffer a portion of this time as paid leave in addition to other accrued \nleave, while others allow workers to use accrued vacation or sick leave \nfor this purpose prior to going on unpaid leave.\n  Since its enactment in 1993, the FMLA has helped more than 35 million \nAmerican workers to balance responsibilities to their families and \ntheir careers. According to the Congressional Research Service, between \n2.2 million and 6.1 million people took advantage of these benefits in \nthe year 1999-2000.\n  Our military families sacrifice a great deal. Active duty families \noften move every couple of years due to transfers and new assignments. \nThe 10 years since FMLA's enactment have also been a time where we as a \ncountry have relied more heavily on National Guard and Reserve \npersonnel for more and more deployments of longer and longer duration. \nThe growing burden on these service members' families must be \naddressed, and this amendment is one way to do so.\n  This amendment has the support of a number of organizations, \nincluding the Wisconsin National Guard, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard \nof the United States, and the National Partnership for Women and \nFamilies.\n  We owe it to our military personnel and their families to do all we \ncan to support them in this difficult time. I hope that this amendment \nwill bring a small measure of relief to our military families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I need time, I say to my friend, to review this with the \nArmed Services Committee and the Government Affairs Committee before we \ncan consent to that. I am sure there will be a recorded vote at some \ntime, but I hope the Senator will accept a delay in that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, the Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1806, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I hope this sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution will pass unanimously.\n  The purpose of this resolution is to try to put in perspective what \nhas been achieved by Operation Iraqi Freedom. We have suffered greatly \nin this country. The Iraqi people have suffered. We have lost soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines. We have spent a lot of money, but I argue \nthat we are much more secure as a nation; that there is one less \ndictator in the world to help terrorists; and that dispensing with \nSaddam Hussein's regime has been of particular benefit to our Nation, \nthe region, and the world.\n  But there is one nation where this has made a dramatic difference. \nThat is the State of Israel. This resolution says in very simple and \nstrong terms that disposing of the Saddam Hussein government has made \nthe State of Israel a more secure place. Why do we say that? During \nSaddam Hussein's period of ruling, he paid suicide bombers, homicide \nbombers, in Palestine money, and families of suicide and homicide \nbombers, to go in and kill innocent Israeli citizens. So when he left, \nthere is one less person to fund people who are trying to destroy \npeace.\n  Israel and the Palestinian people deserve to live side by side in \npeace with two independent states. Saddam Hussein was providing money \nto people, the Arab Liberation Front, whose goal was to put Israel in \nthe sea.\n  There is an element of people in that region who don't want to make \npeace with Israel. They want to destroy the State of Israel. Saddam \nHussein made that possibility more likely by providing aid and comfort \nand money. So when we took Saddam Hussein out, we made Israel more \nsecure. That is a good thing. I hope the Senate will join in unanimous \nsupport of that concept.\n\n  The government under Saddam Hussein gave money to the master mind of \nthe hijacking of the Achille Lauro. The government of Saddam Hussein \nlaunched 39 Scud missile attacks against the State of Israel. People \ndebate, should we have done it? Was it worth it? I argue strongly that \nit was worth it, not only for us but for the State of Israel. The men \nand women who have died to replace Saddam Hussein have died to make the \nworld more secure. It is heartbreaking to lose soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines, but one of the reasons we have a military is to \nprotect ourselves and our allies.\n  Every now and then in history people such as Saddam Hussein crop up. \nIf they are left alone, innocent people die unnecessarily. If they are \nleft alone, the forces of evil become stronger.\n  I admire our President who chose to stand up to Saddam Hussein. For \nover 12 years he has violated every effort to rein him in. Force was \nnecessary. Force was costly. But the benefits of that force have made \nthe region safer, made the Iraqi people free for the first time in \ndecades, and made the State of Israel a more secure place to live. \nIsrael has been a good ally. I would ask all of my colleagues, if at \nall possible, to legitimize Operation Iraqi Freedom in terms of making \nIsrael more secure because to say otherwise would be an untruth. Let it \nbe said that the men and women who sacrificed to make the Iraqi people \nfree have sacrificed in a way to make people in Israel and our own \ncountry safer, more secure, and their hopes and dreams maybe will be \nrealized.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays. Senator McConnell would like to speak on \nthe measure, and I ask unanimous consent to make him a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Does the Senator seek the yeas and nays?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I was not informed about the request for \ntime. The agreement we have pending would say we have a vote following \nthe Senator's remarks. If there are Senators who wish to speak, I would \nlike to know who they are and how much time they want to speak so we \ncould change the agreement, at least have a vote. Members are coming \nback, thinking they are going to vote in a few minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The unanimous consent agreement said that following the \nstatement of the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator from South \nCarolina would be recognized for 5 minutes,\n\n[[Page S12594]]\n\nand then we would vote. So we have people coming from all over the city \nhere to vote.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. If I may, Senator McConnell would like \nto speak. He is here. You are right. I am sorry about the scheduling \nproblem. I ask the body to let Senator McConnell speak for whatever \ntime he needs on the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Is that in the form of a unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes have been consumed. Does the \nSenator from South Carolina seek consent for additional time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Yes, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 3 minutes for the Senator from Kentucky so he may speak on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have no objection to that request if \nSenator McConnell can speak and then we can vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina \nfor an excellent amendment. There is no ally of the U.S. and the world \nthat benefits more, as the Senator from South Carolina pointed out, \nfrom the fall of Saddam Hussein than our good friends, the Israelis. \nThey have watched over the years during the Saddam Hussein regime when \nhe paid people to go into Israel and engage in suicide bombings. They \nare extremely grateful that there is one less terrorist state in the \nregion to threaten Israel and the United States. In fact, you could \nargue that Israel benefits every bit as much, if not more so, from the \nchange of regime in Iraq than we do in the United States.\n  I think this amendment is extremely important. Remember, Saddam \nHussein was launching Scud missiles into Israel during the Persian Gulf \nwar. So by changing the regime in Iraq, we have made the situation in \nIsrael dramatically safer than it would have been on top of all of the \nother reasons why the change in regime in Iraq was in our own best \ninterests. So I thank the Senator from South Carolina for a very \nimportant amendment that illustrates the significance of the fall of \nSaddam Hussein and peace in the Middle East and a chance down the road \nfor there to be a final settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 95, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 384 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--95\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Bingaman\n     Chafee\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n  The amendment (No. 1806), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we are seeking to urge Members to raise \nsome of the amendments that they have indicated they want to have \nconsidered so we might have some discussion of those amendments and \nschedule them for a vote early tomorrow morning. I know Senator Byrd is \nprepared to offer an amendment. But I yield to the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. At this juncture, we have a lot of amendments on both \nsides of the aisle. We made progress today, although I think we are \ngoing to be able to narrow down the number of amendments that people \nhave come forward with and given to the managers. Last night we made \nreal progress by taking amendments to the floor, debating the \namendments, and then voting this morning.\n  After talking to the Democratic leader and managers, it is very clear \nthat we should be able to do that tonight, if people will come forward \nwith those amendments and then stack those amendments tomorrow morning.\n  Right now, we cannot say with certainty what time that would be. The \ngoal would be to debate amendments tonight and stack those for an \nappropriate time tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I want to agree with the majority \nleader. I think we did make progress last night. We had good \ncooperation. A number of amendments were offered. We had votes on them \nthis morning. We want to replicate that tonight. I will be offering an \namendment shortly. I know a number of other Senators are planning to \noffer amendments on our side.\n  Our expectation is we will have those votes, plus I think there are \nfive amendments pending that we would like to be able to dispose of, \neither with a voice vote or a rollcall vote, tomorrow morning as well. \nThe majority leader noted we made a lot of progress today. We have a \nfinite list. I think it is important for Senators to come and limit the \namount of time that some of these votes may otherwise take. We can have \na good debate, but I think we have to get through a lot of work \ntomorrow. The only way we can do it is if Senators will come to the \nfloor tonight.\n  As I say, I will offer an amendment now. Senator Feinstein is ready \nto go with an amendment after I am finished. I don't know if there are \nothers on the Republican side, but we need to bring up four or five \namendments tonight. I think we can give the assurance to the majority \nleader that we will be prepared to do that.\n  Mr. REID. Will the distinguished Democratic leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Did you ask consent that following the offering of your \namendment the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, be recognized to \noffer her amendment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I referenced the fact that she was \nprepared to offer it. I ask consent she be recognized after my \namendment has been offered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, we are \nbeing asked to consent to an order. We have not even seen these \namendments. We don't even know the names on the amendments.\n  I remember, when the tables were turned, vehement objections to such\n\n[[Page S12595]]\n\nprocedure. I object until I see the amendment to see whether we want to \nstack them automatically for a vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, if I could just clarify, we are not \nasking for consent that they be voted on tomorrow. I said it would be \nhelpful if they could be voted on tomorrow morning. I was just \nindicating the sequence tonight and hoping to expedite the \nconsideration of these amendments--that after I lay my amendment down \nand make comments relating thereto, that Senator Feinstein be \nrecognized so she could do the same. If the Senator from Alaska chooses \nnot to do that, we can accommodate him with whatever suggestions he may \nhave for how we do this.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is this the loan amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is my only amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is it on the list?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is the one I had with Senator Domenici and which \nSenator Domenici is no longer on.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It would be nice to see it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is at the desk.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to bring one over.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw my objection.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I renew the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1854\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, if there are no other Senators seeking \nrecognition, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending \namendment, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1854.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To achieve the most effective means of reconstructing Iraq \n    and to reduce the future costs to the American taxpayer of such \n reconstruction by ensuring broad-based international cooperation for \n                              this effort)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n       Sec. 2313. (a) Limitation on Amount of Future Funds \n     Available for Iraq Reconstruction Programs.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of this Act or any other provision of \n     law, the amount of appropriated funds that may be obligated \n     and expended for Iraq reconstruction programs may not exceed \n     the current appropriated amount for Iraq reconstruction \n     programs unless--\n       (1) the President certifies to Congress that the amount of \n     appropriated funds to be so obligated and expended for Iraq \n     reconstruction programs is equal to or exceeded by an amount \n     of contributions from the international community for Iraq \n     reconstruction programs; or\n       (2) the President--\n       (A) determines that, notwithstanding the lack of \n     contributions by the international community for Iraq \n     reconstruction programs in an amount described in paragraph \n     (1), the obligation and expenditure of appropriated funds for \n     Iraq reconstruction programs in excess of the current \n     appropriated amount for Iraq reconstruction programs is in \n     the national security interests of the United States; and\n       (B) submits to Congress a written notification on that \n     determination, including a detailed justification for the \n     determination.\n       (b) Construction With Later Enacted Provisions of Law.--\n     This section may not be superseded, modified, or repealed \n     except pursuant to a provision of law that makes specific \n     reference to this section.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``current appropriated amount for Iraq \n     reconstruction programs'' means the aggregate amount \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act, and by \n     any Act enacted before the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     for Iraq reconstruction programs.\n       (2)(A) the term ``Iraq reconstruction programs'' means \n     programs to address the infrastructure needs of Iraq, \n     including infrastructure relating to electricity, oil \n     production, public works, water resources, transportation and \n     telecommunications, housing and construction, health care, \n     and private sector development.\n       (B) The term does not include programs to fund military \n     activities, (including the establishment of national security \n     forces), public safety (including border enforcement, police, \n     fire, and customs), and justice and civil society \n     development.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have been debating this critical \npiece of legislation now for over a week. Most of the debate has \nproperly centered on the immediate issues presented by the bill before \nus: How much of the $20 billion the President is seeking for \nreconstruction of Iraq should American taxpayers provide, and under \nwhat terms and conditions should they provide it?\n  We will have an opportunity tomorrow to talk about a number of \nspecific amendments dealing with loan relationships with Iraq and the \nprobability that the debate centering on whether or not Iraq should be \nrequired to take some of the assistance in the form of a loan will be \nresolved before the end of the week.\n  There are widely divergent and strongly held views within this \nChamber about how we should answer the questions involving loans and \ngrants, and what responsibilities Iraq should have.\n  While Senate passage of $87 billion to secure and rebuild Iraq seems \ncertain, each of us knows the amount contained in this bill is not \nsufficient to complete the task. The administration itself has argued \nthat we may need another $55 billion beyond the request made in this \nappropriations bill today. We don't know how we will do in the donors' \nconference. But I am told the best we can expect at this point is about \n$3 billion from the international community. If it is still accurate \nthat $55 billion may be required, and that $3 billion of that may be \nprovided today at least--and that is over a period of time, and in some \ncases we are told that it could be 4 or 5 years before some of that $3 \nbillion is actually committed--then obviously rebuilding Iraq would \ntake many more years and many tens of billions of dollars in addition \nto what is now being considered within this legislation.\n  The amendment I am offering tonight simply requires that the \nPresident do what he said he will do--work with the international \ncommunity to ensure that the American taxpayer does not continue to act \nalone or largely alone in picking up future reconstruction costs. The \namendment simply seeks to ensure that the international community is an \nequal partner in any future reconstruction costs beyond those contained \nin the bill before us.\n  Basically, what we are saying is we will make our decision about the \n$87 billion, but we recognize this may not be the last request; that \nthere will be additional needs. This amendment simply says that as we \nconsider those additional needs, we ask the President to certify that \nother nations are paying their fair share of any future costs beyond \nthe $87 billion for the occupation and rebuilding of Iraq before he \nuses additional American taxpayer dollars to finance these efforts.\n  I want to emphasize that it doesn't touch one dime of the $87 billion \nrequest. Other amendments will seek to address those concerns, and \nobviously I intend to support them. This pending amendment simply says \nto the President: You must provide some assurance that the \ninternational community will support our efforts to expend additional \nfunds beyond the $87 billion for Iraq's reconstruction.\n  This amendment will not affect security-related expenditures. No \nlimitations are placed on the President's ability to expend funds for \nour troops, Iraqi troops, or for Iraqi public safety programs such as \nborder enforcement, police, fire and customs. And no limitations are \nplaced on the President's ability to commit funds to develop Iraq's \njustice system.\n\n  If the President is unable to get the international community to pay \nits fair share of future Iraqi construction costs, the amendment \npermits the President to expend still more taxpayer dollars on Iraq's \nreconstruction with one provision. That provision is that he certify to \nCongress that additional U.S. expenditures on Iraq's reconstruction are \nin our national security interests. We don't tie the President's hands. \nWe permit him to get everything he is asking for today--enough to \nstabilize and rebuild Iraq for a year according to the administration's \nestimates. It gives him time to round up additional support for our \nefforts in Iraq should he deem it necessary to ask America's taxpayers \nto provide additional funds. And we give\n\n[[Page S12596]]\n\nhim a waiver if he fails to secure the additional international \nsupport.\n  More than 6 months after the end of the Hussein regime, the cost of \nrebuilding and securing Iraq, both in the lives lost and in money now \nexpended, appear without end. Now more than ever, we need to engage the \nsupport of the international community prior to the donors' conference, \nand this amendment would allow us to do that. The entire world will \nbenefit from a democratic and prosperous Iraq. The entire world has an \nobligation to help us build a better future for the Iraqi people.\n  As the President noted just last month in his address about his \nadministration's efforts in Iraq, ``we are committed to expanding \ninternational cooperation in the reconstruction and security of Iraq.'' \nThis amendment provides the President the leverage to make that promise \na reality.\n  I hope our colleagues will endorse this amendment on a bipartisan \nbasis. This is simply an opportunity for us to say from here on out, \nregardless of what you may think of the $87 billion, the time has come \nfor the international community to participate, and it is critically \nimportant that we send that message to the donors' conference when we \nhave that occasion to do so later on this month.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1848\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Johnson, and \n     Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 1848.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require reports on the United States strategy for relief \n and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, and to limit the availability of \ncertain funds for those efforts pending determinations by the President \n      that the objectives and deadlines for those efforts will be \n                        substantially achieved)\n\n       Strike section 2309 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 2309. (a) Limitation on Availability of Funds for \n     Relief and Reconstruction in Iraq Pending Determinations by \n     the President.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, of the amount appropriated by this title under the \n     heading ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund''--\n       (1) $6,770,000,000 shall be available 120 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, but only if the President \n     determines under subsection (b)(1) that the objectives and \n     associated deadlines referred to in that subsection have been \n     substantially met; and\n       (2) $6,770,000,000 shall be available 240 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, but only if the President \n     determines under subsection (b)(2) that the objectives and \n     associated deadlines referred to in that subsection have been \n     substantially met.\n       (b) Determinations.--(1) Not later than 120 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall \n     determine whether or not the objectives, and associated \n     deadlines, for relief and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, as \n     specified in the report under subsection (c), have been \n     substantially met.\n       (2) Not later than 240 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the President shall determine whether or not the \n     objectives, and associated deadlines, for relief and \n     reconstruction efforts in Iraq, as specified in the most \n     current report under subsection (d), have been substantially \n     met.\n       (c) Initial Report on Relief and Reconstruction.--Not later \n     than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall submit to Congress a report on the United \n     States strategy for activities related to post-conflict \n     security, humanitarian assistance, governance, and \n     reconstruction to be undertaken as a result of Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom. The report shall include information on the \n     following:\n       (1) The distribution of duties and responsibilities \n     regarding such activities among the agencies of the United \n     States Government, including the Department of State, the \n     United States Agency for International Development, and the \n     Department of Defense.\n       (2) A plan describing the roles and responsibilities of \n     foreign governments and international organizations, \n     including the United Nations, in carrying out such \n     activities.\n       (3) A strategy for coordinating such activities among the \n     United States Government, foreign governments, and \n     international organizations, including the United Nations.\n       (4) A strategy for distributing the responsibility for \n     paying costs associated with reconstruction activities in \n     Iraq among the United States Government, foreign governments, \n     and international organizations, including the United \n     Nations, and for actions to be taken by the President to \n     secure increased international participation in peacekeeping \n     and security efforts in Iraq.\n       (5) A comprehensive strategy for completing the \n     reconstruction of Iraq, estimated timelines for the \n     completion of significant reconstruction milestones, and \n     estimates for Iraqi oil production.\n       (d) Subsequent Reports on Relief and Reconstruction.--(1) \n     Not later than 60 days after the submittal of the report \n     required by subsection (c), and every 60 days thereafter \n     until all funds provided by this title are expended, the \n     President shall submit to Congress a report that includes \n     information as follows:\n       (A) A list of all activities undertaken related to \n     reconstruction in Iraq, and a corresponding list of the funds \n     obligated in connection with such activities, during the \n     preceding 60 days.\n       (B) A list of the significant activities related to \n     reconstruction in Iraq that the President anticipates \n     initiating during the ensuing 60-day period, including--\n       (i) the estimated cost of carrying out the proposed \n     activities; and\n       (ii) the source of the funds that will be used to pay such \n     costs.\n       (C) Updated strategies, objectives, and timelines if \n     significant changes are proposed regarding matters included \n     in the report required under subsection (c), or in any \n     previous report under this subsection.\n       (2) Each report under this subsection shall include \n     information on the following:\n       (A) The expenditures for, and progress made toward, the \n     restoration of basic services in Iraq such as water, \n     electricity, sewer, oil infrastructure, a national police \n     force, an Iraqi army, and judicial systems.\n       (B) The significant goals intended to be achieved by such \n     expenditures.\n       (C) The progress made toward securing increased \n     international participation in peacekeeping efforts and in \n     the economic and political reconstruction of Iraq.\n       (D) The progress made toward securing Iraqi borders.\n       (E) The progress made toward securing self-government for \n     the Iraqi people and the establishment of a democratically \n     elected government.\n       (F) The progress made in securing and eliminating munitions \n     caches, unexploded ordinance, and excess military equipment \n     in Iraq.\n       (G) The measures taken to protect United States troops \n     serving in Iraq, and an estimated schedule of United States \n     troop strengths in Iraq for each ensuing 120-day period.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I believe this amendment to this \nsupplemental would provide some additional transparency and oversight \nas to how the $20.3 billion in reconstruction funding is spent. The \namendment essentially releases the appropriation of the $20.3 billion \nin three tranches. These tranches are not fenced, but they are \nconditioned on the President presenting a reconstruction plan to \nCongress with specific goals and timetables, and reporting to Congress \non how that plan is being implemented.\n  The amendment began as a bipartisan amendment. Unfortunately, at this \nstage it is not, but it is cosponsored by Senators Murray, Durbin, \nJohnson, Clinton, and Boxer.\n  Specifically, the amendment would provide for the immediate release \nof one-third of the $20.3 billion for reconstruction in Iraq--that is \n$6.77 billion--with the President required to provide Congress with a \ncomprehensive plan for Iraqi reconstruction. The plan would include \ngoals and timetables for specific reconstruction activities.\n  Second, it would provide for the release of the remaining $13.54 \nbillion requested in two equal disbursements of $6.77 billion, the \nsecond tranche after 120 days--or 4 months--and the final after 240 \ndays. Both disbursements would be subject to a Presidential \ndetermination that the goals and timetables spelled out in these \ndetailed reports are being met.\n\n  Third, this would require that the President submit reports to \nCongress every 60 days about how the money is spent.\n  What is the purpose of this? This is a lot of money. The American \npublic are divided on whether we should spend $20 billion \nreconstructing Iraq or we should give it for deficit reduction or to \npriorities in this country. There is no plan. We do not know exactly \nhow this money is going to be spent.\n  What this amendment aims to do is provide a mechanism for both a \ncertification process by the President that the goals and timetables \nare being met and for regular reports to this Congress about how that \nis taking place. That does not seem to me to be too much to ask.\n\n[[Page S12597]]\n\n  In doing so, it also gives us the ability to review how the money is \nbeing spent, what costs are being incurred, who else is contributing, \nand what progress is being made in meeting important security, \npolitical, and economic reconstruction milestones. These are \nsignificant improvements.\n  It is hard for me to understand why the administration does not want \nthis to be done, why the administration expects to be given a blank \ncheck, and this body that is charged with the purse strings is not able \nto carry out diligent oversight.\n  There may be a significant disagreement among Members of the Senate \nabout the wisdom of a course of action which has led us to this point \nin Iraq. But now that the United States is in Iraq, it is clear to me \nwe must stay the course. We must rebuild the infrastructure. We must \nprevent civil war. We must see to it that Iraq does not become a base \nfor terror and instability throughout the region.\n  Indeed, from a national security perspective, I strongly believe the \nUnited States cannot turn tail and run. Instead, we must see to it that \na stable governmental structure and a viable economy, apart from \nSaddam's tyrannical dictatorship, can in fact be put in place. If the \nUnited States were to pull out without completing the job--which \nrejection of the supplemental would mean--I believe Iraq would \ninevitably see civil war and a return to the Baathist regime, perhaps \nheaded by someone as bad as or worse than Saddam Hussein. If the United \nStates were to cut and run, as we did in Lebanon, or more recently in \nSomalia, we would send precisely the wrong message to both our friends \nand our foes around the world.\n  For many, the challenges we now face in Iraq illustrate the \nshortcomings of a doctrine of unilateral preemption and preventive war \nto deal with an asymmetrical threat. When we use force against a state \nto seek regime change, we are left with the inescapable reality and \nrole that we have today, and that is nation building. There is no other \nway to put it. But once there, we must complete the task.\n  As much as I may wish we could structure this package as loans, that \nthere be greater international contributions to the reconstruction \neffort, that Iraqi oil could be quickly brought on line to underwrite \ncosts, that some of the funds earmarked to be spent in Iraq could be \nspent on domestic priorities instead, or that we pay for this \nsupplemental by deferring a large tax cut for Americans earning more \nthan $340,000 a year, thus far, all those options have been debated and \nvoted down in this body. I voted for all these amendments, both in \ncommittee and on the floor.\n  But today the United States has an inescapable responsibility in \nIraq. It is clear to me that now we are there, we must win the peace. \nHowever, we, as a Senate, also have a responsibility, to know what the \nplan is, to be able to buy into that plan, to understand the goals and \nthe timetables of this reconstruction effort, to know when a \nconstitution will be written, to know when a government can be turned \nover, and to understand what specific projects are going to be \nundertaken.\n  This amendment asks for nothing more than that. It is justified, I \nbelieve, because it does just that. I had five Republican sponsors. \nApparently they were weaned off by the White House. But this resolution \nwas carefully crafted not to create a problem for the administration \nbut to say, as a Senate, we have an absolute right to know the details, \nto know the timelines, to know the plans, and you, Mr. President, have \nan obligation to report to us on what they are and to certify that what \nyou say is actually happening. That is all this amendment does. It does \nnot fence funds. It does not require another vote by this body. But it \ndoes say, if we support you, you have an obligation to let us know what \nyou are doing, how you are doing it, and the timelines of completing \nthe mission. I don't think that is too much to ask.\n\n  Along with my prior cosponsors, before they dropped off, we worked \nhard on this. This was negotiated not to present an encumbrance but to \npresent a justifiable reporting requirement with certification by the \nPresident. The only thing was that the money would be released in three \nequal tranches 4 months apart.\n  I have a very hard time, unless people do not want to say what they \nare doing, as to why this amendment would not be acceptable to the \nother side of this aisle as well as to this side of this aisle. It is \nmy sincere hope that by some miracle we could get that concurrence.\n  The work we have yet to do in Iraq is consequential. How do we \nstabilize Iraq? It is a nation with a long and bloody history of tribal \nrivalries. It has known only despotism and tyranny. How do we plant the \nseeds of democracy? What is the timeline for that? This country has \nnever known democracy. How do we rebuild an economy shattered by years \nof neglect, repression, and war? I believe we can accomplish this job. \nIraq could well become a beacon of stability in this volatile area. But \nit is a tall order.\n  In conclusion, I believe the amendment is a well-thought-out approach \nthat gives Congress and the American people a more meaningful and \nsubstantive oversight role in the reconstruction of Iraq and it says to \nthis administration, we will work with you, we will stay the course, \nbut the American people must know where that course will lead us and \nhow we are going to get there. This amendment asks for no more and no \nless.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator respond to a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is it the Senator's intention that the money, one-third, \nbe available at the end of 120 days?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No; the first one-third right away; the second third \n4 months later; the third third in another 4 months. At 120, 240 days.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I state for the information of Senators, we will make \nsome agreements concerning time for the vote to take place tomorrow on \nthe Senator's amendment.\n  I will oppose the amendment. It is an amendment that would limit the \ndiscretion and use of these funds. These funds are designed to as \nquickly as possible bring about the reconstruction of Iraq and the \ntraining of Iraqis to take over their own affairs, to defend \nthemselves, to provide their own security, provide their own water, \nprovide their own electricity, run their own schools--a whole series of \nthings to have this money available, as the Senator says, in the \ntranches. We can do so much for 120 days. You have to wait for another \n120 days before you can have the next money, and another 120 days for \nthe next money.\n\n  Now, when you look at that, what it really means is you are going to \nhave to decide we are going to be there for at least a year just doing \nwhat is designed in this process to be an upfront program to move \nquickly as possible to turn this government back to them.\n  I think that is a restriction on the use of these funds that would \nhamper the ability of Ambassador Bremer and General Abizaid to carry \nout their instructions they have already received from the Congress and \nthe instructions that are generally contained in this bill.\n  It is my intention to speak further on the amendment tomorrow, but \njust so there would be no question about it, I will oppose the \nSenator's amendment and urge that it be defeated. It remains to be seen \nwhether I will ask to table the amendment or to just have a vote on it. \nWe will determine that tomorrow.\n  But I do thank the Senator for her response to my question, and I \nyield the floor on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe the yeas and nays were \ngranted, so there will be a vote; is that not correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There will be a vote, but we will confer with the \nSenator when that vote will occur sometime tomorrow. Last-vote notices \nhave gone out for tonight.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make one further point, just to debate \nthis.\n\n[[Page S12598]]\n\nThere are many of us who believe the very size of the supplemental \nmeans we are going to be in Iraq for a substantial period of time, and, \nmost probably, the supplemental is meant to run through the election. \nThat is the inescapable real life that we live.\n  So we look at this effort as one that is a joint effort between the \nWhite House and this Senate and this House in the sense that we are \nprepared to stay the course provided you share with us what the plan \nis, what the goals are, what the timetables for achieving the mission, \nin effect, are.\n  It is hard for me to understand how more than $6 billion could be \nused in a 4-month period. So nothing is held up. It is three equal \ntranches. I have a hard time, with what I do know about it, envisioning \nmore than $6 billion being spent in a 4-month period.\n  So I do not believe this amendment is any kind of an encumbrance on \nthe administration at all. It is simply a request for oversight, which \nI believe is our constitutional duty.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1858\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1858.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To set aside from certain amounts available for the Iraq \n Relief and Reconstruction Fund, $10,000,000 for the Family Readiness \n                     Program of the National Guard)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n       Sec. 2313. Of the amounts appropriated by chapter 2 of this \n     title under the heading ``OTHER BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE \n     FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT'' under the heading \n     ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund'', other than amounts \n     available under such heading for security (including public \n     safety requirements, national security, and justice), \n     $10,000,000 shall be available only for the Family Readiness \n     Program of the National Guard.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as many of our colleagues are \naware, the National Guard has undergone a difficult year with their \nrapid mobilization and deployment to Iraq and a redeployment date that \ncontinues to slip. This has happened to the National Guard in State \nafter State. It has particularly happened with regard to Florida. \nFlorida was actually mobilized the day after Christmas. They went into \nthe armories and started packing their gear. Many, of course, thought \nit was going to be a very short war, as it was. The military conflict \nwas successfully prosecuted by General Tommy Franks. But all of them \nwere clearly understanding there was the likely possibility they were \ngoing to be gone for a year. What they did not expect, with the \noccupation having been as difficult as it has, was that they were going \nto be extended, in some cases, up to 16, 17, and perhaps even 18 months \nfrom when they first came in to start packing up at the armory of their \nNational Guard unit.\n\n  In State after State, these National Guard units have been so \neffectively trained and, given the adequate and up-to-date equipment in \nthe field, they have performed so admirably. That is clearly the case \nwith the 124th Infantry, which consists of three battalions from \nFlorida. They are so good, they want to continue to keep them. That is \nlike a double-edged sword. Our Guard is so good, and yet they have \nfamilies, they have employers, and they are making a financial \nsacrifice. They are prepared to do that. Now that we are offering these \nsupplemental appropriations for Iraq, there is something we can do.\n  It is my hope we are going to get to the point that the managers will \naccept this amendment. I have offered this amendment. I may not have to \ncall for a vote because I think it might be accepted.\n  This amendment provides $10 million for the Family Readiness Program. \nRight now that program does not have any funding. This program for the \nNational Guard has 396 family assistance centers around the United \nStates. These assistance centers are the primary point of assistance to \nthe families on items such as unit information--this is the National \nGuard; this is not the regular Army--on referral to medical, financial, \nsocial services, and counseling for the families.\n  Why do families need this assistance? Because often those families \nare suffering financial hardship. Their loved one as a civilian was \nearning a certain salary, and when they go on active duty, they are \nearning, in many cases, a much lower salary. Or, goodness gracious, \nlet's not hope they are self-employed and that business is not being \ntended to while they are being extended. They all understood the \nsacrifice they were going to make, and they were willing to make that \nsacrifice because they are loyal citizens ready to fight for the \ninterests of their country.\n  The simple fact is, they need some assistance through these family \nassistance centers, and there is no funding set aside for this critical \ntask.\n  Out of the $15 billion--not the $20 billion because $5 billion of \nthat is going to assist in building up an Iraqi security and police \nforce--but out of the remaining $15 billion of the $87 billion \nsupplemental appropriations, that is going to reconstruction, the \ninfrastructure needs in Iraq, I respectfully suggest to our colleagues \nthat we need to put some money into these family assistance centers \nthrough the Family Readiness Program of the National Guard.\n  In August and just recently during the last recess when I was home, I \nended up having 25 town hall meetings. I met with innumerable families. \nI am telling you, the support from these family assistance centers is \noften their Rock of Gibraltar, where they get information, where they \nshare with each other, where, if they are in financial distress, they \ncan get counseling, and if the financial distress leads to medical \nproblems, they can get the right medical referrals. This is the least \nwe can do for our people whose loved ones back home are often taking \nthe brunt.\n  Today I seek support for those soldiers in the National Guard who \nhave supported our mission in Iraq so bravely and are serving far from \nhome and their loved ones.\n  I will stop my comments right there. I could go on. Does the manager \nof the bill have any questions for me? I will be happy to respond. I \nyield to the manager, the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. The Senator from Florida has explained his amendment very \nwell. I have no questions.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Then, Mr. President, I yield the floor and, at \nthe appropriate time, I will call for the vote, unless it is the \npleasure of the managers of the bill that they want to accept the \namendment as part of a package.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1859\n\n  Mr. REID. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator \nLandrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Ms. Landrieu, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1859.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S12599]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To promote the establishment of an Iraq Reconstruction \n    Finance Authority and the use of Iraqi oil revenues to pay for \n                        reconstruction in Iraq)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. 2313. (a) The President shall direct the head of the \n     Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, in coordination with \n     the Governing Council of Iraq or a successor governing \n     authority in Iraq, to establish an Iraq Reconstruction \n     Finance Authority. The purpose of the Iraq Reconstruction \n     Finance Authority shall be to obtain financing for the \n     reconstruction of the infrastructure in Iraq by \n     collateralizing the revenue from future sales of oil \n     extracted in Iraq. The Iraq Reconstruction Finance Authority \n     shall obtain financing for the reconstruction of the \n     infrastructure in Iraq through--\n       (1)(A) issuing securities or other financial instruments; \n     or\n       (B) obtaining loans on the open market from private banks \n     or international financial institutions; and\n       (2) to the maximum extent possible, securitizing or \n     collateralizing such securities, instruments, or loans with \n     the revenue from the future sales of oil extracted in Iraq.\n       (b) It is the policy of the United States that payment of \n     the cost of reconstruction in Iraq, other than payment made \n     with funds made available in this title under the subheading \n     ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund'' under the heading \n     ``OTHER BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO \n     THE PRESIDENT'' or made available by a foreign country or an \n     appropriate international organization, should be the \n     responsibility of the Iraq Reconstruction Finance Authority.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the amendment establishes the Iraq \nReconstruction Finance Authority. The amendment states the United \nStates will not commit further grants toward Iraq's reconstruction \nbeyond the $20.3 billion requested by the President. Any further \nmonetary commitments by the United States should be secured through the \nIraq Reconstruction Finance Authority using Iraq's revenues from oil \nproduction. This amendment does not cut the $20.3 billion requested by \nPresident Bush.\n  There can be no doubt that America must participate in Iraq's \nreconstruction. However, direct grants are not the only means of \nproviding reconstruction dollars.\n  RAND reports that U.S. post-war reconstruction efforts in seven \nconflicts since World War II have averaged 7 years in duration. We must \ndevelop a sustainable means of financing Iraq's reconstruction. The \nAmerican people will not support giving money to Iraq for 7 years when \nIraq possesses well over 112 billion barrels of oil, valued at least \n$2.5 trillion at $22 a barrel, that could be used to finance Iraq's \nreconstruction. RAND and the World Bank report Iraq's reconstruction \nwill cost at least another $36 billion. The Institute of International \nFinance says the price tag will hit $75 billion. Ambassador Bremer \ntestified before the Appropriations Committee that the administration \nwill ask for little or no money next year for Iraq's reconstruction, \nyet non-partisan studies indicate more funding will be necessary.\n  Conservative estimates say Iraq has 112 billion barrels of oil in its \nreserve, with possibly the same amount undiscovered. Conservative \nestimates say Iraq will generate $28 billion in oil revenues in 2004, \n3.5 million barrels at $22 a barrel. Oil closed at $32 a barrel last \nnight. Iraq is capable of generating billions in revenue each year so \nthat Iraq can be a partner with the United States and the international \ncommunity in its own reconstruction.\n  What worked in the Marshall plan should work in Iraq's \nreconstruction. Germany's vast coal resources were pledged to secure \nthe matching requirements of the U.S. Government contained in the \nMarshall plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12599-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, the Commonwealth of Kentucky lost one of \nits greatest statesman on October 14, 2003. Former Gov. Ned Breathitt \nleft us last night and is on his way to a better place.\n  Governor Breathitt left a great imprint on Kentucky's history and his \nbloodline ran deep in Kentucky's heritage. There is even a Breathitt \nCounty which is named after his distant uncle who was also a Governor \nof Kentucky.\n  Kentuckians elected Ned Breathitt as their Governor in 1963. He \nserved until 1967 with great leadership and accomplishment. The 1960s \nwere somewhat and sometimes tumultuous for the South. Governor \nBreathitt's progressive politics and compassion for all enabled him to \nbe one of the true civil rights leaders in Kentucky. With conviction \nand purpose, he fought racial discrimination and ushered in a lasting \nequality for Kentuckians.\n   Governor Breathitt also worked tirelessly to help improve our \nschools and education system in Kentucky. He truly believed that \nKentucky's pride and best assets were its citizens. This led him to \ncreate and implement the community college system under the University \nof Kentucky, and to this day it is one of the best systems around. \nBesides wanting to ensure Kentuckians a strong education, he also was \ndeeply concerned about their health and environment. This led him to \nhelp strengthen our conversation and environmental laws, and ensuring \nthat our pristine treasures and waters were protected and preserved for \ngenerations to come.\n   But aside from him being my Governor, he was also my friend. Whan I \nfirst arrived in Congress in 1987, Ned and his wife Lucy were living in \nWashington, DC. They welcomed my wife Mary and me with open arms. We \nwere newcomers to the area and Ned and Lucy had moved out a few years \nbefore we did. We became good friends. We played bridge together, dined \nout and socialized together. We all laughed a lot. Mary and I enjoyed \ntheir company so much.\n  Our prayers and thoughts go out to Lucy and her family. We all know \nit is\n\n[[Page S12600]]\n\ndifficult to lose a loved one. But Lucy is strong. I know she is left \nwith the comfort that Ned is in a better place, that his life was \nextraordinary in the way it touched others, and that he loved her and \ntheir family and Kentucky so dearly. Ned Breathitt was as good as they \ncome. He was Kentucky at its best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12600-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's attention to \nthe ongoing crisis in Zimbabwe. For years now, the Government of \nZimbabwe, led by President Robert Mugabe, has pursued policies \ncharacterized by repression, brutality, corruption and mismanagement. \nThe costs to the people of Zimbabwe have been terribly steep. Alongside \nintimidation and repression, Zimbabweans must contend with the economic \nconsequences of this disaster. According to The Economist magazine, the \ncountry's GDP has shrunk by a third in the past 3 years; inflation has \nsurged over 420 percent and 70 percent of the population lives in \npoverty. A country that should be an engine of growth in the region has \ninstead become an anchor, dragging down the prospects for increased \ninvestment and prosperity. A people that should have been able to unite \nand focus their energies on fighting the AIDS pandemic that threatens \ntheir society is instead coping with the systematic destruction of the \nrule of law within their borders.\n  Mugabe's government would like the world to believe that it is \npursuing a policy of defiance, charting an independent course, and \nrefusing to be bullied by westerners. But this is a smokescreen, a \ndistraction from the fact that when voters are intimidated, it is not \nthe West that is defied, it is the will of the Zimbabwean people. When \njournalists are tortured and independent media outlets--most recently \nthe popular Daily News--shut down, the bully is not the West, it is the \nGovernment of Zimbabwe. There is nothing heroic or revolutionary about \nthe policies pursued by Mugabe's government. Sadly, they are taken from \nthe familiar playbook used for decades by self-serving, dictatorial \ngovernments around the world.\n  Secretary of State Powell was right to call on African leaders, and \nespecially South African President Thabo Mbeki, to take a stronger \nposition on the crisis and to re-energize their efforts to help resolve \nit. Make no mistake, these leaders are not indifferent to the problem. \nThey are coping with waves of Zimbabwean migrants fleeing persecution \nand the hopelessness of complete economic collapse. They are struggling \nagainst the downward force of the economic maelstrom across their \nborders. But quiet diplomacy is not working, and Zimbabweans continue \nto suffer. I urge African leaders to tell it like it is, and to express \ntheir solidarity with the Zimbabwean people, not the disgraced and \ncorrupt Zimbabwean Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12600-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AGRICULTURAL CONCENTRATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, increased consolidation and market \nconcentration are, without question, prevalent concerns throughout the \nNation. In particular, I am deeply disappointed to learn that the pork \ndivision of Farmland Foods has been sold to Smithfield Foods in a \nbankruptcy auction. Acquisition of Farmland Foods by either of the \nauction's bidders, Smithfield Foods and Cargill, has significant \npotential to lessen competition, harming both farmers and consumers. In \nthis and many other cases, the Department of Justice has looked the \nother way in enforcing antitrust law, failing to maintain competitive \nmarkets.\n  As I travel around my home State of Wisconsin, agricultural \nconcentration is raised by farmers and growers on a consistent basis. I \nam greatly concerned that industry trends toward consolidation and \nconcentration are causing great disruption, and sometimes ruin, for our \nNation's small- and medium-sized producers. It is my understanding that \nthis acquisition would give Smithfield control of a significant portion \nof the pork processing industry in the U.S. market access for small and \nindependent pork producers is already inadequate, and this merger will \nonly exacerbate the problems of discrimination, a lack of negotiating \npower, and the low prices that farmers face.\n  While this acquisition would reduce competition among purchasers of \nlive hogs, I am also concerned about the lack of benefit to consumers. \nAt the other end of the food marketing chain, consumers are not seeing \nany decreases in the price they pay at the grocery store for these \nproducts. Having fewer competitors providing pork products to American \nconsumers is unlikely to result in lower prices in the supermarket.\n  I am disappointed that the Department of Justice did not choose to \nenforce antitrust laws regarding the acquisition of Farmland Foods by \neither Cargill or Smithfield Foods. The lack of action by the \nDepartment does a disservice to the hard working men and women in the \nagricultural industry and only functions to increase the mounting \nobstacles to garner a fair price for their product.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12600-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Okinawa, \nJapan. On October 27, 1992, Terry Helvey brutally murdered Navy Seaman \nAllen R. Schindler, Jr., his ship mate. Helvey beat and stomped \nSchindler to death because Schindler was gay. Helvey's attack was so \nvicious that he destroyed every organ in Schindler's body. Schindler \nwas so badly beaten that he could hardly be identified afterward. \nSchindler's mother, Dorothy Hajdys-Holman, could only identify her son \nby the remains of a tattoo on his arm. The medical examiner compared \nSchindler's injuries to those sustained by victims of fatal airplane \ncrashes.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12600-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12600-S12601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A TRAGEDY IN GAZA\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, this morning, we awoke to the tragic news \nof what happened to the convoy of United States personnel traveling in \nGaza. My condolences go out to their families, loved ones and \ncolleagues.\n  These brave Americans were accompanying United States diplomats going \nto interview young Palestinians for the opportunity to study in this \ngreat country on Fulbright scholarships--offering them a chance for a \nbetter life. These fallen men were the 48th through 51st American \nvictims of Palestinian Arab terrorism since the signing of the Oslo \naccords in 1993 alone.\n  Several of my colleagues have made mention of the fact today that \nSaddam Hussein rewarded terrorists who carried out suicide bombings in \nIsrael. We must not forget that dozens of Americans were among their \nvictims, and that many who planned and orchestrated these horrific acts \nremain at large today.\n  The deplorable attack on the U.S. convoy sickens me. but it does not \nsurprise me. It should have not been allowed to come to this. For far \ntoo long, the State Department has done little to bring the murderers \nof Americans in certain regions and incidents to justice.\n  For the other 48 Americans, the wheels of justice have been virtually \nnon-existent. This is because every step of an investigation abroad \nmust be cleared by and coordinated with the Department of State. For \ntoo many years, and for too many American families, adequate consent \nand opportunity to pursue has simply not been forthcoming due to \n``diplomatic'' considerations.\n  This is wrong. The families who have lost loved ones should not have \ntheir grief compounded by a lack of justice from our own system. The \nvirtual impunity afforded certain terrorists sends the wrong foreign \npolicy signal to\n\n[[Page S12601]]\n\nwould-be terrorists around the globe. If we are indeed engaged in a \nglobal war on terrorism, then why is justice not pursued to its fullest \nextent when the terrorists are Palestinian or citizens of countries, \nsuch as Indonesia or Yemen, with which we are keen to maintain good \nrelations?\n  We must send the message that we, as a country, are no less than 100 \npercent committed in our resolve to investigate and prosecute the \nmurder of innocent Americans abroad, whether they be high-level \ndiplomats, school teachers on a picnic, or children whose lives are cut \nshort.\n  We have sent precisely the wrong message to would-be terrorists in \ncertain regions of the world for far too long. This culminated in \ntoday's tragic events in Gaza. The State Department obviously maintains \nconsiderable influence in the investigation of the cases of official \nand non-official Americans who have been killed abroad.\n  But the pursuit of justice should not primarily be an issue of \ndiplomacy, but of justice. The return address for this entire issue of \nAmericans who have been killed by terrorists abroad simply belongs in \nthe Justice Department.\n  That is why I call upon you today to join me and almost two dozen \nother Senators in cosponsoring the Koby Mandell Act of 2003. The act \ncalls for transferring the lead responsibility for the investigation \nand prosecution of terrorists who have killed Americans abroad into is \nrightful destination, the Department of Justice.\n  I urge you to cosponsor S. 684, the Koby Mandell Act of 2003, and to \nsend a message to terrorists that we have their number, and that one \nday, hopefully sooner than later, their number will be up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12601-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CELEBRATING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \ncontributions of Hispanic Americans to New Mexico and our country. I \nwould like to focus my remarks today particularly on the representation \nof Hispanic Americans in the Federal judiciary.\n  Hispanics are currently dramatically underrepresented in our Nation's \njudiciary, making up only 3.8 percent of Federal judges while \ncomprising 14 percent of our country's population. New Mexico leads the \nNation with the highest Hispanic population percentage of any State, \nnearly 43 percent. As New Mexico's senior Senator, I am proud to have \nplayed a strong role in recommending Hispanic nominees for the Federal \nbench, and am even prouder that these recommendations have been \naccepted. Soon, three of the seven judges serving on U.S. District \nCourt for the District of New Mexico will be Hispanic. Of the last five \nnominations made by President Bush to this court, all based on my \nrecommendations, two were Hispanic women: Judge Christina Armijo, \nconfirmed in November 2001, and Judith Herrera, nominated last month.\n  Judge Armijo, formerly a judge on the New Mexico Court of Appeals, \nbrings a great deal of judicial experience and a history of public \nservice to the Federal bench in New Mexico. A 1975 graduate of the UNM \nSchool of Law, she was an attorney and public defender before joining \nthe Court of Appeals.\n  Ms. Herrera, a distinguished attorney from Santa Fe, has experience \nin the public sector as a University of New Mexico regent from 1999 to \n2003, a Santa Fe City Councilor from 1981 to 1986, and as an assistant \ndistrict attorney. She has been an attorney with the Herrera, Long, \nPound & Komer firm in Santa Fe since 1987. She was a member of the New \nMexico Economic Development Commission from 1998 to 2000, and is a \ncurrent member of the Federal Magistrate Merit Selection Commission. \nShe also served as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of St. Vincent \nHospital from 1991 to 2000. I know that she will serve her country \nwell, and that her appointment is a step in the right direction to \nensure that New Mexico's Federal bench better reflects the composition \nof our population. I have great hope that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and then the full Senate will confirm her expeditiously.\n  While New Mexico's Federal courts present a stronger-than-average \npicture of Hispanic representation, there is another story with a more \ndismal ending in the case of Miguel Estrada, who if confirmed, would \nhave been the first Hispanic judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. \nIt was a sad day for our Federal judiciary and for Hispanic Americans \nwhen Mr. Estrada decided to withdraw his nomination after Senate \nDemocrats prevented an up-or-down vote, despite seven attempts by \nRepublican leadership to end debate. I am still outraged that a purely \npartisan filibuster prevented this well-qualified Hispanic American \nfrom serving his country on the Federal bench.\n  At this time when we seek to honor Hispanic heritage, I invite my \nSenate colleagues to send the right message to all those who aspire to \npublic service or seek to achieve their goals in this country: through \nhard work, honesty, and integrity, it is possible to overcome any \nbarrier and succeed on your own merit. To me, this means giving \nqualified nominees a fair chance to succeed. I appreciate the qualified \nHispanic Americans leading the way through their service on the Federal \nbench in New Mexico, and look forward to greater representation of \nHispanics throughout the Federal judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12601-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING TED KOCH OF BOISE, ID\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I give a well-deserved ``thank you'' to a \nmember of my staff who recently left the U.S. Senate. Ted Koch was with \nme a short time as a congressional fellow on leave from U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service, and has since returned to Idaho. During this \nexperience here, I benefited from his expertise and abilities, and \nwanted to let him know how much I have appreciated his contributions.\n  Ted stepped into the breach upon the departure of my staff director \nat the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Fisheries, \nWildlife, and Water. He filled the role expertly and with great \nenthusiasm. I appreciate that Ted aspires to principles embodied by \nanother ``Ted,'' President Theodore Roosevelt. He deeply enjoys and \nunderstands the ecology of hunting and fishing. He strives to make \nprogress. Ted and I both believe that the best hope for people and \nwildlife in Idaho is to defend property rights. With greater certainty \nabout the inherent value of property, landowners have the confidence \nand freedom to advance their own ideas for conservation. These \nqualities and beliefs make Ted a valuable spokesman for intelligent \nconversation in Idaho. He has made himself a friend of Idaho through \nhis friendships in the State and here in Washington. I appreciate his \ninvaluable participation on my staff, and wish him well in future \nendeavors. I have no doubt about his continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12601-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING DENNIS HERTEL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I call the Senate's attention to my \nextraordinary constituent, Phyllis Bader, who is celebrating her 90th \nbirthday today in California with her children, grandchildren, and \ngreat-grandchildren.\n  Though she might take the day off, Phyllis is not resting on her \nlaurels. At an age when most of us might be at least thinking of \nslowing down, she is\n\n[[Page S12602]]\n\nstill going strong, still working, and still doing good work to benefit \nher community.\n  For the past two decades, Phyllis Bader has served as a volunteer and \nemployee at The Shop, a nonprofit thrift store operated by the Junior \nLeague of Palo Alto--Mid Peninsula. Proceeds from sales at The Shop are \nused to fund the League's charitable and educational projects in the \ncommunity.\n  Shortly after Phyllis moved to California to be near her family, she \njoined The Shop team as a volunteer at the suggestion of her daughter, \nJunior League supporter Lorinda Reichert. When The Shop moved to Menlo \nPark, the League asked Phyllis to join the staff. She has been there \never since, taking good care of customers and encouraging donations of \nsale items.\n  Noting that her work with the public has contributed to her longevity \nand good health, Phyllis has ``never given a thought to retiring.'' She \nsays that ``It's important for old people to be around young people; \nthey keep you on your toes.''\n  Asked what lessons she has learned in 90 years, Phyllis Bader advises \nus to ``Keep a positive attitude. Laugh at yourself. Don't be too \nsensitive about what people say. Be tolerant of others' ideas. Try to \nlift someone's spirits each day. Find something every day to be \ngrateful for.''\n  We would all do well to heed Phyllis Bader's advice. I thank her for \nher wisdom and her service to the community, and I send her my very \nbest wishes on her 90th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12602-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY'S CHICAGO WOMEN'S BOARD\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize the \n50th anniversary of the Chicago Women's Board of the American Cancer \nSociety's Illinois Division.\n  Since its inception, in 1913, the American Cancer Society has been \nwidely regarded as one of our Nation's leaders in public health. Even \nas the ACS expanded to become a nationwide community-based volunteer, \nhealth organization, they have remain dedicated to eliminating cancer \nas a major health problem by preventing cancer, saving lives and \ndiminishing suffering from this disease through research, education, \nadvocacy, and service.\n  Founded in 1953, the Women's Board of the American Cancer Society has \nserved as dedicated volunteers in the fight against cancer. In the \nbeginning, the original members worked diligently canvassing \nneighborhoods, knocking on doors, requesting donations while also \ndelivering important cancer information.\n  Today, the board raises over $250,000 each year through their \nsignature fundraising event, the Spring Fashion Show and Luncheon. They \nhave also expanded their fundraising efforts to include pediatric \ncancer patients through their annual American Girl Fashion Show. \nThrough their Teen-In-Training program, a commitment has been made by \nthe Chicago Women's Board to share their knowledge and experience to \nenable young girls and women to become aware of cancer issues, \nphilanthropy, and service, paving the way for another 50 years of \ndedicated service.\n  The American Cancer Society has set important nationwide goals for \nthe year 2015: to reduce cancer incidence rates by 25 percent, to \nreduce cancer mortality rates by 50 percent, and to improve the overall \nquality of life for cancer patients.\n  Clearly, the Women's Board is critical to achieving these goals, and \nit is for these reasons that I proudly stand here today, congratulating \nthe Chicago Women's Board on its 50th anniversary. I know my fellow \nSenators will join me in applauding them for their dedication, and I \nextend my best wishes for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12602-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF JOHN BAILEY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of an \noutstanding public servant and a dear friend, John Michael Bailey, who \npassed away on September 23 at the age of 59.\n  My friendship with Jack Bailey was long and deep. Our families were \nclose friends, and we knew each other as children. We ran against each \nother for Congress in 1974, and I will always remember his civility \nduring that campaign. We stayed friends during the campaign, and we \nremained close until his untimely passing.\n  Jack served as the chief State's attorney in Connecticut for 9 \nyears--the longest tenure of anyone to hold that office. With his \ncigars, dark suits, and slicked-back hair, he outwardly resembled a \nfigure out of a Hollywood crime drama. But his success as a lawyer, and \nhis integrity as a human being, were no fictions.\n  He spent 27 years as a criminal prosecutor, and his tireless work \nearned him the respect of political leaders in both parties. He was \ntough on crime, but also fair. He was truly a pioneer in law \nenforcement in Connecticut, leading the fight to get violent offenders \noff the streets and to crack down on the abuse of senior citizens. A \nnumber of his initiatives and methods have been adopted by law \nenforcement officials across America.\n  Jack Bailey's influence in Connecticut will be felt for years to \ncome. Not only did he set up units and institutions that will serve as \nhis legacy; he also was a mentor to many of the younger attorneys and \nofficers who are now the new faces of law enforcement in our state.\n  But for his debilitating illness, Jack Bailey would still be serving \nthe people of Connecticut. As his sister, former Congresswoman Barbara \nKennelly, said, ``He thought he had the best job in the world.'' He \nstayed in his office as long as he could taking two medical leaves of \nabsence--before finally resigning a year ago. The only thing that kept \nJack from his job was a terrible disease that has no cure.\n  I join all of Connecticut's citizens in expressing my deep gratitude \nto Jack for spending so many years making our lives safer, and better. \nHe served us with dignity, class, and great honor.\n  My deepest sympathies go out to Jack's wife Dee, to his sons John and \nBrian, and to all who knew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12602-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12602-S12603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. BILL SHIPP\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nrecently announced decision of Dr. Bill Shipp to retire as president \nand laboratory director of the Idaho National Engineering and \nEnvironmental Laboratory, INEEL. After over 4 years as laboratory \ndirector and 3 years as president of Bechtel BWXT Idaho, the company \nthat manages and operates the INEEL for the U.S. Department of Energy, \nDr. Shipp is retiring to pursue other endeavors. Knowing him as I do, \nhunting and fishing will be high on the list of ``other endeavors.''\n  Dr. Shipp came to Idaho as part of the Bechtel team that won the \ncontract to manage the INEEL in 1999. He had previously served with \ndistinction as an associate lab director of the Pacific Northwest \nNational Laboratory.\n  His years at the INEEL have been filled with accomplishment, \nleadership, and an ability to adapt to ever-changing circumstances. \nUnder his leadership, the INEEL met critical cleanup milestones to \ncleanup the site and ship waste out of Idaho. The leadership he has \nprovided at the INEEL has resulted in the growth of both the funding \nand respect for the INEEL's research and development capabilities. \nWithin the Department of Energy's National Laboratory network he is \nrespected by his peers.\n  In 1999, Idaho Governor Dirk Kempthorne named Dr. Shipp as Idaho's \nfirst Science and Technology Advisor to the Governor. In that capacity, \nhe made important recommendations to the State and the Governor \nregarding the Idaho education system.\n  Dr. Shipp's record of leadership and accomplishment was recognized by \nPurdue University when it named him one of the institution's \ndistinguished alumni in 2002. He returned to West Lafayette, IN, to \nreceive that award, and I know that was a special moment for Dr. Shipp, \nhis wife Linda and their children, Jennifer and John.\n  I enjoyed meeting with Dr. Shipp when he has come by my office to \nupdate me on how things are going at the INEEL. During these meetings, \none of us would ask if the other had been hunting. As I think back, I \nrealize lab directors get to hunt more than Senators, but what I \nremember most is Dr. Shipp and I always made plans to hunt\n\n[[Page S12603]]\n\nquail together at a mutual friend's ranch. One season, our plans were \ncancelled because he broke his leg while hunting. I am sorry we never \ndid go quail hunting together, but I want him to know the offer still \nstands.\n  Within the DOE system, laboratory directors serve as stewards of \nnational assets. These are difficult jobs where mistakes are not \ntolerated and success is expected. Within these demanding constraints, \nDr. Shipp set the standard for performance and accomplishment with a \ncommitment to safety and people. More than that, Bill Shipp is a man \nwho others look to for guidance and support. I am pleased to call Bill \nShipp a friend and I want to say thank you for your service to Idaho, \nthe DOE and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12603-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12603-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12603-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12603-S12607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-4662.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish \na rural water supply program in the Reclamation States to provide a \nclean, safe, affordable, and reliable water supply to rural residents; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that is \ncritical to rural America and long overdue. My bill would help to \nensure that our rural communities continue to thrive and flourish by \nguaranteeing a safe, reliable water supply.\n  There is no comprehensive program in existence that rural communities \ncan tap into to meet increasing demands for rural water infrastructure. \nMy bill will remedy this problem by creating such a program within the \nDepartment of the Interior, specifically in the Bureau of Reclamation. \nMy bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to undertake a \ncompetitive program to plan, design, and construct rural water supply \nprojects in conjunction with non-Federal local entities.\n  To date, there is no Federal program specifically in place with the \npurpose of meeting the rural water needs of communities and tribes. As \na result, we either offer piece meal help through EPA grants or \ncommunities turn to other programs that were originally designed for \nother purposes.\n  In the State of New Mexico alone, there are numerous projects that \nwould benefit from a program such as the one I propose in this bill. \nLet me just share one example with you--the community of Chimayo, NM. \nChimayo is in northern New Mexico tucked in the foothills of the \nbeautiful Sangre de Christo Mountains. This historic and picturesque \ncommunity is over 400 years old. Today, the small community of less \nthan 3000 people is forced to haul water because they lack adequate \ninfrastructure to service their homes. I know that other States in the \nwest have communities with similar needs.\n  My bill requires the Secretary to look at whether or not a community \nhas an urgent and compelling need, whether construction of a rural \nwater system would help alleviate future water supply shortages, \nwhether it would help improve health of water quality to name just a \nfew. Additionally, my bill is based on the communities capability to \npay. Again, I will speak about New Mexico where many of these \ncommunities are among the poorest. Yet, I don't believe that should \npreclude them from the most basic resource--a safe and reliable \ndrinking water supply.\n  I know that many are aware of the on-going drought conditions in the \nwest. Our best experts have predicted that this will only get worse. \nMany of America's rural communities are being hit the hardest by these \nworsening drought conditions. I believe my bill goes a long way in \nhelping these already struggling communities. This issue is of such \nhuge importance to me, that I intend to ask Senator Murkowski to hold a \nWater and Power Subcommittee hearing on this bill as early as next \nweek. We have critical needs that need to be addressed and I urge my \nfellow Senators to help ensure that we can indeed meet them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1732\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to \nStates to develop and implement State court interpreter programs; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the State Court \nInterpreters Grant Program Act of 2003. This bill would create a modest \nFederal grant program to support the State court interpreter services. \nCurrently, court interpreting services vary greatly by State--some \nStates have highly developed programs, others are trying to get \nprograms running but lack adequate funds, and still others have no \nprogram at all. This inconsistency creates the potential for poorly\n\n[[Page S12611]]\n\ntranslated court proceedings, or court proceedings that are not \ntranslated at all. It is critical that we protect the constitutional \nright to a fair trial by funding State court interpreter programs.\n  According to the 2000 Census, 18 percent of the population over age \nfive speaks a language other than English at home. As these individuals \nwith limited English proficiency come into the court system to seek \nredress or to defend themselves against allegations of civil or \ncriminal wrongdoing, it is critical to the fair administration of \njustice that they be able to understand their court proceedings.\n  At the Federal level, court interpreting services are provided as \nneeded by trained and certified interpreters. Similarly, some States \nhave robust and effective court interpreter programs in their State \ncourts. These States recruit, train, test and certify individuals in \nall necessary languages. However, many States have limited programs \nwhich may test and certify interpreters for only one language. Such \nStates may have only a small number of interpreters certified to \ninterpret courtroom proceedings. Still other States have no program at \nall. We have heard horror stories of ``amateur'' interpreters \nattempting to translate courtroom events. For example, the Philadelphia \nInquirer reports: ``In one juvenile court, a juvenile defendant had to \ninterpret for his parents. In a Monroe County [Pennsylvania] court, a \nmember of an anti-domestic violence group was asked to interpret for an \nalleged victim, despite having a clear bias.''\n  The skills required of a court interpreter differ significantly from \nthose required of other interpreters or translators. Legal English is a \nhighly particularized area of the language, and requires special \ntraining. Although anyone with fluency in a foreign language could \nattempt to translate a court proceeding, the best interpreters are \nthose that have been tested and certified as official court \ninterpreters.\n  A lack of qualified interpreters can create serious problems in the \njustice system. For example, a poorly interpreted trial may be appealed \non the grounds that justice was not administered fairly. Those appeals \nclog up the courts. In addition, where there are inadequate resources \navailable, interpreters may not be able to keep up with the caseload \nand trials may be delayed unreasonably and in violation of a \ndefendant's right to a speedy trial.\n  This is not just a State issue. First and foremost, the right to a \nfair trial is a federally protected right under the Constitution. The \nFederal Government therefore has a role to play in ensuring that State \ncourts are holding fair trials. In addition, State budget crises have \nreduced the ability of the courts to pay for interpreter services. At \nthe same time, requests for interpreter services have skyrocketed over \nthe past several years all around the country. Although Spanish is by \nfar the most requested language to be translated in courtrooms, court \nofficials report regular or occasional need for Russian, German, \nFrench, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, Vietnamese, \nAfghani, Armenian, Punjabi, Hindi, Arabic, Somali, Polish and many \nother languages. The coincidence of budget cuts and increased demand \nthreatens federally-guaranteed due process and justifies Federal \nassistance.\n  This legislation addresses this problem by authorizing $15 million \nfor each of the next five fiscal years for a grant program to the \nStates. Those States that apply would be eligible for a $100,000 base \ngrant allotment. In addition, $5 million would be set aside for States \nthat demonstrate extraordinary need. The remainder of the money would \nbe distributed on a formula basis determined by the percentage of \npersons in that State over the age of five who speak a language other \nthan English at home.\n  Support for this legislation comes from State court administrators \nacross the country. In fact, the Conference of Chief Justices and \nConference of State Court Administrators this summer adopted a \nresolution urging Congress to establish a national program to assist \nState courts in providing court interpreters services.\n  I hope my colleagues will help the court systems in their States to \nprovide critical court interpreting services to their constituents.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1733\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the fair administration of justice depends on the \n     ability of all participants in a courtroom proceeding to \n     understand that proceeding, regardless of their English \n     proficiency;\n       (2) 18 percent of the population of the United States over \n     5 years of age speaks a language other than English at home;\n       (3) only qualified court interpreters can ensure that \n     persons with limited English proficiency comprehend judicial \n     proceedings in which they are a party;\n       (4) the knowledge and skills required of a qualified court \n     interpreter differ substantially from those required in other \n     interpretation settings, such as social service, medical, \n     diplomatic, and conference interpreting;\n       (5) the Federal Government has demonstrated its commitment \n     to equal administration of justice regardless of English \n     proficiency;\n       (6) Executive Order 13166, issued August 11, 2000, requires \n     Federal Agencies, including courts, to improve access for \n     persons who have limited English proficiency;\n       (7) 29 States have developed, or are developing, court \n     interpreting programs;\n       (8) robust, effective court interpreter programs--\n       (A) actively recruit skilled individuals to be court \n     interpreters;\n       (B) train those individuals in the interpretation of court \n     proceedings;\n       (C) develop and use a thorough, systematic certification \n     process for court interpreters;\n       (D) have sufficient funding to ensure that a qualified \n     interpreter will be available to the court whenever \n     necessary; and\n       (9) Federal funding is necessary to--\n       (A) encourage States that do not have court interpreter \n     programs to develop them;\n       (B) assist States with nascent court interpreter programs \n     to implement them;\n       (C) assist States with limited court interpreter programs \n     to enhance them; and\n       (D) assist States with robust court interpreter programs to \n     make further improvements and share successful programs with \n     other States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to provide States with the option to expand or add coverage of \npregnant women under the medicaid and State children's health insurance \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n   Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Prevent \nPrematurity and Improve Child Health Act of 2003, which seeks to reduce \nthe incidence of prematurity and improve the health of women of \nchildbearing age and children. I am joined in this effort today by my \ncolleagues Senators Richard Lugar and Jeff Bingaman.\n   The number of premature births is increasing at an alarming rate. \nAccording to data from the National Center for Health Statistics, more \nthan 476,000 infants were born prematurely in 2001--a 27 percent \nincrease since 1981 and the highest level ever reported in the United \nStates. Prematurity, which is defined as birth at less than 37 \ncompleted weeks of gestation, is the leading cause of infant death in \nthe first month of life. Today, one in eight infants is born too early. \nUnfortunately, in my own State of Arkansas, the problem of preterm \nbirths is even more astounding. In 2001, more than 13 percent of births \nwere preterm, ranking Arkansas 43rd in the Nation. This is a clear \nwake-up call: we must take action to reduce the number of premature \nbirths, improving the health of hundreds of thousands of infants born \neach year. Not to mention the cost savings that will result from \nbringing healthy babies into the world.\n  This legislation I introduced today gives States increased \nflexibility and the Federal resources needed to improve access to \nprenatal care for low-income pregnant women. Specifically, it will give \nStates new options to cover pregnant women under the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program (SCHIP) and to cover low-income legal \nimmigrant pregnant women and children under Medicaid and SCHIP. At \nleast one in eight pregnant women are uninsured, according to a 1999 \nstudy conducted by Emory University professor Ken Thorpe for the March \nof Dimes. Uninsured women receive fewer prenatal services and report \ngreater difficulty in obtaining needed care than women with insurance, \nan Institute of Medicine study concluded. The National Center for \nHealth Statistics reports that infants born to mothers who received \nlate or no prenatal care in 2000 were about twice as likely to be low \nbirthweight, less than 5\\1/2\\ pounds, as infants born to mothers who \nreceived early prenatal care--9.9 percent compared with 5.5 percent. \nTiming of entry into prenatal care often reflects factors also \nassociated with low birthweight, including maternal age and poverty. \nIncreased access to prenatal care will give women greater access to \nscreening and diagnostic tests as well as education, counseling, and \nreferral services to reduce risky behaviors like substance abuse and \npoor nutrition. Such care may thus help improve the health of both \nmothers and their infants.\n   Premature birth can happen to any family. In fact, nearly half of \npremature births have no known cause. but we do know that a whole host \nof factors are associated with increased risk, including maternal age, \nmultiple births, a history of preterm delivery, stress, infection, \nsmoking and drug use.\n  Additionally, this bill tackles a major prematurity risk factor--\nmaternal smoking--by improving and expanding coverage for \npharmaceuticals and counseling that will help income-eligible pregnant \nwomen enrolled in the program quit smoking. Almost 20 percent of \npregnant women ages 15 to 44 smoke, according to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention. But pregnancy is a powerful motivator \nto help women stop smoking. Women who smoke are more likely to stop \nduring pregnancy, both spontaneously and with assistance, than at any \nother time. According to the Surgeon General, programs to help pregnant \nwomen quit smoking can increase cessation rates, benefiting infant \nhealth, and are cost-effective. Yet many States' Medicaid programs do \nnot reimburse counseling services aimed at helping pregnant smokers \nunderstand the medical consequences their smoking can have on their \nunborn child and giving them the tools they need to quit. For some \npregnant women, counseling is not enough and a physician may prescribe \npharmaceuticals. At least 35 States already include at least one type \nof smoking cessation pharmaceutical in their Medicaid programs. This \nbill will require all States to include these drugs that, when \nprescribed by a physician, can help pregnant women stop smoking.\n  The bill also contains a provision directing the Administrator of the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to review the core \nperformance measures in the Maternal and Child Health block grant and \ndetermine if there are sufficient prematurity-related measures, \nincluding the percentage of infants born to mothers that smoke while \npregnant.\n  This bill also gives States the tools they need to help low-income \nwomen enrolled in Medicaid avoid another risk factor for premature \nbirth--spacing pregnancies too close together. In recent years, a \nnumber of States, including Arkansas, have sought and received Federal \npermission in the form of waivers to provide Medicaid-financed family \nplanning services and supplies to income-eligible uninsured residents \nwhose incomes are above the state's regular Medicaid eligibility \nceilings. This bill would make it possible for States to extend \nMedicaid coverage for family planning services without having to obtain \na federal waiver.\n  Finally, the bill will improve the health care of some infants and \nchildren with disabilities, such as those born prematurely, who have \nprivate health insurance with limited benefits that do not meet their \nhealth needs. Currently, infants and children must be uninsured to be \neligible for SCHIP. However, this provision will give states the \nability to use federal funds available under SCHIP to include income-\neligible underinsured infants and children in SCHIP, as is currently \npermitted in Medicaid.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with my \ncolleagues Senator Lincoln and Senator Bingaman, the Prevent Pre-\nmaturity and Improve Child Health Act.\n  Pre-maturity has been escalating steadily and alarmingly over the \npast two decades. Between 1981 and 2001, the rate of premature births \nrose from 9.4 percent to 11.9 percent, an increase of more than 27 \npercent. In 2001, more than 476,000 babies were born prematurely.\n  Pre-maturity is the leading cause of infant death in the first month \nof life. Babies born too early are more likely than full-term infants \nto face serious multiple health problems following delivery. the health \nproblems facing many of these children include cerebral palsy, mental \nretardation, chronic lung disease, and vision and hearing loss. If we \nare able to reduce the number of premature births we will be able to \nimprove the health of hundreds of thousands of infants born each year.\n  The goal of the ``Prevent Pre-maturity and Improve Child Health Act'' \nis\n\n[[Page S12616]]\n\nto give States increased flexibility and the Federal resources needed \nto improve access to prenatal care for low-income pregnant women and \ntheir children.\n  Among other things, the bill allows States the option of covering \nlegal immigrant pregnant women under Medicaid. It also promotes new \nprograms and more coverage for tobacco cessation in Medicaid, and \nMaternal Child Health block grant programs, and allows States the \noption of providing wrap-around SCHIP coverage for special needs \nchildren who have another source of health insurance.\n  Our bill has the potential to make a real difference in many lives. I \nam pleased that we are able to introduce this bill in conjunction with \nthe March of Dimes kick off of their new campaign on pre-maturity \nawareness and hope that our colleagues will consider joining us in this \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 1735. A bill to increase and enhance law enforcement resources \ncommitted to investigation and prosecution of violent gangs, to deter \nand punish violent gang crime, to protect law abiding citizens and \ncommunities from violent criminals, to revise and enhance criminal \npenalties for violent crimes, to reform and facilitate prosecution of \njuvenile gang members who commit violent crimes, to expand and improve \ngang prevention programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, a comprehensive bipartisan bill to \nincrease gang prosecution and prevention efforts.\n  This legislation, the Gang Prevention and Effective Deterrence Act of \n2003, authorizes approximately $650 million over the next 5 years to \nsupport law enforcement and prevention efforts. Of the $650 million, \n$450 million would be used to support Federal, State and local law \nenforcement efforts against violent gangs, and $200 million would be \nused for intervention and prevention programs for at-risk youth. The \nbill also increases funding for the Federal prosecutors and FBI agents \nneeded to conduct coordinated enforcement efforts against violent \ngangs.\n  Additionally, this bill will create new criminal gang prosecution \noffenses, enhance existing gang and violent crime penalties to deter \nand punish illegal street gangs, enact violent crime reforms needed to \nprosecute effectively gang members, and implement a limited reform of \nthe juvenile justice system to facilitate Federal prosecution of 16 and \n17-year-old gang members who commit serious violent felonies.\n  I want to take a moment here and commend my dear friend Senator \nFeinstein for her long-time commitment to this issue. She has been a \nleader in California and in the Senate in the war against gangs and \ngang violence. She and I have worked together for many years on this \nimportant issue, and I look forward to our joint effort to enact \nmeaningful legislation.\n  The problem of gang violence in America is not a new one, nor is it a \nproblem that is limited to major urban areas. Once thought to be only a \nproblem in our Nation's largest cities, gangs have invaded smaller \ncommunities.\n  The problem of gang violence is of great concern to the citizens of \nmy State. According to the Salt Lake Area Gang Project, a multi-\njurisdictional task force created in 1989 to fight gang crime in the \nSalt Lake area, there are at least 250 identified gangs in our region \nwith over 3,500 members. What is perhaps most troubling, the juvenile \ngang members in Utah account for over one-third of the total gang \nmembership.\n  Gangs now resemble organized crime syndicates who readily engage in \ngun violence, illegal gun trafficking, illegal drug trafficking and \nother serious crimes. All too often we read in the headlines about \ngruesome and tragic stories of rival gang members gunned down, innocent \nbystanders--adults, teenagers and children--caught in the crossfire of \ngangland shootings, and family members crying out in grief as they lose \nloved ones to the gang wars plaguing our communities.\n  Recent studies confirmed that gang violence is an increasing problem \nin all of our communities. Based on the latest available National Youth \nGang Survey, it is now estimated that there are more than 25,000 gangs, \nand over 750,000 gang members who are active in more than 3,000 \njurisdictions across the United States. The most current reports \nindicate that in 2002 alone, after five years of decline, gang \nmembership has spiked nationwide.\n  While we are all committed to fighting the global war on terrorism, \nwe must redouble our efforts to ensure that we devote sufficient \nresources to combating this important national problem--the rise in \ngangs and gang violence in America. I have been--and remain--committed \nto supporting Federal, State and local task forces as a model for \neffective gang enforcement strategies. Working together, these task \nforces have demonstrated that they can make a difference in our \ncommunities.\n  In Salt Lake City, the Metro Gang Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force has \nfor years demonstrated its critical role in fighting gang violence in \nSalt Lake City. We must act in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that \nadequate resources are available to all of our communities to expand \nand fund these critical task force operations to fight gang violence.\n  I also am mindful of the fact that to be successful in reducing gang \nviolence, we must address not only effective law enforcement \nstrategies, but we must also take steps to protect our youth--so that \nthe next generation does not all into the abyss of gang life, which so \noften includes gun violence, drug trafficking, and other serious \ncrimes. The young people of our cities need to be steered away from \ngang involvement. We need to ensure that there are sufficient tools to \nintervene in the lives of these troubled youth. Federal involvement is \ncrucial to control gang violence and to prevent new gang members from \nreplacing old gang members.\n  We must take a proactive approach and meet this problem head on if we \nwish to defeat it. If we really want to reduce gang violence, we must \nensure that law enforcement has adequate resources and legal tools and \nthat our communities have the ability to implement proven intervention \nand prevention strategies, so that gang members who are removed from \nthe community are not simply replaced by the next generation of new \ngang members.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join with me and Senator Feinstein \nin promptly passing this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an analysis of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       The Gang Prevention and Effective Deterrence Act of 2003 is \n     a comprehensive bill to increase gang prosecution and \n     prevention efforts. The bill authorizes approximately $650 \n     million over the next 5 years, $450 million of which would be \n     used to support Federal, State and local law enforcement \n     efforts against violent gangs, and $200 million of which \n     would be used for intervention and prevention programs for \n     at-risk youth. In support of this effort, the bill increases \n     funding for federal prosecutors and FBI agents to increase \n     coordinated enforcement efforts against violent gangs.\n       The Act also creates new criminal gang prosecution \n     offenses, enhances existing gang and violent crime penalties \n     to deter and punish illegal street gangs, proposes violent \n     crime reforms needed to prosecute effectively gang members, \n     and proposes a limited reform of the juvenile justice system \n     to facilitate federal prosecution of 16 and 17 year old gang \n     members who commit serious acts of violence.\n\n\n              title i--criminal street gang abatement act\n\n       Sec. 101. Solicitation or Recruitment of Persons in \n     Criminal Street Gang Activity. This section creates a new \n     criminal offense to prohibit recruitment of a person in a \n     criminal street gang. The penalty for such a violation is a \n     maximum of 10 years imprisonment, or if the violation \n     involves the recruitment of a minor, a mandatory minimum \n     penalty of not less than 3 years and a maximum of 10 years \n     imprisonment.\n       Sec. 102. Criminal Street Gangs. This section revises \n     existing section 521 of title 18, United States Code, to \n     prohibit illegal participation in a criminal street gang. A \n     ``criminal street gang'' is defined to mean a formal or \n     informal group, club, organization or association of 3 or \n     more persons who act in concert to commit gang crimes. The \n     term ``gang crime'' is defined to include violent\n\n[[Page S12617]]\n\n     and other serious State and Federal felony crimes. Subsection \n     (b) prohibits participation in a criminal street gang either \n     by (1) committing, conspiring or attempting to commit, 2 or \n     more predicate gang crimes related to the gang activity; or \n     (2) to employ, use or command, counsel persuade, induce, \n     entice or coerce another individual to commit a gang crime. \n     The maximum penalties for a violation of subsection (b)(1) is \n     30 years imprisonment and for subsection (b)(2) is 20 years \n     imprisonment, or a mandatory minimum of 10 years imprisonment \n     if the violation of subsection (b)(2) involves a minor. \n     Additional penalties, including the death penalty, are \n     authorized for gang crimes depending on whether the violation \n     results in the taking of a life, attempted murder, the \n     violator is an organizer, leader, supervisor, or manager, or \n     the violator is a repeat offender.\n       Sec. 103. Violent Crimes in Furtherance or in Aid of \n     Criminal Street Gangs. This section creates a new criminal \n     offense for murder, kidnapping, sexual assaults, maiming, \n     assaults with a dangerous weapon, or assaults resulting in \n     serious bodily injury, which are committed in furtherance or \n     in aid of a criminal street gang. The penalties for such \n     violations range from a maximum of 10 years to death \n     depending on the nature of the offense.\n       Sec. 104. Interstate and Foreign Travel or Transportation \n     in Aid of Criminal Street Gangs. This section amends existing \n     section 1952 of title 18, United States Code, to increase \n     penalties and expand the prohibition to include efforts to \n     obstruct justice, intimidate or retaliate against witnesses, \n     jurors, informants or victims.\n       Sec. 105. Amendments Relating to Violent Crime in Areas of \n     Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction. This section amends criminal \n     statutes relating to assault (section 113(a)(3)), conspiracy \n     (section 371), manslaughter (section 1112(b), offenses \n     committed within Indian country (section 1153(a)), \n     racketeering (section 1961(l)), carjacking (section 2119), \n     illegal gun transfers to drug traffickers or violent \n     criminals (section 924(h)), special sentencing provisions \n     (section 3582(d)), and application of the two strikes \n     provision in Indian country (section 3559(e)).\n       Sec. 106. Increased Penalties for Use of Interstate \n     Commerce Facilities in the Commission of Murder-For-Hire and \n     Other Felony Crimes of Violence. This section amends existing \n     section 1958 of title 18, United States Code, to increase \n     penalties for hiring an individual to kill another person and \n     prohibits a fine in lieu of a sentence for conduct resulting \n     in death.\n       Sec. 107. Increased Penalties for Violent Crimes in Aid of \n     Racketeering Activity. This section amends existing section \n     1959(a) of title 18, United States Code, to increase \n     penalties and expand the prohibition to include sexual \n     assault.\n       Sec. 108. Murder and Other Violent Crimes Committed During \n     and In Relation to a Drug Trafficking Crime. This section \n     creates a new criminal offense for murder, kidnapping, sexual \n     assaults, maiming, assaults with a dangerous weapon, or \n     assaults resulting in serious bodily injury, which are \n     committed during and in relation to drug trafficking crimes. \n     The penalties for such violations range from a maximum of 10 \n     years to death depending on the nature of the offense.\n       Sec. 109. Sentencing Guidelines for Gang Crimes, Including \n     an Increase in Offense Level for Participation in Crime as a \n     Gang Member. This section directs the United States \n     Sentencing Commission to amend the Federal Sentencing \n     Guidelines to reflect the newly created offenses of: (1) \n     solicitation or recruitment or persons in criminal street \n     gang activity; (2) criminal street gangs; and (3) violent \n     crimes in furtherance of criminal street gangs to reflect the \n     seriousness of the offenses.\n       Sec. 110. Designation of and Assistance for ``High \n     Intensity'' Interstate Gang Activity Areas. This section \n     requires the Attorney General, after consultation with \n     the Governors of appropriate States, to designate certain \n     locations as high intensity interstate gang activity areas \n     and provides assistance in the form of criminal street \n     gang enforcement teams made up of local, State and Federal \n     law enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute \n     criminal street gangs in each high intensity interstate \n     gang activity area. Subsection (c) authorizes funding of \n     $100 million for each fiscal year 2004 through 2008. Sixty \n     percent, or $60 million, will be used to support the \n     criminal gang enforcement teams and 40 percent, or $40 \n     million, will be used to make grants available for \n     community-based programs to provide for crime prevention \n     and intervention services for gang members and at-risk \n     youth in areas designated as high intensity interstate \n     gang activity areas.\n       Sec. 111. Enhancement of Project Safe Neighborhoods \n     Initiative to Improve Enforcement of Criminal Laws Against \n     Violent Gangs. Subsection (a) expands the Project Safe \n     Neighborhood program to require United States Attorneys to \n     identify and prosecute significant gangs within their \n     district; coordinate such prosecutions among all local, \n     State, and Federal law enforcement; and coordinate criminal \n     street gang enforcement teams in designated high intensity \n     interstate gang activity areas. Subsection (b) authorizes the \n     hiring of 94 additional Assistant United States Attorneys and \n     funding of $7.5 million for each fiscal year 2004 to 2008 to \n     carry out the provisions of this section.\n       Sec. 112. Additional Resources Needed by the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation to Investigate and prosecute Violent \n     Criminal Street Gangs. This section requires the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation to increase funding for the Safe \n     Streets Program and to support the criminal street gang \n     enforcement teams in designated high intensity interstate \n     gang activity areas. Subsection (b) authorizes $5 million for \n     each fiscal year 2004 to 2008 to expand the FBI's Safe \n     Streets Program.\n       Sec. 113. Grants to States and Local Prosecutors to Combat \n     Violent Crime and to Protect Witnesses and Victims of Crime. \n     This section authorizes $20 million for each of the fiscal \n     years 2004 to 2008 to allow for the hiring of additional \n     State and local prosecutors, the funding of gang prevention \n     and community prosecution programs, the purchasing of \n     technological equipment to increase the accurate \n     identification and prosecution of violent offenders, and the \n     creation and expansion of witness protection programs to \n     prevent witness intimidation and retaliation.\n\n\n  Title II--violent crime reforms needed to deter and prevent illegal \n                               gang crime\n\n       Sec. 201. Multiple Interstate Murder. This section creates \n     a new criminal offense for traveling in or causing another to \n     travel in interstate or foreign commerce or to use any \n     facility in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent \n     that 2 or more murders be committed in violation of the laws \n     of any State or the United States.

Expansion of Rebuttable Presumption Against \n     Release of Persons Charged with Firearms. This section \n     applies the rebuttable presumption in pre-trial release \n     detention hearings to cases in which a defendant is charged \n     with firearms offenses after having previously been convicted \n     of a prior crime of violence or a serious drug offense.\n       Sec. 203. Venue in Capital Cases. This section amends \n     section 3235 of title 18 to clarify venue in capital cases \n     where murder, or related conduct, occurred.

Cherry, 217 F.3d 811 (10th Cir. 2000), which \n     permits admission of statements of a murdered witness to be \n     introduced against the defendant who caused a witness' \n     unavailability and the members of the conspiracy if such \n     actions were foreseeable to the other members of the \n     conspiracy.\n       Sec. 208. Clarification of Venue for Retaliation Against a \n     Witness. This section clarifies the venue statute for crimes \n     involving the retaliation against a witness to allow for \n     prosecution in the district where the official proceeding \n     which gave rise to the retaliation occurred or where the act \n     of retaliation occurred.\n       Sec. 209. Amendment of Sentencing Guidelines Relating to \n     Certain Gang and Violent Crimes. This section directs the \n     United States Sentencing Commission to review and, if \n     appropriate, amend its guidelines and policy statements in \n     order to implement new or revised criminal offenses created \n     by this legislation.\n       Sec. 210. Increased Penalties for Criminal Use of Firearms \n     in Crimes of Violence and Drug Trafficking. This section \n     increases the penalty for the use or discharge of a firearm \n     in a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. The \n     penalties are increased further if the firearm injures or \n     causes the death of another.\n\n\n         TITLE III--JUVENILE CRIME REFORM FOR VIOLENT OFFENDERS\n\n       Sec. 301. Treatment of Federal Juvenile Offenders. This \n     section authorizes the United States Attorney to charge in \n     federal court a juvenile who is 16 years or older and \n     committed a serious violent felony, as defined in section \n     3559(c)(2) or (c)(3). Technical changes are made to existing \n     statute, section 5032 of title 18, United States Code, to \n     conform with limited authorization for United States Attorney \n     filings\n       Sec. 302. Notification After Arrest. This section modifies \n     existing section 5033 of title 18 to ensure notification of \n     United States Attorney after arrest of juvenile offender.\n       Sec. 303. Release and Detention Prior to Disposition. This \n     section makes technical changes to existing statue, 5034 of \n     title 18, and makes conforming changes to ensure \n     consideration of release conditions for juveniles charged as \n     adults.\n       Sec. 304. Speedy Trial. This section modifies existing \n     speedy trial statute to require\n\n[[Page S12618]]\n\n     trial within 70 days from detention of juvenile who is \n     charted as an adult and applies existing exclusions from \n     section 3161(h) of title 18.\n       Sec. 305. Use of Juvenile Records. This section ensures \n     that juvenile records relating to a case in which a juvenile \n     is charged as an adult are made available in the same manner \n     as adult cases.\n       Sec. 306. Directive to United States Sentencing Commission. \n     This section directs the Sentencing Commission to develop new \n     guidelines applicable to juvenile offenders who are charged \n     as adults.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Hatch in \nintroducing the Gang Prevention and Effective Deterrence Act of 2003, a \nbill to give law enforcement additional tools to fight the scourge of \ngang violence and to fund prevention programs to stop the cycle of gang \nviolence.\n  I thank and commend my good friend and colleague, Chairman Hatch, for \nhis hard work in helping to develop this legislation. Since 1996, he \nand I have worked together to address the problem of gang violence in \nthis country.\n  We have now introduced legislation in each of the last four \nCongresses--the 104th, 105th, 106th, and 107th. None of that \nlegislation became law. But we have not given up.\n  The legislation we are introducing today addresses the many aspects \nof gang violence by focusing on new criminal offenses and increased \npenalties for individuals who engage in gang violence. Specifically, \nthis legislation targets gang members who participate in criminal \nstreet gang by committing gang crimes like murder, sexual assault, \nrobbery, and drug offenses to name a few, or by employing others to do \nso; recruit and use minors in gang crimes; commit violent crimes in \nfurtherance of gang or drug trafficking activity; or travel in \ninterstate commerce to intimidate and retaliate against witnesses.\n  This legislation also makes it easier to prosecute certain 16 and 17-\nyear-olds as adults if they are engaging in violent gang activity.\n  We have also worked to provide for more cooperation between Federal \nand local law enforcement officials, and to make it easier for \nprosecutors to go after gang members who commit serious or violent \ncrimes on behalf of their gangs.\n  We offer this comprehensive legislation because the problem of gang \nviolence continues to get worse. I concur in the sentiments expressed \nby Los Angeles Police Department Chief William Bratton when he stated, \n``There is nothing more insidious than these gangs. They are worse than \nthe Mafia. Show me a year in New York where the Mafia indiscriminately \nkilled 300 people. You can't.''\n  In 2002, there were over 650 homicides in Los Angeles, half of which \nwere gang related. This year the Los Angeles Police Department reports \napproximately 400 murders and almost one-half of those murders are the \nresult of gang violence.\n  The United States Attorney in Los Angeles testified before the \nJudiciary Committee last month about the gang problem in her city. She \nstated that in Los Angeles County alone, conservative estimates put \nstreet gangs at about 1,000 in number. The number of individual gang \nmembers in those street gangs is 150,000.\n  In addition, there are approximately another 20,000 gang members in \nOrange County, Ventura and San Bernardino Counties.\n  I am often struck by how vicious gang crimes can be, and how damaging \nthey are to the victims and to the surrounding community.\n  Let me give a couple of examples from my own home city of San \nFrancisco.\n  In 2000, two rival gangs had a shoot out in San Francisco's Mission \nDistrict. An innocent bystander was caught in the crossfire and shot \nthrough both legs.\n\n  A brave eyewitness gave law enforcement the name of the shooting \nsuspect, who was then arrested. The gang then tracked down the witness, \nput a 9 millimeter automatic to his head, and threatened to kill him \nfor cooperating with the police.\n  And just recently, on September 28, 2003, 7-week-old Glenn Timmy \nMaurice Molex was killed in his home during a drive-by shooting in a \nBayview district neighborhood in San Francisco. Law enforcement believe \nthat gang members may have been involved in the shooting.\n  But this problem is not limited to any one city, of course.\n  In 1980, there were gangs in 286 jurisdictions. Today, they are in \nover 1,500 jurisdictions.\n  In 1980, there were about 2,000 gangs. Today, there are over 26,000 \ngangs.\n  In 1980, there were about 100,000 gang members. Today, there are more \nthan 750,000 gang members.\n  I would like to explain how this legislation will help deter and \npunish gang-related crimes, and why Congress should act quickly to pass \nit.\n  First, the bill includes tough 10-year sentences for gang \nrecruitment. This will serve to punish anyone who recruits a member to \njoin--or forces a member to stay in--a criminal street gang with the \nintent to have that person commit a serious violent crime or a drug \ncrime.\n  Second, if the person who was recruited was a minor, the offender \nwill serve a mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years.\n  The purpose of this provision is to deter criminal gang recruitment. \nIt is also to punish those who use minors to commit their crimes. And \ngangs specifically do go after juveniles because they know that, if the \nchild is caught, he or she will probably receive lighter punishment \nthan an adult.\n  I believe that we need to punish gang recruitment of children very \nseverely. This bill would do that.\n  This legislation would also make it a crime for three or more people \nwho work together to commit predicate gang crimes which are listed in \nthe bill. Gang members who commit two or more predicate gang crimes or \nemploy another individual to commit a gang crime would be punished \nunder this new statute by up to 30 years in prison. If the predicate \ngang crime carries a greater penalty, the maximum would increase. If \nthe gang member has previously been convicted of a predicate gang \ncrime, that gang member's sentence would also increase.\n  And because juveniles are being used to commit these gang crimes, if \nthe gang member employs a minor to commit the gang crime, the gang \nmember would face a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.\n  The predicate gang crimes are felony crimes and include murder, \nattempted murder, manslaughter, gambling, kidnapping, robbery, \nextortion, arson, obstruction of justice, tampering with or retaliating \nagainst a witness, victim or informant, burglary, sexual assault, \ncarjacking, or selling or possessing a controlled substance, firearm \noffenses, and illegal transportation of an alien.\n  The offenses that are listed as predicate gang crimes are those \ncommonly pursued by gangs.\n  One study of gangs in various countries found that law enforcement \nreported that 55 percent of gang members were involved in aggravated \nassaults; 33 percent in robberies;\n  Fifty-eight percent in burglary and breaking and entering;\n  Fifty-two percent in motor vehicle theft; and\n  Seventy-two percent in drug sales.\n  Numerous gangs illegally launder their illicit drug profits. These \ninclude Russian and West African criminal gangs as well as street gangs \nsuch as the Bloods, Crips, Gangster Disciples, and Latin Kings.\n  This bill also allows property derived from gang crimes to be \nforfeited.\n  Third, the bill creates a new, RICO-like, anti-gang law to help \nprosecutors target the more serious gangs and gang members. In response \nto the problems of mafia-violence, the racketeering statute was created \nto punish violent crimes that are in furtherance of a racketeering \nenterprise. This legislation will do the same for violent crimes that \nare in furtherance of gang activity or drug activity.\n  The gang and drug crimes are those which I have described earlier--\nmurder, carjacking, drug distribution, robbery, firearms violations, \nand sexual assault. These crimes represent the heart of gang activity \nand those who commit them must be met with tough penalties.\n  The penalties range from a maximum of 10 years to the death penalty \nif death results from the crime.\n  This legislation also expands the Travel Act.\n  The Travel Act allows Federal prosecutors to charge certain \ninterstate crimes such as extortion, bribery, and arson, and for \nbusiness enterprises involving gambling, liquor, drugs, or \nprostitution.\n\n[[Page S12619]]\n\n  This statute was passed in 1961 also with mafia-related criminal \nactivity in mind.\n  Now criminal street gangs travel interstate for another purpose which \nstrikes at the heart of our system of justice--intimidating and \nretaliating against witnesses, jurors, informants, and victims.\n  This bill would make it a crime to travel across state lines for that \npurpose and would allow for a sentence up to life imprisonment for \nsomeone who commits that crime.\n  Defendants who violate the Travel Act and kill someone will also face \na possible death sentence for such actions.\n  This bill should ensure that prosecutors can use the Travel Act to \nact against crimes caused by the new Mafia: criminal street gangs.\n  The bill also amends several criminal statutes to address violent \ncrimes frequently or typically committed by gangs.\n  These crimes include carjacking, assault, manslaughter, racketeering, \nillegal gun transfers to drug traffickers or violent criminals, the use \nof firearms in drug trafficking and violent crimes, and murder-for-\nhire.\n  These amendments make it easier for prosecutors to prove these crimes \nby eliminating or modifying the intent requirement for the crimes or by \nincreasing the penalties for violations.\n  This legislation also changes the venue statute for capital cases so \nthat capital cases can be brought where the murder occurs or where the \nracketeering conspiracy, drug conspiracy, or criminal street gang \noperates. So, if the gang, commits the bulk of its crimes in one State \nbut commits a capital crime in another State, all of the crimes can be \ntried in the same State where the gang focused its criminal activity \nand the government can seek the appropriate punishment for that crime. \nThe jury will then get the whole picture of how the gang operated and \nwhat they did.\n\n  Where a 16-year-old or 17-year-old has committed a Federal serious \nviolent felony, this legislation facilitates Federal prosecution of \nsuch offenders. Surveys in 1996 and 1999 showed that 37-50 percent of \ngang members were under the age of 18. This legislation also calls upon \nthe United States Sentencing Commission to create new sentencing \nguidelines for juvenile offenders who are charged as adults to address \nconcerns specific to offenders of that age.\n  The bill permits the Attorney General to designate high intensity \ninterstate gang activity areas, HIIGAs, and authorizes $100,000,000 for \neach of 5 years for these task forces.\n  These provisions are modeled after similar provisions creating high \nintensity drug trafficking areas, HIDTAs.\n  HIDTAs are joint efforts of local, State, and Federal law enforcement \nagencies whose leaders work together to assess regional drug threats, \ndesign strategies to combat those threats, and develop initiatives to \nimplement the strategies.\n  HIDTAs are based on an equal partnership between different law \nenforcement agencies.\n  HIDTAs are based on an equal partnership between different law \nenforcement agencies.\n  HIDTAs integrate and synchronize efforts to reduce drug trafficking.\n  They eliminate unnecessary duplication of effort and maximize \nresources.\n  And they improve intelligence and information sharing both within and \nbetween regions.\n  HIDTAs are necessary because drug trafficking tends to be ``head \nquartered'' in certain areas of the country, from which it spreads to \nother areas.\n  Moreover, drug traffickers have been highly organized and developed \nsophisticated interstate and international operations.\n  These points are also true for many criminal gangs. So we have \nerected a new program of cooperation between law enforcement agencies \nto attack the gang problem like we attack the drug problem.\n  This bill authorizes $75 million over the next 5 years for the hiring \nof Federal prosecutors to identify and prosecute significant gangs \nwithin their districts under the Project Safe Neighborhoods program. \nAcross the Nation, 94 Project Safe Neighborhoods Task Forces are \nworking to implement the coordinated strategy to reduce gun violence, \nled by the U.S. Attorney in each of the Federal judicial districts. \nU.S. Attorneys have been working side by side with all law enforcement \nparticipants in their communities to identify the most pressing crime \nproblems and attack those problems both through prevention and \naggressive prosecution.\n  Finally, this legislation would authorize $100 million dollars over \nthe next 5 years for States to update their technology, create and fund \ngang prevention and community prosecution programs, and create and \nexpand witness protection programs.\n  Witness protection is a critical part of reducing gang violence. The \npresident of the National District Attorneys Association, Robert \nMcCulloch, who is also the district attorney in St. Louis, testified \nlast month before the Judiciary Committee. He said that while his \noffice is able to put witnesses in motels for a couple of days or a \nweek or is able to send them on a bus ride to a relative's house, the \nsolutions are not long-term. And as a result, the witnesses come back \nand are at risk. That is not acceptable. If witnesses are not confident \nthat they will remain safe, they will not talk to law enforcement. It \nis as simple as that. We must give local and State law enforcement the \ntools to keep witnesses alive.\n\n  While criminal street gangs flourish in certain urban areas such as \nLos Angeles and Chicago, they typically use these cities as bases to \ninvade more rural locales.\n  And the characteristics of a criminal street gang are extremely \ndiverse. While some criminal street gangs are looser-affiliations of \nviolent individuals who work together in furtherance of their gang, \nthere are also some very highly disciplined, hierarchical \n``corporations,'' often encompassing numerous jurisdictions.\n  MS-13, an international gang with roots in El Salvador's civil war \nhas spread to at least 28 States and includes more than 8,000 members. \nIn this gang there is no real command structure or national charter.\n  And in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, criminal street gangs \nare largely neighborhood-based associations of lifelong friends. They \nuse no flashy names or symbols, but they bank together to commit crimes \nand sell drugs.\n  In the past three years, members of just three neighborhood-based \ngangs in Washington, D.C., called the 1-5 Mob, the K Street Crew and \nMurder Inc. by prosecutors, have been convicted of 57 murders and \ndozens of assaults and weapons offenses for gang crimes committed over \nthe past ten years.\n  On the other hand, there are some very organized and structured \nruthless gangs in this country.\n  The Gangster Disciples Nation, for example, has a chairman of the \nboard, two boards of directors, one for prisons and one for streets), \nGovernors, regents, area coordinators, enforcers, and ``shorties,'' \nyouth who staff drug-selling sites and help with drug deals.\n  From 1987 to 1994, this gang was responsible for killing more than \n200 people. Moreover, one-half of their arrests were for drug offenses \nand only one-third for nonlethal violence.\n  And just like MS-13, these gangs pop up all across the country.\n  In 1996, the Gangster Disciples Nation and other Chicago-based gangs \nwere in 110 jurisdictions in 35 states.\n  Members of the Los-Angeles based 18th Street Gang have migrated \noutside of California into the southwest border up into the Pacific \nNorthwest, out to New Jersey, Mexico, and El Salvador. Los Angeles gang \nmembers have been tracked to Indianapolis, Oklahoma, Omaha, Raleigh and \nSt. Louis.\n  This bill is a necessary measure to target increasingly violent, \nincreasingly sophisticated, and increasingly national gangs. This is \nnot just a California problem, or a Chicago problem, or a District of \nColumbia problem--this problem is a nationwide in its scope, and we \nmust craft a nationwide solution. This legislation will tackle that \nproblem head-on. We simply cannot wait any longer.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Gang \nPrevention and Effective Deterrence Act of 2003.\n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Hagel, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and \n        Mr. Rockefeller):\n\n[[Page S12620]]\n\n  S. 1736. A bill to promote simplification and fairness in the \nadministration and collection of sales and use taxes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Streamlined \nSales and Use Tax Act, a bill that will make it easier for American \nconsumers and businesses to conduct sales from remote locations. Our \nbill will also help states begin to recover from years of budgetary \nshortfalls.\n  This bill is not a disguised attempt to increase taxes or put a new \ntax on the Internet. Consumer are already supposed to pay sales and use \ntaxes in most States for purchases made over the phone, by mail, or via \nthe Internet. Unfortunately, most consumers are unaware they are \nrequired to pay this use tax on purchases for which retailers choose \nnot to collect sales tax at the time of purchase.\n  That means consumers who buy products online are required to keep \ntrack of their purchases and then pay outstanding use tax obligation on \ntheir State tax forms. Most people do not know this or comply with the \nrequirement. As such, States are losing millions of dollars in annual \nrevenue.\n  Our legislation will help both consumers and States by reducing the \nburden on consumers and providing a mechanism that will allow States to \nsystematically and fairly collect the taxes already owed to them.\n  This bill is not about new taxes. Simply put, if Congress continues \nto allow remote sales taxes to go uncollected and electronic commerce \ncontinues to grow as predicted, other taxes--such as income or property \ntaxes--will have to be increased to offset the lost revenue. I want to \navoid that. That's why we need to implement a plan that will allow \nStates to generate revenue using mechanisms already approved by their \nlocal leaders.\n  This bill is about economic growth. Sales and use taxes provide \ncritical revenue to pay for our schools, our police officers, \nfirefighters, road construction, and more. It will bring more money--\nmoney that is already owed--into rural areas that are struggling \neconomically. It will also help businesses comply with the complicated \nStates sales tax systems. That means the business resources that have \nhistorically been spent on tax compliance could be used, among other \nthings, to hire new people and buy new equipment.\n\n  This bill is about tax simplification. As the Supreme Court \nidentified in the Quill versus North Dakota decision in 1992, the \ncomplicated State and local sales tax systems across this country have \ncreated an undue burden on sellers. Our bill will help relieve this \nburden by requiring States to meet the stringent simplification \nstandards outlined in the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. This \nbill requires States to implement and maintain these simplification \nmeasures before they can require any seller to collect and remit sales \ntax.\n  The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement includes dramatic \nsimplification in almost every aspect of sales and use tax collection \nand administration, especially for multi-state sellers. Areas of \nsimplification include exemption processing, uniform definitions, State \nlevel administration of local taxes, a reduced number of sales tax \nrates, determining the appropriate tax rate, and reduced audit burdens \nfor sellers using the state-certified technology.\n  I firmly believe this bill, coupled with the Agreement, will \nfacilitate a change to our taxing system that benefit local and State \ngovernments, Main Street and online businesses, and consumers. I \nrecognize that this legislation may not be perfect, but I welcome the \nopportunity to continue working with retailers, local and State \nlawmakers and my colleagues to address any remaining concerns. Our \nintention is to close the sales tax loophole for remote sales, and I am \nready and willing to engage in discussions to ensure that this bill \nfairly accomplishes that objective.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for his tireless efforts on \nthis issue. He has been instrumental in drafting this critical \nlegislation, and I appreciate his insight and thoroughness. I would \nalso like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have \nagreed to be original cosponsors--Senators Dorgan, Breaux, Bingaman, \nChafee, Bob Graham, Hagel, Hutchison, Johnson, Ben Nelson, Rockefeller, \nVoinovich, and my esteemed fellow Senator from Wyoming, Senator Thomas.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Enzi and others \nto introduce legislation to address the long-standing issue of how to \nsee that the sales and uses taxes which are owed on remote sales, i.e., \nitems bought from companies outside of the State in which the purchaser \nlives, can be fairly collected. The Simplified Sales and Use Tax Act \nwhich we introduce today will allow the States to require collection \nonly after they have dramatically simplified their sales and use tax \nsystems.\n  Collecting a sales tax in a face-to-face transaction on Main Street \nor at the mall is a relatively simple process. The seller collects the \ntax and remits it to the State or local government. But with remote \nsales--such as catalog and Internet sales--it's more difficult. States \ncannot require a seller to collect a sales tax unless the business has \nan actual location or sales people in the State. So most States, and \nmany localities, have laws that require the local buyer to send an \nequivalent ``use tax'' to the State or local government when he or she \ndid not pay taxes at the time of purchase.\n  The reality, of course, is that customers almost never do that. It \nwould be a major inconvenience, and people are not accustomed to paying \nsales taxes in that way. So, despite the legal requirement, most simply \ndon't do it, and the tax, which is already owed, goes unpaid. For \nyears, State and local governments could accept this loss because \ncatalog sales were a relatively minor portion of overall commerce. But, \nas e-commerce continues to grow so does the competitive divide between \nthose businesses with and without the collection burden and the local \ngovernments who are losing an ever larger share of sales tax revenues.\n  In fact, it appears as if local governments are facing a perfect \nstorm of dwindling economic activity, and a growing migration of \ncommerce from Main Street to the Internet. As online consumer purchases \nhave nearly doubled in the last 2 years estimates are that States and \nlocalities lost at least $13.5 billion in uncollected sales and use tax \nrevenues in 2002, and that number is expected to grow to $45 billion by \n2006.\n  Internet and catalog sellers correctly argue that collecting and \nremitting sales taxes would be a significant burden. Understandably, \nthey contend that, unless things change, it would be difficult for them \nto have to comply with tax laws from thousands of different \njurisidictions--46 States and thousands of local governments--with \ndifferent tax rates and all of the idiosyncrasies regarding what is \ntaxable and what is non-taxable.\n  This is a legitimate complaint, and I understand why the Supreme \nCourt agreed with them when it decided that companies have to have a \nphysical presence in a State before being required to collect sales \ntaxes.\n  But, in so ruling the Court did two things: (1) it told the States to \nsimplify their sales and use tax systems, and (2) it invited Congress \nto define how much simplification will be needed so that collection \nwill no longer be an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.\n  The States have since responded to the Court's ruling with the \n``Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.'' Approved by 34 States and \nthe District of Columbia after extensive discussions with the business \ncommunity this unprecedented agreement will dramatically simplify and \nstreamline how State sales taxes are identified and collected. And, by \nharmonizing State sales tax rules, bringing uniformity to definitions \nof items in the sales tax base, significantly reducing the paperwork \nburden on retailers, and incorporating a seamless electronic reporting \nprocess the agreement will significantly reduce the burden of \ncollection on all sellers. Once adopted by 10 States with at least 20 \npercent of the population, the Simplified Sales and Use Tax Act would \ngive those States the authority to collect sales or use taxes equally \nfrom all retailers.\n  I understand that some have raised questions about how the small \nbusiness exemption included in this legislation will be applied, and I \nintend to work with those interested parties to try to address this \nmatter. However, sales and\n\n[[Page S12621]]\n\nuse tax simplification is an important issue that Congress must address \nsooner rather than later. The legislation we introduce today is \nworkable and strikes a fair balance between the interests of consumers, \nlocal retailers and remote sellers.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed \nbipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1737. A bill to amend the Clayton Act to enhance the authority of \nthe Federal Trade Commission or the Attorney General to prevent \nanticompetitive practices in tightly concentrated gasoline markets; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it's time to bring competition back into \nour Nation's gasoline markets. Across America, gasoline prices have \nrecently soared to the highest levels ever. Right now, gasoline costs \n12 cents more than it did at this time last year. In my home State of \nOregon, folks are paying a whopping 32 cents more per gallon than in \nOctober of last year.\n  Proven price manipulation is siphoning competition out of the \ngasoline markets and stealing money from Americans' wallets. It's time \nthat government regulators opened their eyes to reality of rampant \nprice manipulation by gas companies and protected American consumers \nfrom getting pummeled at the pump. That's why today I am introducing \nthe Gasoline Free Market Competition Act.\n  Every extra penny Americans spend on the artificially inflated price \nof gasoline is a penny they aren't spending on other things--like \nclothes, groceries, or other consumer items. The difference is that \nbuying a new washer dryer helps create jobs; paying extra for gas only \ncreates a fatter bottom line for oil companies, nothing more.\n  With people losing their jobs and the economy in sorry shape, \nCongress should act right now to protect the American people from oil \ncompany price gouging. Artificially inflated gas prices hurt American \nfamilies three ways: it steals dollars from their pocketbooks, slows \ndown job creation, and often raises the price of the goods families \nneed to buy due to increased transport costs.\n  Folks are looking to Congress to address gasoline price spikes and \nindustry pricing policies that can't always be explained away by the \nmarket. But as the American people have called out for relief, the \nFederal government has stayed silent--refusing to respond in any \nmeaningful way to the gas price crisis.\n  The Secretary of Energy says he's conducting an informal \ninvestigation to look into the issue. But under current law, the \nDepartment of Energy has no power to do anything about gasoline prices.\n  On the other hand, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) does have the \npower to protect consumers from gas price manipulation. Yet they've \ndone almost nothing. They turned aside evidence of serious, documented \nanti-consumer practices--such as redlining and zone price--that inflate \ngas prices. They've argued that they can only prosecute if they find \nout-and-out collusion, setting out a standard that is almost impossible \nto prove against savvy oil interests.\n  You can see the results of the FTC's inaction at gas stations in \nOregon and all across America. Nationwide, gasoline markets in Oregon \nand at least 27 other States are now considered to be ``tight \noligopolies'' with 4 companies controlling more than 60 percent of the \ngasoline supplies. The problem is particularly dire in the West, where \nCalifornia, Oregon, Washington and Idaho are four of the top six States \nfor high gas prices today.\n\n  In these tightly concentrated markets, numerous studies have found \noil company practices are driving independent wholesalers and dealers \nout of the market. One practice they employ, called ``redlining,'' \nlimits where independent distributors can sell their gasoline. As a \nresult, independent stations must buy their gasoline directly from the \noil company, usually at a higher price than the company's own brand-\nname stations pay. With these higher costs, the independent stations \ncan't compete.\n  Redlining is just the tip of the iceberg. Investigations have also \nfound oil companies controlling not just stations' buying choices, but \nalso distributors' selling prices. Companies engage in a practice \ncalled zone pricing, basing prices not on the cost of producing \ngasoline, but on the maximum a neighborhood will pay. They have \nsqueezed out smaller refineries that could increase supply and \nintroduce new competitions. They have exported gasoline and oil to Asia \nat rock-bottom prices, making up their profits by sticking West Coast \nconsumers with the difference. So, stopping one anti-competitive \npractice, by itself, won't get the job done.\n  The solution is to update antitrust law to prohibit anti-competitive \npractices by single companies in concentrated markets. The current \nstandard of collusion is unenforceable. Smart oil companies will never \nhole up in a room and collude to set prices; they don't need to.\n  Chevron/Texaco's North American President David Reeves admitted to a \ncongressional panel that the West Coast gasoline market is so dominated \nby a limited number of large committed refinery/marketers whose \nindividual actions can have significant market impact.\n  Here's how the Gasoline Free Market Competition Act would tackle the \nproblem. First, the Federal Government would establish consumer watch \nzones for concentrated gasoline markets. Where control is concentrated, \nsupplies can be manipulated, and competition restricted with ease. \nWhere that capability is ready-made, the FTC should watch markets more \ncarefully.\n  Oil companies employing anti-competitive practices in consumer watch \nzones should have to prove they're not hurting consumers. The whole \nlitany of anti-competitive practices should be considered presumptively \nillegal. That includes exporting at a discount and pressuring \nindependents--all the practices that manipulate supply or limit \ncompetition.\n  Consumer watch zones would also be empowerment zones for quick action \nby the FTC. In these zones, the agency could issue cease and desist \norders to companies participating in these anti-competitive practices, \nforcing them to stop gouging consumers.\n  These legislative proposals are first steps toward bringing back \ncompetition to the Nation's gasoline markets. Congress should act now \nto address the problem of skyrocketing gasoline prices--because even \nthe oil companies admit the market won't solve the problem on its own. \nLast month, a report by the Rand Corporation revealed that even oil \nindustry officials are predicting more price volatility in the future. \nThat means consumers can expect more frequent and larger price spikes \nin the next few years.\n  I have spent years documenting unethical and anti-competitive \npractices in this country's gasoline markets--practices that have \ndriven prices up and driven consumers crazy at the pump. The American \npeople deserve relief from high gas prices and the Congress should act \non their behalf.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1738.

Res. 73\n\n       Whereas environmental sampling by the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency (IAEA) at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility \n     revealed the presence of 2 types of highly enriched uranium \n     that can be used to develop nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas the traces of highly-enriched uranium detected by \n     the IAEA at the Natanz facility and the Kalaye Electric \n     Company could indicate that Iran has been secretly attempting \n     to produce weapons-grade uranium at these facilities;\n       Whereas, in March 2003, the Director of the IAEA announced \n     that Iran was constructing a facility to enrich uranium, a \n     key component of advanced nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas, on January 1, 1968, Iran signed the Treaty on the \n     Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, \n     London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March \n     5, 1970 (the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');\n       Whereas the June 6, 2003, report of the Director General of \n     the IAEA expressed concern over the failure of the Government \n     of Iran to report material, facilities, and activities at its \n     nuclear facilities, including those that have the potential \n     to enrich uranium and develop nuclear weapons, in \n     contravention of its obligations under the safeguards \n     agreement it signed in connection with the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty;\n       Whereas the Board of Governors of the IAEA adopted a \n     resolution on September 12, 2003, that calls on Iran to \n     provide the IAEA a full declaration of all imported material \n     and components relevant to the uranium enrichment program, to \n     grant unrestricted access, including environmental sampling, \n     to the IAEA, to resolve questions regarding the conclusion of \n     the IAEA experts who tested gas centrifuges in that country, \n     to provide complete information regarding the conduct of \n     uranium conversion experiments, and to provide such other \n     information and explanations and take such other steps as the \n     IAEA determines necessary to resolve by October 31, 2003, all \n     outstanding issues involving Iran's nuclear materials and \n     nuclear activities;\n       Whereas, in June 2003, Iran conducted a successful test of \n     the 800-mile range Shahab-3 missile, and Iran is also seeking \n     to produce a 1,200-mile Shahab-4 missile;\n       Whereas the construction by Iran of nuclear facilities, \n     coupled with its ties to terrorist groups, constitutes a \n     threat to international peace and security; and\n       Whereas, by signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, \n     signatories such as Iran that are not declared nuclear powers \n     commit themselves to abstaining from the acquisition of \n     nuclear weapons, preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and \n     weapons technology, promoting cooperation in the peaceful \n     uses of nuclear energy, and achieving nuclear disarmament: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) deplores the development by Iran of a nuclear weapons \n     program and the failure of the Government of Iran to report \n     material, facilities, and activities to the International \n     Atomic Energy Commission in contravention of its obligations \n     under the safeguards agreement it signed in connection with \n     the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done \n     at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered \n     into force March 5, 1970 (hereafter in this resolution \n     referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');\n       (2) concurs with the view of the Department of State, as \n     delivered in testimony to the U.S.-Israel Joint Parliamentary \n     Committee on September 17, 2003, by the Assistant Secretary \n     of State for Verification and Compliance that the \n     explanations provided by the Government of Iran for its \n     nuclear activities are not credible;\n       (3) concurs with the conclusion reached in the Department \n     of State's Annual Report on Adherence to and Compliance with \n     Arms Control and Nonproliferation Agreements and Commitments \n     that Iran is pursuing a program to develop nuclear weapons;\n       (4) calls on the President to use all appropriate means to \n     prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, including--\n       (A) urging the Government of Iran to accept in full the \n     resolution adopted by the Board of Governors of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency on September 12, 2003 \n     (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the ``IAEA \n     resolution''), that calls on Iran to--\n       (i) provide the Agency a full declaration of all imported \n     material and components relevant to the uranium enrichment \n     program;\n       (ii) grant unrestricted access, including environmental \n     sampling, to the Agency;\n       (iii) resolve questions regarding the conclusion of the \n     Agency experts who tested gas centrifuges in that country;\n       (iv) provide complete information regarding the conduct of \n     uranium conversion experiments;

and\n       (B) the passage of a Security Council resolution or the \n     taking of other actions that may be necessary to impose \n     diplomatic and economic sanctions against Iran if it fails to \n     meet its obligations to the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency by October 31, 2003; and\n       (8) calls on the Government of Iran to cease all efforts to \n     acquire nuclear fuel cycle capabilities until it is able to \n     provide specific assurances that it is not engaged in a \n     clandestine nuclear weapons program by--\n       (A) coming into complete and verifiable compliance with its \n     obligations under the IAEA resolution, including the prompt \n     and unconditional implementation of the Model Additional \n     Protocol; and\n       (B) fully meeting its obligations under the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Kyl, to introduce a resolution to express deep \nconcern about Iran's nuclear program. The time has come for the \ninternational community to speak with one voice and urge Iran to \nabandon its attempts to acquire nuclear weapons.\n  With the fall of the Hussein regime in Iraq, attention has turned to \nthe threat posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and the recent \nrevelations about its nuclear program. I am increasingly concerned that \nTehran is determined to develop nuclear weapons and substantially alter \nthe balance of power in the Middle East.\n  In December 2002, Iran admitted that--in addition to the known \nconstruction of a light water reactor complex in Bushehr with Russian \nassistance--it is building two facilities that could be used to develop \nfissile material for a nuclear weapon: a uranium enrichment facility at \nNantanz and a heavy water production plant at Arak.\n  According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the \nNantanz large-scale commercial plant, scheduled for completion in 2005, \n``could produce approximately 400 to 500 kilograms of weapon-grade \nmaterial annually, or enough for 15 to 20 nuclear weapons a year.'' The \nArak facility, scheduled to begin in 2004, ``could produce between 8 \nand 10 kilograms of plutonium annually, enough for one or two nuclear \nweapons a year.''\n  The revelations are serious and deeply troubling.\n  As Professor Gary Mihlhollin testified before the U.S.-Israel Joint \nParliamentary Committee on September 17, 2003: ``Adding an Iranian \nnuclear weapon capability runs the risk of joining terrorism and \nweapons of mass destruction--a combination that our government \nconsiders the greatest security challenge of the 21st century.''\n  Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons demands the full attention of the \nUnited States and the international community, and a concerted and \nclear response to bring Iran into compliance with its obligations under \nthe Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.\n\n[[Page S12624]]\n\n  Iran's assertion that its nuclear program is peaceful and is aimed at \nproducing 6,000 megawatts of electricity is highly dubious given the \nefforts to conceal construction of the Nantanz and Arak facilities and \nits plentiful supplies of oil and gas reserves. In her testimony before \nthe U.S.-Israel Joint Parliamentary Committee, Assistant Secretary of \nState for Verification and Compliance, Paula A. DeSutter agreed and \nstated: ``Iran's attempts to explain why it needs an indigenous nuclear \nfuel cycle are simply not credible.''\n  In fact, United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \ninspectors have found traces of highly enriched, weapons grade uranium \non Iranian nuclear equipment at two sites.\n  I am pleased that the IAEA Board of Governor's passed resolution last \nweek setting a deadline of October 31 for Iran to come clean about its \nnuclear program. As IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming stated:\n\n       What the IAEA inspectors need is accelerated cooperation, \n     full transparency on the part of Iran, so that we can clear \n     up these questions in a matter of weeks, and not months and \n     months.\n\n  Talks have begun between the IAEA and Iranian authorities about \nIran's nuclear program and the October 31 deadline. Our resolution \nsupports the IAEA efforts to bring Iran into compliance with its \ninternational obligations. Among other things, it: deplores the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran's development of a nuclear weapons program and for its \nfailures to report material, facilities, and activities to the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency as it is obligated to do pursuant to \nits safeguards agreement; concurs with the conclusion reached in the \nU.S. Department of State's Annual Noncompliance Report that Iran is \npursuing a program to develop nuclear weapons; calls on the President \nof the United States to urge the Islamic Republic of Iran to accept in \nfull the International Atomic Energy Agency's September 12, 2003 \nresolution; calls on member states of the United Nations to join the \nUnited States in preventing the Islamic Republic of Iran from \ncontinuing to pursue and develop programs or facilities that could be \nused in a nuclear weapons program; and calls on the United Nations \nSecurity Council to immediately undertake consideration of the threat \nto international peace and security posed by Iran's nuclear weapons \nprogram as well as such action as may be necessary, including a \nSecurity Council resolution, that would impose diplomatic and economic \nsanctions against Iran should Iran fail to live up to its obligations \nto the International Atomic Energy Agency by October 31, 2003.\n  In addition, its calls on the Government of Iran to: to come into \nverifiable compliance with its obligations under the September 12, 2003 \nresolution of the International Atomic Energy Agency; to come into \nverifiable compliance with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons; and to immediately sign the Model \nAdditional Protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which \nwould allow inspectors freer access to nuclear sites.\n  The international community must stand together to put pressure on \nTehran to live up to its commitments and, in particular, sign the \nadditional protocol to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty to permit \nsnap, short-notice inspections of Iran's declared and undeclared \nnuclear facilities.\n  I, for one, had been hopeful that Iran in recent years had begun to \ntake the necessary steps to rejoin international community. The \nelection of President Mohammad Katemi in May, 1997 appeared to be a \nvote for moderation and engagement with the outside world.\n  Yet, the clandestine nuclear weapons program, the continued support \nfor terror, the numerous human rights abuses against religious \nminorities including Iranian Jews, the suppression of the student lead \npro-democracy movement, and the continued uncompromising influence of \nthe unelected hardliners in the Council of Guardians and the military \nlead me to conclude that we still have a long ways to go before we see \na peaceful, stable, democratic Iran.\n  I firmly believe that the Iranian people desire to see their country \nbreak its ties with the past and commit itself to a future based on \ndemocracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\n  If they are to realize that dream, the United States must work \nclosely with our friend and allies in the international community to \nput pressure on Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program, cease its \nsupport for terror, and become a positive force for change in the \nMiddle East. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/15/senate-section/article/S12624-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1838.

(a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that removing potential nuclear weapons materials \n     from vulnerable sites around the world would reduce the \n     chance that such materials would all into the hands of al \n     Qaeda or other groups and states hostile to the United \n     States, and therefore should be a top priority for achieving \n     the national security of the United States.\n       (b) Task Force on Nuclear Material Removal.--(1) There is \n     established in the Department of Energy the Task Force on \n     Nuclear Material Removal (in this section referred to as the \n     ``Task Force'').\n       (2)(A) At the head of the Task Force shall be the Director \n     of the Task Force, who shall be appointed by the Secretary of \n     Energy for that purpose.\n       (B) The Director of the Task Force shall report directly to \n     the Administrator for Nuclear Security regarding the \n     activities of the Task Force.\n       (3) The Secretary and the Administrator shall assign to the \n     Task Force personnel having such experience and expertise as \n     is necessary to permit the Task Force to carry out its \n     mission under this section.\n       (4)(A) The Secretary of Energy and the Administrator shall \n     jointly consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \n     and the heads of other appropriate departments and agencies \n     of the Federal Government to establish mechanisms that ensure \n     that the Task Force is able to draw quickly on the \n     capabilities of other departments and agencies to fulfill its \n     mission.\n       (B) Mechanisms under subparagraph (A) may include the \n     assignment of personnel from other departments and agencies \n     of the Federal Government to the Task Force.\n       (c) Mission.--The mission of the Task Force shall be to \n     take actions to ensure that potential nuclear weapons \n     materials are entirely removed from the most vulnerable sites \n     around the world as soon as practicable after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Assistance.--To assist the Task Force in carrying out \n     its mission under this section, the Secretary of Energy may--\n       (1) provide such funds as are needed to remove potential \n     nuclear weapons materials from vulnerable sites, including \n     funds to cover the costs of--\n       (A) transporting such materials from such sites to secure \n     facilities;\n       (B) providing interim security upgrades for such materials \n     pending their removal;\n       (C) managing such materials after their arrival at secure \n     facilities;\n       (D) purchasing such materials;\n       (E) converting such materials to use as low-enriched fuels, \n     or to uses that no longer require nuclear materials;\n       (F) assisting in the closure and decommissioning of such \n     sites;

and\n       (3) provide funds to upgrade security and accounting at \n     sites where, as determined by the Secretary, potential \n     nuclear weapons materials will remain for an extended period \n     in order to ensure that such materials are secure against \n     plausible potential threats, and will remain so in the \n     future.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than 30 days after the submittal \n     to Congress of the budget of the President for fiscal year \n     2005 pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United States \n     Code, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to Congress a \n     report that shall include--\n       (A) a list of the sites determined by the Task Force to be \n     of the highest priorities for removal of potential nuclear \n     weapons materials, based on the quantity and attractiveness \n     of such materials at such sites and the risks of the theft or \n     diversion of such materials for weapons purposes;\n       (B) a strategic plan, including measurable milestones and \n     metrics, for accomplishing the mission of the Task Force \n     under this section;\n       (C) an estimate of the annual financial requirements for \n     implementing the plan;\n       (D) recommendations on whether any further legislative \n     actions are needed to facilitate the accomplishment of the \n     mission of the Task Force;

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 1474), and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1474), to facilitate check truncation by authorizing \n     substitute checks, to foster innovation in the check \n     collection system without mandating receipt of checks in \n     electronic form, and to improve the overall efficiency of the \n     Nation's payments system, and for other purposes, having met, \n     have agreed that the House recede from its disagreement to \n     the amendment of the Senate, and agree to the same with an \n     amendment, signed by a majority of the conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of October 1, 2003.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I support the conference report to the \nCheck Clearing for the 21st Century Act or Check 21 Act. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation and a high priority for the Federal \nReserve Board. I commend Chairman Shelby for his leadership on this \nissue. Senators Johnson, Carper, Miller and Bennett also played \nimportant roles in developing this legislation. The Check 21 Act enjoys \nbroad bipartisan support. the conference report passed the House of \nRepresentatives unanimously on October 9th. Earlier this year both \nHouses of Congress passed similar bills by unanimous vote.\n  This legislation is designed to allow banks to use electronic images \nof checks to expedite check collection and processing. Current law \nrequires a bank that receives a deposited check to physically return \nthe check to the\n\n[[Page S12633]]\n\nissuing bank unless there is an agreement to provide for alternative \npresentment. It is important to note that there is no current legal \nrequirement that an issuing bank return the original check to its \ncustomer.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent \nclosure of air traffic by the Federal Aviation Administration exposed a \nserious weakness in our financial system. The inability of banks to \nsend physical checks for presentment and payment for several days \nprevented the clearing of close to $50 billion in transactions. This \ncrisis required the Federal Reserve to use extraordinary efforts to \nprevent a serious disruption in our financial markets.\n  Under the Check 21 Act, banks will no longer be required to \nphysically transport checks across the nation. Instead, they will be \nallowed to electronically scan the front and back of each check, create \nan encrypted, electronic image of each check, and then transmit the \nimages rapidly from one area of the country to another. Consumers who \nwish to receive copies of their checks for record keeping purposes or \nwho are investigating bank errors or possible fraud may receive printed \ncopies of these electronic images. According to the Federal bank \nregulatory agencies, they have received few, if any, complaints from \nbank consumers who currently do not have their original checks returned \nwith their monthly statements and use imaged copies of checks to \ndispute payments. Moreover, the Check 21 Act will not alter present law \nrequiring banks to maintain copies of checks for seven years.\n  The widespread adoption of check truncation and electronic imaging \nwill reduce the dependence of the check processing system on \ntransportation and will increase the resiliency of the financial system \nto terrorist attacks or other unforeseen events. In addition, the \nbanking industry has indicated that the legislation has the potential \nto make deposited funds available to the consumer more quickly. With \nincreased efficiency through electronic check transmission, banks have \nalso indicated that they will be able to reduce processing time and may \nbe able to more quickly identify check fraud and bank errors. Moreover, \nin certain cases where a consumer's account is improperly charged, the \nlegislation provides for expedited recrediting of the account.\n  Important consumer protections were maintained during the development \nof this check truncation legislation in the Senate. I appreciate \nChairman Shelby's responsiveness to many of my concerns regarding \nconsumer protections and ensuring that consumers enjoy some of the \nbenefits of the legislation. I am also pleased that the House Conferees \nagreed to incorporate the Senate's consumer protection provisions in \nthe Conference Report.\n  First, the conference report contains statutory language clarifying \nthat the comparative negligence language in the bill is not intended to \nreduce the rights of consumers under the Uniform Commercial Code or \nother applicable state or federal law. The report language in the \nSenate bill further clarifies that in the absence of fraud or bad \nfaith, the comparative negligence provisions would generally not be \napplicable to consumer check users.\n  Second, the Check 21 Act establishes, for the first time, the right \nof expedited recredit for improper check charges to a consumer's bank \naccount. Pursuant to Section 7 of the legislation, certain consumers \nare given a right to expedited recredit within 10 days for the amount \nof a substitute check--under $2,500--that is improperly charged to the \nconsumer's account. Current check law does not mandate a time frame for \nresolving consumer complaints. A consumer will have 40 days to make a \nclaim after the financial institution mails the periodic statement or \nmakes the substitute check available. Under extenuating circumstances, \nthe financial institution must extend the period for filing a claim by \na reasonable amount of time.\n  Section 7 states that the time for action begins when the financial \ninstitutions mails or delivers, by any means agreed to by the consumer, \nthe periodic statement, or the date on which the substitute check is \nmade available to the consumer and Section 12 permits notices to be \nsent to a consumer by any means agreed to by the consumer. However, \nthis Act does not address how the agreement referred to in sections 7 \nor 12 may occur. That topic is covered by the Electronic Signatures in \nGlobal and National Commerce Act.\n  Third, the conference report contains a Federal Reserve study on the \nappropriateness of the time frame and monetary threshold for expedited \nfunds availability. This provision requires the Fed to re-evaluate \ncurrent practices and may lead to the reduction in the amount of time a \nbank may hold a deposited check before making the funds available to \nthe consumer.\n  Lastly, the conference report contains a General Accounting Office \nstudy to evaluate an assessment of consumer acceptance of the check \ntruncation process, including whether consumers who were receiving \nreturned checks prior to the enactment of this legislation incurred any \nnew costs; and estimate of the gains in efficiencies made possible by \nthis Act; and a determination of consumers' share of total benefits \nderived from this Act.\n  I also want to take a moment to recognize those members of the \nBanking Committee staff who devoted so many hours to crafting this \nimportant and comprehensive legislation. On my staff: Patience \nSingleton and Aaron Klein and on the staff of Chairman Shelby: Peggy \nKuhn and Doug Nappi.\n  I look forward to monitoring the implementation of the Check 21 act \nby the Federal Reserve and the banking industry to ensure that \nconsumers benefit from this legislation.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that the conference report be \nadopted and the statements relating to the conference report be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
