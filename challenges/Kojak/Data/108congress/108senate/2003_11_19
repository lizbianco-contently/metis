Mr. President, what I would like to talk about today is \nthe Energy bill that is coming upon us. I want to talk about one \nprovision in there which I find to be one of the most abusive \nprovisions that I have ever seen come down the pike, and that is the \nprovision of a safe harbor for the MTBE producers.\n  As everyone knows, we have found that while MTBEs did work at \ncleaning air, they also worked at polluting the groundwater. What has \nhappened in my State and in 38, I believe it is, of the 50 States is \nthat when the MTBEs were spilled, they went into well water, into \naquifers, and basically made the water undrinkable and unusable. This \nhas left thousands and thousands of families in terrible shape, \nprobably tens of thousands, and it is going to grow. It is going to be \nmillions of families down the road because we are just learning of the \nextent of the MTBE spills.\n\n  We are being very generous, even without this safe harbor, to the \nMTBE producers. We are giving them $2 billion to shut down. How many \nsmall business men and women in America, when they shut down, get a \nGovernment subsidy? I think very few. But we are giving it to them and \nI am not arguing against that right now, as much as I oppose it.\n  We have also given them a safe harbor. We have said to them that you \ncannot be sued, and we have set a retroactive date of September 5 in \nthis Energy bill. I should not say ``we.'' Two people who crafted the \nEnergy bill did it. Nobody else had much say.\n  What will this mean? Let me tell you the situations I have found on \nLong Island and the Hudson Valley, in Orange County and Dutchess \nCounty, throughout my State.\n  MTBEs were spilled and have leaked into either individual wells of \nfamily homes or into aquifers upon which towns and villages depend. The \nwater supply is gone. The people cannot use the water or drink the \nwater. What does that mean? The least of it is they need bottled water \nto do everything--to drink, to brush their teeth, et cetera. They have \nto go out and buy bottled water. That is a significant expense to these \nfamilies.\n  In most of the places I visited, the homes are modest. They are small \nhomes. They are typical American families who have worked their lives \nand their little piece of the rock is their home.\n  Worse, however, is that you can't even take a shower because the \nMTBEs, it is said, give off some kind of vapor that could be very \nharmful if you shower regularly. So the families have to go to \nneighbors. Since often the spills are in whole tracts of land, it is \nnot just walking across the street and knocking on the door. In some \ncases that is possible because some houses are not polluted and some \nare, that are next to each other. But usually they have to get in the \ncar and drive the kids, drive themselves to take a shower. That renders \ntheir home--if not valueless, it knocks out their investment.\n  We have lots of people struggling with these MTBEs. What they have \ndone, of course, is gone to the people who have created the problem. \nThey have gone to the service station owner who might have spilled the \ngasoline, or the pipeline that ruptured. But the bottom line is, in \nmost cases those people are out of business or not able to help.\n  So what happened was, because of lawsuits--and I am not one of the \nDemocrats who is the leading advocate for the trial lawyers, but I do \nbelieve there are instances where lawsuits are the only solution. They \nwent to oil companies with lawsuits, one in California, several in \nother parts of the country, and showed not only that the companies knew \nMTBEs were harmful but, worse, they didn't tell anybody.\n  If in the mid-1980s we found that MTBEs were polluting the \ngroundwater and permanently doing such severe damage, wouldn't it have \nmade sense for the oil companies and the producers to send \nnotifications to the service stations, to the pipelines, to the \ntrucking companies, and say: If this stuff spills, it could be \ndangerous. Be very careful. Here is what you do in the immediate case \nthat there is a spill.\n  None of that happened. It is reminiscent of the cigarette industry. \nWe knew cigarettes were harmful. Most people sort of had an inkling \nafter 1965. I, for one, believe that just to do a lawsuit because you \nlater find a product is harmful is not the strongest case. But in the \ncigarette industry, and now with the MTBEs, when the producer knew it \nand not only continued to produce it but didn't let the information \nout, that to me is egregious because you could have prevented a whole \nlot of harm.\n\n  So what we had throughout New York was the following. We had \nlawsuits, and even in many of the cases when it wasn't lawsuits, the \noil companies were beginning to come forward. In Fort Montgomery, right \nnear West Point, Orange County, are a lot of retirees from the \nmilitary, in lovely homes near the banks of the Hudson River. The oil \ncompanies paid to put on these filters that would prevent the MTBEs \nfrom going into the drinking water, the bathing water, et cetera. In \nsome places, up in Dutchess County, they were beginning to negotiate \nwith the law firm. The town would pay some money, the oil companies \nwould pay some money, and they would put in a water system of piped-in \nwater because the entire drinking water, under a large number of homes, \nwas gone.\n\n[[Page S15107]]\n\n  Many of these cases didn't reach lawsuits because they were trying to \nsit down and work out a negotiation. But we all know that the threat of \na lawsuit is the only thing that brought the oil companies to the \ntable. But progress was being made dealing with this bad problem. I \ndon't want to cast blame here; it is just a serious problem.\n  I ask my colleagues, if you are a homeowner and you bought your home \nand this stuff leaked half a mile away and leached into your aquifer \nand your home is worth half the value it was, and it could be made \nwhole again by simply putting in a water supply, should we just say to \nthe homeowner: Tough luck? Or should we try to figure out a way to have \nthose who knew this horrible thing was happening help pay?\n  I would have felt better--maybe some of my colleagues don't like the \nidea of lawsuits; in this Energy bill we have $30 billion to fund \neverything under the Sun--had there been a fund to help the homeowners. \nIf you don't like the way of lawsuits, that is fine, and if you believe \nthe Government has some responsibility--which it probably does because \nthe Government sanctioned MTBEs--fine. But what we are saying is, with \nthis safe harbor, to the tens of thousands, soon to be hundreds of \nthousands, and probably into the millions of homeowners whose whole \nlife savings are destroyed: Tough luck. You can't sue. You can't \nnegotiate.\n  This is a classic case of what is wrong, sometimes, with the things \nwe do here. We have sided with the oil companies that, at least, have \nas much blame as the innocent homeowner--more blame. And we have told \nthe homeowners: Tough luck.\n  It is not fair. As I say, these are hard-working people. There is no \nfault of their own. No one thinks there is any culpability on the part \nof the homeowners.\n  We had things beginning to move in the proper direction, and because \nof the power of a limited few, and, frankly, because of the way this \nbill was created, with no debate, no chance for amendment--what we did \nhere on the floor I think many on our side regret because we passed \nlast year's Democratic bill which modified the safe harbor provision, \ndue to the work of the Senator from California and some of the others, \nand then it was totally ignored and basically two people--both of whom \nI have a lot of respect for but they have a point of view quite \ndifferent than many of us here on energy issues--negotiated the entire \nproposal.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask that I be given another 5 minutes since none of my \ncolleagues is here.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, many of us believe this whole Energy bill \nis a travesty. Many of us believe there are three major energy issues \nthat have occurred in the last 3 years. One was 9/11. It showed us the \nneed to be independent of Middle Eastern oil. And China, of all places, \nbecause they are worried about dependence on Middle Eastern oil, is now \ninstituting CAFE standards in their automobiles that are higher than \nours. That should make every American think. If our country cannot take \nthe necessary preparations to deal with a problem that is going to be \nnipping at our heels and then create real problems in America a few \nyears from now, that is a sign of weakness of our country, and I love \nthis country and I don't like to see us be weak. But we have done \nnothing on oil conservation.\n\n  I am not one of those who says we shouldn't produce new oil. I was \none of six Democrats who voted to look in the east gulf, much to the \nchagrin of my friends from Florida. I think on Federal lands--certainly \nnot in parks or monuments but on the huge forest land--we should not be \nso doctrinaire. If there is a good amount of oil and gas that can be \nrecovered in an environmentally sound way, I think we should do so. We \nneed to increase supply and decrease demand. But we are doing nothing \nto decrease demand. On that issue, we have done nothing.\n  The second issue that occurred with California and the way \nelectricity flows in this country--again, talk to my colleagues from \nWashington and talk to my colleagues from California; they will tell \nyou; they know this issue better than I--we are doing nothing in this \nbill to prevent another fiasco like the one which occurred in \nCalifornia, and the one I find most amazing is the recent blackout that \nmany of us in the Northeast and Midwest suffered. We all know the \nreason is that no one is in charge of the grid. In some places, it is \npower companies; in some places, it is a conglomeration; in some \nplaces, it is ISOs.\n  There was consensus immediately after the blackout that we ought to \nhave one national grid governed by someone who will look out for the \ntransmission of electricity.\n  The analogy ought to be the highway system. We have one national \nhighway system. Even though people drive within the States, commerce \nflows across State lines. So does electricity.\n  The idea of not creating a strong national unit that can determine \nhow our power flows because we are going to need more power--again, I \ndon't like those who say we shouldn't grow. We should grow, but we are \ngoing to need more power to grow. To not have a national grid after \nwhat we saw on August 14, I believe the date was, and to just sort of \nignore history because a few special interests or a few power companies \ndidn't like it--I try to read a little bit of history. When the special \ninterests, whether they be left, right, or center, whether they be rich \nor poor, overcome the national interests, that is a sign of weakness. \nIt is a sign of failure. And energy and power are two issues that \ndemand some kind of national solution and some kind of long-term \nsolution.\n  This bill, aside from the MTBE provision, is a hodgepodge of little \nspecial interest things. I know what it does. I ought to vote for it. I \nam getting a few things for New York State. If each one of us is going \nto say we got our little thing for our States and we are not dealing \nwith the national problem--and the two are not mutually exclusive in \nmost cases--then we are not serving America.\n  I predict that within 5 years we are going to need to do another \nEnergy bill. I think the last one we did was in 1992. We are going to \nneed to do another Energy bill because the best that can be said about \nthis bill is it sidesteps the major problems. The worst that can be \nsaid about it, or one of the harshest things that can be said about it, \nis if you hired the right lobbyist and had the right connections, you \ngot something in this bill.\n  But the thing I most object to is not all those little things in \nthere but, rather, that they have taken the place of a national policy \non energy which we do not have. If there was ever a time to have it, \nafter 9/11, blackouts, and Enron in California, now is the time we \nshould have created it. If we can't create it now, when?\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about two \nmonumental pieces of legislation that are coming this way and, \nhopefully, will be passed in the next 48 hours. I am hopeful that we \nwill pass the Energy bill. The House has passed this Energy bill. I \nhave heard a lot of discussion about it. It was a very hard-fought \nbill.\n  Since coming to the Senate 10 years ago, I have tried to have a part \nin passing energy legislation that would make our country self-\nsufficient. Ten years ago, I said we were too dependent on foreign oil. \nWe were dependent upon foreign oil for about 50 percent of our energy \nneeds. Today, 10 years later, it is 10 percent more. We are 60 percent \nmore dependent on foreign oil for our energy needs.\n  It is a very important issue for our economy. Our economy is not the \nmost stable right now, but it is in a recovery. We are dependent on \nenergy for our factories, for our businesses, for our economy to remain \nstable, and for us to be able to continue to increase the number of \njobs in our country. Having more energy self-sufficiency\n\n[[Page S15108]]\n\nwill be very important for our country to be able to strengthen our \neconomy, put people back to work, and go into a full recovery.\n  The bill we will have before the Senate in the next 48 hours is not a \nperfect bill, but it is a bill that I am very hopeful will pass so that \nwe can start the process of having an energy policy that includes \nconservation, incentives for production, incentives for nuclear power. \nWe have not had a nuclear powerplant built in America since 1978. It is \nour cleanest source of energy and it is energy that has the capacity to \nmeet our needs. I am very hopeful we will pass this bill and we will \nwork to fix some of the things not fixed in the bill.\n  I am hopeful also that we will pass Medicare prescription drug \nbenefits. That is a bill in progress. We are going to have an \nincredible ending to this legislative session if we are able to work \nthose bills out and pass them, including the jobs created in the Energy \nbill and to begin the process of providing our seniors a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  I see the Senator from the State of Oregon is on the Senate floor, \nand I yield to him up to 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding to me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/19/senate-section/article/S15108-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15108-S15110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, in thinking about my remarks today, I was \nreflecting back upon the investments made during the Great Depression \nin the Pacific Northwest by President Franklin Roosevelt, by his \ncongressional friends. They were at the time expensive, but they were \ndone at a time in America, particularly the Pacific Northwest, when \nonly 30 percent of the American people had electricity. One had to live \nin the city to have electricity.\n  President Roosevelt went to Oregon and Washington and dedicated the \nBonneville Dam. At the time, in 1937, it was an enormous undertaking. \nHe was a visionary when he dedicated that dam. He foresaw the benefits \nof universal electrification of our Nation from an economic and from an \nenvironmental point of view.\n  There were those who expressed concern about the cost of this Energy \nbill. In preparing for these remarks, I read the address of Franklin \nRoosevelt those many years ago because it is applicable even today. He \nends his address with this adage, which is as true today as it was \nthen:\n\n       We in America are wiser in using our wealth on projects \n     like this which will give us more wealth, better living, and \n     greater happiness for our children.\n\n  It seems to me the difference between those for the bill and those \nagainst it has to do with money and the picking of winners and losers \nsupposedly in this bill, and the difference of approach.\n  The American people want affordable energy. The American people want \na clean environment. It does seem to me there are those on the other \nside who believe the best approach to get energy and to get more green \npolicies in place is through regulation. Indeed, I saw with some \ninterest an article in the Washington Post this morning in which the \nprobable Democratic nominee, Howard Dean, calls for: An age of \nreregulation. There is the headline. He was apparently a born-again \nreregulator. He wants to reregulate American industry, and specifically \nenergy.\n  It seems to me you can get different outcomes at the heavy hand, the \nclub, of government. But I think what this legislation does is try to \nget to green results with affordable energy by incentivizing it with \ncarrots. So you really have a choice between carrots and clubs, \ndepending on which side you want to support in this debate and how you \nvote.\n  But, Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nconference report on H. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2003. All of the \nconferees are to be congratulated for their tireless efforts to craft a \nbill that provides for real progress in securing our Nation's energy \nfuture. It is a positive step toward ensuring our farms, factories, and \nhomes have energy they need at affordable prices.\n  The bill provides significant incentives for diversification of our \nenergy sources and for investment in needed energy infrastructure.\n  I am pleased the bill authorizes $550 million in grants for biomass \nprograms, which will help Oregon's communities and small businesses \ntreat forested lands at high risk of catastrophic fires. This bill will \npromote the generation of electricity with the wood and brush removed \nfrom lands when lands are treated to reduce wildfire dangers.\n  The extension and expansion of tax credits for the generation of \nelectricity from renewable resources will also benefit Oregon, which \nhas been a leader in renewable energy production, particularly in wind \nenergy.\n  There are tremendous amounts of incentive here for windmills. In \nfact, I heard Pete Domenici say: In 10 years, you are going to be tired \nof seeing all the windmills that will be produced from this.\n  Now, the Federal Government can mandate it and impose it on \nelectrical utility companies, or it can incentivize it by helping these \nrenewable types of energy to be more affordable and more marketable in \nthe marketplace of today. Again, it is the carrot approach, not the \nstick approach.\n  We will further improve the environment by establishing tax credits \nfor energy-efficient homes and appliances, and for energy efficiency \nimprovements to existing homes. Expansion of the Energy Star program \nbuilds on the success of the collaborative effort between Government \nand industry to inform consumers about energy-efficient appliances.\n  Mr. President, hydroelectric facilities in the Pacific Northwest \nprovide almost 60 percent of the region's electricity. That is why I am \nso supportive of the provisions in this bill that authorize $100 \nmillion for increased hydropower production through increased \nefficiency at existing dams. People worried about global warming ought \nto be very interested in this provision because hydroelectric power \nproduces abundant electricity without global warming.\n  The bill also contains important reforms to hydroelectric relicensing \nlaws, allowing for increased production while maintaining existing \nenvironmental safeguards.\n  Our Native-American tribes in Oregon will benefit economically from \nprovisions that promote the development of energy resources on tribal \nlands and extend the accelerated depreciation benefit for energy-\nrelated businesses on Indian reservations. I thank Senator Campbell for \nhis leadership on this important Indian energy title.\n  The bill also recognizes that not everyone is sharing in the Nation's \neconomic recovery. It is very important that we approve the \nauthorization in this bill of $3.4 billion a year from 2004 to 2006 for \nthe Low Income Housing Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP. It is an \nimportant addition to this bill.\n  Nationally, we have finally established mandatory reliability \nstandards for the electric transmission system, including enforcement \nmechanisms. This is something the Senate has attempted to do for the \npast three Congresses. These standards will help avoid future blackouts \nlike those that plunged the east coast into darkness last August 14 or \nthe August 1996 event which paralyzed the Western United States.\n  Finally, let me turn to the electricity title. This has been an issue \nof particular importance to my constituents in Oregon and to the West \nin general. In recent years, Oregon ratepayers have been harmed as a \nresult of market problems that spread from California throughout the \nWest. Most Oregonians have seen their electricity rates increase by \naround 50 percent in the past 3 years.\n  FERC's proposal on standard market design, SMD, threatened to raise \nOregon's rates even further. As originally proposed, it simply would \nnot have worked in the Northwest, where hydroelectricity is the \ndominant resource.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH. Might I have another 2 minutes?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 1 more minute to the Senator from Oregon, and \nthen I will yield up to 8 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S15109]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. In short, SMD was bad for the consumers of Oregon, \nparticularly those in rural areas.\n  Led by the Senate, this Congress has taken the extraordinary step in \nthis bill of blocking FERC from continuing with this rulemaking that \nwould have been so harmful to so many areas of the country.\n  Unfortunately, the SMD is only part of a FERC vision for \nrestructuring the wholesale electricity industry in a way that puts \nconsumers at risk. FERC appears bent on ``competition at all costs,'' \nregardless of the costs to consumers, and without justifying the need \nfor its draconian proposals.\n  We have stopped SMD in this legislation, but other proposals are out \nthere. Even now, utilities in the Northwest are concerned that they \nwill once again be harmed by California's efforts to get FERC approval \nfor new market structures under what is commonly known as MDO2.\n  We cannot continue to legislate against specific FERC proposals for \nmarket design.\n  I do hope that FERC gets the message we are sending them, however. \nThe goal of Federal policy, which I believe is furthered by this \nelectricity title, is to promote universal access to electricity at \naffordable prices.\n  Electricity is too fundamental to our lives, and to this Nation's \neconomic well-being to be subjected to radical experiments, such as the \none proposed by SMD.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Domenici and \nSenator Grassley for their leadership in crafting this important \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nOregon and his thoughtful comments about the electricity section. I do \nthink this legislation includes good language in that area that will be \nfair to all sides of electricity production.\n  I do believe, as a result of this legislation, we are going to have a \nbetter grid. There are incentives to expand the grid where it is \nneeded. In my part of the country, there have been significant \ninvestments in the grid already. We have a surplus of power. We are \ndelighted to have more competition. We are delighted to work to have \ninterconnectibility.\n  But my concern had been that this language, this section, was not \nwritten properly, that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would \nhave come up with a plan that would have forced ratepayers in my State \nto pay for additional transmission lines which would not benefit them. \nSo it is a delicate balance.\n  It has been very hard to work through this with regional differences, \nwith Senators on both sides of the aisle coming at it from a different \nviewpoint. But through the efforts of Senator Domenici and Senator \nCraig Thomas, and the interest of Senators such as Gordon Smith and \nLarry Craig, and the chairman in the House, Billy Tauzin, we came up \nwith a good package. I appreciate the efforts of all concerned.\n  We will hear from the chairman and ranking member about details of \nthis legislation. I am sure they will go into some of the specifics \nabout policy decisions that were made in the electricity section and \nalso give us detailed information about some of the tax policy, the tax \nincentives that were included in this bill.\n  I guess there is some sticker shock when we learn that the tax \nsection would actually wind up being some $23.5 billion. But it is a \ndiverse package and one that I do believe will produce more energy in \nthis country.\n  It has a lot of incentives. Some of them will not produce that much, \nand I acknowledge that. Some of it I would not have included. Probably \ntwo-thirds of it I would not have included. But this is the art of \nlegislating.\n  So I want to speak to the broader perspective of what we are doing.\n  We have not passed major energy legislation in the Congress for 10 \nyears. The truth is, we have done very little since 1979, when we were \ndealing with lines at gas stations and unreliability of supply. \nFrankly, it has not been getting better over the years. It is getting \nworse. We are becoming more and more and more reliant on foreign oil \nfor our energy needs--now well over 50 percent, probably headed for 60 \npercent. This is dangerous. We are relying on Saudi Arabia, Iraq, \nVenezuela, Nigeria, and other countries such as Canada and Mexico, \ncountries on which it makes me very nervous that we are dependent for \ntheir oil to power this country.\n  This issue is about the future of America. Are we going to continue \nto be dependent on this foreign oil and, if we are, what will that mean \nfor our economy if they decide to jack up the prices or cut off the \nsupply, or if there is a change of government that produces uncertainty \nas we have seen to a degree in Venezuela, not to mention Iraq, of \ncourse.\n  That leads to the national security aspects. If we don't have a \nreliable energy supply, it will affect our ability to power our ships, \nour planes. I thought it was so ironic last year that we were involved \nin a direct conflict with Iraq and yet we were winding up relying on \nIraqi oil which we brought to the United States, refined, and put in \nairplanes to bomb Baghdad. This is a dangerous situation.\n  What is the solution? Produce more energy supply of our own. The \nwhole package, not just oil but, yes, oil. We have a lot of oil in \nAmerica that is captured in these stripper wells, these small wells. We \nhave natural gas that we could produce more of. What we have done in \nAmerica is there is no incentive to produce it, and by the way, we have \nlocked up lots of it. You can't drill in most of the Gulf of Mexico, \nnot on the Atlantic or Pacific coasts, not in certain areas in the \nwest. So slowly but surely we have stopped production in America.\n  This bill will produce some more oil and natural gas. We will be able \nto have greater use of coal because we are going to put an investment \nin clean coal technology. We are going to have more hydropower and, \nyes, more nuclear power. The cleanest power producers are natural gas \nand nuclear power. Why don't we encourage more of that?\n  And we have lots of incentives in here for alternative fuels: \nethanol, biodiesel, whatever that is. We are going to use biomass, and \nsome of that will be done in my State. I don't think it is going to \nproduce a whole lot. I think it is going to eat up a lot of money. But \nwe will look for alternative fuels, and that is good. So that is part \n1: more production.\n  Some people say we don't need more production; we can conserve \nourselves into an energy policy. How ridiculous can you get. What are \nwe going to do, go back to just burning coal in the fireplaces? I used \nto have to bring in a scuttle of coal every morning before I went to \nschool, and I didn't like it. It was cold to bring in the coal, and it \nwas dirty burning. I never liked it. Well, what are we going to do? \nJust produce more blankets. They would probably be sent to us from \nChina.\n  Let's get real. In conservation, yes, give incentives to people to \nbetter insulate their homes and to maybe buy more fuel-efficient and \nbetter appliances that don't create pollution. Let's include that. More \nproduction: let's go after alternative fuels. Let's have conservation. \nLet's have the whole package.\n\n  What will be the result? America will be more secure. Our economy \nwill be stronger because this bill will produce jobs. You may say, \nwell, they are not real jobs or maybe they are temporary jobs. A job is \na job where I come from. Where I come from, if you want to eat and live \nand do well, you have to find a job. You take what you can get. This \nwill produce over 800,000 jobs. This is a jobs bill.\n  It is about the future reliability of our economy, about the future \nof our national security, and it is about jobs, which will help our \neconomy.\n  It is also about ensuring clean, affordable, and reliable energy--the \nwhole package. I think we have good legislation here. We do have \nincentives in it for ventures such as geothermal energy. That will \nbring a renewable energy online, could create a few hundred jobs. We \nalso are going to put a real emphasis on clean coal technology. We have \nan abundant supply of coal, and we are developing the technology to be \nable to use it, burn it, and in a clean way.\n\n[[Page S15110]]\n\n  I commend my colleagues for producing this bill. It is like every \nlegislative piece. It has a few warts on it. If you are expecting the \nperfect, this is not it. But we need to do this. We have been arguing \nabout it for 3 or 4 years. The things that held us back in the past we \ndid set aside. Now we are going to be able to get this legislation.\n  When you look back on this year, there is going to be a lot the \nSenate can take credit for having made a difference in the country--the \ntax bill, the partial-birth abortion legislation, energy legislation, \nand transportation bills.\n  I am glad we have this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support \nit. It will make a difference for the future.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison of Texas for putting together this \nopportunity for us to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \nSenator from Mississippi. He was on the conference committee. He worked \nhard, knows how hard the compromises were. I appreciate his leadership \nbecause we can't depend on foreign countries for 60 percent of our \nenergy needs and have a stable economy and keep the jobs we have and \ncreate more jobs for our recovery. I thank the Senator from Mississippi \nand the Senator from Oregon. The Senator from Oregon also has been a \nleader in this field. I appreciate so much his remarks and his \nleadership in this area.\n  I ask how much time remains in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes ten seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Santorum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/19/senate-section/article/S15110-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15110-S15111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas and thank \ncolleagues for their remarks this morning. I rise to talk about the \nMedicare prescription drug bill that is still being worked out. I think \nit needs to be stated that this is still a process. We have an \nagreement in principle, but there are still issues having to do with \nhow much the bill will cost and whether it is going to be within the \n$400 billion framework that has been laid out by both Houses of \nCongress and by the President. They are still working through that.\n  As a result, there will be some changes, probably, over the next 24 \nto 48 hours as to what this bill is going to look like in particular. \nBut we do have a sense of what the broad outlines are. I have to tell \nyou in all honesty, it is like any piece of legislation. There are some \nthings that I really like, and there are some things that are good and \nI am in favor of. There are some things I don't like, and there are \nsome things that I just darn well wish were not in the bill.\n  The question is, How do you come out? That is a decision that every \none of us is going to have to make on both sides of the aisle, because \nthere are things I am sure every Member in this Chamber can look at and \nsay: This is a good thing. The problem is, for about half of us who say \nit is a good thing, the other half will say it is a bad thing. But that \nis the nature of compromise. You try to come together to work out an \noverall package that is going to be beneficial to seniors, beneficial \nto taxpayers, and beneficial to the Medicare system over the long haul.\n  That is what I want to talk about today. I think on balance this is a \nbill that achieves that.\n  Let me lay out sort of my thoughts. No. 1, I am concerned with the \noverall Medicare system, the long-term health of that system. I think \nin part that is dependent upon the private sector system of this \ncountry upon which Medicare was built.\n  You have to remember, Medicare was built on a 1965 Blue Cross plan. \nThat was a private sector plan. The reason we are doing Medicare \nprescription drugs is because the private sector has been offering that \nfor some time. So Medicare tends to follow what the private sector \ndoes.\n  The question is, What is the private sector doing now? They are doing \na lot of managed care, HMOs, PPOs, and other things insurance companies \nare trying to do to try to get costs under control, to increase quality \nand efficiency.\n  Well, what are we trying to do with reforming the Medicare system? We \nare trying to put PPOs into Medicare. We already have some HMOs there. \nWe are trying to expand that. What we are trying to do here is to \nconform Medicare to sort of a current state of play, as it was in 1965, \nand we are trying to conform it to what is working best in the private \nsector today. So that is one of the objectives we are trying to \naccomplish.\n  This is my problem. I don't think, necessarily, that the current \nprivate sector--just as in 1965--is necessarily the most efficient way \nto run a health care system. I think there are fundamental underlying \nproblems in the health care system that we are paying the costs for \ntoday. That is why our health care costs continue to go up. I think the \nfundamental problem is that people are not paying for their health \ncare. When I say that, it is not that people are not paying for it \nthrough insurance. They are, and their premiums and copayments are \ngoing up to some degree.\n  The overall cost for employers is going up, no question. One of the \nreasons the cost is going up is that utilization is going up, is that \npeople's out-of-pocket expenditures don't conform to the benefit they \nare getting. In other words, they are paying $2 for $10 worth of \nservice. As long as you are paying $2 out of pocket for a $10 benefit, \nyou are probably going to continue to consume that benefit, \ndisproportionate to other activities where you put $2 out of pocket and \nget $2 of benefit. We have to change that dynamic in health care, while \nmaintaining insurance for people who need that coverage.\n  The way this bill does that is just crucial. One of the reasons I am \nvery excited about the bill is it puts in a provision called health \nsavings accounts, which sets up a system in the private sector--it is \nnot a Medicare provision but it is in the Medicare bill--it sets up a \nprivate sector reform to allow people to set up accounts so they can \ntake more responsibility and more control over their health care \nexpenditures. In a sense, by living healthier lives, by doing \npreventive care, doing all the things to maintain good health, they can \nactually save money and--this is the kicker--keep it. The insurance \ncompany doesn't benefit if you stay well and do the good things and you \ndon't end up in hospitals or having surgeries. You benefit.\n  So we are fundamentally changing the dynamic at the private sector, \npre-Medicare level. Why is that important? If this is successful--and I \nbelieve it will be--it becomes a building block for future reform of \nMedicare, because once the employee population with private sector \ninsurance, pre-Medicare, becomes used to and comfortable with this kind \nof program, they will be demanding it when we get to Medicare.\n  It will infuse in Medicare what I believe is ultimately necessary, \nwhich is more individual control and responsibility for their health \nexpenditures. So I argue that of all the things done, interestingly \nenough, in this Medicare bill, the most important thing I think we do, \nas a conservative, as somebody who believes in giving people more power \nand giving individuals more control, more choices, the most important \nthing we do in the Medicare bill isn't in Medicare but it is going to \nbe a dramatic impact on it when the baby boomers retire and the costs \ngo out of control.\n\n  I make the argument--and we can get into the details of the Medicare \nbill--from the standpoint of a Republican conservative and to \nconservatives across this country, what we are doing with the reform in \nhealth savings accounts--they used to be referred to as medical savings \naccounts--is probably the most important, I argue, for the long-term \nfuture of Medicare because, as I said before, Medicare reform follows \nprivate sector reform. When the private sector changes, eventually \nMedicare will change to reflect that because that is what the public \nwill want and demand.\n  Within the Medicare system, we do put some reforms into place that \nare important. We have the reforms to Medicare Part B. We do put a \nMedicare drug bill in. Some people are saying: Well, as a conservative \nRepublican, why do you want to put in a $400 billion new entitlement?\n  The fact is, we have a health care system that doesn't cover health \ncare\n\n[[Page S15111]]\n\nexpenses. If we have a health insurance system that doesn't cover 50 \npercent or, in some cases, more than 50 percent of the actual costs \nmost people consume in health care expenditures, what kind of health \ncare system is it, as far as insurance is concerned? It is not a very \ngood one.\n  Again, some Republicans are saying, well, we should be doing what the \nmarket is doing. Well, what the market did was cover drug costs. For us \nnot to do that--I think it is a little disingenuous to make the \nargument that we should not take on this liability. I agree we need to \nhave reforms and control costs, but we need to take on this \nresponsibility because it is part and parcel of good quality health \ncare in America today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In a very productive way, it highlights the issues that we \nwill continue to debate and discuss over the next several days.\n  As I mentioned earlier this morning, the plans are to address the \nissues of the Energy bill, as well as the Medicare bill, as well as the \nappropriations bills, over the next several days and bring them to the \nfloor as soon as possible, as soon as they are ready, so we can proceed \nwith this debate in an orderly fashion.\n  As I mentioned earlier this morning, the plans will be to work \nthrough this week and through the weekend and, hopefully, that will be \nit.

Mr. President, at this point, I move to proceed to the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 6), to enhance \nenergy conservation and research and development, to provide for \nsecurity and diversity in the energy supply for the American people, \nand for other purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede \nfrom its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to the \nsame, with an amendment, signed by a majority of the conferees on the \npart of both Houses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  (The text of the conference report is printed in the proceedings of \nthe House in the Record of November 17, 2003.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to first say to the Senate, a \nlittle over a year ago the Senate changed committees and I had the \nluxury of moving from the Budget Committee to the Energy Committee--\nperhaps not a luxury in everyone's sense but from my standpoint it was, \nindeed, a great opportunity and a tremendous change for me. I took that \nopportunity with a great deal of relish and enthusiasm and decided I \nwould do the very best I could to produce an energy policy, broad \nbased, for this country.\n  The House agreed on that conference report yesterday by an \noverwhelming vote. That means that one body has looked at that \nconference report and, with bipartisan support, said this is a good \npolicy for the United States to follow in the future, and it will do \ngood things for our people and for our growth and development.\n  The United States of America spends annually $440 billion, roughly--\nand that is on the low side--on energy. That energy is the underpinning \nof our economy and is a principal component of our quality of life. For \nmost Americans, the complex system of energy production and \ndistribution is something they take for granted. When they turn on the \nlights every morning, they give absolutely no thought to the turbines \npowered by coal, gas, oil, hydropower, or nuclear power spinning around \nto produce that electricity. Only during hurricanes or blackouts are \nthey reminded of how complex the system of transmission lines is that \nbrings that power to their homes and to their businesses sometimes \nacross many States.\n\n  Americans almost never give a thought to the fact that beyond the \ncomplex physical system that produces and generates our energy is a \nmassively complex system of rules and regulations. These rules and \nregulations govern, one, who pays for power and who pays for the \npowerplants and transmission lines; two, how the emission from the \nplants is regulated; three, who can own them; four, how the fuels can \nbe shipped; and five, what costs can be charged and to whom.\n  Some of my colleagues are critical of this legislation. Who would not \nexpect that to be? This bill is put together by the House and the \nSenate, each with different ideas about what they think is the best way \nto solve our problems, if we can. Clearly, each body has strong \nfeelings about certain issues that they match up when we attempt to \nmove ahead in some positive direction.\n  Some will get up here in the next couple of days and argue about some \nof the provisions in this bill. I say right now to the Senate and to \nthe American people, some of the provisions that will be argued I agree \nwith. Some of the provisions I don't agree with; that is, some that \npeople suggest should be changed in this bill. But I remind everyone \nthat we didn't get to this point without giving and taking, without \nputting and taking back, without arguing one way and then not winning \nit and having to go the other way. I suggest that everybody in this \nbody knows--and if they don't right now, they will soon--that across \nthis land there are millions of farmers, who farm all kinds of \nproducts, who are either up here on the Hill or on the telephones \ntalking about passing this bill because it has a giant provision to \nconvert corn and related products of our country over time to ethanol \nwhich will, in turn, be used in our automobiles in lieu of gasoline \nthat comes from crude oil.\n  We in the Senate, I say to my good friend, were led in those \nnegotiations for ethanol by the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley. He has been a staunch advocate, along with the minority \nleader, Senator Daschle, for a major American ethanol program. I can \ntell my colleagues that in negotiating with the House, they weren't as \nexcited about the program, the project, or the size as we were under \nthe leadership of Senator Grassley. So to get what we wanted, we had to \nask them what they wanted. They didn't wait around for us to ask. That \nis sort of a way of saying it. They told us what they needed. In other \nwords, they said: You want that, we want something.\n  I will tell my colleagues shortly of the numerous provisions they \nwanted that are in this bill that brought us forth today with the most \nsignificant program for farmers and the production of ethanol to take \nthe place of crude oil that we have ever had in this country.\n  Let me proceed with my original thoughts and then move over to the \nsubject matter which has brought a number of people into a state of \nopposition to this bill. Let me complete a few thoughts.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill will cost \n$26 billion over 10 years. Some people have much bigger numbers, but \nwhat they are talking about in those numbers is not where we have \nobligated the expenditure of funds. They are authorized. They are to be \nfunded, if ever, later. They are statements of policy, but not \nstatements of policy accompanied by programs that must be paid for.\n\n  What I am talking about is $26 billion that has to do with the taxes \nthat are included in this bill. That averages $2.6 billion a year. \nPeople can talk about\n\n[[Page S15112]]\n\nhow much we are spending and who we are giving it to, and I remind them \none more time, America at work, day by day, spends about $440 billion \nannually on electricity. We, who were charged in our committee with \nmaking things better for the future, said let's have some production \ntax credits and the like to bring on more energy and cause more \nalternatives. If we took that number of $2.6 billion per year on \naverage, and then figure that up against $440 billion a year, it would \nseem to me that some might say: You didn't do enough; you can't move \nthis system with that little tiny bit of money.\n  I will, before we are finished, calculate this over 10 years. I will \ntake $440 billion times 10 and then the little bit we are spending, and \nthe number will then be such a tiny number that people will wonder \nwhether we can really get much done. I think we can.\n  In exchange for that investment of about one-half of 1 percent, in \nsummary, for there is time to go into detail, we will diversify our \nresources of electricity to build new, clean coal-burning powerplants, \nsolar facilities, relicense our hydropower, and build new geothermal \nplants and, yes, perhaps build some nuclear powerplants.\n  For the same one-half of 1 percent, we will impose mandatory \nreliability standards on our transmission systems to ensure that \nblackouts, such as the one in August, will not occur again.\n  This legislation will also streamline the permitting process for oil \nand gas production on Federal lands. I want to be clear that this \nlegislation does not change the standards. We are not reducing the \nrequirements to produce energy on Federal properties, but we require \nFederal agencies to coordinate so that the regulatory process is more \nstraightforward. I would think anybody would expect that of us in these \ndays when we have shortages and when we have resources of our own.\n  This bill did not shy away from controversy. Some of the most \ndifficult issues we faced were the regional differences on how to \nregulate electricity generation and transmission. This Nation is \ndivided on the issue. If they are not divided, it is because they don't \nknow the issue. But if they knew the issue, they would be divided, and \nthat is unavoidable.\n  As I have said before, if I could have written four different laws, \ncutting our country into four pieces, we could have provided each \nregion of the country its own set of laws. But we cannot do that.\n  There is one America, not four. We were asked to write a reform of \nthe Federal Power Act for the whole country. So without the luxury of \ndoing it in pieces, we think we have achieved a fair middle ground.\n  In exchange for compromise, all market participants can now conduct \ntheir business understanding what rules and regulations will be \napplicable. I believe that certainty will allow new capital to enter \nthe electricity transmission business and encourage new construction \nand thereby create a more reliable transmission grid.\n  In some cases, I wish we could have done more. I think it is known \nthat I support the opening of ANWR. I wish we could have had it in \nhere, but we know the bill could not have passed with it. In addition, \nI wish we could have inventoried the resources of the Outer Continental \nShelf, just to know what we own, but the House would not hear of that \neither. However, to the extent possible, the conference report avoids \nthose two issues and issues of that type.\n  There are some issues this conference report contains that concern my \ncolleagues, and I have heard much about them already. I want to take a \nvisit to one of those.\n  First, there is an issue that is called MTBE. Those provisions were \nnot in the Senate bill but the House was adamant about the provision. \nSimilarly, the House insisted on an amendment called the bump-up \nprovision. They made a case and then they voted again on that case on \nthe floor of the House and repeated their support of it overwhelmingly. \nIn due course, if we want a discussion of it, we can have it.\n  While these provisions are controversial, I am convinced the policy \nbehind them is sound, and I will discuss them in detail as we debate \neach provision.\n  This bill is not just about producing energy. To the extent we can, \nwe try to save energy. Some wish we could have done something more \nradical, such as imposing very high CAFE standards for automobiles. \nThat continues to come up when we are asked how much gasoline are we \ngoing to save and how much oil will we import, how much will that be \nreduced.\n  I say, we will do whatever the Senate and/or the House would vote \nfor, and everybody knows they will not vote for changes in the existing \nlaw with reference to automobiles. That is not a question of copping \nout, it is a question of taking the vote and finding there are not the \nvotes.\n  So for those who would like to say we should have done something in \nthat area, I think it is fair to say they either know something none of \nus knows about--they have a secret weapon to get the votes--or they are \njust making a statement to make this effort look less effective.\n  We know neither the House nor the Senate has the will to modify the \nCAFE standards to any significant degree. We have done everything else \nwe could do short of that. I am a pragmatist, but I believe this bill \nwill indicate we will go only so far and then we have to draw a line \nand say that is as far as we will go.\n  We did what was politically feasible. We increase efficiency \nstandards for appliances, Federal buildings, and we provide tax \nincentives to use fuel-efficient cars and to build energy-efficient \nbuildings. Many of these are not new and have been espoused by others \nbefore me as part of an energy program, including many of them by \nSenator Bingaman heretofore.\n  This bill is an investment. It will pay off in affordable, reliable \nenergy that will underpin our economy. It will pay through savings we \nare going to enjoy from increased energy efficiency, and this bill is \none-half of 1 percent investment in our economy and our future. I think \nit is worth it. There is no doubt in my mind that if we do this, the \ncountry will be much safer, much better off in the years to come. After \nall, if one takes on a job such as this, they can end up saying they at \nleast have done that. Much more cannot be asked for.\n\n  I wish to comment on MTBE. MTBE was a product authorized by the \nUnited States of America years ago to be used in the process of \noxidation in this country. It was an acceptable product to be used in a \nregulated manner. Many companies did that. Some companies did not use \nit correctly and may have violated rules, may have been negligent, may \nhave thrown it around, may have spilled it where it should not be, but \nthe House had in mind--and we had no alternative but to agree in order \nto get the rest of this bill--that for those companies that produced a \nvalid, legal product and used it validly and legally, they should not \nbe liable if there are damages that are forthcoming.\n  I might say to the Chair and all Senators, the same thing is going to \napply to ethanol.\n  Now, going back to MTBE, it is a prescribed product. The U.S. \nGovernment prescribed it and authorized it. This bill says if it is \nused improperly, the companies are liable. If it is used properly, this \nsays lawsuits do not lie for damages.\n  I have heard many Senators come to the floor and abhor lawsuits that \nseek damages from companies for products they produced that were legal \nand valid but some damage occurred to somebody through no fault of the \nproduct, of the production of the product or its proper use. I have \nheard Senators on my side of the aisle say it is time we stop those \nkinds of suits; those are lawyers just trying to attack, sue, and gain \nbig settlements. In this case, we decided that for using the product \nimproperly, lawsuits can maintain; for using it properly, lawsuits \ncannot be maintained.\n  I am very sorry there are Senators in this room whose States either \nwere or are ready to file lawsuits claiming damages. There is surely \nnothing new about that, for I am sure, just as sure as I am standing \nhere, that if this does not become law, there will be hundreds of them \nfiled across this land. I do not think they are justified under the \ntheory I have expressed and the theory the House expressed to us. \nNonetheless, it is probably one of the most contentious issues in this \nbill.\n  I suggest that it seems to this Senator we ought to look at the \noverall bill. The overall bill--I cannot do justice to it in 8 minutes, \nbut I can tell\n\n[[Page S15113]]\n\nyou one more time, in summary--will make America stronger, will \nminimize our dependence upon foreign products, in particular should \nmake us less and less dependent upon the potential of foreign natural \ngas being needed in this great economy. We are moving rapidly in that \ndirection.\n\n  The last 15 powerplants in America were built with natural gas. If we \nbuild 15 or 20 more, just as certain as I am standing here, we will be \nimporting gas from overseas. So we will just get out of the muddle of \nimporting crude oil and we will have sat by and watched ourselves get \nback into the middle of importing natural gas.\n  We have done everything we can, that we could come up with, that we \ncould understand, that we could be informed on, that says America is \ngoing to produce as much natural gas as possible. As a matter of fact, \nthings indeed could work out under this bill where Alaska--not ANWR but \nAlaska--could be selling natural gas to the lower 48 in large \nquantities.\n  We have given some tax credits to companies that would do that. We \nare all hopeful that before too much time passes they will agree to get \nstarted.\n  In addition, we have said there is a great deal of natural gas that \nlies off the shores of America in valid, not prohibited areas, very \ndeep. We have said: Why isn't it getting produced? It is gas; we can \nuse it; it is ours.\n  The issue was it was too expensive. We chose in this bill to do what \neverybody on this conference overwhelmingly supported and that was to \nsubstantially reduce the royalty payments so as to make that abundant \nnatural gas available. We believe with the passage of this bill they \nwill be out there drilling for that, adding it to America's reserves, \nquickly.\n  There are many more issues like that. I regret we could not produce a \nbill that would alter the current makeup of the use of fuel in America \nto produce energy and electricity without some stimulating and some \nproduction tax credits that would go to the industries that were not \ncurrently involved in producing energy for the American mix.\n  Incidentally, in that regard, we produced a tax credit for wind and \nsolar energy the likes of which will yield wind energy for America in \nabundance. I ran into a gentleman yesterday whose company produces \nwindmills and wind energy for America. He thanked me for this bill. I \ndon't know him. I didn't know him. I met him right there. He said he \nwas visiting with a few Senators just to make sure they understood that \nwith this bill wind and solar energy will continue as they are but will \nstrive to move ahead exponentially.\n  He said: I currently produce more wind energy than anyone, and we \nwill be able to double and triple it with this bill because there is a \ngood credit that is going to continue under this bill.\n  Incidentally, for those who want that, you should know if this bill \ndoesn't pass, that tax credit is gone. You can wish all you want about \nwind energy, if that is what you like, but by not passing this bill you \nwill have wished that away. It will not be part of any mix for the \nfuture.\n  In my judgment, when you add up all those pluses and you take all the \nnegatives that are going to be spoken of here, you have a bill that \ndeserves the U.S. Senate follow suit with the House and approve this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Parliamentary inquiry: I have not been able to locate this \nbill. I understand under rule XI the bill should be printed. I \nunderstand it may be printed in the House calendar, but I am interested \nto know whether or not printing in the House Journal represents having \nthe bill before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I have been informed that the bill is printed \nin the Congressional Record.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does that qualify as having the bill before the Senate for \npurposes of debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it does.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bingaman for a chance to \ntalk for a few minutes now. He has done a tremendous job in terms of \nadvocating so many issues vital to the public, and I thank him for his \nthoughtfulness letting me begin this debate.\n  Throughout this discussion, we have been told this legislation should \nnot be looked at in terms of any particular provision, but it should be \nevaluated on its overall merit. We heard that yesterday. We heard that \nagain today.\n  We have been told that a conference report, particularly, is part of \na give-and-take kind of discussion among various legislators and the \nvarious parties. Let me be real clear on that. If we are using the \ngive-and-take measure as a barometer of evaluating an Energy bill, it \nought to be clear that on this one, it is the public that is giving, \nand the powerful and the influential are taking a whole package of \ngoodies.\n  In my view, if you look at this legislation and its provisions that \nin effect begin with the ``get out of jail free'' card that is given to \nthe MTBE producers, and you go on to this grab bag of tax goodies that \nare given to powerful interests, on every measure this overall \nlegislation breaches the fundamental principles of good energy policy.\n  Let me begin by talking about how it would affect our dependence on \nforeign oil. I believe reducing America's dependence on foreign oil is \nthe dipstick for measuring an Energy bill. By that measure, this \nlegislation is more than several quarts low. Thirty years ago the \npeople of this country waited in long lines to fill up their tanks. \nThey dreamed then of the day when the United States would no longer be \ndependent on foreign oil. Our citizens were asked to hold their \nthermostats down, and they said: What is going to be done to make this \ncountry and our electric supply less dependent on fossil fuels?\n  We all understand our dependence on foreign oil has increased. Fossil \nfuels still provide more than 85 percent of all the energy produced in \nthe United States. If you look at this legislation, what it does is it \ngives, on a virtual 5 to 1 ratio, most of the tax relief to those \npowerful interests that, in my view, have contributed mightily to the \nmess that our country is in.\n  What is needed, of course, is a bold and aggressive approach in terms \nof clean and renewable energy. That is regrettably sorely lacking in \nthis legislation.\n  So the Senate is aware exactly of the numbers: Renewable energy in \nthis legislation gets about $3.4 billion over the next 10 years. The \ncombined credits for those involved in fossil fuels comes to well over \n$15 billion.\n  I am of the view that when you look at this legislation and the fact \nthat it does virtually nothing in terms of the key areas like \ntransportation to promote conservation and help us find a way to a \ndifferent energy future. This legislation simply does not meet the need \nat this time for a fresh approach in energy.\n  What is so unfortunate about it is, I believe, a new approach on \nenergy is just about the most patriotic thing our country could do. We \nall understand the role of oil and energy dependence with respect to \nglobal security. Yet this legislation is basically a tribute to \nyesteryear, a hodgepodge of subsidies for the well connected, and these \nhuge energy conglomerates basically would get additional funds for what \nthey are already doing.\n  We tried over the last couple of days to amend the legislation. On \nall of the pro-consumer amendments, they were just gunned down almost \nin a perfunctory manner. The American people were given 2 days to scan \n1,100 pages, more than 40 percent of which by some estimates was brand \nnew text that was not in either the House or the Senate bill. \nEssentially, we have 500 pages of brand new text that had not been seen \nby either the Senate or the House.\n  For purposes of this opening discussion, let me talk about some of \nthe areas about which I am particularly concerned.\n  The people of my part of the country were shellacked by the Enron \nscams. One of our major utilities used up hundreds of thousands of \ndollars of scores of workers' retirement accounts. Now these workers \nhave virtually nothing as a result of Enron. The conference report did \nvirtually nothing to deal with the market manipulation that went on in \nthe Enron case--all of the smoking gun memos we read about in the \npapers for days involving Death Star, the Ricochet tactics that were \nused to drive\n\n[[Page S15114]]\n\nup market prices, the energy traders who used schemes such as Get \nShorty or use a Fat Boy to manipulate energy markets with impunity.\n  What this legislation does, in effect, is say we will ban just one of \nthe manipulative practices used in Enron but for everything else you \nhave free rein to manipulate the American consumer. It is sort of like \nbuilding a 4-inch dam across our mighty Columbia; you stop one \nrelatively small practice, but it is going to be drowned out by all the \nother manipulative schemes.\n  In my view, this legislation is an open invitation to future Enrons.\n  With respect to other priorities about which we felt strongly, I \ntried, for example, to prevent the weakening of current export controls \non highly enriched uranium. It seems astounding that at a time when \nPresident Bush correctly talked about how important it is to fight \nterrorism--and we have all been concerned about yellowcake.\n  I sit on the Intelligence Committee. Of course, I can't get into what \nis discussed there. But I don't think anybody in the United States \ndoubts the seriousness of the terrorist threat around the world. \nControls in current law are intended to end the dependence of foreign \ncompanies on nuclear-bomb-grade materials, but the conference report, \nincredible as it may seem, goes in just the opposite direction and is \ngoing to make it easier for terrorists to traffic in these nuclear-\nbomb-grade materials.\n  The conference report would give foreign producers a fresh 9-year \nholiday on converting highly enriched uranium into the much safer low-\nenriched uranium, a conversion, in my view, that should have happened \nyears ago. I fought in the conference to keep in place the current \nexport controls on highly enriched uranium. I believe had my amendment \npassed, it would have empowered President Bush to be able to fulfill \nhis goal of keeping nuclear materials out of the hands of terrorists. \nUnfortunately, this too went down on strictly party lines.\n  There are other areas with respect to pro-consumer amendments I \nthought were important which I will discuss briefly.\n  Many of our parts of the country have been subjected to price spikes \nin the gasoline market. We saw last summer that many consumers were \nspending more than $2 a gallon for gas. In parts of the Southwest, it \nwas up to $4 per gallon for gas.\n  I sought to give the Federal Trade Commission authority to go after \ndocumented anti-consumer practices such as redlining and zone pricing. \nAt present, every time there is a price spike, Secretary of Energy \nSpencer Abraham most recently put out various kinds of press releases \nsaying they are doing an inquiry into why gasoline prices have spiked \nup. Just as sure as the night follows the day, the next time there is a \nprice spike we will hear the very same thing from the Secretary of \nEnergy.\n\n  The fact is when you look at the statutes on the books, you will find \nthat the Secretary of Energy has absolutely no authority to do anything \nwith respect to skyrocketing gasoline prices.\n  What I have sought to do in the conference and over the last few \nmonths is give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to go after \ndocumented anti-competitive practices in markets where you basically \nhave three or possibly four of the oil companies controlling more than \n60 percent of the gas that is sold in this area.\n  Many Members of the Senate represent just those communities--\ncommunities where in effect you have seen the competitive marketplace \nforces sucked right out of the gasoline markets in their communities. \nUnfortunately, that too was rejected on a straight party line vote.\n  In addition, I offered an amendment to create an advocate for the \nenergy consumer. I believed that if you were going to have a whole \npassel of deregulation and regulatory changes, somebody ought to have \nthe authority to stand up for the consumer. The great majority of our \nStates do exactly that. We all understand that the energy markets have \nchanged. Now there is much more being done in terms of interstate \ntrading of energy, and there is nothing the States could do to go after \nabuses in the interstate trading of wholesale power.\n  In the conference, I offered an amendment. I made it clear I was \nwilling to work with both Republican chairs, Senator Domenici and \nCongressman Tauzin, on it. Yet that went nowhere as well despite \nbipartisan support.\n  Pat Wood, head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, thought \nit was ``a great idea'' to have an advocate--those are his words, not \nmine--for the consumer. Regrettably, that idea went nowhere as well.\n  I have talked about what the conference report doesn't do. I want to \ntalk for a few minutes about what it does do. It gives, for example, \noil and gas extractors a blanket exemption under the Safe Drinking \nWater Act from pumping noxious and carcinogenic fluids underground. It \ngives energy producers immunity from Clean Water Act protection to \npresent contaminated storm water runoff from polluting our lakes, \nstreams, and marshes. It gives $30 million to a whole host of mining \ninterests to pursue direct leaching of radioactive mine tailings into \nthe ground.\n  In other words, the conference report either explicitly allows or it \npays to create America's future Superfund sites.\n  I have talked about the get-out-of-jail-free card for the MTBE \nproducers. This in effect would allow these producers protection from \nlawsuits that forced them to clean up the problem they created.\n  In our State, even Republicans in the State legislature are concerned \nabout not only losing the ability to fund MTBE cleanup in Oregon but \nthey are concerned about the precedent it sets for future cleanup of \nvarious other dangerous materials such as perchlorate and TCE.\n  I think this is part of what concerns me the most. I have always \nbelieved that anything important in this town has to be done on a \nbipartisan basis. It is probably the concern I have that has dominated \nmy career in public service. I think we had an opportunity for a \nbipartisan bill in this area. As I have been able to do in my home \nState with our colleague, Senator Smith, I think there was an \nopportunity for common ground on a whole host of key kinds of cases \nthat would have laid out a vision for a very different energy future. \nBut essentially what you had for weeks and weeks was a blackout. You \nhad energy blackouts last summer with respect to this legislation. \nSenator Bingaman and I and others who were in the conference faced an \ninformation blackout. Any time you go behind closed doors, any time you \ndo something along the lines of a conference in secret, it is an \ninvitation to special interests to exploit their clout and their \ninfluence. That is exactly what has happened here.\n\n  I will outline one other provision. I know colleagues are waiting, \nand I am particularly grateful to Senator Bingaman for this chance to \ntake a few minutes at the outset of the debate and touch on the \nproposal with respect to standard market design.\n  In our part of the world, in my home state, we have the highest \nunemployment rate in the country. Reasonable energy prices have been a \nkey to our well-being. What we have now in this legislation is a \nglidepath to set up something called standard market design, a one-\nsize-fits-all approach with respect to energy regulation.\n  I come to that view because there are two provisions in the report \nand they are essentially contradictory in nature. The first part of the \nconference report says you cannot engage in a standard market design \nregulatory regime in effect until 2007. The second part says it is \nbasically OK for FERC to do anything they want. At a minimum, we have a \nlawyer's full employment program as a result of this regulatory limbo. \nBut what is more likely to happen, because of the power of the \ninterests that want the standard market design, they are going to \nexploit the regulatory confusion in this legislation to work their \nwill.\n  On September 30th I received a letter from a Republican FERC \ncommissioner, Joseph Kelliher, in which he explicitly told me that \nstandard market design is a bad idea for Oregon, a bad idea for the \nPacific Northwest, and should not be implemented in our region.\n  I say to the people of my State and my region, I am still going to \nfight this with everything I have.\n  Finally, at a time when our country can be held hostage by oil-\nproducing\n\n[[Page S15115]]\n\nnations, we had a chance to go forward with legislation that would make \nus truly energy independent. At a time when cutting-edge renewable \nresources are at our fingertips, what this conference report does is it \nlets these exciting technologies slip through our fingers. At a time \nwhen the people of our country have been clamoring for a fresh \napproach, a different energy future, this conference report looks at \nenergy policy through the rearview mirror. I hope my colleagues will \nreject this conference report and look forward over the rest of this \nday and perhaps others to talk about it at some length.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to raise my serious concerns with \nthis piece of legislation. I appreciate the excellent statement of the \nSenator from Oregon which touched on a number of the issues this \nlegislation raises.\n  The purpose of an energy policy should be, obviously, to make our \nNation more independent of international fuels, to allow energy to be \nmore readily available, and allow more productivity in our society as a \nresult of having energy at a reasonable cost.\n  There are a number of ways to approach this. Any energy policy should \nbe balanced. First, it forces conservation. Any energy policy should \nsignificantly encourage Americans, and Americans in business \nespecially, to use appropriate conservation which does not undermine \nlifestyle dramatically and does not undermine efficiency but, rather, \nimproves efficiency in order to reduce the amount of energy used.\n  Second, after conservation, we should use energy products which are \nrenewable, things we can use over and over or at least produce over and \nover and as a result not be so dependent on international sources of \noil.\n  Third, of course, is production. We should increase production, \nespecially production within the United States or within regions which \nthe United States has a relationship which is more positive and \nconstructive than the Middle East and other areas of significant \ninternational attention.\n  Good energy policy requires those three elements. However, the bill \nbefore the Senate does not accomplish that. It does have some \nconservation. It does have some renewable language and it does, \nobviously, have some production language but on balance it does not \nhave any of those at a level of intensity or effort, at least in a \nconstructive way, that outweighs what is basically a grab bag of \nspecial interest projects directed at benefiting one segment of the \neconomy or one segment of the population at the expense of other \nsegments of the population.\n  There are a lot of examples of this. The most significant is the \noverall cost of the bill. This bill was suppose to have $8 billion of \ntax credits in it and it is up to $25 billion. That difference between \n$8 billion and $25 billion is almost entirely filled not by a broad \napproach to energy policy but by very targeted, very specific \nprogrammatic initiatives directed at certain interest groups in order \nto give them benefits to pervert the marketplace, to basically say: \nHere is a winner; everyone else is a loser.\n  The most classic example is the ethanol package which makes up one of \nthe biggest initiatives in this bill. It is hard to figure out how much \nsubsidy is in this bill for ethanol but it is huge. We know there is at \nleast $5.9 billion, which is double the present subsidy, and we know on \ntop of that there is probably $2.5 billion of tax credit. That is \nprobably not all, and as people review this bill, we will find it is \neven more obscene than that. This is more a product which cannot stand \non its own, a product which essentially has been brought to the \nmarketplace because it has been subsidized at such a high level and \nbecause it is now, by law, required to be used, it therefore becomes \nviable. It does not become viable because it can compete in the \nmarketplace--even with lower subsidies.\n  Some modicum of subsidy might make sense but to basically take a \nproduct and say, we essentially are going to pay more for it than it \nprobably costs to produce and we are going to require that it then be \nused, is hardly a subsidy. It is basically, to be honest, a socialistic \napproach to managing an economy. The ``pick a winner'' and decide that \nwinner, whether it works or not, will be paid for, and then you \nsubsidize it at an extraordinary level.\n\n  There are, of course, a variety of different projects in here which \nare essentially projects in home States, projects of people who are \nfriends of somebody, projects of people who happen to be able to get \ninto that room that the Senator from Oregon mentioned was closed to \nmost Members.\n  We have the advance reactor hydrogen cogeneration project for $1.1 \nbillion. This appears to be not only for building of the plant but for \nthe operating of the plant, which is an incredible concept. First, the \ntaxpayers will pay to build this plant and then the taxpayers are going \nto pay to operate the plant. I am wondering what the purpose of the \nplant could be that has any commercial interests at all and the \ntaxpayers are picking up $1.1 billion for construction and building \ncosts.\n  We have $2 billion to pay for companies to assist them in phasing out \nMTBE, which is something I will get back to, but there is an irony in \nthat because, of course, the bill limits the liability of those \ncustomers and then it pays out the program.\n  We have authorized loan guarantees for using certain types of coal \nthat come from the Midwest and to build a plant in the Midwest which \ndoes not even exist. Basically, we are going to say, there will be a \nplant out there somewhere and we will put this money into it to build \nit. We do not know where the plant will be. We suspect it will be in \nNorth Dakota. It is a new concept in taking care of one's constituency \nto essentially create a plant somewhere in theory. It is a virtual \nplant that we are going to spend all this money on, and I guess in \ntoday's world of virtual reality it is probably appropriate that this \nbill have some virtual things in it because it does not have much else \nbecause the rest of the bill is equally unsubstantive.\n  As to the abandoned mines provision in this bill, we are essentially \ngoing to take an account which was supposed to help in cleaning up the \nmines which were used in the West, and we are going to take the money \nout of that account and we will redirect it so, basically, none of \nthose dollars will flow into the cleanup which they are allegedly being \nraised for.\n  We have a proposal to build some sort of green shopping centers, \nwhatever those are. That is a great concept. I always wanted to build a \ngreen shopping center. I like blue, purple, yellow. Why did we leave \nthose colors out? We are gone to build a green shopping mall in \nShreveport, LA. We are going to build a green shopping center in \nAtlanta. We are going to build a green shopping mall in Syracuse. And \nthe taxpayers are going to pay for that.\n  Building shopping centers is a new concept for energy, for having a \nnational energy policy.\n  We will spend a lot of time on this over the next week as we debate \nthis bill, because it will take at least a week to do this bill. The \nmost significant detriment in this bill is the fact that it is \nessentially structured to benefit one region of the country \nsignificantly over another region of the country.\n\n  It is almost a gratuitous attack on the Northeast from the standpoint \nof the way it has been put together. The most glaring example of that \nis the way this MTBE issue is handled.\n  MTBE is an additive put in gasoline. It was decided by the EPA, in \nthe early 1990s, that this additive should be put in gasoline to make \nit oxidate faster, thus getting cleaner burning gasoline and reducing \nair pollution.\n  It turns out one of the unintended consequences of this legitimate \ndesire to make gasoline burn faster is it is an incredible pollutant, \nan extremely difficult pollutant to deal with if it gets in the \ngroundwater.\n  So States which were put under the authority of the EPA to clean \ntheir air, and which were then required, in order to accomplish this, \nto essentially use this additive, now find that although their air may \nbe marginally cleaner, their groundwater is dramatically more polluted.\n  If you have ever been in a house--and I have been in a number of \nthem--that has an MTBE pollution issue, it is essentially unlivable. \nYou cannot use the shower, you cannot use the sinks, the smell is just \noverwhelming, and the\n\n[[Page S15116]]\n\nwater cannot be drunk. It cannot be put on your body to clean. It is a \nhorrific situation.\n  People in community after community in my State--small communities, \ncul-de-sacs, groups of homes--have found they are basically unable to \nlive in those houses until the water system has been fundamentally \nrepaired. Sometimes you have to bring in new water because they are on \nwells in order to address the pollution coming from MTBE.\n  Thirty-three percent of one of my counties has a serious problem of \nMTBE pollution, and the percentages are in the midteens and higher in \nother towns, counties. So it is a serious environmental hazard.\n  Yet this bill says we will continue to use it and States that are \nunder these orders will have to continue to use it for another period \nof years, increasing the amount of pollution.\n  Then this bill does one more thing that is really--I already used \nthis term once, so I hate to use it again, but really is a gratuitous \nshot. It says States which have pursued a legal remedy for the damage \ncaused by MTBE will no longer be able to pursue those lawsuits.\n  This bill--because somebody got in that room the Senator from Oregon \nwas talking about got somebody's ear--has language in it which \nspecifically goes back before the lawsuits were brought by some of the \nNew England States and eliminates the ability of those suits to go \nforward.\n  Now, when I was in law school that would be called an ex post facto \nlaw and would be subject to some significant debate. However, \nobviously, the people who drafted this have figured out a way around \nthat ex post facto attack, and they figure they are going to survive \nthis attack and, therefore, they are going to eliminate the capacity of \nStates such as New Hampshire to try to get redress on the issue of the \nfact that in some counties, up to 33 percent of the water is not usable \nbecause of the MTBE pollution.\n  It is a truly ironic situation that this has happened, that a bill \nproposed to reduce our reliance on energy would have innumerable \nspecial initiatives in it that have no relationship to actually \nincreasing energy production but actually perverts the marketplace, \nand, on top of that, would take a policy which is being debated in the \ncourt system between the States and the producers and essentially wipes \nthat policy, which is in an environmental fight, off the books in an \nattempt to protect those industries which produce this product.\n\n  We heard the Senator from New Mexico defend the position on the \ngrounds that--I believe he used the term--I have it right here; I wrote \nit down because it is a unique term.\n  Well, I guess I can't find it right now. Anyway, it was a term that I \nfound interesting because it basically implied that well, really, \nStates should not be able to bring these lawsuits. These people should \njust have to have this groundwater pollution. And, what the heck, why \nnot do it? Why not protect these companies from that sort of pollution \nforever?\n  Well, I think you do not protect them because, as a practical matter, \nyou let the court decide whether the liability exists in this instance. \nThis is not a question that is appropriate to this Energy bill, to say \nthe least. It is, in fact, a question which should have been allowed to \nbe resolved by the New England States as they dealt with this question \nof MTBE pollution in groundwater.\n  So this bill has some very serious problems independent of the fact \nthat it is philosophically wrong, that it takes a marketplace, and does \nso much tweaking of the marketplace that you have no longer any \nsemblance of market force in the issue of the production of energy. You \nsimply have a grab bag of winners and losers.\n  The grab bag is unique. It really is unique. I would have loved to \nhave had a fly on the wall in that room because there must have been \njust a parade of people coming in and out who had their special \nprojects.\n  I remember this happened once before back in 1979 or 1980 when we \nwere just coming out of the energy crisis of the 1970s, and we had the \nArab oil embargo, and we decided to put money into trying to pick \nwinners and losers in oil production. We put money into shale oil and \nwe put money into wind and we put money into solar. At the time, I \nsupported a lot of that exercise and said, well, that is something we \nought to try.\n  Unfortunately, what we failed to recognize was unless the market \nmakes the product viable, it usually never works. That has been proven \nbecause all those initiatives--synthetic fuels, shale oil, things like \nthat--have fallen by the wayside simply because they were not \ncompetitive in the marketplace.\n  So to abandon the market and to pick winners and losers is not that \ngreat a policy approach to the issue of energy. It is better to level \nthe playing field and give the producers the opportunity to choose \nthose products which are going to make sense. That happens to be why I \nwas for opening ANWR, for example.\n  But if you had been in this room, it would have been an interesting \nexperience because as you go through this bill you find it is replete \nwith these little special, targeted items.\n  Here is one. I just opened the bill because I finally got a copy of \nit. I just opened it. I arbitrarily opened it to a page. This is so \namusing--it is not amusing; it is horrible. But the interest is so \napparent and so outrageous you have to smile about it. It is so obscene \nin its attack on the American taxpayers. This section is called the \nGeothermal Steam Act. Basically, what it says--and I am almost tempted \nto read the whole thing--is anybody who wants is now going to be able \nto apply to go on to Federal lands and produce geothermal energy.\n  Well, geothermal energy probably has some productive capability that \nmakes sense. I am not sure it does because no one, other than icelandic \ncountries, has been able to make it efficient. They have an efficiency \nwith it because they have so much of it, and they are so small.\n  But basically what this bill says is, all right, you can go on public \nlands--let's say Yellowstone Park--where there is a lot of geothermal, \nand you can have the Federal Government evaluate whether or not \ngeothermal energy should be produced there. Obviously, they are not \ngoing to do it in Yellowstone Park. That was an excessive statement, \nbut that is where we know there is geothermal power.\n  Then, if you, the person getting a fairly significant subsidy in this \nbill for geothermal production, want to, you can then decide you are \ngoing to pursue energy there. The Department is under some significant \ndirection to actually give you a permit, at which time you have to go \nthrough something called a NEPA process, which means you have to go out \nand prove there is an environmentally sound way to produce this \ngeothermal power.\n\n  All that is outrageous in and of itself because it is basically \nputting a put to our national lands for geothermal power that is \nindependent of just determining whether or not that is the appropriate \nuse for those natural lands. This is where it gets very entertaining. \nThen they say, you--us, the taxpayers--have to pay for the NEPA study. \nWe have to pay to reimburse the company that wants to do the drilling \nor use the geothermal power for the environmental study which they are \nrequired to produce in order to prove that the power can be produced in \nthat area. That is a very interesting concept. That is like saying to a \ndrug company, we, the Federal Government, must pay to produce the \nresearch to produce your drug, even though you are going to get the \nprofits from selling the drug, or any other business that has to make a \nbasic investment to get the asset which they are going to then sell and \nmake money on because the only significant cost for determining whether \nor not they are going to get their geothermal power will be the \nenvironmental impact study. So to ask the taxpayers to pay for it is, \nto say the least, an unusual approach.\n  In the context of this bill, it is very mainstream. It is very much \nconsistent with the rest of the bill, the fact that you are going to \nhave $1 billion worth of land or purchases made in order to protect the \nshoreline. But where is it all going to be purchased? Louisiana. Ninety \npercent of the $1 billion is going to be spent in Louisiana; or the \nfact that you are going to have these shopping centers in various \nlocations; or the fact that you are going to have an ethanol program \nwhich will probably\n\n[[Page S15117]]\n\ncost more in tax subsidy than what it cost to produce the product, \ncertainly more than what the net income is going to be of that product, \nno question about that; or that you are going to have a subsidy for a \nvariety of initiatives which are now allegedly commercially \ncompetitive--the list goes on interminably of tax credits which are now \ngoing to be put in place for different industries which already are, \ntheoretically, producing a competitive product. But we have to expand \nthat tax credit.\n  I won't read them all, but a few of them: There is a credit for \nproduction for advanced nuclear power; to repeal the 4.3-cents motor \nfuel excise tax on railroad and inland waterways; a credit for natural \ngas distribution; a credit for electric transmission properties--that \nthis is an expensing item--an expensing for capital costs incurred in \ncomplying with EPA sulfur regulations; modifications to special rules \nfor nuclear decommissioning costs; treatment of certain income as \nexpenses; arbitration rules not to apply to prepayments for natural \ngas; a temporary suspension of limitation based on 65 percent of \ntaxable income and extension of suspension of taxable income limit with \nrespect to marginal production--that is stripper wells, I presume--\namortization of delayed rental payments--that, I presume again, is a \nstripper well type of thing--amortization of geological and geophysical \nexpenditures--these are all significant tax benefits--temporary repeal \nof the alternative minimum tax preference for intangible drilling \ncosts--again, a significant tax benefit--credit for clean coal \ntechnology units--that is a tax credit.\n  Then, of course, relative to the natural gas business, there is a \ndramatic change in the way they account for their taxes. There is even \na credit in here for ceiling fans, for certain steam generators and \ncertain reactors and vessels used for nuclear technology. The list goes \non and on: Energy production incentives; there is a special tax credit \nfor granular mine tailings. Maybe that is not tax. I just noted that \nbecause it seems as if that may be a misapplication of that or the use \nof that.\n\n  The tax credit section, which makes up the difference between the $8 \nbillion requested and the $25 billion that is actually being incurred \nhere in tax credits, is just replete with special interest efforts to \ntry to pervert the marketplace for the purposes of picking winners and \nlosers in the energy production business. That might work at some \nlevel. There is no question there may be a legitimate need to do some \nof that. But this bill is excessive.\n  It is also clearly not being driven by energy policy but, rather, by \nparochial interests and by interests who see the opportunity to have \nsignificant gain at the expense of others--specifically, the general \ntaxpayer.\n  We will spend a lot of time talking about these various issues. I \nthink the more light shown on this bill, the better. I think we do need \nto spend a few days discussing the issues within the bill. Most \nspecifically, we want to spend more time on this issue of MTBEs and the \nfact that this bill has essentially been structured to target one \nregion of the country in a manner which seems highly inappropriate and \npunitive and which is clearly inconsistent with what historically has \nbeen the case, which is that you don't pass a law which says the \nlegitimate activity of a State or group of States, in trying to defend \nthe quality of their environment, will be wiped off the books. That is \nsomething the Federal Government should not be doing. It should \ncertainly not be being done by a Republican-dominated Congress which \ntheoretically still believes there are States out there that have some \nrights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Hampshire would \nstay on the Senate floor for a moment, I don't blame him for being \nfrustrated about the MTBE.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I would ask my \ncolleague to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I was just wondering if those of us who are on the \nSenate floor could agree on an order so my colleague from Illinois \nwould know when he should be planning to come to speak. I know the \nSenator from Idaho plans to speak and Senator Thomas would then want to \nspeak. Would that be the order? And then I would speak and Senator \nDurbin after that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Certainly. I have no problem with an order.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Well, you have also been here. If you care to speak after \nSenator Craig, perhaps I could be after you, and Senator Durbin after \nthat.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Craig's \nstatement, I be recognized to speak, then Senator Thomas, and then \nSenator Durbin in that order.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Fifteen minutes apiece?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Whatever period of time the Senator would want.\n  Mr. CRAIG. No more than 15 minutes for me.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Fifteen minutes for each of us, and a half hour for the \nSenator from Illinois. I think my statement will probably be closer to \na half hour as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire has left. I \ndon't blame him for his frustration over MTBEs. What he didn't say was \nthat it was a Federal program and a Federal mandate. If there is a \nliability, maybe it ought to be the Federal Government. It was the \nClean Air Act that drove States in meeting their air shed requirements \nto address additives to gasoline that would result in some improvement \nin that pollution. I don't blame him for his frustration in all of \nthat.\n  I hope we can sit down and resolve this issue apart from the bill \nthat is currently on the Senate floor as it relates to the concern of \nthe Northeast or any State that has experienced pollution and now has a \ngroundwater problem as a result of a Federal program and a Federal \nmandate passed by this Congress in a Clean Air Act. The product, yes, \nproduced independently by a private company to meet a Federal mandate \nand now, of course, years later, after the application of that product, \nwe find that there were environmental consequences.\n  For a few moments this morning I want to talk about the energy bill \nwe have before us, the Energy Policy Act of 2003, and to bring some \ncontext to it, on where I believe we are and how I believe we ought to \napproach this particular piece of legislation.\n  I came to the Senate in 1990. I went on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee in 1990. In 1990, we began to talk about the need \nfor a national energy policy because we were growing increasingly \ndependent upon foreign sources for our energy--primarily hydrocarbons--\nbut we had a myriad of Federal regulations that were in large part \ndriving energy policy into a nonproductive approach.\n  We were basically saying to the energy companies of our country, \nwhether electrical, hydro-based, or nuclear-based, or whether they were \ncoal-based--we were saying to the hydrocarbon companies: You really \nought not do business here because it is going to be so expensive to \nmeet all of these Federal rules and regulations.\n  We had the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. National \nenvironmental policy has been talked about by the Senator from New \nHampshire. That was in play, and it was beginning to have very real \nconsequences in the ability to produce an abundance of energy for our \ncountry at a reasonable cost to the consumer.\n  Our economy has been based on--historically and even today--an \nabundant supply of low-cost energy. Every American is the beneficiary \nof that. From the car you drive to the toys you play with out there in \nrecreational ways, to the home you heat, to the products you use--all \nof them have been tied to an abundant supply of energy at a relatively \nlow cost. But that was because we had always been producing a lot of \nenergy.\n  In the 1990s, all of the environmental regulations came into play. \nAttitudes shifted there. There seemed to be an attitude on the part of \npolicymakers that energy was always going to be in abundance, always \ngoing to be there; therefore, you could begin to regulate and control \nit for a variety of different reasons and it would just keep coming.\n\n[[Page S15118]]\n\n  That is not so. The decade of the nineties proved it. In the decade \nof the nineties, we experienced unprecedented economic growth, but we \nalso became increasingly huge consumers of energy at a time when we \nwere no longer producing much energy. We were living off the surpluses \nthat had been built into the capacity of the energy development and \nproducing system in our country and a delivery system that was produced \nin the sixties and the seventies and the 1980s.\n  Guess what began to happen in the latter part of the nineties. The \nlights went out. The lights dimmed and, of course, energy costs began \nto go up. That once 75 cents or 80 cents a gallon for gas all of a \nsudden went to $1.25, $1.60, and not long ago, in some areas, it spiked \nat $4 in one instance. We saw what happened to electrical energy. No \nlonger was that switch that you woke up to every morning and flipped \nexpecting your home and bedroom and bathroom to be filled with light--\nno longer was that switch something you considered automatic, that you \njust flipped and it was always going to be there. The generation at \nhand always accepted that energy was always there and relatively \ninexpensive, but, more importantly, they believed it was always going \nto be there: Just throw the switch and on came the lights.\n  In the late part of the nineties, they threw the switch in California \nand the lights didn't come on. What happened this summer in the \nNortheast? They threw the switch and the lights didn't come on. \nSomebody has to be to blame; the lights are not coming on. We went to \nthe gas pumps, and all of a sudden it was costing us an arm and a leg \nto fill up our cars or SUVs; any form of transportation was beginning \nto cost more.\n\n  What happened? Why are we here? This President, George W. Bush, \nbefore he came to office as President elect, met here with the majority \nleader and leaders in the Senate and said: We have to get this country \nback into the business of producing energy--all forms of energy, \nincluding hydrocarbon, electrical, green energy, black energy, but \nenvironmentally sound in all respects. We have to get back into the \nbusiness of production.\n  No longer were we 35, 40, 45, 50 percent dependent; now we were 55 \npercent dependent upon some other country to supply our hydrocarbon \nbase. We had to begin to extend our politics around the world to secure \nthe stability of that market and that supply because we decided here at \nhome that we were no longer going to be producing it because there was \nan environmental cost to that production.\n  If you were witnessing the Senate floor a couple of years ago, the \ndebate was on producing oil in Alaska. This Senate basically said: No, \nwe are not going to do that anymore; the environmental consequences are \ntoo great. So we will let somebody else produce it in Saudi Arabia or \nin Iraq or Russia, and we will pay them and we will ship it over here. \nThey will profit by it and we will spend it, we will use it.\n  That is really what our policy said--not in a spoken way but in an \nunspoken way.\n  That is why this President and it is why others--I and others who \nwork on the Energy Committee and studied the market and watched the \ntrends over the past decade--realized something had to be done. We \nbegan to try, as Republicans and then as Democrats.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is in the Chamber. He chaired that \ncommittee. He worked mightily hard to produce an energy bill a couple \nof years ago, and we got it to the floor and we passed it out of the \nSenate. I voted for it. Why? Because it was a major step in the right \ndirection. In fact, it was the bill of the Senator from New Mexico that \npassed out of the Senate this year because we could not get our bill \nout. We could get enough votes for that bill.\n  What was happening out there was a growing consensus in the Congress, \nthe House and the Senate, that something had better get done.\n  Now, let's take the Clean Air Act. To maintain clean air quality, you \nheard about the problems we created in the Northeast with MTBEs--that \nadditive to fuels. We have another problem as it relates to all of \nthat. The lights went out up there this summer because we had not \ncreated an environment in which investment in a profitable way could be \nput back into the electrical grids and electrical systems, that could \nbe returned to the investor so that these kinds of problems would not \nexist. There were a lot of other things we tried to do.\n  Out of all of that, there clearly came a consensus that something \nought to be done. What you have before you now--and my guess is we \nought to debate it for a good long while--is the Energy Policy Act of \n2003. It just passed the House. It is a mighty big piece of \nlegislation, no question about it. What does it do? It puts the United \nStates back into the business of producing energy. That is what it \ndoes. It didn't pick winners or losers. It largely said, pick it all, \nget it all, advance solar power, advance wind power, advance \nconservation, take the old technologies of gas, coal, and oil and put \nnew technology to them so that we can use those abundant resources in a \nway that they will be environmentally cleaner.\n  That is what we are saying here. We are not subsidizing. We are \nsaying that if you invest your dollars into the market, you are going \nto get a tax credit in return. That is called incentivizing investment. \nThat is why those who look at our work product say that over the course \nof the decade this bill could produce over 800,000 new jobs in the \nlower 48 States and Alaska and Hawaii. Why? Because we are asking the \nmarketplace to invest, and we are incentivizing all of the bits and \npieces of the marketplace.\n  I used to be a bit selective--solar is only a percent; wind may be a \ncouple to 3 percent. Was it worth doing? Yes, it is worth doing. It is \nclean. So we add it up and it is 4, or 5, or 6 percent in the total \nmarketplace over the next decade, and it is clean energy. Americans \nwant clean energy, and we ought to be doing that. So we are doing it in \nthis bill.\n  We are also saying, without question, that coal is a huge producer of \nelectricity today and it has caused problems in the past. We have a \nClean Air Act, and we want to drive ourselves toward ever cleaner air. \nHere we are continuing to incentivize the substantial investment in \nclean coal technology.\n  What is also transpiring here--and we heard it debated on the floor a \ngood number of times--is the issue of greenhouse gases and climate \nchange, a product of burning of hydrocarbons. This bill goes more \ntoward climate change and improving our environment than any climate \nchange bill we ever had on the floor of the Senate, and here is the \nreason: Every new technology, every new dollar invested in the \nmarketplace puts down a cleaner form of energy and brings down the \noverall emission of greenhouse gases. That is what happens when you \ncreate new technologies and you bring on line new approaches. It was \nthe old approaches that were producing the greenhouse gases using \nhydrocarbons. The new approaches are producing substantially less \ngreenhouse gases.\n  As this economy comes back under new technologies, already per unit \nof production in our economy we are using less carbon, and that has \nalready been shown. We are leading the world as it relates to unit of \nproduction as to the amount of energy or carbon produced by that \nproduction. This bill drives us even further toward a cleaner \nenvironment because we are investing in the environment, and we are \nincentivizing that investment.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Two minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, another area that is significant in this \nbill--and I will be talking later about a variety of the approaches we \nhave taken--is the area of nuclear energy, without question one of the \ncleanest forms of energy out there. There are no emissions. There has \nalways been a concern about waste management and the waste stream that \ncomes from nuclear plants, but we also have recognized our ability to \nmanage it and other nations' ability to manage that waste stream in a \nresponsible fashion.\n  In this bill, we clearly incentivize the marketplace to get back into \nthe business of electrical production through nuclear generation. We \nhave even proposed a new reactor concept called a passive generation 4 \nreactor, and also we will tie to that an electrolysis process to \nproduce hydrogen, to begin to fuel this new exciting initiative which \nour President led in saying the transportation fuel of the future ought \nto be\n\n[[Page S15119]]\n\nhydrogen. Why? We can produce it, and we can produce a lot of it. We \nought not be producing it from natural gas; we ought to be producing it \nfrom water. Let natural gas heat space. Don't ask natural gas to \ngenerate electricity or create hydrogen. That is not the way to use \nnatural gas. That is part of what has driven the cost of it up. So \nanother new initiative.\n  While anyone can stand on the floor and pick at the pieces, look at \nthe whole. It is a market basket full of energy for the future of this \ncountry to ensure reliability so that when you wake up in the morning \nand you turn on the light switch, the light comes on; when you plug in \nyour computer, the screen lights up; when you go to the Internet, you \ncan communicate across the world instantly, and it is all driven by \nenergy.\n  Every single minuscule thought is driven by energy, and this country \nhasn't been producing energy for over a decade. We have been only the \nconsumer of that energy basket. I think we ought to be proud of this \nwork. I think we ought to be energized to pass it for the future of our \ncountry, for the future of our economy. We incentivize the marketplace \nto go back to work and produce all forms of energy from every concept \nand every idea.\n\n  Let's not pick winners and losers. I am sorry, we don't pick winners \nand losers. The Senator from New Hampshire is wrong. We say do it all \nand do it well. Out of it may come new sources that 30 or 40 years out \ndominate the energy supply of this great country.\n  I am proud of the work we have done. I hope the Senate will join \ncollectively in adopting the conference report. The House has already \nseen the merit. The President strongly supports it. Let me tell you, \nthe American people support this package because they don't want $4-a-\ngallon gas, and they want the light to come on in the bathroom when \nthey wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I will speak for a few minutes about the Energy \nbill. I know we will have additional opportunities to speak as the day \nwears on, but I wish to give a few comments before my colleague, \nSenator Thomas, speaks.\n  We are beginning today the debate on H.R. 6, which is entitled the \nEnergy Policy Act. We have had many hours of debate on this subject in \nthe Senate over the last few years. The debates we have had before in \nthe previous Congress and then this year in this Congress have resulted \nin our passing an Energy bill with an overwhelming vote.\n  I am very gratified to recount that the Senate did vote with a large \nmajority, a bipartisan majority, in favor of an Energy bill in 2002. In \nthe 107th Congress, we passed an Energy bill by a vote of 88 for the \nbill and 11 against and 1 not voting. Earlier this year, we passed the \nsame bill we had passed in the previous Congress again with a large \nbipartisan majority: 84 Members voted for it, 14 against, and 2 did not \nvote.\n  Of those who opposed the bill, I would say there is fairly good \nrepresentation from both parties. So this has not been a bill that has \ngone through the Senate, as previous energy bills, on a partisan basis. \nI think we can all take some gratification in that.\n  It is important, in my view, that we deal with these issues--the \nissue of energy supply, the issue of energy sufficiency, concern about \nthe important connections between energy policy and environmental \npolicy, including global warming, to which my colleague, Senator Craig, \nwas just referring. Those are all issues that I think deserve \nsubstantial attention as, I have said, we have devoted substantial time \nto them.\n  It is not easy to bring together all the competing views and points \nof view that come together in this legislative body and come out with \nan end product. I congratulated my colleague, Senator Domenici, the \nother day when we concluded the conference on the fact that he had been \nable to produce a conference report. I did not congratulate him on the \ncontent of that report because I had serious disagreements with it, and \nI expressed those views. There is a substantial amount involved in \nproducing a conference report, and he deserves credit for doing that.\n  The chairman of our committee said--and the chairman of the \nconference said--he did not consider this report to be perfect. I could \nnot agree with him more. I recognize that it is not fair to expect \nperfection in this process, but we could have done much better had the \nprocess been a better process. We could have done much better in terms \nof the product that was produced.\n  I believe we find ourselves now with a bill that does not command the \nbroad support and staying power we should have in a national energy \npolicy.\n  I think the entire country should be brought into a national energy \npolicy and support a comprehensive approach to dealing with our energy \nproblems.\n  Our difficulty, of course, is we now are presented with a bill that \nwe either vote for or against. I have been one who has advocated \nadopting an Energy bill. I have advocated for essentially the basic \npremise that President Bush campaigned on when he ran for office. He \nsaid that we needed to try to put in place something that was a \ncoherent national energy policy, and I essentially agreed with that \nidea.\n  I remember former Chairman Bob Galvin of Motorola saying at one point \nthere are certain things that the country should set out to do on \npurpose. To me, establishing a national energy policy seems to be one \nof those things that we should set out to do on purpose, because if we \nallow the issue to go unaddressed and the subject to go unaddressed, we \ncan find ourselves substantially disadvantaged economically and in many \nother ways by virtue of not having an energy policy. I fear that is \nwhere we find ourselves today in many respects.\n  So while I compliment the President for recognizing the importance of \nan energy policy, I do not think he got us off on the right foot once \nhe became President in trying to develop that comprehensive, coherent \nenergy policy. By that I am referring, of course, to the process that \nthe Vice President was tasked to perform and did perform of trying to \ncome up with a blueprint. That was a closed process. There have been \nefforts through the courts and otherwise to try to find out precisely \nwho was talking to whom and which groups and individuals were \nconsulted, but clearly that was a closed process. There was no reaching \nout to Democrats in the Congress. To my knowledge, there was no \nreaching out to many of the groups that have a vital interest in this \nissue. That was a mistake. At the time, I said it was a mistake. It \nprevented policymakers from hearing the broad range of views that would \nhave been offered, I believe, in a constructive manner.\n  In addition, the conduct of that exercise, in that closed process, \nfailed to generate the public trust and confidence that we ought to \nhave behind the energy policy we adopt. So I think the President made a \nmistake in the way he got us started on developing an energy policy. \nUnfortunately, that mistake has been repeated in the process that we \nhave seen leading to this final conference report.\n  My colleagues and I on the Democratic side of the aisle in the Senate \nhave voiced our concerns about this many times. The conference was a \nclosed process. In my view, clearly that was not designed to get us a \nproduct that would enjoy broad support, and it has not. We did have a \nmeeting. We had, of course, one early meeting where conferees were \npermitted to come forward and make opening statements. Then some 71 or \n72 days later, we had a final meeting, which lasted approximately 3\\1/\n2\\ hours, where Democratic conferees in the Senate offered 20 \nsubstantive amendments on a wide variety of topics. None of those \namendments can be found in the conference report today. That leads me \nto conclude the exercise was cosmetic and that there was no real \nintent, as we went into that final conference meeting, of seriously \nconsidering any of those Democratic amendments since none of them were \nagreed to.\n  In fact, one that was agreed to by the Chair when it was offered was, \nof course, rejected by the House, as were all the others.\n  Of the 4 that slipped through the process--16 of the 20 that we \noffered were rejected out of hand. Four of them did get through the \nprocess, but they were all rejected on a party-line basis by the House \nRepublicans as the first order of business when they convened later \nthat same evening.\n\n[[Page S15120]]\n\n  We went to conference on this bill expecting we would be able to \nparticipate in a meaningful way. That was not permitted. I regret that \nit has gotten to the point we are at now.\n  The common ground that was reflected in the Senate-passed bill was \nbased on a few basic principles, and I will allude to those. First, \nperhaps most importantly, was the basic agreement that we needed to \nhave an energy policy that struck a balance between increasing energy \nsupplies and encouraging additional energy efficiency or conservation. \nI think all of us can agree, at least at some level, of a \nconceptualization that both have to be done in order to deal with \nenergy problems. Supplies have to be increased. Usage has to be \ndecreased. That is the only way to begin to make up the enormous \ndeficit which we are currently operating under with regard to energy, \nwhere we are importing a tremendous amount of energy.\n  The reality is that our country does need new policies in both areas, \nand that was what we set out to do. On the energy supply side, one of \nthe most important national needs is to meet the need for natural gas. \nNatural gas is the fuel of choice for most electric generation that is \nnow being planned. We know there have been plans to construct \nsubstantial additional electric generation that uses natural gas.\n  Natural gas will play an important role in any new distributed \ngeneration that is planned in the future. It is favored by alternative \nfuel vehicle programs in both the Government and in the private sector. \nIt is the most likely feedstock to produce hydrogen.\n  The President has indicated his strong support for moving to a \nhydrogen-based economy. The point which I think often gets lost is that \nthe most logical and ready source for that hydrogen is natural gas. So \nit is not possible to just say, OK, let's not use oil and gas, let's \nuse hydrogen. Natural gas has to be used, or at least that is what most \npeople think is the most economic course to follow.\n  Apart from its energy uses, of course, natural gas is also a critical \nfeedstock for the petrochemical industry and the fertilizer industry.\n  Over the long haul, natural gas consumption in this country is \noutstripping the amounts we are able to produce in the lower 48 States. \nWe as a nation are in the early stages of developing a substantial \ndependence on foreign sources of natural gas. Just as we find ourselves \ntoday dependent upon foreign sources of oil, in the near future, the \nnext decade or so, we are going to find ourselves substantially \ndependent upon foreign sources of natural gas. That is not a good \nresult, and it is not one that we should sit by and idly allow to \noccur.\n  We all know, and the Presiding Officer today knows better than any of \nus, that there are at least 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that \nare stranded on the northern slope of Alaska, Prudhoe Bay. That gas has \nbeen produced and is being produced every day, along with the oil that \nwe now produce at that location. The gas is currently being pumped \nright back into the ground because there is no way to transport it to \nthe lower 48 where it is needed.\n  As we see the price of natural gas go up in the lower 48, as we may \nwell this winter--we do not know--we need to remember there is a \nsubstantial supply of natural gas that we are not accessing. We need to \nprovide financial incentives to the private sector to help in the \nconstruction of a pipeline to bring that gas to the lower 48. Such a \nproject would not only help with our national energy needs, national \nenergy security, it would also, of course, be a great boon to \nconstruction in this country, and to the domestic steel industry.\n  We hear a lot of talk about how this bill before us is now a jobs \nbill. To the extent that one cannot argue the virtues of it from an \nenergy perspective, they have to talk about it as a jobs bill. There \nare jobs that will be created from this bill. There are a great many \nmore jobs that would be created if we provided an adequate incentive \nfor the construction of the pipeline in Alaska. On this topic, the \nconference report does not measure up. It does not do what we did in \nthe bills that we passed through the Senate, in the bills that we \npassed through the Senate both last year and this year.\n\n  It does contain regulatory streamlining procedures for the pipeline \nthat former Senator Murkowski and I worked hard on in the previous \nCongress. That is a critical part of the problem. But in order to get \nthe pipeline constructed, we also need to have fiscal incentives. The \nSenate voted for those. The administration opposed them.\n  Once Chairman Domenici announced publicly that they would not be part \nof the conference report, all of us who were officially conferees \nreceived a letter from the CEO of the gas company that has been most \nactive in promoting going forward with the design and construction of \nsuch a pipeline, and that corporate executive stated that based on his \nunderstanding of the conference report, his company could not proceed \nwith the project in face of the extraordinary financial risk that it \nwould have to bear if gas prices were to drop below what the Energy \nInformation Administration agrees is the likely level.\n  So the lack of a risk mitigation mechanism, that probably would never \nhave cost the taxpayers a dime, and even if it had cost taxpayers, \nthere was a provision to ensure that those funds would be repaid when \nthe price went back up again--but because of the lack of that risk \nmitigation mechanism, the likelihood is that our Nation will forego the \npossibility of using that Alaskan natural gas for future supply needs.\n  We will, instead, depend on imports of liquefied natural gas. We will \nbring our natural gas from places like Nigeria and Trinidad. Those are \nplaces, of course--some of those places, at least--that have their own \nproblems with regard to political stability and the security of that \nsupply.\n  Building the necessary transportation system for LNG, liquefied \nnatural gas, will create jobs for shipyard workers in Korea, but we \nwill not have the jobs for pipeline construction for Americans on this \ncontinent.\n  I believe this is an unfortunate policy mistake that our country will \ncome to regret. I am disappointed we were not able to maintain in the \nbill the financial incentives that we put in the bill when the Senate \nacted previously, both in the last Congress and this Congress.\n  Along with providing for more robust domestic supplies of natural \ngas, we need to look for ways to diversify our energy generation away \nfrom such reliance, such strong reliance on gas. One important arena in \nwhich we can do this is in electricity generation.\n  The bill the Senate passed earlier this year focuses this \ndiversification strongly on new technology, including ultraclean ways \nof burning coal. Ultraclean coal is the most sustainable way over the \nlong term to ensure that coal maintains its key position in our \nnational energy mix. This is because concerns about the levels of \npollution emitted from coal-fired plants are only increasing. It \nincreases, of course, as the concern about the contribution of coal-\nfired generation to global warming increases.\n  This conference report unfortunately takes a step backwards from what \nwe passed through the Senate in its commitment to ultraclean coal. The \npercentage of funding dedicated to these purposes is cut by 20 percent. \nA new competing program of direct grants to companies to pay for half \nof the cost of current technology pollution equipment, and current \ntechnology coal-fired generation is also put in place.\n\n  In my view, we have limited Federal funds. Focusing those Government \nsubsidies to buy today's technology instead of investing to create \ntomorrow's coal technology, risks coal's ultimate ability to maintain \nits position in our energy mix. I think that is unfortunate and a \npolicy mistake as well.\n  Another key part of the strategy of diversifying away from natural \ngas would be to tap into opportunities for distributed generation, such \nas combined heat and power at industrial facilities. Here again, the \nconference report falls short as it does not address the barriers that \nhave been erected to uniform interconnection of distributed generation \nto the grid. It is not enough to have the technology. We need to rid \nourselves of the redtape that is keeping that technology from being \nused. Again, I believe our previous bill facilitated that. I don't \nbelieve this bill does.\n\n[[Page S15121]]\n\n  Along with these steps, we also need to make a greater push to \nintroduce renewable energy technologies for electricity generation. \nSome of these renewable technologies are already cost competitive. Wind \nis the prime example. But in order to see widespread use of these \ntechnologies, both financial and regulatory incentives should be put in \nplace. That means both a meaningful production tax credit--and there is \na meaningful production tax credit in this conference report. I commend \nthe drafters for that. We would need that, but we also need a flexible \nrenewable portfolio standard for electric utilities.\n  For those who have not been studying this area, a renewable portfolio \nstandard essentially means a requirement on utilities to produce a \ncertain portion--in the case of our bill, 10 percent--of the power they \nproduce or that they sell, 10 percent of that power should come from \nrenewable sources. That is what our Senate bill provided. That \nprovision, of course, has been deleted from the bill that is now before \nus. I think that, again, is a mistake in policy.\n  The lack of an effective renewable portfolio standard is a major \nmissed opportunity for our country. There are those who argue that we \nshould leave this to the free market. But the reality is that a \nmajority in the Senate, a majority of Senate conferees have disagreed \nwith that. In spite of that, we have deferred to the House, and the \nHouse says they don't like it. We say fine; if you don't like it, we \nwill drop it.\n  The conference report is pretty much status quo on the future of \nrenewables and the future role of renewables in our energy mix. Tax \ncredits are extended for a few more years and slightly broadened, but \nrenewables do not get anywhere near the attention lavished on them in \nthis legislation that the coal industry gets or that the nuclear power \nindustry gets.\n  Coal and nuclear power have problems with regard to social \nacceptance. So in the absence of a stronger push forward on increasing \nrenewables I think the conference report is basically making a choice \nin favor of the existing trends toward an overreliance on natural gas \nfor future electric generation. That choice leaves our citizens' future \nnatural gas and electricity prices that are more volatile than they \nshould be, resulting in more frequent price spikes than we would like \nto see. People will come back and say: Why did you in the Congress not \ntry to deal with this problem and anticipate this problem and head it \noff in a more meaningful way?\n  Renewable energy technologies can help with another energy supply \nissue that we face and that is of transportation fuels. The conference \nreport mandates a phase-in, an introduction of up to 5 billion gallons \nof ethanol in our gasoline supply by 2012. This has been coupled in the \nconference report with the issue that has already been discussed fairly \nbroadly here in the Senate this morning, and that is the issue of how \nto treat the gasoline additive MTBE, methyl tertiary-butyl ether. One \nprovision in the ethanol title purports to ban MTBE by the year 2014, \nbut when you look at the rest of the language, it is clear the ban is \nfull of loopholes.\n  For one thing, each State Governor can opt his or her State out of \nthat ban, if the Governor determines. This language is sufficiently \nvague that it appears that States can opt out, even after the purported \nnational ban goes into effect.\n  I do not know if that was intended, but that certainly is the way it \nappears.\n  One other problem with the language is that the President is given \nextraordinary powers to make the statutory ban null and void by a \nstroke of the pen in the year 2014 before it takes effect. With these \nkinds of loopholes, it is not likely MTBE will actually be banned \nnationwide in 2014.\n  In addition, the conference report provides product liability \nprotection for MTBE and does so retroactively as to September 5 for any \nlawsuit filed after that date. The Senator from New Hampshire spoke \nabout his objection to this as it affects his State. I can certainly \nunderstand that objection. I think it is one other provision that \nundermines the broad bipartisan support we really ought to be able to \nenjoy for this bill.\n  Even with the greater use of renewable fuels in cars, we still will \nbe very dependent on oil for the transportation sector. It is in our \nnational interest to support domestic production of oil. But many of us \nknow our domestic production of oil is not adequate. We are more and \nmore dependent on foreign sources of oil, and most of that growing \ndependence on foreign sources of oil is occurring in the transportation \nsector as we are using more and more gasoline for larger and larger \ncars every year.\n  I notice, as everyone else does, all of the advertisements for \nHummers. I am sure that is a great vehicle, but the reality is that \nwhen you have such a focus on larger and larger vehicles and less and \nless efficient vehicles, as we have and have had for some time in this \ncountry, it is clear that our dependence on foreign oil will grow, as \nit has been growing.\n  I understand that the answer to our doing nothing there--we did not \ndo a great deal in the Senate bill on this subject, and we did much \nless than I wanted to do. But we did adopt an amendment by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, that set a goal for reducing the amount \nof oil consumed in our transportation sector, and we gave broad \ndiscretion to the President and the Secretary of Transportation as to \nhow they achieve that goal. That provision, modest as it was, has been \ndeleted from this bill. That, in my view, was an unfortunate deletion \nand, again, a wrong direction for us to be going in our national energy \npolicy.\n  I have various other points I wish to make. I know my colleagues are \nhere ready to speak. I will have opportunities to speak later and \nconclude my remarks on a whole range of issues since this is such a \ncomprehensive subject. It is a comprehensive set of provisions with \nwhich we are being presented.\n  At this time, in deference to my friend, Senator Thomas, let me yield \nthe floor so he can speak. Of course, the Senator from Illinois is also \nhere ready to speak. I will defer to him as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank my friend from New Mexico and \nthe ranking member on our committee. I thank him for the work he has \ndone.\n  I think it is interesting, as we hear people begin to talk about this \nbill and talk about the need for an energy policy, to say how important \nit is for us to have one and then spend the rest of the time opposing \nthe things that are there.\n  The fact is we do need an energy policy. We haven't had one for a \nvery long time. It has been something we have been working on now for 3 \nyears. The other side of the aisle was unable to get one for the last \nyear, and we worked right up to the end and it didn't get through. Now \nwe have worked on it another 2 years, and we ought to be able to get it \nfinished. I am disappointed that everyone talks about the need and then \nbegins to talk about why they don't like this bill and this little \npiece and that little piece. I understand. It is a broad bill. But it \nis an important issue.\n  We need an energy policy. We need the kind of energy policy that \ngives us some direction for where we are going to be in the future. It \nis not designed to deal with all the problems that may exist today, \nalthough some of those are there of course. We ought to be looking to \nwhere we need to be in 10 years or 15 years down the road. That is what \npolicies are for--to talk about the future.\n  It obviously has to be a balanced policy. Unfortunately, I am afraid \nvery many of our friends here and very many of the folks in the country \nare just accustomed to turning on the lights, going to the gas station, \nand not thinking about how it happens to be there.\n  It is kind of interesting that for States that are dependent on all \nother sources, their representatives are more opposed to doing \nsomething than the people who are producing the product. I think it is \ntime they begin to take a look at the fact that energy just isn't there \nnaturally. There has to be a policy to do that. It has to be a balanced \npolicy.\n  We are looking at conservation. We are looking at alternatives. We \nare looking at renewables. Of course, in the short term, in reaching \nthose goals, the most important thing we have to talk\n\n[[Page S15122]]\n\nabout is domestic production so that we aren't becoming more and more \ndependent on foreign countries to provide what we are using.\n  One of the reasons is that much of the opposition comes from \nenvironmentalists who only look at things from one side. This needs to \nbe balanced. In my State of Wyoming, we are very concerned about the \nenvironment. We also know that you can have multiple use, you can have \nproduction, and you can also take care of the environment. You don't \njust have to say you can't touch these areas. These are the kinds of \nbalances we have to find to really be able to move forward the way we \nwould like to do.\n  I thank Senator Domenici and Representative Tauzin and their staffs. \nThey worked very hard. We worked on it very hard as well, prior to \nputting it together for the Senate and certainly from the House side, \nwith a mix of domestic production, research and development, incentives \nto cause these things to happen, and conservation. We will be better \noff certainly with the passage of this bill and this legislation. It \nhas been over a decade in coming.\n  It has been over 2 years--almost 3 years--since the President's \noffice and the Vice President particularly set about to come up with an \nenergy policy so we will have some direction on where we are going as \nthe demands increase, which they are. There has to be some way to meet \nthose demands.\n\n  The idea that you can suddenly go to alternatives and renewables--\nthey produce now about 3 percent of the total we utilize, \nnotwithstanding the dams and that sort of thing. But air, wind, solar \nare a very small percentage. They have great possibilities for the \nfuture, but that isn't going to happen next year, or the next year, or \neven 5 years from now. That is what this thing is all about--to make \nsome movement.\n  We have experienced blackouts. We have experienced natural gas price \nhikes and all of those kinds of things. When that happens, suddenly \neverybody talks about energy. When that moves away from us, we forget \nabout it again. We really ought to stay on the issue. I don't think we \nshould, nor can we, wait for another crisis to be able to do something \nof this kind.\n  If there is anything we should have learned in the 21st century and \nthe quality of life that we seek, the idea of creating jobs, the idea \nof having a vibrant economy is very closely enhanced and tied to \nreliable energy and a clean environment. Those are the goals that we \nhave. We have to modernize conservation to be able to do that job more \neffectively.\n  Everyone is in favor of conservation. But how much have you done in \nyour home in terms of having incentives to change the equipment you use \nto make it more conservation-like? Very little. We just want more power \nat a cheaper price.\n  What have we done to modernize our infrastructure? We see things \nchanging. With more and more market generators who do not make the \ndistribution and have to move it to a market, then you have to change \nthe system, you have to change the system of moving power. Those things \nchange. Indeed, they are changing.\n  We have to increase our energy supplies, including renewables and \nalternatives.\n  We can do a better job of protecting the environment. I am persuaded. \nObviously, there are some places in our States that should be set \naside--and they are set aside--national parks, wilderness areas, parts \nof the forests, and this and that. Half of our State land belongs to \nthe Federal Government. It is public land. We have to find a way to \nhave alternative uses and to have multiple use. We intend to do that.\n\n  Finally, one of our goals ought to be increased national security. \nWhat could be a more important goal than that? Are we going to be \ndependent on Iraq and Saudi Arabia for our energy? We need to change \nthat. After years of talking about it, this is a good opportunity to do \nsomething.\n  In any bill as complex and as large as this, there will be items of \ndisagreement, such as MTBE liability. Of course, we can talk about that \nthe rest of the month. But we ought to give a little thought to where \nwe need to be with energy and whether that is the tradeoff necessary to \ndefeat a bill. I cannot imagine that tradeoff. We need to have a \nbalanced approach. That is what we seek.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the tax credits. Let me state what \nthey are for: tax credits for residential energy efficiencies; tax \ncredits for producing electricity from certain renewable sources; tax \nincentives for fuel-efficient vehicles; tax credits for efficient \nappliances. All the talk of tax credits, and that is what they are for. \nThat is how a private sector system gives incentives.\n  For reliability, accelerated depreciation of natural gaslines so we \ncan have accelerated depreciation for distribution, electric \ntransmission lines. We need reliability to move the energy; open \ntransmission, to be able to deal with the changes taking place in the \ndevelopment of the energy we have now.\n  Production: How to get more production of gas and oil? Through \nincentives. Marginal wells, low-production wells, do not produce. There \nhas to be an incentive to continue to produce, to continue to \nreintroduce CO2 into the ground. These are not to make \nsomeone wealthy. These are designed to cause things to happen.\n  Suspended income in the percentage of depreciation for small \nproducers, provide amortization for geophysical expenses to determine \nwhere we have production opportunities for oil and gas--these are the \nitems we mean when we talk about tax credits.\n  Yes, there are substantial credits but that is how we move toward \ndomestic production. We can do it in an economically and \nenvironmentally sound manner.\n  Oil and other fossil fuels provide 85 percent of all energy use in \nthe United States. The fact is, we still depend on coal largely for the \ndevelopment of electricity. Quite frankly, we ought to depend on it \neven more because gas is so much more flexible for other uses. We are \nworking on ways, with some of the dollars in the bill, to provide \ncleaner plants for the production of electricity with coal. That is \npart of the overall plan to move forward.\n  Renewables, including hydrogen, currently provide about 7 percent. \nAbsent hydro, it is only about 3 percent. We built a building for a \ncompany I worked with in Caspar and we used solar. This was about 15 \nyears ago. Quite frankly, it did not work. We had to remove the solar \npanels and do something else. We had to find another way. Now I think \nit probably would work. We have to move forward.\n  There is a difference in views depending on where you are from. The \nNew Englanders have one point of view; of course, they use the energy. \nSome of the rest of the country produces as well as uses energy. My \nState produces about 35 percent of the Nation's coal and has the \ngreatest coal reserves of any place in the United States. We are sixth \nor seventh in the production of oil. In gas, we are about fifth. We \nhave come up with a methane production opportunity recently. There has \nto be a policy that encourages production so we can move forward.\n\n  We have to have investment in the transmission. We find increasingly \nthe market is here and the energy use is over here. That is a problem \nin California. California is the biggest user of energy but that is not \nthe energy development area. We have to move that energy, whether it is \nthrough pipelines or transmission.\n  In the bill we are trying to put together regional transmission \norganizations for electric transmissions so the States can collectively \nmake some decisions with respect to interstate movement. No Member \nwants to leave it all in the hands of FERC, although there has to be \nsome opportunity for FERC. We have to leave some responsibility there.\n  We have had a big hassle over standard market design. This bill puts \nin a standard market design as it was designed a couple of years ago. \nBut it does recognize that FERC still has to ensure reliability so we \ndo not have blackouts, to assure the opportunities for movement of \nenergy among States, which is not always an easy thing to do. These are \nrealistic issues.\n  I am surprised sometimes we find so much opposition to ideas. Ideas \nhave to be here to accomplish our goals. That is what a policy is, to \nhave a goal and decide how to get there. I cannot help but continue to \nbe a little surprised at\n\n[[Page S15123]]\n\nthe difficulty in getting an energy policy on the ground. In any bill \nas complicated as this, everyone has a different view and everyone can \nchange things a bit. This has become a collective bill, put together by \nthe House, the Senate, Democrats, Republicans, people from New England, \npeople from all over. We have a mixture of ideas. I would not have done \nit exactly this way had I been doing it by myself, but I think it is \nimportant to have a policy to move on, dealing with our demand for \nenergy, and moving in the direction we want.\n  In general, this is a good bill. This is a bill that moves us forward \nfor energy in the future, the kind of future in which we can work on \nour conservation methods and, hopefully, reduce the demands we have--at \nleast the growth level we have had in the past--and that we can find \nalternative fuels.\n  As we move forward, we are looking now at coal as the basis for \nhydrogen. That can be very important. Imagine if we developed hydrogen \ncars next year and were ready to go with them as a clean and available \nsource. How long would it take to get the delivery system in place, to \nget hydrogen stations instead of gas stations all over the country?\n  When we think about potential changes out there, we have to think \nabout reaching that point. We must continue to provide energy as we now \nknow it, as we move toward something different. All this talk of more \noil and gas, we will have renewables. Good luck. What are we going to \ndo in the 15-year-period of transition?\n  I hope we continue to look at a balanced policy with conservation, \nalternatives, domestic production, research, more cleanliness in \nproduction, and so on.\n\n  We will continue, I suppose, to talk about this matter for a while. I \nam disappointed that apparently there is going to be a reluctance to \nlet us move forward with it as quickly as we should.

Madam President, I have sought recognition today to \nexplain briefly the provisions of S. 1156, the proposed Veterans Health \nCare, Capital Asset, and Business Improvement Act of 2003, as the \nranking member of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, Senator Graham of \nFlorida, and I propose be amended to incorporate provisions contained \nin S. 1156 as reported by the Committee on Veterans Affairs on November \n10, 2003, and also to contain provisions derived from H.R. 1720, passed \nby the House on October 29, 2003, H.R. 2357, passed by the House on \nJuly 21, 2003, H.R. 2433, passed by the House on September 10, 2003, \nH.R. 3260, passed by the House on October 8, 2003, and H.R. 3387, \npassed by the House October 29, 2003.\n  This bill, as so amended, incorporates agreements reached between the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which I am privileged to chair, \nand our counterpart committee in the House of Representatives, on \nlegislation relating to the provision of health care services by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. I thank the Ranking Member, Senator \nGraham of Florida, and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs, Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey \nand Representative Lane Evans of Illinois, for their advocacy for \nveterans and for their cooperation in resolving issues raised by the \nbills considered in our respective bodies. Inasmuch as S. 1156, as \nreported by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, itself incorporated \nprovisions drawn from nine separate Senate bills, S. 1156 as presented \nto the Senate today is properly viewed as a bill that incorporates \nprovisions from 14 separate pieces of legislation. A bill containing \nsuch a range of material would not have been knitted together, as this \none has been, without a spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship from \nthe other body. The Ranking Member, Senator Graham of Florida, and I \nappreciate the leadership of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n  Since this is a lengthy bill--over 50 pages--I will not endeavor in \nthis statement to explain in detail each and every provision. Rather, I \nwill discuss the highlights briefly in this statement, and refer my \ncolleagues to a Joint Explanatory Statement, which I ask be \nincorporated into the Record as if read, for a detailed explanation of \nthe bill as amended.\n  The starting point for S. 1156, as presented to the Senate today, was \nS. 1156, the proposed Veterans' Health Care Authorities Extension and \nImprovement Act of 2003. That bill was marked up by the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs on September 30, 2003, and reported on \nNovember 10, 2003. S. 1156, as reported, contained a number of \nelements; its key provisions would have extended mandates that VA \nprovide nursing home care and outpatient-based long term care services \nto our senior veterans; improved VA assisted living and mental health \nprograms; modified VA personnel provisions relating to non-physician \nproviders of healthcare services and employees of VA's Veterans Canteen \nService; and authorized major medical facility projects and projects \nrelated to VA's Capital Assets Realignment for Enhanced Services, \nCARES, initiative. Each and all of these provisions, with some \nmodifications as appropriate, are contained in S. 1156 as presented to \nthe Senate today.\n  The major change between the bill, as reported, and the current bill \nis the addition of provisions contained in House-passed legislation. \nHouse-approved provisions incorporated into the bill would allow \nradiation-exposed veterans higher priority access to VA\n\n[[Page S15127]]\n\nhealth care; exempt former prisoners-of-war from pharmaceutical \ncopayments; create in VA an Office of Research Oversight; authorize VA \nto allow ``Saturday premium pay'' to licensed practical nurses and \nnursing assistants; and authorize additional needed VA construction \nprojects. All of these added provisions are constructive and useful.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the Senate approve this legislation. It \nis good bipartisan legislation that is supported by VA's extraordinary \nSecretary, the Honorable Anthony J.

The bill would allow individual VA \n     facilities to be reimbursed for the expenses incurred by the \n     development and execution of enhanced-use leases.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 202 of the Compromise Agreement adopts the \n     provisions of the House bill which streamline the approval \n     process for enhanced use leases in VHA. The provisions \n     concerning the expansion of this authority to properties of \n     NCA and VBA have been omitted due to mandatory spending \n     concerns.\n\n\n     simplification of annual report on long-range health planning\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 8107 of title 38, United States Code, requires VA \n     to submit annually a report regarding the long-range health \n     planning of the Department. Included in that report is a \n     five-year strategic plan for the provision of health care \n     services to veterans, a plan for the coordination of care \n     among the geographic health care regions of the Department, a \n     profile of each such region, any planned changes to the \n     mission of any medical facility of the Department, and a \n     listing of the 20 VA major medical facility projects with the \n     highest priority.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 7(d) of H.R. 3260 would change the report date on \n     the Annual Report on Long-Range Health Planning to June 1 of \n     each year.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 203 of the Compromise Agreement rescinds section \n     8107(b)(3) and (4) of title 38, United States Code, to \n     simplify the required report by removing the detailed \n     prescription of its content.\n\n                   Subtitle B--Project Authorizations\n\n\n            authorization of major medical facility projects\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 8104(2) of title 38, United States Code, requires \n     Congressional authorization of any VA major medical facility \n     construction project.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 211 of the Senate bill, as reported, would \n     authorize the following major construction projects:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Location                      Purpose             Cost\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLebanon, PA........................

It was \n     determined that no lease authority for the Pensacola site was \n     necessary. Further, the Compromise Agreement would not \n     authorize a lease supporting relocation and expansion of the \n     Health Administration Center (HAC) in Denver, Colorado. The \n     Committees believe the Department has not justified the \n     continuing expansion of activities at the HAC. The Committees \n     are concerned that this administrative function, originally \n     authorized to process reimbursement claims for the Civilian \n     Health and Medical Program for the VA (CHAMPVA), has inflated \n     its activities well beyond its original responsibilities. The \n     Committees urge VA to reconsider whether the long-term \n     obligation of leased space and the significant growth of \n     staff at the HAC, as opposed to other methods of \n     accomplishing these various tasks, are warranted.\n       The Compromise Agreement generally follows the Senate \n     language on the Regional Federal Medical Center lease at the \n     former Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado, \n     pending a decision by the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and \n     Defense on the nature of any joint venture undertaking at the \n     site. However, advance planning is authorized for this \n     project under section 213 of the Compromise Agreement.\n\n\n                    advance planning authorizations\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 8104(2) of title 38, United States Code, requires \n     Congressional authorization of all VA major medical facility \n     construction project.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate bill contains no similar provisions.\n     House Bill\n       Section 3 of H.R. 1720, as amended, would authorize major \n     construction projects in Columbus, Ohio; Denver (Aurora), \n     Colorado; and the lease of a Multi-specialty Outpatient \n     Clinic in Clark County (Las Vegas), Nevada.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 213 of the Compromise Agreement authorizes advance \n     planning funds for fiscal year 2004 for purposes of \n     developing new medical facilities at the following locations:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Location                      Purpose             Cost\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nColumbus, OH.......................

Since then, VA \n     has spent $4,000,000 of those funds on the design and \n     planning of a bed tower that will alleviate the strain on the \n     older bed tower currently in use. The remaining $46,000,000 \n     will be used for the tower's construction, with a projected \n     Spring 2004 groundbreaking. The Committees understand that \n     the Secretary has pledged at least an additional $25,000,000 \n     to enhance this project and minimize any reduction of total \n     beds at this facility. Even with the completion of this \n     construction, the Committees are advised that additional \n     seismic and utility upgrades are needed at the San Juan VA. \n     The Committees encourage the Secretary to honor this pledge \n     and continue the practice of providing high quality services \n     to the veterans of Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, I rise today to urge swift \npassage of S. 1156, which is essentially a conference report on various \nveterans' health care measures. This bill will dramatically assist the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs in providing quality health care to our \nNation's veterans. I would like to highlight some of the key \nprovisions.\n  The compromise agreement would authorize $17.5 million in advanced \nplanning funds for a new medical facility in East-Central Florida. \nWhile this is only an authorization, I note that the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill will likely contain an unspecified pot of \nconstruction funding--up to $600 million total. These funds will likely \nbe used for East-Central Florida and other worthy projects stemming \nfrom VA's realignment effort.\n  Veterans living in East-Central Florida are in dire need of a full-\nfledged VA hospital. One VA report found that since 1996, ``the Central \nFlorida market sustained the greatest workload expansion of the entire \nVA system--105 percent.'' Other VA studies have deemed the region as \n``the logical choice for infrastructure investment for all major \nInpatient and Outpatient categories.'' The decision about where to \nplace a new VA hospital in this region falls to VA, but I encourage \nSecretary Principi to carefully study all the options to ensure that \nthe most appropriate location is chosen.\n  The demand for care in East-Central Florida heretofore has also been \nvalidated by the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services \n(CARES) process. CARES is a multi-stage analysis that VA has undertaken \nof its assets and infrastructure nationwide, for the purposes of making \naccording adjustments to meet the projected health\n\n[[Page S15132]]\n\ncare needs of veterans over the next 20 years. The process has reached \nits final stages, with the release of a Draft National Plan currently \nunder review by a commission.\n  The CARES initiative will have profound ramifications for hospitals \nall across the country. As such, the compromise agreement includes a \nprovision that I fought for, granting Congress a 60-day notice and wait \nperiod before commencing any closures or consolidations that result \nfrom CARES recommendations. It is imperative that Congress have a role \nin this process, as the delivery of health care to our nation's \nveterans will be greatly affected by its outcome. This became \nparticularly apparent when the Draft National Plan was unveiled, \nrevealing the targeting for closure of up to 6,000 beds nationwide--\nincluding some 1,500 long-term care and 800 psychiatry beds. As long-\nterm care and mental health were not factored into the original CARES \nmodel, many questions were raised about the validity of the process.\n  The Veterans Health Care, Capital Asset, and Business Improvement Act \nof 2003 would also authorize the construction of a comprehensive \noutpatient medical care facility at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, in \nPensacola, FL. The clinic, as envisioned, would be a joint venture \nbetween VA and the Department of the Navy. This area of my home state \nis greatly underserved in terms of medical facilities for \nservicemembers and veterans, and I am pleased to be a part of bringing \nvital health care services to the region.\n  Because of the need for quality, accessible hospital services for \nveterans in the Pensacola area and surrounding counties, this bill \nwould require VA to develop a plan to meet their inpatient needs. While \nthere is no doubt that the VA-Navy clinic would provide vital \noutpatient services, inpatient care will still be lacking. This \nprovision seeks to address that facet of the health care continuum for \nveterans in the Panhandle.\n  Another important provision of the compromise agreement would expand \nVA's assisted living pilot program to one additional site. The assisted \nliving pilot program is designed to help the large numbers of men and \nwomen in the VA system over the age of 65, who either need long-term \ncare now or potentially will need it in the future. The pilot program \nwas first established through The Veterans Millennium Health Care and \nBenefits Act, which gave VA clear authority to furnish an assisted \nliving service, including to the spouses of veterans.\n  The CARES Draft National Plan also puts emphasis on assisted living \nprograms. No fewer than 19 sites are proposed to be converted into \nassisted living facilities. The assisted living pilot program seeks to \nhelp VA address inequities in availability of noninstitutional services \nby developing models for proliferating the program nationwide. I am \nhopeful that Network 8 will apply to be the next pilot program. There \nis a great need for long-term care services in my home state of \nFlorida.\n  I am proud to have worked on this valuable piece of legislation for \nour Nation's veterans, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I commend Senator Arlen Specter and the \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs for their efforts in support of S. 1156, \nthe Veterans Health Care Authorities Extension and Improvement Act of \n2003, which would improve the provision of long-term health care for \nveterans by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the section of S. \n1156 that authorizes the VA to provide Filipino veterans residing in \nthe United States the same medical benefits that are currently provided \nto veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States. Approximately \n9,500 Filipino veterans residing in the United States would be eligible \nfor these benefits.\n  Many of you are aware of my continued support and advocacy on behalf \nof the Filipino World War II veterans, and the importance of addressing \ntheir plight. As an American, I believe the treatment of Filipino World \nWar II veterans is bleak and shameful. Throughout the years, I have \nsponsored several measures to rectify the wrongs committed against \nthese World War II veterans, and I am grateful to the committee for the \nassistance and consideration given to my past initiatives. While some \nstrides have been made, I believe more needs to be done to assist these \nveterans who are in their twilight years. Of the 120,000 who originally \nserved in the Commonwealth Army during World War II, approximately \n59,899 Filipino veterans currently reside in the United States and the \nPhilippines. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the \nFilipino veteran population is expected to decrease to approximately \n20,000, or roughly one-third of the current population, by 2010.\n  I support the provision in S. 1156 that authorizes the VA to provide \nFilipino veterans residing in the United States the same medical \nbenefits that are currently provided to veterans of the Armed Forces of \nthe United States. However, I remain concerned that these benefits are \nrestricted to only those veterans residing in the United States. In my \nview, a distinction should not be made between veterans residing in the \nUnited States and those residing in the Philippines.\n  As a result of a citizenship statute enacted by the Congress in 1990, \nsome Filipino veterans who were able to travel came to the United \nStates to become United States citizens. At the same time, many other \nFilipino World War II veterans were unable to travel to the United \nStates and take advantage of the naturalization benefit because of \ntheir advanced age. The law was subsequently amended in the Fiscal Year \n1993 Departments of State, Justice, Commerce and the Judiciary \nAppropriations Act, Public Law 102-395, to allow the naturalization \nprocess for these veterans to occur in the Philippines. Since then, a \ndistinction has been made, and benefits have been provided to only \nthose Filipino veterans residing in the United States.\n  I believe it is unfair to make this distinction. The Commonwealth \nArmy of the Philippines was called to serve with the United States \nArmed Forces in the Far East during World War II under President \nRoosevelt's July 26, 1941, military order. Together, these gallant men \nand women stood in harm's way with our American soldiers to fight our \ncommon enemies during World War II. Because all Filipino veterans stood \nin equal jeopardy during World War II, I do not believe we should draw \na distinction based on their current residency in the U.S. or in the \nPhilippines. All of them were at equal risk, and so all should receive \nequal benefits.\n  Accordingly, I introduced S. 68, the Filipino Veterans' Benefits \nImprovements Act of 2003, which provides health and disability \ncompensation benefits that are similar to the provision included in S. \n1156, but without limitations based on the residency of the veterans. I \nstrongly urge Chairman Specter and members of the Committee to give \nconsideration to S. 68, and to work with me in the coming year to \nprovide health benefits to veterans residing in the Philippines.\n  Heroes should never be forgotten or ignored, so let us not turn our \nbacks on those who sacrificed so much. Many of the Filipinos who fought \nso hard for our nation have been honored with American citizenship. Let \nus now work to repay all of these brave men and women for their \nsacrifices by providing them the veterans' benefits they deserve.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsubstitute amendment which is at the desk be agreed to, the committee \nsubstitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, the amendment to the title as reported be \namended with the amendment at the desk, the title amendment, as \namended, be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table \nen bloc, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2203) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2204) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2204\n\n       Amend the title to read as follows: ``A bill to amend title \n     38, United States Code, to improve and enhance provision of \n     health care\n\n[[Page S15133]]\n\n     for veterans, to authorize major construction projects and \n     other facilities matters for the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, to enhance and improve authorities relating to the \n     administration of personnel of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, and for other purposes.''.\n  The bill (S. 1156), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The title amendment, as amended, was agreed to\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/19/senate-section/article/S15133-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15133-S15140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVING BENEFITS UNDER LAWS ADMINISTERED BY THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS \n                                AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nH.R. 2297 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \ncommittee is discharged.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2297) to amend title 38, United States Code, \n     to improve benefits under laws administered by the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition today to \nexplain briefly the provisions of H.R. 2297, the proposed Veterans \nBenefits Act of 2003, that the Ranking Member of the Committee on \nVeterans Affairs, Senator Graham of Florida, and I propose be approved, \nas amended, by the Senate. H.R. 2297, as so amended and as presented to \nthe Senate today, incorporates agreements reached between the Senate \nCommittee of Veterans Affairs, which I am privileged to chair, and our \ncounterpart Committee in the House of Representatives, on legislation \nrelating to the provision of non-healthcare-related benefits by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  H.R. 2297, as amended, contains provisions derived from S. 1132, the \nproposed Veterans Benefits Enhancements Act of 2003, as approved by the \nSenate on October 31, 2003, and S. 1156, as reported by the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs on November 10, 2003. It also contains provisions \nderived from H.R. 2297, as approved by the House on October 8, 2003; \nH.R. 1257, as approved by the House on May 22, 2003; and H.R. 1460, as \namended from the bill approved by the House on June 24, 2003. Inasmuch \nas S. 1132, as approved by the Senate earlier this year, had itself \nincorporated provisions derived from 11 Senate bills--meaning that H.R. \n2297 contains provisions derived from 15 separate bills--it is apparent \nthat this bill represents the work and ideas of many sponsors with many \ndiffering interests. I thank the Ranking Member, Senator Graham of \nFlorida, and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on \nVeterans Affairs, Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey and \nRepresentative Lane Evans of Illinois, for the spirit of cooperation \nand bipartisanship that they showed in addressing the sometimes-\ncompeting interests in play as 15 pieces of legislation were knitted \ninto a single, coherent whole.\n  Since this is a lengthy bill--over 50 pages--I will not endeavor in \nthis statement to explain in detail each and every provision. Rather, I \nwill discuss the highlights briefly in this statement, and refer my \ncolleagues to a Joint Explanatory Statement. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint in the Record a detailed explanation of the bill as amended.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nExplanatory Statement on Senate Amendment to House Bill, H.R. 2297, as \n                                Amended\n\n       H.R. 2297, as amended, the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, \n     reflects a Compromise Agreement reached by the House and \n     Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs (``the Committees'') \n     on the following bills considered in the House and Senate \n     during the 108th Congress: H.R. 1257; H.R. 1460, as amended; \n     H.R. 2297, as amended (``House Bill''); and S. 1132, as \n     amended (``Senate Bill''). H.R. 1257 passed the House on May \n     22, 2003; H.R. 1460, as amended, passed the House on June 24, \n     2003; H.R. 2297, as amended, passed the House on October 8, \n     2003; S. 1132, as amended, passed the Senate on October 31, \n     2003.\n       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     prepared the following explanation of H.R. 2297, as amended \n     (``Compromise Agreement''). Differences between the \n     provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement and the \n     related provisions of H.R. 1257, H.R. 1460, as amended, H.R. \n     2297, as amended, and S. 1132, as amended, are noted in this \n     document, except for clerical corrections, conforming changes \n     made necessary by the Compromise Agreement, and minor \n     drafting, technical, and clarifying changes.\n\n                       TITLE I: SURVIVOR BENEFITS\n\n\n retention of certain veterans survivor benefits for surviving spouses \n                        remarrying after age 57\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 103(d) of title 38, United States Code, prohibits a \n     surviving spouse who has remarried from receiving dependency \n     and indemnity compensation (``DIC'') and related housing and \n     education benefits during the course of the remarriage. This \n     benefit may be reinstated in the event the subsequent \n     marriage is terminated. Public Law 107-330 extended to \n     surviving spouses who remarry after age 55 continuing \n     eligibility under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs (``CHAMPVA'').\n     House Bill\n       Section 6 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would allow a surviving \n     spouse who remarries after attaining age 55 to retain the DIC \n     benefit. Spouses who remarry at age 55 or older prior to \n     enactment of the bill would have one year from the date of \n     enactment to apply for reinstatement of DIC benefits. The \n     amount of DIC would be paid with no reduction of certain \n     other Federal benefits to which the surviving spouse might be \n     entitled.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 101 of the Compromise Agreement would provide that \n     a surviving spouse upon remarriage after attaining age 57 \n     would retain DIC, home loan, and educational benefits \n     eligibility. Surviving spouses who remarried after \n     attaining age 57 prior to enactment of the Compromise \n     Agreement would have one year to apply for reinstatement \n     of these benefits.\n\n\nbenefits for children with spina bifida of veterans of certain service \n                                in korea\n\n     Current Law\n       Chapter 18 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA'') to provide benefits \n     and services to those children born with spina bifida whose \n     natural parent (before the child was conceived) served in the \n     Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962 and May 7, 1975. \n     Benefits and services are authorized due to the association \n     between exposure to dioxin and the incidence of spina bifida \n     in the children of those exposed. Children born with spina \n     bifida whose parent was exposed to dioxin and other \n     herbicides during military service in locations other than \n     the Republic of Vietnam do not qualify for VA benefits and \n     services.\n     House Bill\n       Section 12 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would permit children \n     born with spina bifida whose parent (before the child was \n     conceived) served in an area of Korea near the demilitarized \n     zone (``DMZ'') between October 1, 1967 and May 7, 1975, to \n     qualify for benefits in the same manner as children whose \n     parent served in the Republic of Vietnam.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 101 of S. 1132, as amended, would permit children \n     with spina bifida whose parent (before the child was \n     conceived) served in or near the DMZ in Korea during the \n     period beginning on January 1, 1967, and ending on December \n     31, 1969, to qualify for benefits in the same manner as \n     children whose parent served in the Republic of Vietnam. The \n     Senate Bill would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     to make determinations of exposure to herbicides in Korea in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement would generally \n     follow the Senate language. However, under the Compromise \n     Agreement, the time period for qualifying service in or near \n     the DMZ is changed to service which occurred during the \n     period beginning on September 1, 1967, and ending on August \n     31, 1971. The Committees note that although use of herbicides \n     in Vietnam ceased in 1971, Vietnam-era veterans who served \n     until May 7, 1975, are presumed to have been exposed to \n     residuals. Similarly, even though herbicide use in or near \n     the Korean DMZ ended in 1969, the Committees believe it is \n     appropriate to extend the qualifying service period beyond \n     1969 to account for residual exposure.\n       The Committees also note that the Secretary of Defense has \n     identified the following units as those assigned or rotated \n     to areas near the DMZ where herbicides were used between 1968 \n     and 1969: combat brigades of the 2nd Infantry Division (1-38 \n     Infantry, 2-38 Infantry, 1-23 Infantry, 2-23 Infantry, 3-23 \n     Infantry, 3-32 Infantry, 1-9 Infantry, 2-9 Infantry, 1-72 \n     Armor, and 2-72 Armor); Division Reaction Force (4-7th \n     Cavalry, Counter Agent Company); 3rd Brigade of the 7th \n     Infantry Division (1-17th Infantry, 2-17 Infantry, 1-73 Armor \n     and 2-10th Cavalry); and Field Artillery, Signal and Engineer \n     support personnel.\n\n[[Page S15134]]\n\nalternate beneficiaries for national service life insurance and united \n                    states government life insurance\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1917 of title 38, United States Code, gives \n     veterans insured under the VA's National Service Life \n     Insurance (``NSLI'') program the right to designate the \n     beneficiary or beneficiaries of insurance policies maturing \n     on or after August 1, 1946. It also specifies the modes of \n     payment to beneficiaries when an insured dies, and sets forth \n     the procedure to be followed when a beneficiary has not been \n     designated or dies before the insured.\n       Section 1949 of title 38, United States Code, gives \n     veterans insured under the United States Government Life \n     Insurance (``USGLI'') program the right to change \n     beneficiaries, and sections 1950 through 1952 of title 38 set \n     out the modes of payment to designated beneficiaries and sets \n     forth the procedure to be followed when a beneficiary either \n     has not been designated or dies before the insured. For the \n     NSLI and USGLI programs, the law does not specify the course \n     of action VA is to take when no beneficiary can be found.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 102 of S. 1132, as amended, would authorize the \n     payment of NSLI and USGLI to alternate beneficiaries, in \n     order of precedence and as designated by the insured veteran, \n     if no claim is made by the primary beneficiary within two \n     years of the insured veteran's death. If four years have \n     elapsed since the death of the insured and no claim has been \n     filed by a person designated by the insured as a beneficiary, \n     section 102 would authorize VA to make payment to a person VA \n     determines to be equitably entitled to such payment.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n        payment of benefits accrued and unpaid at time of death\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 5121 of title 38, United States Code, restricts \n     specified classes of survivors to receiving no more than two \n     years of accrued benefits if a veteran dies while a claim for \n     VA periodic monetary benefits (other than insurance and \n     servicemen's indemnity) is being adjudicated.

Generally, those eligible for DEA benefits are the \n     spouses and dependents of: veterans with total and permanent \n     service-connected ratings; veterans who died as a result of \n     service-related injuries; or servicemembers who died while on \n     active duty. Currently, monthly benefit rates for eligible \n     DEA beneficiaries are $695 for full-time study, $522 for \n     three-quarter-time study, and $347 for half-time study. \n     Monthly DEA benefits are also available for beneficiaries \n     pursuing programs of education on a less-than-half-time \n     basis, through farm cooperative programs, correspondence \n     courses, special restorative training programs, or programs \n     of apprenticeship or other approved on-job training programs.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 104 of S. 1132, as amended, would raise monthly DEA \n     benefits by 13.4 percent over current levels.

Section 3452 of title 38, United \n     States Code, furnishes various legal definitions used in the \n     administration of VA educational assistance programs. Section \n     3471 of title 38, United States Code, establishes general \n     requirements which must be met by educational institutions \n     before VA may approve applications for educational assistance \n     from veterans or eligible persons. There is no provision in \n     current law authorizing the approval of entrepreneurship \n     courses.\n     House Bill\n       Section 2 of H.R 1460, as amended, would allow State \n     approving agencies to approve non-degree, non-credit \n     entrepreneurship courses offered by a Small Business \n     Development Center (``SBDC'') or the National Veterans \n     Business Development Corporation for the training of \n     veterans, disabled veterans, dependent spouses and children \n     of certain disabled or deceased veterans, and members of the \n     National Guard and Selected Reserve. VA would also be \n     prohibited from considering a beneficiary as already \n     qualified for the objective of a program of education offered \n     by a qualified provider of an entrepreneurship course solely \n     because he or she is the owner or operator of a small \n     business.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n    REPEAL OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO OBSOLETE EDUCATION LOAN PROGRAM\n\n     Current Law\n       Subchapter III of chapter 36 of title 38, United States \n     Code, establishes VA's education loan program, states policy \n     regarding eligibility, amount, condition, and interest rates \n     of loans, and establishes a revolving fund and insurance \n     against defaults as part of its administration. This program \n     has been in effect since January 1, 1975.\n     House Bill\n       Section 5 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would, effective on the \n     date of enactment, repeal the VA education loan program and \n     waive any existing repayment obligations of a veteran, \n     including overpayments due to default on these loans.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 305 of S. 1132, as amended, contains a comparable \n     provision, but terminates the program 90 days after date of \n     enactment.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 306 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n    SIX-YEAR EXTENSION OF VETERANS' ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3692 of title 38, United States Code, requires the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs to administer a Veterans' \n     Advisory Committee on Education. It requires the Secretary to \n     consult with and seek the advice of the Advisory Committee \n     from time to time with respect to the administration of \n     chapters 30, 32, and 35 of title 38, United States Code, \n     and chapter 1606 of title 10, United States Code. The \n     Advisory Committee's authorization expires on December 31, \n     2003.\n     House Bill\n       Section 4 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would extend, through \n     December 31, 2009, the Veterans' Advisory Committee on \n     Education, as well as amend the language to eliminate the \n     requirement that veterans from certain periods--World War II, \n     Korean conflict era, or post-Korean conflict era--be required \n     to participate as members of the Advisory Committee.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 342 of S. 1132, as amended, would extend the \n     Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education through December \n     31, 2013, and maintain the existing membership requirements, \n     as practicable.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 307 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language with regard to membership, and the House language \n     with regard to extending the Advisory Committee's \n     authorization date through December 31, 2009.\n\n\nPROCUREMENT PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY \n                  QUALIFIED SERVICE-DISABLED VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Sections 631 through 657 of title 15, United States Code, \n     establish policies with respect to aid to small businesses. \n     Section 637 specifies Small Business Administration (``SBA'') \n     authorities regarding procurement matters. Section 637(a) \n     specifies SBA authorities with respect to procurement \n     contracts and subcontracts to disadvantaged small business \n     concerns. Section 637(d) establishes policies regarding \n     performance of contracts by small business concerns \n     (``SBC''), as described in title 15, United States Code. \n     Section 637(h) establishes policies regarding award of \n     contracts, procedures other than competitive ones, and \n     exceptions.\n     House Bill\n       Section 3 of H.R. 1460, as amended, would provide Federal \n     agencies discretionary authority to create ``sole-source'' \n     contracts for service-disabled veteran-owned and controlled \n     small businesses, up to $5 million for manufacturing contract \n     awards and up to $3 million for non-manufacturing contract \n     awards.\n       This section would provide Federal agencies discretionary \n     authority to restrict certain contracts to service-disabled \n     veteran-owned and controlled small businesses if at least two \n     such concerns are qualified to bid on the contract.\n       Section 3 would establish a contracting priority that \n     places restricted and ``sole\n\n[[Page S15136]]\n\n     source'' contracts for service-disabled veteran-owned and \n     controlled small businesses immediately below the priority \n     for socially and economically disadvantaged firms (known as \n     ``8(a)'' program contracts) for all Federal departments and \n     agencies except VA. Such priorities for service-disabled \n     veteran-owned and controlled small businesses would rank \n     above priorities for HUBZone and women-owned businesses. \n     HUBZones are SBCs located in historically underutilized \n     business zones. However, a contracting officer would procure \n     from a source on the basis of a preference provided under any \n     provision of this legislation unless the contracting officer \n     had determined the procurement could be made by a contracting \n     authority having a higher priority. Lastly, procurement could \n     not be made from a source on the basis of preference provided \n     under this legislation if the procurement could otherwise be \n     made from a different source under section 4124 or 4125 of \n     title 18, United States Code, or the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act.\n       Section 3 would establish a four-year pilot program in the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs in which service-disabled \n     veteran-owned and controlled small businesses would have the \n     same contracting priority as the 8(a) program.\n       This section would define ``qualified service-disabled \n     veteran'' as any veteran who (1) has one or more disabilities \n     that are service-connected as defined in section 101(16) of \n     title 38, United States Code, and are rated at 10 percent or \n     more by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, or (2) is entitled \n     to benefits under section 1151 of title 38, United States \n     Code.\n       Section 3 would define ``small business concerns owned and \n     controlled by qualified service-disabled veterans'' as (1) \n     one in which not less than 51 percent of which is owned by \n     one or more qualified service-disabled veterans or, in the \n     case of any publicly-owned businesses, not less than 51 \n     percent of the stock of which is owned by one or more \n     qualified service-disabled veterans, and (2) the management \n     and daily business operations of which are controlled by one \n     or more qualified service-disabled veterans or, in the case \n     of a veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse \n     or permanent care giver of the veteran.\n       Section 3 would define the term ``certified small business \n     concerns owned and controlled any qualified service-disabled \n     veterans'' as any small business concern owned and controlled \n     by qualified service-disabled veterans that is certified by \n     the Administrator of the Small Business Administration as \n     being such a concern.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 308 of the Compromise Agreement would provide \n     Federal contracting officials the discretionary authority to \n     award sole source contracts (limited to contracts of up to $5 \n     million for manufacturing and $3 million for non-\n     manufacturing) to SBCs owned and controlled by service-\n     disabled veterans. This section would also provide Federal \n     contracting officials, in certain circumstances, the \n     discretionary authority to award contracts on a restricted \n     competition basis to SBCs owned and controlled by service-\n     disabled veterans. This provision would not supercede any \n     existing procurement preference established under law. \n     Specifically, it would not accord service-disabled veteran \n     small business owners priority over procurement preferences \n     under the Federal Prison Industries, Javits-Wagner-O'Day, SBA \n     8(a), Women's, or HubZone programs. Rather, the Committees \n     intend the provision to provide Federal contracting officials \n     a means to improve their results with respect to contracting \n     with service-disabled veterans. The Committees note that in \n     1999, Public Law 106-50 established a 3 percent government-\n     wide goal for procurement from service-disabled veteran-owned \n     small businesses. To date, all Federal agencies fall far \n     short of reaching this procurement goal. The Committees \n     intend that a determination of service-connection by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs would be binding on the SBA \n     for purposes of participation in this program. The \n     Committees also urge the SBA and the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy to expeditiously and transparently \n     implement this program, perform outreach, and provide the \n     necessary resources to improve results with respect to \n     SBCs owned and operated by service-disabled veterans.\n\n\n        outstationing of transition assistance program personnel\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1144 of title 10, United States Code, authorizes \n     the Secretary of Labor to place staff in veterans' assistance \n     offices on military installations, both foreign and domestic, \n     to help transitioning servicemembers obtain civilian jobs.\n     House Bill\n       Section 19 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would require the \n     Department of Labor to place staff in veterans' assistance \n     offices where VA staff are located at overseas military \n     installations 90 days after enactment. It would also \n     authorize the Department of Labor to exceed the number of VA \n     locations and place staff in additional locations abroad.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 309 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with a technical modification.\n\n             TITLE IV: HOUSING BENEFITS AND RELATED MATTERS\n\n\nauthorization to provide adapted housing assistance to certain disabled \n         members of the armed forces who remain on active duty\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2101 of title 38, United States Code, provides for \n     grants to adapt or acquire suitable housing for certain \n     severely disabled veterans, including veterans who are unable \n     to ambulate without assistance. Severely disabled \n     servicemembers who have not yet been processed for discharge \n     from military service, but who will qualify for the benefit \n     upon discharge due to the severity of their disabilities, are \n     not allowed to apply for or receive the grant until they are \n     actually discharged from military service.\n     House Bill\n       Section 4 of H.R. 1460, as amended, would permit a member \n     of the Armed Forces to apply for and receive a grant prior to \n     actually being discharged from military service.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 401 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\nincrease in amounts for certain adaptive benefits for disabled veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is authorized in chapter \n     21 of title 38, United States Code, to assist eligible \n     veterans in acquiring suitable housing and adaptations with \n     special fixtures made necessary by the nature of the \n     veteran's service-connected disability, and with the \n     necessary land. The maximum amount authorized for a severely \n     disabled veteran is $48,000. The maximum amount authorized \n     for less severely disabled veterans is $9,250.\n       Section 3902(a) of title 38, United States Code, authorizes \n     the Secretary to pay up to $9,000 to an eligible disabled \n     servicemember or veteran to purchase an automobile (including \n     all state, local, and other taxes).\n     House Bill\n       Section 10(a) of H.R. 2297, as amended, would increase the \n     specially adapted housing grants for the most severely \n     disabled veterans from $48,000 to $50,000, and from $9,250 to \n     $10,000 for less severely disabled veterans.\n       Section 10(b) would increase the specially adapted \n     automobile grant from $9,000 to $11,000.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 402 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n   permanent authority for housing loans for members of the selected \n                                reserve\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 3702(a)(2)(E) of title 38, United States \n     Code, members of the Selected Reserve qualify for a VA home \n     loan if the reservist has served for a minimum of six years. \n     Eligibility for reservists under this program is scheduled to \n     expire on September 30, 2009.\n     House Bill\n       Section 13 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would make the \n     Selected Reserve home loan program permanent.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 403 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n\n     reinstatement of minimum requirements for sale of vendee loans\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3733 of title 38, United States Code, generally \n     establishes property management policies for real property \n     acquired by the Department of Veterans Affairs as a result of \n     a default on a loan that VA has guaranteed.\n     House Bill\n       Section 15 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would reinstate the \n     vendee loan program which VA administratively terminated on \n     January 31, 2003. It would increase from 65 percent to 85 \n     percent the maximum number of purchases of real property the \n     Secretary may finance in a fiscal year. It would change the \n     vendee loan program from a discretionary to a mandatory one.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 308 of S. 1132, as amended, contains an identical \n     provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 404 of the Compromise Agreement contains this \n     provision. However, the Compromise Agreement specifies that \n     the changes made under this provision shall expire after \n     September 30, 2013.\n\n\n  adjustment to home loan fees and uniformity of fees for qualifying \n           reserve members with fees for active duty veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3729(a) of title 38, United States Code, requires \n     that a fee shall be collected\n\n[[Page S15137]]\n\n     from each person (1) obtaining a housing loan guaranteed, \n     insured, or made under chapter 37; and (2) assuming a loan to \n     which section 3714 (concerning loan assumptions) applies. The \n     fee may be included in the loan.\n       Section 3729(b) of title 38, United States Code, determines \n     the amount of the home loan fees expressed as a percentage of \n     the total amount of the loan guaranteed, insured, or made, \n     or, in the case of a loan assumption, the unpaid principal \n     balance of the loan on the date of the transfer of the \n     property.\n       Section 3729(b)(2) requires that veterans who served in the \n     Selected Reserve pay 75 basis points more than veterans with \n     active duty service.\n     House Bill\n       Section 14 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would make four \n     revisions to the Loan Fee Table. First, it would provide \n     uniformity in the funding fees for VA-guaranteed home loans \n     charged to those who served in the Selected Reserve and \n     veterans with active duty service. Second, beginning in \n     fiscal year 2004, it would increase the fee charged for loans \n     made with no down payment by 15 basis points. Third, it would \n     increase the fee charged for repeated use of the home loan \n     benefit, i.e., for a second or subsequent loan, by 30 basis \n     points for the fiscal year 2004-2011 period and by 90 basis \n     points in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Fourth, it would \n     replace the existing range of fees for hybrid adjustable rate \n     mortgages under the current pilot program with a flat fee of \n     1.25 percent.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 307 of S. 1132, as amended, would increase the \n     funding fees for subsequent use of a guaranty by 50 basis \n     points, but only between fiscal years 2005 and 2011.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 405 of the Compromise Agreement would follow the \n     House language, except that a funding fee for members of the \n     Selected Reserve would, for initial use of a guaranty, be set \n     25 basis points higher than applicable funding fees set for \n     veterans with active duty service. Further, for the period \n     January 1, 2004 through September 30, 2004 only, in the case \n     of active-duty veterans making initial loans with zero \n     dollars down, the fee would be increased from 2.15 percent to \n     2.20 percent. In addition, the Compromise Agreement would not \n     effect a 1.25 percent flat fee for hybrid adjustable rate \n     mortgage loans.\n\n\none-year extension of procedures on liquidation sales of defaulted home \n         loans guaranteed by the department of veterans affairs\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3732 of title 38, United States Code, defines the \n     procedures for a liquidation sale of a property acquired by \n     VA in the event of a default on a VA-guaranteed home loan. \n     The procedures direct VA to follow a formula, defined in \n     statute, which mandates VA consider losses it might incur \n     when selling properties acquired through foreclosure. \n     Ultimately, after considering the loss VA can make a \n     determination whether to, in fact, acquire the property or \n     simply pay the guaranty on the loan used to purchase the \n     property. The authority for these procedures is currently set \n     to expire on October 1, 2011.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 406 of the Compromise Agreement would extend the \n     application of the liquidation sale procedures through \n     October 1, 2012.\n\n                        TITLE V: BURIAL BENEFITS\n\n\n                         BURIAL PLOT ALLOWANCE\n\n     Current Law\n       Veterans who are discharged from active duty service as a \n     result of a service-connected disability, veterans who are \n     entitled to disability compensation or VA pension, and \n     veterans who die in a VA facility are eligible for a $300 VA \n     ``plot allowance'' if they are not buried in a national \n     cemetery. Section 2303(b)(1) of title 38, United States Code, \n     allows state cemeteries to receive the $300 plot allowance \n     payment for the interment of such veterans, and the interment \n     of veterans of any war, if the cemeteries are used solely for \n     the burial of veterans. However, states may not receive a \n     plot allowance for burial of veterans who die as a result of \n     a service-connected disability and whose survivors seek \n     reimbursement of funeral expenses under section 2307 of title \n     38, United States Code (which currently authorizes a $2,000 \n     funeral expense benefit).\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 201 of S. 1132, as amended, would expand existing \n     law to allow states to receive the $300 plot allowance for \n     the interment of veterans who did not serve during a wartime \n     period and for the interment of veterans who died as a result \n     of service-connected disabilities and whose survivors sought \n     reimbursement of funeral expenses under section 2307 of title \n     38, United States Code.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 501 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n  ELIGIBILITY OF SURVIVING SPOUSES WHO REMARRY FOR BURIAL IN NATIONAL \n                               CEMETERIES\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2402(5) of title 38, United States Code, prohibits \n     a surviving spouse of a veteran who has remarried from being \n     buried with the veteran spouse in a national cemetery if the \n     remarriage is in effect when the veteran's surviving spouse \n     dies. Public Law 103-466 revised eligibility criteria for \n     burial in a national cemetery to reinstate burial eligibility \n     for a surviving spouse of an eligible veteran whose \n     subsequent remarriage was terminated by death or divorce.\n     House Bill\n       Section 7 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would allow the \n     surviving spouse of a veteran to be eligible for burial in a \n     VA national cemetery based on his or her marriage to the \n     veteran, regardless of the status of the subsequent marriage. \n     This eligibility revision would be effective January 1, 2000.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 202 of S. 1132, as amended, contains a similar \n     provision, with the eligibility revision being effective on \n     date of enactment.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 502 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language. Despite the inclusion of an additional group of \n     persons (i.e., remarried spouses) eligible for national \n     cemetery burial under the Compromise Agreement, the Secretary \n     retains the authority under section 2402(6) of title 38, \n     United States Code, to grant or deny national cemetery burial \n     for other persons, or classes of persons, not explicitly \n     granted eligibility in statute. It has come to the \n     Committees' attention that VA's record-keeping system \n     concerning which persons are granted or denied waivers for \n     burial in national cemeteries is, at best, incomplete. \n     Adequate records on burial waivers are necessary to ensure \n     that the Secretary's judgment on waiver cases is being \n     applied uniformly to all applicants. The Committees direct VA \n     to rectify gaps in its waiver-accounting system so that basic \n     information, such as which persons are denied burial waivers \n     and the reasons for the denial, will be available.\n\n\n         PERMANENT AUTHORITY FOR STATE CEMETERY GRANTS PROGRAM\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2408(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code, \n     authorizes appropriations, through fiscal year 2004, for VA \n     to make grants to States to assist them in establishing, \n     expanding, or improving state veterans' cemeteries.\n     House Bill\n       Section 8 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would make the State \n     Cemetery Grants Program permanent.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 203 of S. 1132, as amended, contains a similar \n     provision with an additional technical change.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 503 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n               TITLE VI: EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES\n\n\n     RADIATION DOSE RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3.311 of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, \n     sets out procedures for the adjudication of claims by VA for \n     benefits premised on a veteran's exposure to ionizing \n     radiation in service. For veterans who claim radiation \n     exposure due to participation in nuclear atmospheric testing \n     from 1945 through 1962, or due to occupation duty in \n     Hiroshima and Nagasaki prior to July 1, 1946, dose data are \n     requested from the Department of Defense (``DOD''). DOD's \n     Defense Threat Reduction Agency (``DTRA'') pays a private \n     contractor to estimate radiation exposure through a process \n     called radiation dose reconstruction.\n       There is no entity under existing law which provides \n     independent oversight of DTRA's radiation dose reconstruction \n     process.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 331 of S. 1132, as amended, would require VA and \n     DOD to review, and report on the mission, procedures, and \n     administration of the radiation dose reconstruction program. \n     It would also require VA and DOD to establish an advisory \n     board to oversee the program.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 601 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n             STUDY ON DISPOSITION OF AIR FORCE HEALTH STUDY\n\n     Current Law\n       The Air Force Health Study (``AFHS'') was initiated by DOD \n     in 1982 to examine the effects of herbicide exposure and \n     health, mortality, and reproductive outcomes in veterans of \n     Operation Ranch Hand, the activity responsible for aerial \n     spraying of herbicides during the Vietnam Conflict. The study \n     will conclude in 2006.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 332 of S. 1132, as amended, would direct VA to \n     enter into an agreement with\n\n[[Page S15138]]\n\n     the National Academy of Sciences (``NAS'') under which NAS \n     would report on the following: (1) the scientific merit of \n     retaining AFHS data after the Ranch Hand study is terminated; \n     (2) obstacles to retaining the AFHS data which may exist; (3) \n     the advisability of providing independent oversight of the \n     data; (4) the advisability and prospective costs of extending \n     the study and the identity of an entity which would be suited \n     to continue the study; and (5) the advisability of making \n     laboratory specimens from the study available for independent \n     research.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 602 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language, but the reporting deadline is extended to 120 days.\n\n\n    FUNDING OF MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP AGENCY OF INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE OF \nNATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON MEMBERS OF \n                     THE ARMED FORCES AND VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Public Law 102-585 requires that VA and DOD each contribute \n     $250,000 in annual core funding to the Medical Follow-Up \n     Agency (``MFUA'') for a period of 10 years. MFUA is a panel \n     of the Institute of Medicine which researches military health \n     issues.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 333 of S. 1132, as amended, would mandate VA and \n     DOD funding for MFUA, at current levels, from fiscal year \n     2004 through 2013.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 603 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n                        TITLE VII: OTHER MATTERS\n\n\n TIME LIMITATIONS ON RECEIPT OF CLAIM INFORMATION PURSUANT TO REQUESTS \n                   OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 5102(b) of title 38, United States Code, requires \n     that VA, in cases where it receives an application for \n     benefits that is not complete, notify the applicant of the \n     information that is necessary to complete the application for \n     benefits. Similarly, section 5103(a) of title 38, United \n     States Code, requires that VA, when it receives a complete or \n     a substantially complete application for benefits, notify the \n     applicant of any information or evidence necessary to \n     substantiate the claim. Section 5103(b) of title 38, United \n     States Code, states that if information or evidence requested \n     under section 5103(a) is not received within one year of the \n     date of such notification, no benefit may be paid by reason \n     of that application for benefits.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 310 of S. 1132, as amended, would require that \n     claimants who have submitted an incomplete application under \n     section 5102(b) of title 38, United States Code, and who have \n     been notified that information is required to complete the \n     application, submit the information within one year of the \n     date of notification or else no benefit would be paid by \n     reason of the application. It would also clarify section \n     5103(b) by stating that that subsection would not be \n     construed to prohibit VA from making a decision on a claim \n     before the expiration of the one-year period. Section 310 \n     would be effective as if enacted on November 9, 2000, \n     immediately after the enactment of the Veterans Claims \n     Assistance Act of 2000.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 701 of the Compromise Agreement would follow the \n     Senate language, but would make a further amendment to \n     section 5103(b) of title 38, United States Code, to remove \n     the statutory bar to payment of benefits when information or \n     evidence, requested of the claimant by VA, is not submitted \n     within one year of the notification requesting such \n     information or evidence. If a matter is on appeal and \n     evidence is received beyond the one-year period relating \n     to the original claim, it should be considered.\n       Section 701(d)(1) of the Compromise Agreement would require \n     VA to readjudicate the original claim when a claimant \n     adequately asserts he or she was misled upon receiving \n     notification from VA of the information or evidence needed to \n     substantiate the claim. However, section 701(d)(4) specifies \n     that the Secretary is not required to identify or \n     readjudicate any claim based upon the authority given to the \n     Secretary under this section when information or evidence was \n     submitted during the one-year period following the \n     notification or when the claim has been the subject of a \n     timely appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals or the United \n     States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.\n\n\nCLARIFICATION OF APPLICABILITY OF PROHIBITION ON ASSIGNMENT OF VETERANS \n      BENEFITS TO AGREEMENTS ON FUTURE RECEIPT OF CERTAIN BENEFITS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 5301 of title 38, United States Code, prohibits the \n     assignment of VA benefits and exempts such benefits from \n     taxation and from the claims of creditors.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 311 of S. 1132, as amended, would clarify current \n     statutory language prohibiting the assignment of benefits and \n     specify that any agreement under which a VA beneficiary might \n     purport to transfer to another person or entity the right to \n     receive direct or indirect payments of compensation, pension, \n     or DIC benefits shall be deemed to be a prohibited \n     assignment. Section 311 would also make it clear that such \n     prohibitory language would not bar loans to VA beneficiaries \n     which might be repaid with funds derived from VA, so long as \n     each periodic payment made under the loan is separately and \n     voluntarily executed by the beneficiary at the time the \n     payment is made.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 702 of the Compromise Agreement would follow the \n     Senate language but would modify it to state that payments on \n     loans are explicitly allowed when made by preauthorized \n     electronic funds transfers pursuant to the Electronic Funds \n     Transfers Act (``EFTA''). The EFTA defines a characteristic \n     of these transfers as allowing the beneficiary to direct his \n     or her financial institution to cease payments upon the \n     beneficiary's notice. It is the Committees' intent to ensure \n     that methods of loan repayment would not be limited for \n     disabled veterans. The Compromise Agreement would also \n     eliminate the section that specifies the effective date of \n     the provision. It is the Committees' intent that prohibition \n     against assignment shall be enforced through coordination \n     with appropriate authorities.\n\n\n     SIX-YEAR EXTENSION OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON MINORITY VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 544 of title 38, United States Code, mandates that \n     VA establish an Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. The \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs must, on a regular basis, \n     consult with and seek the advice of the Advisory Committee \n     with respect to issues relating to the administration of \n     benefits for minority group veterans. The Secretary must also \n     consult with and seek the advice of the Committee with \n     respect to reports and studies pertaining to such veterans, \n     and the needs of such veterans for compensation, health care, \n     rehabilitation, outreach, and other benefits and programs \n     administered by VA. The Advisory Committee is required to \n     submit an annual report providing its assessment of the needs \n     of minority veterans, VA programs designed to meet those \n     needs, and any recommendations the Advisory Committee \n     considers appropriate. The authorization for the Advisory \n     Committee expires on December 31, 2003.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 341 of S. 1132, as amended, would extend the \n     authorization of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans \n     until December 31, 2007.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 703 of the Compromise Agreement would extend the \n     authorization of the Advisory Committee until December 31, \n     2009.\n\n\n      TEMPORARY AUTHORITY FOR PERFORMANCE OF MEDICAL DISABILITIES \n                  EXAMINATIONS BY CONTRACT PHYSICIANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 504 of Public Law 104-275 authorized VA to carry \n     out a contract disability examination pilot program at 10 VA \n     regional offices. The law specifies that VA draw funds for \n     the program from amounts available to the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs for compensation and pensions.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 343 of S. 1132, as amended, would authorize VA, \n     using funds subject to appropriation, to contract for \n     disability examinations from non-VA providers at all VA \n     regional offices. Such examinations would be conducted \n     pursuant to contracts entered into and administered by the \n     Under Secretary for Benefits. The Secretary's authority under \n     this section would expire on December 31, 2009. No later than \n     four years after the section's enactment, the Secretary would \n     be required to submit a report assessing the cost, \n     timeliness, and thoroughness of disability examinations \n     performed under this section.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 704 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language, but adds a technical modification that would \n     clarify that the authority granted the Secretary under \n     section 704 of the Compromise Agreement is in addition to the \n     authority already granted the Secretary under Section 504 of \n     Public Law 104-275. Thus, it is the Committees' intent that \n     VA's existing contract for disability examinations under the \n     authority of Public Law 104-275 remain in force. It is also \n     the Committees' intent that the Secretary's ability to enter \n     into contracts in the future under the strictures of Section \n     504 of Public Law 104-275 remain in force as well.\n\n\n            FORFEITURE OF BENEFITS FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 6105 of title 38, United States Code, provides that \n     an individual convicted after September 1, 1959, of any of \n     several specified\n\n[[Page S15139]]\n\n     offenses involving subversive activities shall have no right \n     to gratuitous benefits (including the right to burial in a \n     national cemetery) under laws administered by the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs.

The \n     following criminal offenses from title 18, United States \n     Code, would be added: section 175, prohibited activities with \n     respect to biological weapons; section 229, prohibited \n     activities with respect to chemical weapons; section 831, \n     prohibited transactions involving nuclear materials; section \n     1091, genocide; section 2332a, use of certain weapons of mass \n     destruction; and section 2332b, acts of terrorism \n     transcending national boundaries. All of these offenses, \n     which involve serious threats to national security, were \n     added to title 18, United States Code, after the enactment of \n     the provisions in section 6105 of title 38, United States \n     Code.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 313 of S. 1132, as amended, contains an identical \n     provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 705 of the Compromise Agreement contains this \n     provision.\n\n\n TWO-YEAR EXTENSION OF ROUND-DOWN REQUIREMENT FOR COMPENSATION COST-OF-\n                           LIVING ADJUSTMENTS\n\n     Current Law\n       Sections 1104(a) and 1303(a) of title 38, United States \n     Code, mandate that yearly cost-of-living adjustments made to \n     rates of compensation and dependency and indemnity \n     compensation be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar \n     amount.

Expedited \n     treatment of decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals \n     would be codified in chapter 51 of title 38, United States \n     Code. Expedited treatment of decisions of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims would be codified in \n     chapter 71 of title 38, United States Code.\n\n                   LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS NOT ADOPTED\n\n\n    CLARIFICATION OF NOTICE OF DISAGREEMENT FOR APPELLATE REVIEW OF \n               DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ACTIVITIES\n\n     Current Law\n       Claimants for VA benefits who disagree with an initial \n     decision rendered by VA may initiate an appeals process by \n     submitting a written notice of disagreement (``NOD'') within \n     one year after the claimant was notified of the initial \n     decision. Section 7105(b) of title 38, United States Code, \n     states that an NOD ``must be in writing and filed with the \n     activity which entered the determination with which \n     disagreement is expressed.'' Upon the timely filing of an \n     NOD, VA is required to provide appellate review of its \n     initial benefits rating decision.\n       VA has promulgated regulations to implement section 7105 of \n     title 38, United States Code, which state that ``while \n     special wording is not required, the Notice of \n     Disagreement must be in terms which can be reasonably \n     construed as disagreement with the determination and \n     [expressing a] desire for appellate review.'' 38 CFR \n     Sec. 20.201 (2002).\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 314 of S. 1132, as amended, would clarify section \n     7105(b) of title 38, United States Code, by requiring that VA \n     deem any written document which expresses disagreement with a \n     VA decision to be an NOD unless VA finds that the claimant \n     has disavowed a desire for appellate review. This section \n     would be effective with respect to documents filed on or \n     after the date of enactment, and with respect to documents \n     filed before the date of enactment and not treated by VA as \n     an NOD pursuant to part 20.201 of title 38, Code of Federal \n     Regulations. Furthermore, a document filed as an NOD after \n     March 15, 2002, and rejected by the Secretary as insufficient \n     would, at VA motion or at the request of a claimant within \n     one year of enactment, be deemed to be an NOD if the document \n     expresses disagreement with a decision and VA finds that the \n     claimant has not disavowed a desire for appellate review.\n\n\n            PROVISION OF MARKERS FOR PRIVATELY MARKED GRAVES\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 502 of Public Law 107-103, the Veterans Education \n     and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001, authorizes VA to furnish \n     a government headstone or marker for the grave of an eligible \n     veteran buried in a non-veterans' cemetery irrespective of \n     whether the grave was already marked with a private marker. \n     The law applies to veterans whose deaths occurred on or after \n     December 27, 2001. Public Law 107-330 extended this authority \n     to include deaths occurring on or after September 11, 2001.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 204 of S. 1132, as amended, would amend the \n     Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001 to \n     authorize VA to furnish a government headstone or marker for \n     the grave of an eligible veteran buried in a private \n     cemetery, irrespective of whether the grave was already \n     marked with a private marker, for deaths occurring on or \n     after November 1, 1990.\n\n\n TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY TO GUARANTEE LOANS TO PURCHASE MANUFACTURED \n                             HOMES AND LOTS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 3712 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes VA \n     to guarantee loans for the purchase of a manufactured home \n     and a lot on which it is sited.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 306 of S. 1132, as amended, would eliminate VA's \n     authority to guarantee loans to purchase a manufactured home \n     and the lot on which it is sited.\n\n\n   REINSTATEMENT OF VETERANS VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN \n                           PENSION RECIPIENTS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1524 of title 38, United States Code, authorized a \n     pilot program of vocational training to certain nonservice-\n     connected pension recipients. The initial pilot program was \n     in place from February 1, 1985, through January 31, 1992. \n     Public Law 102-562 extended the program through December 31, \n     1995.\n     House Bill\n       Section 9 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would reinstate the VA \n     pilot program for five years beginning on the date of \n     enactment to provide vocational training to newly eligible VA \n     nonservice-connected pension recipients. The program would be \n     open to those veterans age 45 years or younger. The \n     Department of Veterans Affairs would be required to ensure \n     that the availability of vocational training is made known \n     through various outreach methods. Not later than two years \n     after the date of enactment, and each year thereafter, the \n     Secretary would be required to submit to the Committees on \n     Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives a report on the operation of the pilot \n     program. The report would include an evaluation of the \n     vocational training provided, an analysis of the cost-\n     effectiveness of the training provided, and data on the \n     entered-employment rate of veterans participating in the \n     program.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n\n         THREE-YEAR EXTENSION OF INCOME VERIFICATION AUTHORITY\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 5317 of title 38, United States Code, directs VA to \n     notify applicants for needs-based VA benefits that \n     information collected from the applicants may be compared \n     with income-related information obtained by VA from the \n     Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and \n     Human Services. The authority of the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs to obtain such information expires on September 30, \n     2008.\n       Section 6103(l)(7)(D)(viii) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     authorizes the release of income information by the Internal \n     Revenue Service to VA.

Madam President, as Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge the Senate to pass H.R. 2297, \nthe proposed Veterans Benefits Act of 2003.\n\n[[Page S15140]]\n\n  The pending measure, which I will refer to as the ``Compromise \nAgreement,'' is the final version of an omnibus bill. This Compromise \nAgreement would improve a variety of veterans' benefits, most \nsignificantly for the survivors of those who lose their lives on active \nduty, or who die of their service-connected conditions. It is entirely \nappropriate that, at a time when we have called our servicemembers into \nharm's way, we should extend not only our sympathies but critical \nassistance to the families left behind by those who have made the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  I will briefly highlight some of the most important provisions, and \nrefer my colleagues seeking more detail to the Joint Explanatory \nStatement accompanying the bill. I thank Chairman Arlen Specter and his \nstaff for their efforts on behalf of our nation's veterans, and my \ncolleagues in the House for working with our committee staffs to craft \nthis agreement.\n  While this Compromise Agreement enhances many veterans' benefits, it \nfocuses particularly on meeting the needs of survivors. I am gratified \nthat Congress plans to increase the rate of educational benefits for \nsurvivors and dependents of veterans. This bill would raise education \nbenefits by 13.4 percent over current levels--to $788 per month from \n$695 for full-time study--creating parity with the benefits that the \nNation provides to active-duty servicemembers. Family members who have \nalready faced the loss of a father, mother, husband, or wife in \nservice, or who have helped a servicemember endure total disability, \nshould not have to face limited educational opportunities and fragile \nfutures due to resulting financial hardships.\n  I am very pleased that we have continued to build upon legislation of \nthe past two years to assist the surviving spouses of servicemembers. \nIn 2001, Congress passed legislation to allow survivors of severely \ndisabled veterans to continue receiving VA healthcare coverage through \nthe program called CHAMPVA after age 65. Congress extended this \ncoverage last year, allowing eligible surviving spouses of veterans who \ndied from service-connected disabilities or in the line of duty to \nretain their eligibility for CHAMPVA benefits even if they remarried \nafter age 55. This year, the committees have agreed to allow the \nsurviving spouses to retain survivors' benefits--Dependency and \nIndemnity Compensation, education allowance and home loan--if they \nremarry after the age of 57, placing these spouses on the same footing \nas those in other Federal survivorship programs.\n\n  The committees were also mindful of those who must live with the \npossible health consequences of a parent's service. Recent scientific \nevidence has suggested an association between exposure to dioxin, a \ntoxic chemical found in the herbicide Agent Orange, and an increased \nrisk of the birth defect spina bifida in children born to those \nexposed. In 1996, Congress authorized VA to provide benefits to \nchildren with spina bifida whose fathers or mothers served in the \nRepublic of Vietnam and might have been exposed to Agent Orange. The \nCompromise Agreement would extend theses same benefits to affected \nchildren whose parents served in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone \nduring the Vietnam era, where Agent Orange was also used a defoliant.\n  I am pleased that the Compromise Agreement also addresses the \nenduring, and sometimes invisible, scars of war. Recognizing the long-\nterm effects of prolonged malnutrition and confinement, current law \nspecifies a list of 15 disabilities that VA presumes are related to \nmilitary service of former prisoners of war who were held captive 30 \ndays or more. This legislation would eliminate the 30-day requirement \nfor certain physical and mental disorders that could result from as \nlittle as a day of captivity. It would also add cirrhosis of the liver \nto the list of presumptively service-connected disabilities for those \nformer POWs who were held captive for at least 30 days, as peer-\nreviewed studies have shown that former POWs have a higher incidence of \nthis debilitating disease.\n  Another group of veterans who struggle with potential long-term \nhealth consequences are those who were exposed to significant doses of \nionizing radiation, particularly in post-war Japan and during \nsubsequent nuclear testing. Nearly 20 years ago, Congress mandated that \nveterans who suffered from illnesses they believed were caused by such \nradiation could request that VA ``reconstruct'' the actual dose of \nradiation that they received during service. A panel of experts \nconvened by the National Academy of Sciences reported that the \ncontractor-operated program established by the VA to produce this data \nfor veterans suffered from a shockingly cavalier approach to quality \nassurance, resulting in data that failed to meet the standards assumed \nby both VA and veterans. The Compromise Agreement would require VA and \nDOD to establish an advisory board to oversee this dose reconstruction \nprogram's mission, procedures, and administration to ensure that it \ncollects and interprets data adequately and fairly.\n  Congress required the Air Force to conduct a long-term \nepidemiological study of the veterans of Operation Ranch Hand, the unit \nresponsible for aerial spraying of herbicides during the Vietnam War. \nThis study is about to conclude, and experts agree that both samples \nand data could still provide key data for many unanswered questions. \nThe Compromise Agreement would direct VA to enter into an agreement \nwith the National Academy of Sciences to advise whether the study \nshould be continued, describe the steps that would be involved in doing \nso, and evaluate the advisability of making laboratory specimens from \nthe study available for independent research.\n  Finally, the Compromise Agreement would ensure that the core funding \nfor the Medical Follow-Up Agency (MFUA) would be extended for 10 more \nyears. MFUA uses this funding to update, maintain, and improve long-\nterm epidemiological studies of military and veterans' populations. \nCongress, VA, military, and independent scientists have relied on MFUA \ndata since World War II to evaluate whether specific exposures might \nhave long-term health effects that suggest a need for benefits, new \ntreatments, or further research.\n  Together, all of these provisions demonstrate that our nation will \ncontinue its commitment to those veterans who carry the burdens of the \nbattlefield--whether obvious or invisible--long after the end of the \nfight.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank Senator Specter and his benefits staff \nfor their work on this comprehensive bill, specifically Bill Tuerk, Jon \nTowers and Chris McNamee, as well as my benefits staff--Mary Schoelen, \nTandy Barrett, Ted Pusey, Amanda Krohn, and Faiz Shakir, along with \nJulie Fischer, who recently left the committee, and Patrick Stone, who \nhas recently joined it. I urge my colleagues to support this important \npiece of legislation for our Nation's veterans and their families.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This is a bill that has been before Congress for quite some time. It \nis a bill that relates to America's energy needs. It certainly is one \nthat is timely. Our energy supplies and use of energy are critical to \nthe state of our economy and its growth.\n\n[[Page S15141]]\n\n  This bill was first proposed by the Bush administration under the \nleadership of Vice President Cheney. Most people followed it in the \nnews because Vice President Cheney called together a task force to \nwrite the administration's energy policy. When he was asked to identify \nwho was in the room, the people who were involved in the task force, he \nrefused. Despite the pleas of Members of Congress and requests for that \ninformation about the origin and creation of this energy policy, the \nVice President basically said he was not going to disclose the identity \nof those who were part of the energy task force.\n  The General Accounting Office took the Vice President to court and \nthe Vice President prevailed. He was allowed to conceal the names and \nidentities of those who were on the energy task force. So this idea of \nan energy policy was conceived in secret.\n\n  Then there were lengthy debates on the floor of the Senate and House \nabout Energy bills, both during the period when the Democrats were in \ncontrol of the Senate and the period with Republicans in control. We \nspent many, many days going through Energy bill options and amendments, \nvoting on them, and moving forward. The net result of it was we \nproduced a Senate Energy bill which was sent to conference.\n  Conference committees, as defined under our Constitution, and by the \npractice and precedent of the Senate, usually involve both political \nparties sitting down, and the House and Senate conferees trying to work \nout some agreement or some compromise.\n  As has been the case more recently than not, this conference \ncommittee did not follow that standard. The conference committee met \nprimarily with Republican Members only, and primarily in secret.\n  So ultimately the work product of this energy conversation or energy \nanalysis that we have before us today was not only conceived in \nsecrecy, it was produced in secrecy.\n  So today we have a great epiphany, a great opening, a great \nrevelation. The bill is finally before us, and we have a chance to look \nat this bill, which was brought together with special interest groups \nand the Vice President at the outset, and which was hammered out in a \nconference committee with those same special interest groups.\n  Having considered the origin of this bill, and its maturation \nprocess, it is no surprise that this bill is heavily larded with \ngiveaways to the energy industry. In fact, if you go through this bill \nyou will find two things that stand out. The first relates to a \nquestion which we have to face as a nation: Is it possible for us to \nhave a sound energy policy which allows for economic growth and \nsustains our standard of living without endangering our environment?\n  I think the answer to that is yes, and I think we have proven that it \ncan happen. We have seen an expansion of the American economy over the \npast several decades while we have reduced pollution in our air and \nwater. That is a positive. It shows we are thinking ahead, that we are \nnot trying to enjoy the benefit of the moment with energy as an expense \nwhich our children will pay for.\n  But, sadly, this bill, by its contents, comes to an opposite \nconclusion. Because this bill finds, first and foremost, that in order \nto pursue the administration's energy policy, and the energy policy of \na Republican majority in Congress, we have to basically sacrifice our \nenvironment. I think that is a horrible conclusion. I find it totally \nunacceptable, and it is the reason I stand today in opposition to this \nbill.\n  Secondly, aside from the question of whether we can have a sound \nenergy policy and a safe environment, we are challenged with this \nquestion: Can you promote in America the energy we need for this \ngeneration and future generations without providing generous, lavish \nsubsidies to private corporations?\n  Now, this morning, one of my colleagues from Oregon, on the \nRepublican side, came to the floor and was critical of Governor Dean of \nVermont for saying yesterday that we had to consider reregulation in \nAmerica. This Senate critic said that is exactly what we do not need. \nWe do not need Government regulation in America.\n\n  His argument was--and the traditional Republican argument is--let the \nfree market work its will. Well, that, in the abstract, sounds like \ngood medicine, but in reality it is far from the truth.\n  The market worked its will with Enron. The market has worked its will \nwith the scandals involving mutual funds. The market is working its \nwill every day when it comes to the cost of health insurance to \nbusinesses and families across America.\n  As we look at how the market has worked its will, it is clear the \nresults are unacceptable. So the question before us in the Energy bill \nis, Can we rely on a free market, then, to develop sources of energy in \nAmerica?\n  The answer from this bill is no. The answer from this bill is that \nthe Government must inject itself into the energy sector of our economy \nand make substantial subsidies to certain elements in the economy in \norder for America to meet its energy needs. I will outline some of \nthose subsidies in a moment.\n  So the two conclusions from this Energy bill are that America's \nenergy supply and its growth are inconsistent with a safe environment; \nand, secondly, that giving the free market its rein, it will not \nproduce the energy that we need in the future. Instead, we have to \ngenerously subsidize energy markets.\n  Now, that is a lot different than what you have heard from the \nadministration. They have talked about balance and they have talked \nabout a forward-looking energy policy. But I will tell you, when you \nlook at the specifics in this bill, it is clear that it is not \nbalanced.\n  It is sad to report that this bill, as it is written, has turned out \nto be a piece of legislation which I believe this Congress should \nreject. This energy policy that is being promoted in this bill is a \ngush of giveaways to corporate special interests that is masquerading \nas an energy policy.\n  There is a way out of this embarrassment for the Senate. There is a \nway to come up with an energy policy that works. That way, of course, \nis to stop this bill and to ask our friends on the important committees \ndealing with energy to go back to work, go back to work to deliver a \nbill which, frankly, will be bipartisan, a bill which will be balanced, \na bill that will not sacrifice the environment for energy, and a bill \nwhich would not be the gush of giveaways this bill has turned out to \nbe.\n\n  Let me tell you some of the specifics included in this Energy bill \nwhen it comes to the environment, specifics that tell the story about \nhow what was conceived as an Energy bill turned out to be the worst \npiece of environmental legislation that I have seen in the Senate.\n  Among the provisions in this bill are the following: It allows more \nsmog pollution for longer than the current Clean Air Act authorizes. \nUnder the existing act, areas that have unhealthy air are required to \nreduce ozone-forming smog pollution by a strict statutory deadline. If \nthese areas fail to meet the deadline, they are given more time to \nclean up, but must adopt more rigorous air pollution control measures. \nThe bill attempts to allow more polluted areas more time to clean up \nwithout having to implement stronger air pollution controls, placing a \nsignificant burden on States and communities downwind from the urban \nareas.\n  This bill exempts all oil and gas construction activities including \nroads, drill pads, pipeline corridors, refineries, and compressor \nstations from having to obtain a permit controlling polluted storm \nwater runoff as currently required under the Clean Water Act. So in \nthese first two provisions, this bill violates the Clean Air Act and \nthe Clean Water Act. It delays pollution cleanup in southwestern \nMichigan for 2 years while the EPA conducts a study, dramatically \nincreases air pollution and global warming with huge new incentives, \nclaims to promote clean coal, which I support, but inhibits its \ndevelopment by disqualifying federally funded clean coal projects as \nbest available control technologies; threatens drinking water sources \nby exempting from the Safe Drinking Water Act regulation the \nunderground injection of chemicals during oil and gas development.\n  Do you remember the squabble we had here in the Senate about arsenic \nin drinking water and whether or not it\n\n[[Page S15142]]\n\nwas safe, and how the Bush administration finally backed off of \nweakening regulations that would protect us from arsenic in drinking \nwater? This so-called Energy bill is going to increase the danger in \nour drinking water by exempting from coverage by that act the \nunderground injection of chemicals during oil and gas development. \nThere is a whole section on MTBE, which I will speak to specifically. \nIt encourages the mixture of hazardous waste in cement and concrete \nproducts as an alternative to safe disposal in permitted hazardous \nwaste landfills. The list goes on and on and on.\n  When it comes to our public lands, this bill allows the Interior \nSecretary, by Secretarial order, to designate utility and pipeline \ncorridors across public lands owned by Americans without any seeking \npublic input through a land use planning process. It authorizes the \nleasing of the national petroleum reserve in Alaska for oil and gas \nproduction without protection for wildlife. It allows the Secretary to \nwaive royalties, which means payments to taxpayers for those who are \ndrilling for oil and gas on the lands that we own as Americans. It \nallows the Secretary to waive royalties so these companies can drill on \nour public lands for free.\n  The list continues. The list is overwhelming. In each and every \npage--and there are five of them--you will find 10 or 20 examples of \nenvironmental degradation, abandonment of environmental standards, \nendangerment of the air that we breathe and the water we drink. For \nwhat? So that someone can make a dollar. That is what it is all about. \nIt is about profit taking at the expense of public health. That is what \nthis Energy bill does.\n\n  Did anyone ever announce at the outset that was our goal? Did anyone \never conceive during the debate that what we were trying to do was to \nprovide some more energy at the expense of the environment and at the \nexpense of public health? That is exactly what this bill does.\n  Before I get into the MTBE issue, which I think is possibly one of \nthe worst I have seen in the time I have served in Congress, let me \ntell you what this bill fails to do. What is the No. 1 use of oil that \nwe import into the United States today? We use it to fuel our cars and \ntrucks, of course. Of course, a lot of us own quite a few of them. And \nwe know as well that if these cars and trucks are not fuel efficient, \nthey will burn more gas and require us to import more oil. So if you \nwant to have an honest discussion about energy security in America, \nwould you not be pursuing goals which would reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil? Would you not want to find ways that America can ween \nitself away from its dependence on Saudi Arabia and its oil sources? \nShouldn't that be front and center the main topic in our energy policy? \nWell, everybody I have spoken to in my State agrees, of course, that is \nwhere you should start the energy discussion.\n  You can search this bill, 1,400 pages or more, and not find a word \nthat gives you comfort that we as a nation will even seriously consider \nimproving the fuel efficiency of the cars and trucks we drive. Why? \nBecause the big three in Detroit--General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler--\nhave said they are not capable of producing more fuel-efficient cars to \ncompete with those that are being imported from Japan. They have \nconvinced the majority in the Senate--I know because I offered an \namendment to improve fuel efficiency--that America is technically \nincapable of competing when it comes to fuel-efficient cars. That is \nsuch a sad commentary. It is one which I reject.\n  Let me tell you what fuel efficiency means for us. First, a little \nhistory: The year was 1975. Gas lines were long. People were concerned \nabout the availability of energy in America. An argument was made that \nwe had to do something about the efficiency of the cars and trucks we \ndrive. Of course, there are two ways to achieve it: One is to raise the \nprice of gasoline. If the price of gasoline at the pump doubled \ntomorrow, every American family would start asking how many miles a \ngallon do I get from this hog? Well, I don't want to see that happen, \nnor do most Americans. That imposes new financial burdens on families \nand small businesses and, frankly, is inflationary.\n  But there is another one. In 1975 Congress said: We are going to \nmandate doubling the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks. It is going to \nbe a Federal mandate. It has to happen.\n  The automobile manufacturers in Detroit said: It can't be done. It is \ntechnically not feasible for us to double over 10 years the fuel \nefficiency of our cars. Secondly, those cars are going to be so small, \nthey are going to be unsafe. Third, you are just playing into the hands \nof foreign automobile producers who will beat us to the punch.\n  Thankfully, Congress ignored them and passed a law. In a matter of 10 \nyears, fuel efficiency went from about 14 miles a gallon fleet average \nto 27.5 miles a gallon. In a 10-year period of time, we virtually \ndoubled the fuel efficiency of our cars, reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n\n  What have we done since 1985, since we reached 27.5 miles a gallon? \nNothing, except drive larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles, import more \noil from overseas, and pollute our air even more in America.\n  What has Congress done? Absolutely nothing. This bill is silent on \nthe issue of fuel efficiency. The Energy bill for America's energy \npolicy is silent when it comes to fuel efficiency.\n  Let me correct myself. It isn't silent. It creates a new loophole \nthat will be added to the process which will make it even more \ndifficult in the future for us to even consider increasing fuel \nefficiency.\n  I offered an amendment which said, what if we went to 40 miles a \ngallon from 27.5 miles a gallon by 2015. Let's have 12 years. Look at \nthe dramatic savings we would have in the barrels of oil that are \nconsumed.\n  This is what drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \nworth, this tiny little line down here. But just by increasing the fuel \nefficiency of our cars and trucks, we could answer a major part of the \nchallenge of America's energy future. This bill sadly does nothing.\n  In addition, this bill excludes a renewable portfolio standard. It \ndoes not in any way encourage new ways to use energy from renewable \nfuels in a way that could make a sizable difference. I think we ought \nto be embarrassed by this. What an embarrassment it was to read in the \nWashington Post yesterday that China, a developing nation, now has \nhigher fuel efficiency standards and fuel economy standards than the \nUnited States. Can you believe it? Can you believe that this growing \neconomy, just developing, has decided they see the future, and the \nfuture is in more fuel-efficient cars and less dependence on foreign \noil; and the United States, this great economic engine that we run, \ndoesn't see the same? As a consequence, we find ourselves in a position \nwhere this bill is silent when it comes to fuel efficiency.\n  I think that is a terrible deficiency in this legislation. I cannot \nimagine it can be taken seriously in a conversation about America's \nenergy policy. We know full well that we use a lot of oil. According to \nthis chart, the global consumption of oil per capita in 1999, in \ngallons per day, the United States is 3; other industrialized \ncountries, 1\\1/2\\; and the rest of the world less than \\1/2\\. The U.S. \ncontinues to consume more oil than other countries.\n  The gasoline savings we realized going from 14 miles a gallon in 1970 \nto 28 miles a gallon in 1999 reduced, by 3.7 billion gallons, the \ngasoline we consumed in a given year. Less gasoline, less polluted oil, \nless pollution. This bill is silent on that issue, and that is \nunfortunate.\n  Let me speak for a minute to what I consider the single most \noutrageous part of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have been in Congress a few years. I have noticed \nthat at the end of a session strange things happen. Some of these \nstrange things involve massive giveaways to individual companies or \ninterest groups. Over the years I have paraded out my personal award \nfor this activity. I call it the moonlight mackerel award. It is given \nto that effort or amendment or bill in the closing days of the session \nwhich is the most outrageous. It goes back to a quote where someone \nsaid that a certain thing would shine and stink like a mackerel in the \nmoonlight.\n  The one I am about to describe, I believe, may retire the trophy, the \nmoonlight mackerel trophy, which has been\n\n[[Page S15143]]\n\ncoveted by special interest groups forever. Frankly, it is now being \nchallenged by what may be the worst provision in this Energy bill. It \nis a provision that led me to oppose the bill. Even though I have had \npeople from Illinois call me who support this bill and genuinely want \nto see it pass, I have told them that as long as this provision is in \nthe bill, there is no way I will support it. I think it is that bad and \nthat embarrassing.\n  The provision is on methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE. MTBE was an \nadditive to gasoline so that engines ran a little smoother, called an \noxygenate. Oil companies started adding that to our fuel and selling it \nacross America. There are alternatives. They could have used ethanol, \nfor example; but they said, no, we will use MTBE. So they used this \nMTBE additive, this compound, in gasoline and then discovered \nsomething. They discovered it a long time ago. This MTBE compound is \ndangerous. MTBE, when it leeched out of underground storage tanks, \ncould get into the groundwater and into the public water supply.\n  If you took out a boat on a lake with MTBE mixed with gasoline and it \ndischarged into the lake, it could contaminate the lake.\n  The contamination went beyond the foul-smelling additive itself to \nraise serious public health questions. According to the GAO, it has \nbeen detected in groundwater and drinking water all across the U.S. It \nis classified as a potential human carcinogen, a cause of cancer. At a \nlevel of 2 parts per billion, MTBE produces a harsh chemical odor that \nrenders tap water undrinkable. Removing MTBE is difficult and costly. \nWater utilities must either blend contaminated water with clean sources \nto dilute the MTBE to acceptable levels, install systems to remove \nchemicals, or abandon certain water sources altogether.\n  The most effective argument of those who have been harmed and seek a \nday in court is a defective product argument. The fact is that the oil \nindustry knew MTBE was, in fact, dangerous and they continued to use it \nand sell it, despite the danger it posed to public health. That was the \nbasis for a lawsuit filed in California near Lake Tahoe, where the oil \ncompanies eventually paid $60 million, conceding their guilt.\n  The producers of MTBE knew the problems they had. I believe the \nproducers of the MTBE should be held responsible. In fact, in one \npowerpoint presentation, the producers cynically dubbed MTBE as ``most \nthings biodegrade easier.'' They were making a joke of the fact that \nMTBE would stand for those initials, realizing that it did not \nbiodegrade easily. It was a persistent, troublesome, and dangerous \nelement, which stayed for a long time.\n  Who should pay for the cleanup for MTBE? According to this bill, not \nthe polluters, not the producers, but the taxpayers of America. That is \nthe conclusion in this bill. This bill provides the single most \nexpensive immunity to litigation of any bill that I have ever seen \nbefore Congress. It says the producers of MTBE cannot be held \naccountable in product liability legislation for what they knew to be a \ndangerous product, and it doesn't stop there. It is retroactive, saying \nthat lawsuits already being prosecuted in States across America cannot \nbe pursued to verdict or settlement.\n  Think about that for a minute. This is the single biggest giveaway to \na special interest group that I have ever seen in the time I have \nserved in Congress. This jury in Tahoe, considering the contamination \nnear the Lake Tahoe area, found that gasoline with MTBE is a defective \nproduct because of the risk of this additive, and because the oil \ncompanies failed to warn consumers of the risk to the environment and \ndrinking water. The jury found ``clear and convincing evidence'' that \nthe producer of MTBE acted with malice, and they are going to have a \nfield day and a holiday with this Energy bill. They were found to have \nacted with malice in selling this product that endangered the lives of \nthe people in the community.\n  MTBE producers know they are vulnerable to these lawsuits. If you are \nvulnerable for wrongdoing, if you created a product that endangers \nthousands of Americans, where should you turn? Come to Congress. Come \nto Capitol Hill. Come to mama.\n  That is what happened with this conference committee. They came to \nthis conference committee and the conference committee delivered. This \nconference committee let the MTBE producers and oil companies off the \nhook. About three-fourths of the producers are located in Texas \nand Louisiana, and it has been the Congressmen from these States who \nhave pushed this provision.\n\n  Let me tell you what it means to Illinois. We are hit, but not as \nhard as some. Only 26 to 29 communities in my State of Illinois have \ndrinking water currently contaminated with MTBE, affecting over 200,000 \npeople where I live.\n  Currently, there are four lawsuits in Illinois that this waiver in \nthis bill would eliminate--in the communities of Crystal Lake, Island \nLake, Village of Alton, and Woodstock. The lawsuits currently underway \nwill be eliminated by the language in this bill. So where does that \nleave the community with the contaminated water supply? Where does it \nleave the families who cannot live in their homes because of this MTBE \ncontamination? It leaves them, frankly, at the mercy of those who would \nturn and give them money. Should you not hold the polluters \naccountable? Not according to this bill. This lets the polluters off \nthe hook.\n  The community of East Alton, with a population of 6,500 people, was \nfaced with a MTBE plume that threatened its drinking water supply. A \nmillion dollars was spent to clean it up, and the community went to \ncourt to recover the cost of that million-dollar expenditure.\n  In the town of Island Lake, individual wells were affected.\n  In Kankakee County, Oakdale Acres subdivision and two other small \nsubdivisions were forced to shut down their groundwater systems and \nconnect to a nearby community's public water supply, after a pipeline \nrupture contaminated the subdivision's aquifer.\n  Roanoke, with a 2,000 population--like you might find in Nebraska, \nNew Hampshire, and all across America--has had to use one of their \nwells as a hydraulic containment area with treatment and discharge to \nsurface water in order to protect their well field from an MTBE plume \nwith a concentration exceeding 1,000 parts per billion.\n  These communities and others deserve a fair and reasonable hearing. \nThey deserve a judge and jury. They deserve their day in court. This \nEnergy bill locks the courthouse door and says to these communities \nthat they will not have their day in court.\n  With the defective product liability waiver which reaches back to \nSeptember 5, 2003, this conference report meddles with the courts at \nthe request of the oil companies. At least 35 States have problems such \nas I have just described in Illinois.\n  By 1986, the oil industry was adding 54,000 barrels of MTBE to \ngasoline every single day. By 1991, the number was up to 100,000 \nbarrels of MTBE per day. Yet oil company studies conducted as early as \n1980 showed that the oil industry knew that MTBE contaminated ground \nwater virtually everywhere it was used. There was a $60 million \nsettlement in Lake Tahoe.\n  Some have analyzed this and said the reason this provision is in here \nis if the oil companies were going to accept the expansion of ethanol, \nthey had to be given something.\n  I have been a strong supporter of ethanol for over 20 years, and I \nwill continue to be, but if that is what it is all about, if the only \nway to increase ethanol is to provide this kind of immunity from \nliability for the producers of MTBE, it is too high a price to pay, as \nfar as this Senator is concerned.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me say another word about this MTBE. In these lawsuits that have \nbeen filed, it has been shown that these oil companies knew what they \nwere getting into. You would think at some point in time they would \nhave at the Federal level banned MTBE perhaps long ago. It took State \nleadership for this to happen. In California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nIllinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, South Dakota, and the State of \nWashington, they took the initiative, when the Federal Government\n\n[[Page S15144]]\n\ndidn't move quickly, to ban MTBE. They know what it is all about, and \nthey understand the damage that has been done to their communities.\n  In the State of New York, in Liberty, after fighting for 11 years \nbecause they found MTBE in their local well water, they finally got the \nState to move forward to establish new standards for public water \nsupplies after a lot of families there had serious health problems. \nThat is just a story that is going to be repeated all over, not just in \nNew York.\n  In New Hampshire last spring, they filed a string of lawsuits against \n22 oil companies. If these lawsuits are being brought on product \nliability theories--the ones that are the most successful--they will be \nthrown out by this legislation. These lawsuits will be eliminated. The \nbusinesses, the families, the individuals who have been damaged by this \ndeadly additive are going to lose their day in court because we are \ngoing to mandate it in this legislation.\n  How does this enhance the energy security of America? It certainly \nadds to the bottom line of profitability of the oil companies which \nwould be held responsible for their misconduct, I will agree with that. \nBut is it just? Is it fair? Is it something we should be doing, giving \nblanket immunity to companies that, by their wrongdoing, endanger the \nhealth of families and individuals across America?\n\n  In the State of New Hampshire, the State sued 22 major oil companies \non October 6 because of MTBE. According to Governor Craig Benson, they \nclaim the oil companies have added increasing amounts of MTBE to the \ngasoline, even though they knew years ago it would contaminate water \nsupplies.\n  The General Accounting Office told Congress what this was all about. \nIn the year 2002, John Stevenson, Director of GAO's Natural Resources \nand Environmental Division, testified before a House subcommittee and \nsaid that MTBE created health risks which he described as follows:\n\n       Such health risks can range from nausea to kidney or liver \n     damage or even cancer.\n\n  He pointed out that a school in Roselawn, IN, discovered students had \nbeen drinking water with nearly 10 times the Federal recommended level \nof MTBE. Officials are trying to determine if the additive came from a \nnearby tank and whether it is causing the students to have an \ninordinate number of nosebleeds. These are real health issues, real \nhealth problems.\n  Mr. President, ``60 Minutes'' on January 16, 2000, brought the MTBE \nissue to the attention of America. They noted at the time there was \ncontamination in some 49 States--as I said earlier, about 35 that we \ncan directly link MTBE to contamination of water supplies. They \nestimate that MTBE is a contaminate in 35 percent of the Nation's urban \nwells. A single cupful of MTBE in a 5 million gallon reservoir is \nsufficient to render the water in that reservoir undrinkable.\n  In 1995, an Italian study on the effects of MTBE showed high doses of \nthis chemical caused three types of cancer: lymphoma, leukemia, and \ntesticular cancer. We are saying to those hapless innocent victims of \nMTBE contamination of their water supply that we are closing the \ncourthouse door for their recovery in product liability suits. How in \nthe world can we do this in good conscience? How can we turn our back \non these innocent victims across America, these communities forced to \npay millions of dollars for the wrongdoing of oil companies, and give \nthem this sort of special giveaway and special break?\n  I, frankly, don't understand how we can. I don't understand how what \nstarted out to be an Energy bill has become something much different. I \ndon't know how a bill which was supposed to give us energy security \ncould be so damaging to our environment in so many specific ways. I \ndon't know how a bill that was supposed to be giving Americans peace of \nmind about their energy future instead in community after community and \nin State after State is going to close the courthouse doors to holding \noil companies accountable for their misconduct.\n  This is the worst. This retires the trophy in the Moonlight Mackerel \nAward. I cannot recall a time when we have gone this far, and that is \nsaying something. There is a way out of our embarrassment, and it is a \nway I would encourage colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take \nvery seriously. We will have an opportunity on a cloture motion soon to \ndecide whether this bill goes forward. If we can gather 41 Senators to \noppose it from going forward, then the bill will stop and be returned \nto conference or perhaps back to committee for further consideration.\n  I think that is the way it should be, and the sooner we do that the \nbetter. If enough of my Republican colleagues will step forward with \nDemocratic colleagues, we can make that difference.\n\n  In case you think this is a partisan issue, the Wall Street Journal, \nwhich is not known to be friendly to many Democrats, including this \none, went after this bill and criticized it on Tuesday, November 18, \ncalling this Energy bill one of the great logrolling exercises in \nrecent congressional history. In the words of the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The Republican leadership has greased more wheels than a \n     NASCAR pit crew.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The bill's total price tag of new outlays is a tidy $72 \n     billion according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. That's not \n     counting $23 billion in tax giveaways to nuclear, oil, gas, \n     and coal concerns all over the country, 3 times more than the \n     President said he would accept.\n\n  The Washington Post, November 18:\n\n     . . . producers of MTBE, another gasoline additive that is \n     believed to pollute drinking water, have not only been \n     exempted from product liability, they also have been \n     retroactively exempted, a change that cancels out lawsuits . \n     . .\n\n  Across America.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       This bill does not, for example, provide a clear direction \n     for the development of the electricity grid . . . it does not \n     encourage the U.S. car industry to manufacture vehicles that \n     consume less fuel . . . and it does not significantly \n     encourage energy conservation.\n\n  The New York Times says this bill is:\n\n     . . . hardly surprising in a bill that had its genesis partly \n     in Vice President Dick Cheney's secret task force.\n\n  It creates:\n\n     . . . exemptions for the Clean Water Act, protection against \n     lawsuits for fouling underground water and an accelerated \n     process for leasing and drilling in sensitive areas at the \n     expense of environmental reviews and public participation.\n\n  The list goes on. The Anchorage Alaska newspaper calls the Energy \nbill a setback.\n  The Atlanta Journal Constitution, quoting Keith Ashdown of Taxpayers \nfor Common Sense, says:\n\n       [T]he legislation is ``a smorgasbord of subsidies to big \n     companies masquerading as energy policy.''\n\n  The Atlanta Journal Constitution concludes in its editorial:\n\n       This bill is about as bad as it gets. When it comes up for \n     a vote, members of Congress who remain committed to more \n     rational energy policy for America and still believe in the \n     dignity of the legislative body in which they serve shouldn't \n     hesitate to reject it.\n\n  The Chicago Tribune, from my home State, said the Democrats were \nvirtually locked out of the final negotiations and we were given some \n48 hours to digest and evaluate this lengthy bill.\n  The Patriot News in Harrisburg, PA, says:\n\n       The energy issue is an upside-down world for sure when they \n     look at this bill.\n\n  They say there is no more blatant example than the 100-percent tax \ncredit available to business owners who purchase gas guzzling Hummers \nand more than 30 other models of large SUVs. The tax credit was enacted \nas part of the President's economic stimulus package and was intended \nto help farmers and other small business, but the tax break is so \nattractive it has caused a run on vehicles that average 9 to 15 miles \nper gallon.\n  We are going to have energy security and energy independence with a \ntax policy that encourages the purchase of these gas guzzlers?\n  They go on to say that hybrid cars which offer 50 to 60 miles a \ngallon are subject to a $2,000 tax deduction, and that is in the \nprocess of being phased out. The list goes on and on of editorial \ncomments across America.\n  I hope we can return to this bill and do it in a sensible fashion. I \nhope we can put conservation and energy efficiency at the forefront as \nwe discuss energy security. Though there are many good things in this \nbill, the good things are outweighed by the negatives.\n  This exemption from MTBE liability is the absolute worst. To say to \nthese\n\n[[Page S15145]]\n\nfamilies, these individuals, and these communities that we are going to \nlock the courthouse door to them no matter what damage they have \nsustained is a new low.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very glad I was present today to \nhear the speech of the distinguished Senator from Illinois so that \nimmediately after it I might speak a few words.\n  First, for everybody in this Chamber who wants ethanol--now, I am \nmaking the point very clear that I am not talking about whether ethanol \nis the greatest, whether ethanol is the least, or whether ethanol is \nthe best thing in the world. I am just addressing the millions of \npeople in this country, most of them farmers, many thousands in the \nState of the occupant of the chair, who would like to see ethanol, \nsince it would do great things for them and at the same time diminish \nour demands on gasoline from crude oil. Now I am speaking to them.\n  Whatever has been said by the good Senator from Illinois, all the \nfarmers in his State who produce corn and the other products should \nknow there is no way to get an ethanol bill of any consequence without \naddressing the issue of MTBE. The way the issue has been addressed by \nthe Senator from Illinois on MTBE is wrong, but nonetheless let us just \ntalk about the reality of it. Do my colleagues want a major ethanol \nprogram for America? The answer is overwhelmingly yes. Then go to \nconference with the House like we did and say to them: We want an \nethanol bill like the one that passed the Senate.\n  They will say: Not on your life, unless you decide to treat those who \nproduce MTBE, a forerunner to ethanol, fairly.\n  We said: What does that mean?\n  They said: For those who have used MTBE properly, they shall not be \nliable for any damages that result from MTBE.\n\n  I am reminded in my home State, there was a product liability case \nagainst a company that delivers more coffee and hamburgers than any \nother company in the world, McDonald's. The suit was against McDonald's \nfor delivering coffee to the front window of a car and then spilling \nthe coffee on the lap of the purchaser. The purchaser sued McDonald's \nbecause the coffee was too hot.\n  They did not sue Folgers Coffee for making the coffee. They sued \nMcDonald's for delivering the coffee that was too hot. I think that \nmost people would say that is about right. If the coffee was too hot, \nthen let a jury decide whether they ought to be delivering coffee that \nis so hot. But what if they would have gone off and sued Folgers Coffee \nbecause they made the coffee that somebody used wrongly, to wit, made \nit too hot and burned the legs of a purchaser of hot coffee? That is \nexactly what is going on with MTBE.\n  I am not a proponent of it. I did not know anything about it until I \ngot intimately involved in this legislation and then I found that MTBE \nis a product that has been authorized and prescribed by the Federal \nGovernment. It is something that is supposed to be used because the \nGovernment says you can use it and it is all right.\n  In response to the U.S. House insistence, all we have done is say if \nsomeone uses MTBE, as prescribed by the Federal Government, they are \nnot liable in damages. We are very narrow. As a matter of fact, we have \nunquestionably said if one uses it wrong, if they negligently use it, \nif they spill it, if they throw it around, if they do not handle it \nproperly and damages result, they can be sued.\n  I do not think that is exactly what my friend from Illinois said, but \nI believe that is what this legislation says. I believe that is what we \ndid, and I believe there is no other way to do it.\n  Then we said in the meantime, it is going to be phased out. That is \nin the legislation, too, that in a certain number of years it cannot be \nused anymore. Even if it is used right, it is not going to be used \nanymore. There is something that takes its place.\n  Across this land, people file lawsuits in product liability cases and \notherwise about many things, and we all know about it. Sometimes we \nlook at a lawsuit and we are abhorred to think they could take such a \ncase to court. Sometimes we think, right on, somebody really messed up \nand they ought to pay for it. But when the House said to us, if you \nwant an ethanol bill, you have to look at litigation that is ensuing \nout there in America where MTBE producers are getting sued for a valid, \nappropriate product, okayed by the Federal Government, used properly, \nand they are getting sued for damages.\n  They said: We want to limit that. If it is used improperly and causes \ndamages, the suits can go on. Then we argued and said let's get rid of \nit in due course, and we have language that says what date it will \nexpire in terms of being a product that can be used.\n  I want to say again, so that everybody understands, the last speaker \nhas suggested that this bill should be killed by cloture, and that is \nthe right of the Senate on any bill. But I suggest to them if they kill \nthis bill by cloture, which I urge that they not do, they have killed \nethanol, and I do not know when it ever comes back.\n  As a matter of fact, if they think it is coming back without some \nrestraint on MTBE legislation that is going rampant in this country, of \nthe type I have described, suing Folgers Coffee because somebody \nspilled hot coffee on them, that kind of analogy, for those who think \nthat is going to continue on, then they have given up and abandoned \nforever ethanol. If that is what they would like, then follow the \ndirections and the wishes of the Senator from Illinois who has plenty \nof farmers who are waiting and wondering what is going to happen to \nthis bill because of what they think is going to be fair treatment, \ncreating a new market over the next decade and the next decade after \nthat for a product that has been on a roller coaster for farmers who \nhave been on a roller coaster.\n  Having said that, I want to talk to another group of people. \nThroughout the deliberation on this bill, I have not heard more from \nany group of Americans and any group of Senators than the group \nconcerned about the issues of wind energy, solar energy, biomass, and \nrelated energies. Everybody came to us, day by day, as we put this bill \ntogether and said: Senator, you know wind energy is working. You are \nnot going to kill it in this bill, are you? Senator, bioenergy is right \non the edge, ready to go. All these different energies are ready to go. \nIn the case of wind energy, it is not only ready to go, it is going. It \nis beginning to show up because it is working so well.\n  Let me say to my friend, it is gone; wind energy is finished when you \nkill this bill. It is gone.\n  You might say: How can that be? It is moving along right now. In \nfact, over in Massachusetts they wanted to build some out there and \nsome people didn't want them building them out there in the ocean. I \ndon't know which people around but some. How come? It was being built.\n  Yes, but existing today is a great big credit, tax credit for solar \nand for wind. Guess what. It expires very shortly. It is gone, out the \nwindow. The people who are building wind in America are up here in the \nhalls, knocking on our doors, and saying: Do you really want to kill \nwind energy in America?\n  The answer is: Oh, no, I just don't like the MTBE portion of this \nbill. But I don't want to kill wind. I want to carve it out and save \nit.\n  But you know what, people who want wind, you can't do it that way. Do \nyou think we are going to start over next month writing another bill of \nthis nature because this one was dead on a side issue of the type I \nhave been describing, and we don't have any credit for wind, we don't \nhave any credit for solar? Not on your life. In fact, I don't know when \nwe would get around to it.\n  We can look back to the day after tomorrow or the day after that and \nsay: There it went. There she blew, like they say out in the ocean. \nThere she blew, right out the window with those who decided they wanted \nto talk this bill to death.\n  Then you look around and there are people saying, another group \naround here, a lot of eastern Senators walking up and saying: What is \ngoing to happen to coal? We have a lot of coal and nobody uses it. \nCan't you do something about that in the Energy bill?\n  We say we have. We have given as good a credit for research and \nproduction of clean coal technology in America as has ever existed. It \nis in this bill.\n  In fact, I had one Senator yesterday from the East, somebody trying \nto\n\n[[Page S15146]]\n\nmake this an East versus West bill. I don't know how they did that, \neither. This Senator said: I was wondering what was in this bill for my \nState--being an Eastern State, a big coal State. He said: I found out \nthat it has the finest set of credits for companies to try to use this \ngreat asset called coal that could ever be put in a bill. All of that \nwithin this total cost of $2.6 billion a year, on average, over 10 \nyears.\n  That Senator said: I am voting for it. We have to give coal a shot in \nmy State, said that Senator.\n  We can go on and on and talk about this. But it is much easier to \npick a piece of the bill such as MTBE and state the facts wrong and \ntell everybody they should not vote for this because of MTBE. But I \nfollow by saying the MTBE situation is not what has been said, and \nbefore you decide to kill the bill on MTBE, you ought to remember you \ndon't kill this bill in pieces.\n\n  So everybody out there will know who has an interest: You don't kill \nthis bill in pieces. You adopt it all or none.\n  For those who think MTBE is of that importance as I have explained it \nhere today--and we will be glad to meet privately with any experts \naround who want to look at it--but if anybody thinks MTBE is of such a \nproportionate disadvantage to America that we ought to kill the future \nof windmills and solar energy and we ought to decide we are not going \nto do any of these other technologies that will develop America's \nenergy base, they are all going out the window.\n  This Senator thinks in the end the Senators who are looking at the \npluses and minuses of this bill may sit back in their chair and say, \nyou know, I might have done it differently. No, Senator Bingaman said, \nmaybe he could have done better if he had more time. Yes, maybe they \nshould have given the Democrats more time in the committee. But that \nsame Senator may say: Didn't we do that last year? Didn't we give them \nall the time in the world and what did they do? Nothing. So we produced \nsomething this year.\n  I will take full credit and full blame that I couldn't figure out how \nto do this with a regular, day-by-day markup of a bill of this \nmagnitude with input from all sides, and I thought we should have input \nin a different way. We have established input from the minority party \nin a different way, there is no question. They got e-mails and portions \nof this bill as it was produced. They had meetings when they offered \namendments. Some were adopted. The last 30 percent of the bill was \ndelivered to them at the end, for them to look at, and they got the \nmessage for almost all the amendments were on those things that had to \ndo with electricity and the like. They just didn't win any of them, \nwhich usually happens in a conference.\n  Conferences are usually dominated by the majority party. That is \nhistory. That is tradition or whatever you want to call it around here. \nMany of the early provisions of this bill are provisions that were \nadopted last year as part of the bill when Senator Bingaman was \nchairman. But we didn't get a bill.\n  I decided we were going to get a bill. We worked, and worked as hard \nas people can work, to put one together, and, frankly, you can go \nthrough it and find provisions taken all by themselves and say it \ndoesn't have much to do with energy. But I tell you, you can't go \nthrough the whole bill and say it doesn't have a lot to do with \nAmerica's energy future. In fact, I believe we will see the biggest \nchange in agricultural America in modern history with this bill.\n  Some will say that is not what the bill is for. The bill is for that \nif, in fact, in doing that we are producing gasoline for automobiles. \nIt is not bad to get the two for one.\n  Second, this bill is going to produce alternate activities to get \nnatural gas in abundance, and it is also going to produce just about \nevery stitch of natural gas we can produce as a nation without doing \ndamage to our environment, and that will be used by America for \nAmerican purposes.\n  I wish we could do more. I wish we could have done more with Alaskan \nresources. But you know what, everybody knows, you get one thing and \nyou lose something. You move ahead on one and somebody thinks it is the \nwrong thing and you take two steps backwards.\n  To get this bill, well over 1,200 pages, on all the subjects we have \ndone, and get it together and get it here this far and get it through \nthe House yesterday by a majority vote of more than 60, a 60-vote \nplurality or thereabouts, is pretty good.\n  I am very sorry it is hung up here in the Senate. I will repeat, I \nhave heard quietly--not openly--that some say this is a bill that is \nfor regions of the country. I can't find it. If they would stand up \nhere and say this bill favors the East or the West and show me how, I \nwould be more than glad to go out and look, listen, and try to explain \nwhy it isn't. If MTBE, as I have explained, is an East versus the West \nissue, then I would assume there is no litigation or potential \nlitigation on product liability in nature from the West. I don't think \nthat is the case. If it has to do with resources, we have tried to \nproduce the basic resource that is good for America's future, wherever \nit lies--whether it is the coal of Pennsylvania or the coal of Wyoming. \nWe have tried to build under it incentives that will make it used more \nrather than less. We have done that.\n  In the next few days, we will hear a lot more. Most of it will be \nabout the issues of which I am speaking.\n  I want to repeat, for those who want ethanol and want it bad and have \nbeen waiting 6 or 7 years for it and want a real bill for it, we have \nexactly what is necessary. That took 4 weeks of debate and frustration \ngalore, but we got what the Senate said we should get. Yes, you can \nthrow it all away because we had to take MTBE, as I have explained, \nwith it. Those lawyers who like MTBE like to tell it one way. I tell it \nmy way because I think my way is right. The lawyers' way probably would \nbe if you were using Folgers Coffee at MacDonald's and coffee was \nspilled on someone's lap, you ought to be able to sue Folgers Coffee. \nBut if you put in legislation you can't sue Folgers, then I don't think \nthey can come to the Senate floor and argue the way they are arguing \nabout MTBE because Folgers didn't make it hot and spill it. Neither did \nMTBE get spilled around where it shouldn't be, or used unpropitiously \nor contrary to the Federal Government standards.\n  Everywhere you look, there is a smattering of Senators for whom I \nhave great respect who would like to see a nuclear powerplant built one \nof these days. You can throw them away if you kill this bill. They \nwon't be built. If you pass the bill, there will be a chance there will \nbe one following every law and every rule in the books. We might get \none or two. I think that is pretty good.\n  I am prepared, as are a number of Senators who worked with me, to \nreturn to answer as other Senators bring this issue up.\n  I thank the group that helped work on this bill. They were a mighty \ngroup of seven who worked as Senators on our side of the aisle. I thank \neach and every one of them. They had to learn an awful lot, make a \nwhole bunch of hard votes, and make some very close decisions. Now we \nare here. I hope we go beyond it and get the bill passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the minority side, we have a number of \nSenators who are going to speak. I will ask unanimous consent that they \nspeak. I have three who wish to speak now, and we have a time at which \nthey want to speak. If there are Senators from the majority who want to \ncome in between those, that would also be part of the order. I think \nthat would be fair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that on our side Senator Kennedy be \nrecognized for \\1/2\\ hour, Senator Cantwell be recognized for \\1/2\\ \nhour, and Senator Dorgan be recognized for 30 minutes. As I indicated, \nif there are Senators from the majority who wish to speak following \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Cantwell, and Senator Dorgan, that would be \nappropriate. If not, we have other Senators who have indicated a desire \nto speak. This is not in the order which they will appear.\n  So that everyone knows, there are a number of speakers who want to \ntalk: Senators Akaka, Reed of Rhode Island, Feinstein, Stabenow, \nFeingold, Landrieu, Sarbanes, and Clinton.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be recognized for \\1/2\\ \nhour, Senator Cantwell for \\1/2\\ hour, and Senator Dorgan for 30 \nminutes. If there are Republicans who wish to\n\n[[Page S15147]]\n\nspeak in between, those Senators will be part of the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will \nnot--I ask how you might work this in your schedule. We have been told \nfor some time that Senator McCain would like to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Senator McCain can come at any time he wants, either after \nSenator Kennedy or Senator Cantwell or Senator Dorgan. Whenever the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Arizona shows up, we always give him \nthe floor anyway.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He may be around at 2:30 or 2:45. That might work it \nout perfectly.\n  Mr. REID. That would be perfect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the other statement I made was just to \ninform both the minority and the majority that the Members who desire \nmay speak sometime this evening without any specified time or in any \nnecessary order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                       Prescription Drug Benefit\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Medicare system is the system which \nis relied on, trusted, and a beloved health care system which our \nseniors use just about every day. They know it is always there for many \nof them. It gives them an enormous sense of security as they are \nlooking down the road towards the future. I was here in the Senate in \n1965 when the Medicare bill was passed. It failed in 1964. It passed in \n1965. It is generally recognized today across the country that even \nthough the Medicare bill provided for hospitalization and physicians' \nfees, the one thing that it did not provide for was the prescription \ndrugs.\n  In 1965, only 3 percent of all of the private health care bills \nprovided for prescription drugs. But now it would be inconceivable that \nthis institution would pass a health care program for our seniors and \ngive our seniors who have paid into the Medicare system the assurance \nthat their health care needs would be attended to because we know that \nprescription drugs is of such extraordinary importance to all of them.\n  It will become increasingly clear. We are in the period of the life \nsciences century. We are seeing these extraordinary breakthroughs in \nDNA and genes. The Congress has doubled the NIH budget, and the \nprospects for breakthroughs are just enormous. If we were to see a \nbreakthrough, for example, in Alzheimer's, we would empty three-\nquarters of the nursing home beds in my State of Massachusetts. The \nprospects in terms of what these prescription drugs can do and what \nthey are doing today is enormous. Therefore, we have a very important \nresponsibility to get a prescription drug program.\n  I believe the bill which passed the Senate was a good bill. Seventy-\nsix Members supported it. It was a prescription drug bill.\n  But the proposal that is coming out of the conference committee \nfailed to meet the basic and fundamental test; that is, to do no harm \nbecause the particular proposal that is being recommended by the \nconferees will do harm to the Medicare system. The House of \nRepresentatives adopted important changes in the Medicare system under \nthe guise of a prescription drug program, and they have been accepted \nin that conference committee. Now, for the first time since 1965, the \nMedicare system itself is threatened. Many of us are going to do \neverything we can to make sure that is not the case.\n  An editorial in the Des Moines Register today gets it exactly right. \nIt says:\n\n       Once upon a time, lawmakers wanted to add a prescription-\n     drug benefit to Medicare. In year one, they failed. In year \n     two, they failed. Now, in year three, the quest for a drug \n     benefit has ballooned into a plan to change the entire \n     health-care program for 40 million seniors.\n       As a few details about the 1,100-page bill crafted in \n     conference committee trickle out, it's clear another failure \n     this year would be best for Americans.\n\n  The editorial concludes:\n\n       Lawmakers need, once again, to go back to the drawing \n     board.\n\n  Effectively, what they are saying is that no bill is better than a \nbad bill. This is Des Moines Register. They get it right.\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       This time they should try a new approach: Focus on holding \n     drug prices down, keep 40 million seniors in one buying group \n     to leverage lower prices, open up the global market on drugs \n     to Americans, and remind themselves their job is to serve the \n     interests of the people, not industry lobbyists.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President, the Des Moines Register gets it. This \nproposal will do virtually nothing for keeping prices down.\n  Access to prescription drugs and costs to senior citizens are the two \nelements with which our seniors are concerned. This bill does virtually \nnothing regarding costs. It is flawed in its effort to provide \nprescription drugs by undermining Medicare.\n  This conference report represents a right-wing agenda to privatize \nMedicare and force senior citizens into HMOs and private insurance \nplans. I guess seniors should not get to choose their doctor and \nhospital, they just do not know enough. That choice should be made for \nthem by the insurance company bureaucrats. The conference report \nincludes no serious program to reduce the double-digit drug price \nincrease. The attitude of the special interests who hijacked this \nprocess is clear: Control senior citizens, not drug costs.\n  The day this program is implemented, it will make millions of seniors \nworse off than they are today. It is an attempt to use the elderly and \ndisabled's need for affordable prescription drugs as a Trojan horse to \ndestroy the program they have relied on now for 40 years. It is an \nenormous give-away to the insurance industry and an enormous take-away \nfrom the senior citizens.\n  The new study that has just been released today indicates, when this \nprogram goes into effect, the HMOs and private insurance industry will \nincrease by more than $100 billion if this bill passes. That is more \nfor the private insurance companies and for the HMOs. No wonder our \nRepublican friends and the insurance companies are for this bill. No \nwonder senior citizens are against it.\n  The more senior citizens learn of these problems, the more they \noppose the legislation. In a poll released this morning, only one in \nfive older voters, 18 percent, say this bill should be allowed to pass \nin its current form. In fact, 59 percent of the AARP members agree with \nDemocrats that this bill does more harm than good.\n  Regarding the drug plan itself, even before getting to the problems \nof privatization and the subsidies for HMOs that are in this bill, \nolder voters oppose the drug plan by 65 to 26 percent. In fact, only 27 \npercent of all seniors say they would bother to enroll in this plan at \nall.\n  Seniors are deeply concerned about the way Republicans have hijacked \nthe drug plan to undermine Medicare. They oppose the subsidies for \nprivate plans, 65 to 23 percent. In fact, among the AARP members, \nopposition to the subsidies is even stronger--68 percent to 19 percent. \nOlder voters oppose the cost caps on Medicare services, 60 percent to \n26 percent. And they are deeply concerned, 64 to 26 percent, about the \nfailure of this bill to control drug costs to allow drugs to be \nreimported from Canada.\n  As elected representatives of the people, we pass this bill at our \nperil. In fact, by a margin of 3 to 1, older voters are saying they are \nless likely to support politicians who support this bill.\n  It is important to understand how we got to this point. We started in \nthe Senate with a bipartisan bill to expand the prescription drug \ncoverage. A bill passed with 76 votes. The Senate solidly rejected the \nPresident's plan to privatize Medicare by telling senior citizens they \ncould only get the prescription drugs they needed by joining HMO and \nother private insurance plans. That was the position of the President \nin the spring of this year: You are only going to get prescription \ndrugs if you join an HMO or private insurance plan. You will not be \nable to under the Medicare system. Then the administration shifted.\n  But the House took a different course. They realized the President's \nplan would not be accepted by the American people, so they passed a \nmore subtle proposal, one that tries to privatize Medicare by stealth. \nTheir\n\n[[Page S15148]]\n\nonly problem was it was not stealthy enough. That is why it passed by a \nslim partisan majority of one vote in the House of Representatives--one \nRepublican vote.\n  Now the conference has been hijacked by those who want to radically \nalter Medicare and to privatize it, to voucherize it, to force seniors \ninto HMOs and private insurance plans. The bill the Senate will \nconsider shortly is not a bill to provide a prescription drug benefit. \nIt is a bill to carry out the right-wing agenda. It allows the elderly \nto swallow unprecedented and destructive changes to the Medicare \nProgram in return for a limited, inadequate, small prescription drug \nbenefit. This conference report is so ill conceived that not only does \nit put the whole Medicare Program at risk, it makes 9 million seniors, \nalmost a quarter of the Medicare population, worse off than they are \ntoday. I will illustrate that in one moment.\n\n  On issue after issue, this report abandons the bipartisan Senate bill \nand capitulates to the partisan House bill. On some issues it is even \nto the right of what the House passed. One of the most important of \nthese destructive changes is a concept called premium support. It \nshould really be called ``insurance company profit support'' or \n``senior citizen coercion support.'' It replaces the stable, reliable \npremium senior citizens pay for Medicare today with an unaffordable \npremium for the future. Here is how it works.\n  Today, the Medicare premiums are set at 75 percent of the cost of \nPart B of the Medicare Program, the part that pays for doctors' care. \nBeneficiaries pay the remaining 25 percent. The premium is the same no \nmatter where you live. It is universal whether you live in Key West or \nPortland, ME, whether you live in Takoma, WA, or whether you live in \nSan Diego. You pay the same premium. You pay into the system and you \npay the same premium. It increases from year to year at the same rate \nas the Medicare increases. It is stable. It is reliable. It is now \n$58.70 a month Part B premium and $704 for the year.\n  Premium support would change all that. The senior citizens can \nchoose, if they want to, get their Medicare benefits through HMOs and \nother private insurance plans. The Government pays these plans \napproximately the same amount it costs Medicare to provide the \nservices. The senior citizens pay at least the same Part B premium to \nenroll in the plans they pay for the regular Medicare, but the plans \ncan charge more if they offer additional services or lower copayments. \nIf the plans can provide services more cheaply than Medicare, they give \nthe difference back to the beneficiaries in the form of better services \nor lower copay without additional charge.\n  Senior citizens who choose the private plans may get some additional \nbenefits, but the senior citizens who prefer to keep the freedom to \nchoose their own doctor are not penalized. And 9 out of 10 seniors have \nchosen Medicare over Medicare HMOs.\n  What happens, as everyone knows, is the insurance companies cherry-\npick and get the healthier and younger seniors. Therefore, it costs \nthem less, although they get the payment that would otherwise be going \ninto Medicare. So we have the healthier ones leave and the sicker ones \nremain in the Medicare system. That is what has happened today. There \nis no reason it will not happen in the future. As a result, we will get \nincreases in the cost of premiums under the Medicare system.\n  This chart reflects what the Medicare actuaries--not what I estimate \nbut what the Medicare actuaries--estimate would be the national average \nfor seniors. It would be $1,205. And their estimate national average \nfor premium support, the current estimate, would be $1,501. And 2 years \nago they estimated the national average was $1,771.\n  The fact is, no one knows what the premiums will be. You are playing \nroulette with premium support. Here we have a swing of $300 in \nestimates, estimates made by the Medicare actuaries. It could be \n$1,205, but under this bill for those who fall into the trial category, \nthey will be paying at least $1,500 or the $1,771.\n  Look at this chart. Let me give you a few examples of the disparity. \nAgain, this is from the Medicare actuaries. If you live in \nMassachusetts, and in Barnstable--that is primarily Cape Code--the \npremium for Medicare will be $1,400. If you live in Hampden, it will be \n$900. That is a $500 difference.\n  Today, everyone pays in the same amount and they get the same premium \non it. Under this legislation, everyone is going to be paying in, and \nif you live 100 miles apart, you are going to get a $500 disparity in \nthe payments under the premium support system. This information is from \nthe Medicare actuaries. This is the kind of roulette our seniors do not \nwant.\n  Here is another example in Florida. In Dade County, the best estimate \nfrom the Medicare actuaries is you will pay $2,050; and in Osceola \nCounty, you will pay $1,000; you will be paying twice as much.\n  How do you explain that to the seniors? How do you explain that they \npay in and their premiums are going to have this amount of swing to \nthem? No one can accurately predict with any certainty, but we are \nbuying this program? It is untested, untried. It is the greatest social \nexperiment with whom? With our senior citizens. Why? Because there is \ngoing to be all kinds of money in there for those private insurance \ncompanies and those HMOs. That is what it is about--risking the \nMedicare system.\n  Here we have the example in Los Angeles, $1,700; in Yolo, CA, $775. \nAnd in New York City, $2,000 if you live in the Queens area; $975 in \nErie. This is the Medicare actuaries' data, these premiums and \nestimates. And that is the element that is written in this bill.\n  Now you hear our colleagues who defend their proposal say: Well, \nSenator, this is really just a trial program. It is not going to be \nanything more than a trial program.\n  Well, they are going to have five what they call MSAs, metropolitan \nstatistical areas. If you take five metropolitan statistical areas and \nthen you take one small one--here they are--if you take the States of \nNew York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, that is 2.6 million people who \nare affected. For California--Los Angeles, Long Beach, Santa Ana--that \nis 1.4 million. For Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, that is 1.1 million. \nFor Florida it is 833,000; that is Miami, Fort Lauderdale. For \nPennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, that is 866,000. And then \ntake a small one, Nevada--Reno and Sparks--47,000. So 6.8 million of \nthe 40 million; you are almost up to a quarter who are going to be \nincluded in their program, who are going to be subject to these kinds \nof swings.\n  They call this a demonstration? This is a Mack truck. This is not \njust a small Volkswagen, it is a Mack truck, and they are calling it a \nVolkswagen. And seniors ought to understand it. So that is one threat.\n  Now, listen to the second threat. We say, well, what about the risk?\n  Mr. President, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 18 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. Let me know when I have 3 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I shall.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Now, on the second situation, our Republican friends \nsay: Well, we believe in competition. With competition we will get the \nbest health care for the best price and the best cost. Oh, we say, \nwell, how are you going to do that?\n  Let's see what is in the bill now that you say that is what you want \nto do. You think you have competition in this proposal? Let me show you \nand explain to you how this is a rigged proposal.\n  First of all, in this legislation they give to all of the HMOs and \nthe PPOs a 9 percent increase in the cost of living over what they give \nin the Medicare--9 percent. Nine percent? Nine percent? Why are they \ndoing that? Because: They think they ought to get it. They want \ncompetition.\n  The second point that is in this bill is that those who are in HMOs \ntoday and in the private insurance companies are 16 percent healthier \nthan those in traditional Medicare. That is not my estimate, that is \nCMS's estimate, the agency which provide the reimbursement. That is \ntheir estimate.\n  You add these two together and you get a 25 percent subsidy for every \nprivate plan and every HMO. They call it competition. I thought \ncompetition was an even playing field. This is not an even playing \nfield. And who is paying this additional 25 percent? Our seniors are. \nIt is coming out of their payments. It is coming out of the Medicare\n\n[[Page S15149]]\n\ntrust fund. It is cutting out the benefits they ought to have. That is \nridiculous. That 25 percent should be reinvested in the drug program, \nnot used as a subsidy for the private sector.\n  Now, we say: Well, you have that 25 percent on that. If you looked \nthrough, you would say: Well, that is a pretty big chunk of change for \nit. You think they would be happy with that, wouldn't you? No, no, no, \nno, Senator Kennedy, we are not even happy enough with that. We are \ngoing to include, on top of the 25 percent subsidy, a $12 billion slush \nfund in this bill--$12 billion. So 25 percent is not enough. We will be \nable to provide hundreds of millions--hundreds of millions--billions of \ndollars to those HMOs, some of which made more than $1 billion last \nyear. Some of those CEOs are getting paid more than $22 million a year. \nAnd we are going to take $12 billion more on top of the 25 percent and \nuse that as a slush fund.\n  Talk about an even playing ground. What could that $12 billion \nprovide for? These are the leading diseases about which our elderly are \nconcerned: Arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, cholesterol, acid reflux, \nthyroid deficiency, and depression. That $12 billion could provide for \n11 million of our senior citizens who suffer from arthritis a year, or \n12 million who suffer from osteoporosis, or 11 million who suffer from \ndepression, or it could be used for those who suffer from high \ncholesterol, right on down the line. That is what it could mean for our \nsenor citizens. But, oh, no, this conference said no, we are going to \ntake that and add that in. Not only are we going to threaten you with \nthis premium support program, you will never really know what your \npremiums are, except that they are going up.\n  I want to take just a few more minutes about this proposition. I had \nmentioned earlier that the day this bill passes, you are going to have \n9 million of our 40 million Americans who are going to be worse off and \npay more. Do we understand that?\n  On top of what I have already explained--the completely unfair \nplaying ground that is so tilted towards those who do not support \nMedicare--now we are saying to our elderly that between 2 million and 3 \nmillion--and closer to 3 million.\n  Low-income seniors pay more. Six million of them will be receiving \nMedicare but also receive Medicaid. The conference proposal denies \nStates the ability to provide wraparound coverage to those low-income \nseniors. Instead, a uniform Federal co-payment is imposed, and it is \nindexed, so that it goes up every year. Their out-of-pocket payments \nfor drugs will be raised, and they may not even have coverage for the \ndrugs they need the most. If they need a drug that is not on the \ninsurance company formulary, they will have to go through a burdensome \nappeals process. Most will simply go without.\n  Every one of these 6 million will be paying more. Maybe it is $2 a \nprescription, but if you have three prescriptions, that is $6. You may \nhave to get a refill every other week, and it begins to go up, $24, \n$25. Nine million lose the day this passes. Let's keep our eye on these \n6 million low-income seniors.\n  Prescription copays hurt the very poor. You will have almost double \nthe amount of serious adverse events when seniors don't take those \nmedicines. Emergency visits go up as well, double the amount. For those \n6 million, these are the statistics from all the health care studies. \nNot only will they be paying more, but their health condition will be \nthreatened. It makes absolutely no sense from a health policy point of \nview.\n  One of the most important aspects of the legislation passed in the \nSenate was to say we were going to make sure that the asset test, which \nhas been around for many years, the asset test for the very poor would \nno longer be in effect. As a result, we took steps with regard to \nprescription drugs that we haven't even done with regard to Medicaid. \nThe Senate bill really reached down for the poorest of the poor \nelderly.\n  We said: OK, maybe you can have the car, $4,200; you can have the \npersonal savings, $2,300; you can have even a $1,500 insurance policy \nand a burial plot for $1,500, and we were not going to hold that \nagainst you. People who had worked all their lives perhaps had those.\n  What do our good Republican friends do? They reimpose the assets test \nand say, if you have that, you are not eligible. Three million of the \npoorest of the poor are dropped out of coverage under this proposal. \nThat is enormously unworthy of the proposal.\n  I want to mention an aspect of this because I am running out of time. \nI have mentioned that we have the premium support which is going to \nthreaten the Medicare system. We have the subsidy programs which are \ngoing to threaten the whole Medicare system by enticing, coercing, \nbribing seniors out of that, and then letting the Medicare system \ncollapse right in front of them.\n  Then they have added another program which they call health savings \naccounts--what used to be called medical savings accounts--which \nprovides billions of new tax breaks for the healthy and the wealthy. \nThe money that should have been used in this bill to provide additional \nprescription drugs, they have taken billions out to provide for this \nnew program. They encourage the healthy and the wealthy to take high-\ndeductible policies, policies that require you to pay thousands of \ndollars before you get benefits. That is fine for people who can afford \nto put money into tax-free savings accounts but it is not good for \nordinary working Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Urban Institute and the American Academy of \nActuaries have estimated that the healthiest people are pulled out of \nthe risk pool for regular comprehensive policies by these accounts. \nPremiums skyrocket, if this policy becomes law. If you want to keep \nyour insurance policies, you can see your premiums increase as much as \n60 percent.\n  The Urban Institute estimates that premiums, and this will be for all \nthose who are employees working in small companies all across the \ncountry, once this program gets started, could increase by over 60 \npercent and the American Academy of Actuaries have estimated that \npremiums would jump $1,600.\n  Why are we doing this? Why are we taking a chance with the Medicare \nsystem? The American people and our seniors have confidence in \nMedicare. Why not just do what we did in the Senate in a bipartisan way \nand have a good downpayment rather than threaten the Medicare system?\n  This was the wrong way to go. This bill does not deserve the support \nof the Senate. I hope it will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator from \nArizona has called and wishes to speak following Senator Cantwell. I \nask unanimous consent that that be a part of the order, following her \nstatement, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, be recognized for \nwhatever time he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have allocated to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. If the Chair will notify me after 40 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. We are now going to go back to the Energy bill. I know \nmany of my colleagues have already been on the floor today discussing \nthe conference report that is before us. While I think my colleagues \nhave done a good job of outlining some of the most egregious parts of \nthis legislation, because it certainly is shocking legislation, the \npoint I would like to make in the next few minutes is about how we got \nto this process and how America is very disappointed in what we have \ncome up with as far as a conference report.\n  It should be no surprise to people here when they find out that this \nbill has basically been drafted in secret without a bipartisan effort, \nwithout a lot of daylight shown on the details of the legislation until \njust this weekend. Now many people are curiously reading through \nvarious aspects of the legislation trying to understand all the \ngiveaways, all the subsidies, and whether it could possibly mesh into \nany kind of comprehensive energy policy. I think the bill is a disaster \nas it relates to moving us off our foreign dependence and coming up \nwith a concrete energy\n\n[[Page S15150]]\n\npolicy. It should be no surprise, when this energy policy legislation \nstarted with a task force meeting with the Vice President in which no \ninput was given, no open session as to what was being discussed.\n  That a bill is brought here to the House and Senate that ultimately \nincluded a conference report drafted in secret makes it very difficult \nfor us to have good legislation. But don't take my word for that \nbecause I do want to discuss the policy ramifications. Let's talk about \nwhat America is saying.\n  In the last 24 hours, we have had a variety of people around the \ncountry, particularly in the press, look at this legislation and \nactually make editorial comment on it. When I woke up this morning and \nsaw the stack of editorials that are before us on each Member's desk, I \nwas shocked to read the detail and comments from newspapers all over \nthe country. That is good news because it means America is watching \nthis energy policy, that those of us in the Northwest who have suffered \nfrom Enron market manipulation are not the only ones watching, that \nthose in New York who have suffered through blackouts are not the only \nones watching, that people all across America are.\n\n  In fact, the question is, Are we better off having to pass this \nEnergy bill or are we better off without it?\n  I will take from what the Great Falls Tribune said:\n\n       Once again, let this energy bill die.\n\n  Why would somebody say that? Some of my colleagues are trying to say \nthis Energy bill actually has a concrete policy. According to the Great \nFalls Tribune: We are as certain today as we have been for a of couple \nyears that no Energy bill is a better option than the bills being \nhashed around in the marble halls of Washington, DC.\n  Other newspapers have said this bill should be a ``do not pass go.''\n  The Minneapolis Star Tribune, again an independent newspaper \norganization, that probably, if it took a close look at this bill, saw \nthere were some projects that the State of Minnesota could benefit \nfrom. Yet they say the Energy bill is a fine target for filibuster. A \nnewspaper organization in a State that actually has energy projects in \nthis bill thinks we should filibuster this bill:\n\n       The energy bill unveiled over the weekend is wrong headed \n     policy prepared in a high handed way, fitted with perhaps \n     enough gifts to selected opponents to buy its passage. It's \n     an abusive approach to lawmaking, egregious enough to \n     deserve--indeed, to invite--a filibuster.\n\n  That is from a State that has energy projects in it. So this is a \nnational energy policy, which some, such as colleagues on the other \nside, like to talk about. According to the Houston Chronicle, in a \nState that would benefit in the millions of dollars from different \nsubsidies and sweetheart deals in this legislation, they say:\n\n       Fix the Flaws.\n       A bill setting out a national energy policy should \n     encourage conservation, investment and new technology; \n     increase available energy; make the distribution system more \n     reliable; and reduce pollution from burning fuel. The energy \n     bill unshrouded Monday by congressional Republicans is, at \n     best, half of a loaf that has been dropped repeatedly in the \n     dirt.\n\n  Some people say this was a process, it went through committee \nhearings and through all sorts of hearings, and we had discussions on \nthe floor. I remind my colleagues that we got to this point on July 31 \nof this year where we could not agree on an energy bill. I personally \nthought we should hold the bill up at that time and send it back and \nbasically make the point that it wasn't going to be a successful \nproduct, hoping my colleagues would go back to the drawing board and \nget more bipartisan legislation.\n  What happened was, we got so desperate, we passed last year's Senate \nbill and many of us said: We know what will happen. They are going to \ntake last year's Senate bill and dump it and overreach in the \nconference because it will be controlled by the Republicans, not in a \nbipartisan policymaking fashion, but they are going to overreach. A lot \nof people say this has been written by the energy lobbyists.\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer said:\n\n       The Energy Bill: Lobbyists Gone Wild.\n\n  They say:\n\n       After all, there's something for everyone here. Everyone, \n     that is, with enough dough to finance a lobbyist's next pair \n     of Gucci [shoes].\n\n  It is amazing that so many newspapers have so much on the ball and \ntook time in their editorial pages in the last couple of days to shine \nthe bright light on this policy that has been drafted in the dark and \nnot in a bipartisan fashion.\n  The Chicago Tribune said:\n\n       Energy Legislation on the Fly.\n       If those problems don't sink the bill, the process by which \n     the Republican majority cobbled it together certainly ought \n     to. Democrats literally were locked out of the final \n     negotiations, and now Congress--and the public--have about 48 \n     hours to digest and evaluate the contents of this mammoth \n     document. This is no way to craft sensible national energy \n     policy.\n\n  That was the Chicago Tribune.\n  My colleague, Senator Durbin from Illinois, has been out here talking \nabout the MTBE provisions and how those who might be affected by that \nand the public might become deep pockets on what really is the \nresponsibility of individual businesses. But I think he should be very \nproud that his hometown newspaper is trying to educate people all over \nIllinois who might think, gee, what is wrong with this bill? Probably \nethanol provisions are in it, and it ought to be a good bill. They are \nactually doing the work to show that this is quite controversial.\n  Another newspaper, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, wrote something \npretty humorous:\n\n       Indigestion Before the Holidays.\n       The Old Testament is only slightly longer and is a lot more \n     readable. . . .\n\n  We should take our time with this bill.\n  The St. Paul Pioneer Press is obviously pointing to what Members \nwould refer to as pork-lined elements:\n\n       Energy Bill Lavishes Billions to Drill . . .\n\n  I don't think that is what we thought the future energy policy of \nAmerica would be--lavishing billions to drill. We thought we were going \nto have an energy policy that was about innovation, technology, about \nmoving forward on conservation, and about alternative fuels. Not that \nwe didn't think we were going to continue to use some fossil fuels, but \nwe didn't think we would lavish billions on them.\n  We also heard from USA Today. At a time when we have ballooning \ndeficits, what is this bill doing to help us get on the right track? \nThey said:\n\n       Costly Local Giveaways Overload Energy Plan.\n       The Nation can't afford an energy program that drives up \n     the Federal deficit without addressing critical problems.\n\n  Part of this is not addressing critical problems. There are many \naspects of this earlier legislation draft that I think could have gone \na long way toward getting us on track with jobs, along with the Alaskan \nnatural gas pipeline, that probably are not going to come about now, \nwhich could have gotten us further ahead on a hydrogen fuel economy and \nwould have established U.S. leadership in that new technology. Yet that \nwas left out of the bill.\n  The Wall Street Journal, which I think has followed the energy debate \nvery closely, was shocked to find out in the last couple of days:\n\n       The fact that it's being midwifed by Republicans, who claim \n     to be free marketers, arguably makes it worse. By claiming \n     credit for passing this ``comprehensive'' energy reform, \n     Republicans are now taking political ownership of whatever \n     blackouts and energy shortages ensue. Good luck.\n\n  Why is that? That is the Wall Street Journal, and it is basically \nputting these issues that have happened in America already--energy \nblackouts and shortages--on the other side of the aisle, on their lap, \nand saying this policy isn't going to work.\n  I have to say, as a former businessperson, we have had a lot of \ndebate about standard market design and regional transmission \norganizations. I want to see free markets work. But free markets work \nwhen there is transparency and when there are rules in place. This \nlegislation does very little to provide for transparency in the market. \nI think that, along with many of the other items of oversubsidization \nand special interest initiatives in this legislation, is what drew the \nWall Street Journal to say it is not a good piece of legislation.\n  What else do people say?\n  The Concord Monitor basically said this is:\n\n       Abuse of Power: The Federal Energy Bill is Ultimately Worse \n     Than No Bill At All.\n\n  That is what America is starting to understand--that this policy is \nworse\n\n[[Page S15151]]\n\nthan no bill at all. It is a disappointment that we are at this stage \nof the ball game, and I have to say as a member of the Energy Committee \nfor the last almost 3 years, before joining the committee, I talked to \ncolleagues and former members about joining that committee. People \npointed out to me that it had been almost 10 years since the last time \nwe had an energy bill pass out of that committee. Who knew whether we \nwould have an energy policy in the future? I think it is safe to say, \nwith this product in front of us, we bit off more than we could chew by \ncobbling together a bill that is not really centered around the future \nenergy policy but is specific giveaways to individuals so that they \nwill buy in on support of this legislation. But it is worse than I \ncould have imagined, and certainly doing nothing is better than this \nlegislation.\n\n  What about the blackouts? I know some of my colleagues would like to \nsay this is legislation that is going to move us forward in this area. \nI can tell you what the Providence Journal said:\n\n       Energy Gridlock.\n       Unfortunately, Congress seems intent on passing a bill that \n     does nothing to make our energy supply cleaner, safer, or \n     more affordable, and certainly does nothing to prevent a \n     major failure. We hope that it won't take another huge \n     blackout for Congress to see the light.\n\n  That was written in the last week or so.\n  I have a lot to complain about here because my predecessor--we had a \nblackout in the Northwest prior to New York's, and my predecessor, \nformer Senator Slade Gorton, actually proposed reliability standards \nand a process for moving forward so that the industry was accountable \nfor energy supply and standards that would prevent us from having \nblackouts.\n  What happened? His legislation actually passed out of the Senate and \ngot held hostage in the House because the industry wanted more \nderegulation before they were going to put reliability standards in \nplace. How is that responsible?\n  Now we are moving forward on an energy bill that basically, at best, \nas it relates to FERC and its jurisdiction and responsibility, is \nconfusing and muddling. We do nothing about the market manipulation \nissue of Enron in this legislation.\n  While I would like to believe the reliability standards will help in \nsome ways, I don't know, given the overall aspects of the bill, that \nthey are going to be as helpful as we need them to be. Why should we \nhave to be told that you have to swallow the whole energy policy that \nis bad for America just to get reliability standards so people in New \nYork or Ohio or Michigan can be sure their lights will turn on at \nnight? That is a ridiculous policy. This body should have passed \nreliability standards as a stand-alone bill when Slade Gorton proposed \nit, and it should have passed it as soon as we came back after the \nAugust recess.\n  I am amazed again at how many newspapers across the country are \nwriting about this bill. We talk about, obviously, some of the Clean \nAir Act and Clean Water Act issues, and I will get to those in a \nminute.\n  The Fresno Bee calls this legislation ``political wheezing.''\n  They say:\n\n       The valley representatives in Congress have put a \n     particular stake in this fight. The problems of air \n     pollution, especially diesel particulate matter, are worse \n     here than anywhere else, and we must do everything we can to \n     address this.\n\n  What about the Ventura County Star newspaper talking about the \nobviously bad coastal oil and gas language? Every year on the west \ncoast there is a battle that goes on. Basically, we have had for 20-\nsome years now a moratorium on drilling off the coast of Washington, \nOregon, and California. While that is an Executive order moratorium, we \nalways have to worry that some interest or some group is going to try \nto lift that moratorium. It happens every year, and every year in an \nappropriations bill Congress continues to say: We want a moratorium on \ndrilling off our coast of Washington, Oregon, and California.\n  Why do we have to drill there? We have marine sanctuaries. We have \nterrific problems with tanker traffic and a variety of other issues. We \nhave had spills off the coast of Washington that have caused incredible \ndamage. Why do we have to worry now about legislation that makes that \nissue more cloudy by saying you could give the Secretary the power to \nexpedite and approve a process on this? What did the Ventura County \nStar say?\n  They said:\n\n       Instead of trying to continually slip in language that \n     harms the Nation's coast lines, puts thousands of communities \n     at risk of an economic and environmental disaster, Congress \n     should be focused on the public's welfare, the environment, \n     and the rights of States to protect their residents.\n\n  This bill undermines those rights. It undermines States rights, it \nundermines the rights of individuals, and it will leave our shorelines \nless protected.\n  What did the Nashville Tennessean say? It said:\n\n       An energy bill without savings has no steam. The President \n     and his allies have built an energy policy on their \n     convenience--\n\n  On their convenience.\n\n       When they are willing to build on conservation, then \n     they'll have an energy policy that will work for all \n     Americans.\n\n  Makes sense, doesn't it? The bottom line is, this bill is what some \npeople are saying. It is about Hooters and polluters. It is about \nspecial interests. It is not about a conservation policy that is good \nfor America, and it does very little to get us off our dependence on \nforeign oil. America deserves better.\n\n  If our generation has been smart enough to put a man on the Moon, our \ngeneration can be smart enough to get off our dependence on foreign \noil, but we in this body have to do our job. We have to draft an energy \npolicy that has a vision, that has a focus, that has the right \nincentives and ask America to step up and help with this process.\n  I wish to continue with a few other charts. The Orlando Sentinel \nagrees with what I have just articulated and that is a concern about \nthis Energy bill and where the focus is for tax breaks.\n  The Orlando Sentinel said:\n\n       Start over: The energy bill before Congress is worse than \n     what exists.\n\n  Why do they say that? They articulate:\n\n       Two-thirds of the tax breaks will go to the oil and natural \n     gas and coal industries, helping to perpetuate this country's \n     dependence on fossil fuels.\n\n  A lot of people hear about these tax breaks and think we are talking \nabout new technology, either smart metering, wind energy, or \nsomething--even clean coal. But the clean coal percentages of the \ndollars spent on tax incentives in this bill are very minor as well. So \nwe are spending money on subsidies, but we are spending them in the \nwrong direction.\n  What does America say when you ask them about this? What do they say \nwhen you say: Gee, here's the choice. The question to them is, Do you \nsupport giving subsidies to oil and natural gas companies and giving \ntax incentives. Basically, when you read a description of this, the \nmajority of voters in this country, 55 percent of them, think Congress \nwould be better off if we didn't pass this legislation. A majority of \nAmericans are already saying they are not interested in this \nlegislation.\n  This bill is about as bad as it gets. Obviously, I am encouraging my \ncolleagues to vote no. As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said:\n\n       Put backroom energy bill out of country's misery.\n\n  It goes on to urge, when Members of Congress have the chance, \n``Members of Congress who remain committed to a more rational energy \npolicy . . . shouldn't hesitate to reject it.\n  I have just read for my colleagues, not my thoughts, but the thoughts \nof newspapers around the country. Why did I do that? I am sure my \ncolleagues can read. I know they have busy schedules today. I know they \nhave these editorials on their desks. I spent time to do that because I \nwant them to know that America is watching, and America expects us to \nstand up and do the right thing. This bill that we have had very little \ntime to really understand, and basically on this side of the aisle have \nbeen shut out of the process as it relates to the conference report, \nare trying to respond in very short order to say that this bill is a \nmistake. I want my colleagues to know that the rest of America is \nwatching.\n  Some of these issues my colleagues have gone over before, but I want \nto articulate a few of my objections to this legislation because I \nthink it is important for America to understand the various aspects of \nthis legislation.\n\n[[Page S15152]]\n\n  First, there are a variety of environmental laws that are basically \nundermined by this legislation: the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act, the Outer Continental Shelf public lands \nissues. I ask myself: Why is it that we have to undermine current \nenvironmental law to have a national energy policy? I have sat on the \nEnergy Committee in various hearings about public lands, about energy \ncompanies, about getting more supply. I have not heard an industry show \nup and testify that they have to do something about the Clean Water \nAct, but this legislation does undermine the Clean Water Act. It \nexempts all construction activities at oil and gas drilling sites from \nthe coverage of runoff requirements under the Clean Water Act.\n  Is that what America wants? Is America so desperate for new oil and \ngas drilling sites that they say the runoff at those sites are \nsomething from which those particular industries should get an \nexemption? Everybody else who is a developer in America has to deal \nwith runoff. It is not an easy problem.\n  We set a priority. We said we wanted clean water in America and so we \nset standards. So why would we let new oil and gas construction out of \nthat?\n  We, obviously, care about clean air. Why do we have to have an energy \npolicy that basically changes clean air attainment levels that we have \nalready set in policy just to get new energy construction? Is that what \nthe Congress thinks the message ought to be? Obviously, this \nlegislation is a rewrite of existing law and it postpones ozone \nattainment standards across the country. This is a matter that was \nnever considered in the House and Senate bill and that has now been \ninserted into the conference report. That is what one gets out of a \nsecret process. They get bad legislation as it relates to some of our \nstrongest environmental laws.\n  Now, why does a national energy policy have to step on safe drinking \nwater? Are we in such desperate straits to get energy supply that we \nare willing to say there can be an exemption from safe drinking water? \nThe provisions in this act basically remove an oil and gas extraction \ntechnique from regulation of the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  Hydraulic fractioning is a process by which water, sand, and toxic \nchemicals are injected into rock so the oil and natural gas that they \ncontain can be extracted. So if we do that in some large body of water \nwithin my State of Washington, somehow that company that is involved in \nthat technique does not have to meet the regulations under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act?\n  Somebody who is going to explore for that kind of oil and gas, is it \nso important for us to have that that somehow we are going to say they \ndo not have to meet safe drinking water standards? I do not understand \nthat.\n  I already articulated a little bit our concerns about public lands. \nSince when does an energy policy for America, that ought to be focused \non a hydrogen fuel economy, about energy efficiency, about fuel \nefficiency, a whole variety of things, have to have an assault on \npublic lands?\n  When drilling on those public lands, one has to pay a royalty. Oh, \nbut under this bill now less is paid because we are forgiving some of \nthose royalties. Why? Because we want to incentivize more oil and gas \ndrilling on public land.\n  Why? If we look at the research that shows where the availability of \noil and gas is, it basically shows on most public lands it is \nuneconomical; it is hard to reach. One cannot get that far on the \naccess to public lands to make it even efficient. So why now further \nincentivize it by saying we are going to make them pay less in \nroyalties?\n  The other thing is it creates this new entity--I do not know what one \nwould want to call it. I do not know if it is the Cheney committee. I \ndo not know what it is, but somewhere in the White House this \nlegislation says now there will be an organization that plays a policy \nrole on expediting oil and gas drilling and making sure that if it is \nabout waiving access to public lands, this group will help get the job \ndone. I do not understand why we have to go through that process of \ndealing with our public lands to make energy policy work in America.\n  I think there are many other things we should be doing. Let's talk \nabout a few other things, because I know that I have colleagues who \nwant to chime in on this, but I have to mention a few other things that \nI was shocked to find in this legislation.\n\n  As a Member who spent many hours on the electricity title, I do not \nunderstand why this bill has to have an exemption for Texas. Why does \nthe State of Texas get out of compliance with the electricity title as \nit relates to electricity market rules, market transparency rules that \nare so important to making markets work, basically protecting the \nconsumer? Texas gets protected from the cost shifting that happens in \ntransmission construction, but the rest of us in the country do not get \nto be protected.\n  Now, I wanted to bring this issue up when we were debating this bill \nin July but we decided, because there was so much turmoil, to take this \nout and to basically go back to the Senate Democratic bill passed from \nthe previous year just to try to get something going. As I said \nearlier, now we know what the end result was: A bill in secret in \nconference that has all sorts of things in it, including this exemption \nfor Texas.\n  In the electricity title, after what we have seen in California with \nderegulation, as we have seen with various market manipulation \nactivities, we want better rules. We want transparency. We want things \nto work and to have individual utilities held accountable, but we are \ngoing to exempt Texas. Some of the people have said, well, Texas is not \ntied to the rest of the country so for some reason Texas should be \nexempt from this.\n  Here is the facility right here. This facility does interstate and \nintrastate commerce and is connected, and if this electricity title is \ngood enough for Washington, good enough for New York, and good enough \nfor Ohio, it ought to be good enough for Texas, too. They should not \nhave an exemption in this bill.\n  What about the sweetheart deals in this legislation? I could go on \nactually forever about the sweetheart deals in this legislation. My \nfavorites are the $1.1 billion for a new nuclear facility in Idaho. Not \nthat this Senator has an out and out opposition to nuclear facilities. \nWe have some in Washington State. I spend a good deal of my time \ntalking about Hanford cleanup and the billions of dollars taxpayers \nhave spent on trying to clean up nuclear waste. But why are we going to \nspend $1.1 billion for a new nuclear facility in Idaho to see if \nnuclear power can produce hydrogen? There are thousands of ways to \nproduce hydrogen. You do not have to have a new nuclear facility to do \nit.\n  My other favorite little part of the sweetheart deal is basically a \nprocess in the bill in which DOE can help pay for and finance the \ntransmission hookups that might end up being used for a coal company in \nTexas.\n  My colleagues might say, well, geez, if someone has new power and \nthey want to put it on the transmission grid in my State they get in \nline. If they have capacity and they want to be added to the grid, they \ncome to the Bonneville Power Administration and work with them about \nhow they are going to add capacity to the grid, but they do not have \nDOE coming in and basically saying they will help them get connected \nand get capacity to the grid.\n  That is just part of the aspects of this legislation, the many \nsweetheart deals. I am sure many of my colleagues are going to go \nthrough this and talk in more detail about some of this legislation, \nbut this energy policy, more than anything else, is a missed \nopportunity. Instead of incentivizing the right programs, we are \nspending $23.5 billion in tax incentives where only a small percentage \nof them go to the renewables, conservation, and energy efficiency that \nAmerica thought it was investing in when it heard about this energy \npolicy.\n\n  The whole provision that we talked about dealing with hydrogen fuel, \nwhich was an investment in goals and basically a process for us to get \nto a hydrogen economy, have been thrown out of the legislation. The \nonly thing that remains is sort of a small incentive for that.\n  What about creating the clean energy economy of the future in which \nwe thought we could estimate a creation of 750,000 jobs in America over \nthe next 10 years by focusing on these energy efficiencies? Well, if \nthey are spending\n\n[[Page S15153]]\n\n$23.5 billion and only have 32 percent going to that, those 750,000 \njobs are never going to be created in America.\n  I know my colleague from New York wants to speak, and I know I have \nother colleagues who want to speak, so I will try to wrap up, but I \nfeel disappointed for the policy opportunity that is being missed. \nAmerica wants to know what this legislation is about. They want to know \nwhere we are going with energy policy. This policy could be far more \nreaching in response, not just to the crises that we have had in \nWashington, California, and Oregon, and not just to the policies of \nblackouts or the fact that these institutions, the House and the \nSenate, have not passed a reliability standard that would give people \nin New York and other places in the country the kind of security they \nneed. We are missing a big opportunity to be leaders in energy policy \nin the world. You might hear some people say we are going to get this \nnational grid. It is not about a national grid. I guarantee we are not \ngoing to build a national grid and ship power from Seattle to Miami \nBeach, and anybody who tells you that they are going to does not \nunderstand energy policy. A national grid is not about shipping power \nall the way across the country. We are entering an era of distributed \npower. That means you produce power closer to the source and to the \nindividuals who want to have it.\n\n  What do you do now that you have hydrogen fuel cells? You have new \nforms of energy that can connect to the grid. What do you do to make \nthat a reality? First of all, you obviously provide the right \ntransparency and stabilization of the system and give oversight to an \nentity that hopefully does its job. Obviously FERC, in a lot of \ninstances, has failed to do its job. But you create these decentralized \nenergy plans in which individuals can connect their power source and \ntheir generation to the grid and have it delivered in that region. That \nis the most economical delivery of energy. That is the future.\n  This bill does not invest in that. It does not invest in net \nmetering, which would basically have a framework for people to \nunderstand how to get their power source onto the grid. It doesn't \ninvest in an interconnecting standard by which everybody could start \nunderstanding how they could connect to the grid. It doesn't even set \nstandards for some of these new technologies that everybody wants to be \npart of developing. There should not only be a national standard for \nthe United States on how to build a hydrogen economy, it ought to be an \ninternational standard so the United States can be a leader in job \ncreation in that new economy. But that is not in this bill.\n  As bad as this legislation is, and it is bad, my colleagues should \nmake no mistake; this bill should not pass. But the tragedy is that \nAmerica is not grabbing its future opportunity to both get off of its \ndependence on foreign oil and also to invest in an energy economy that \nwill produce jobs and have America lead the way in new energy \ntechnology. Let's not embarrass America by passing this bad legislation \nthat undermines environmental laws, that puts the tax incentives in the \nwrong way, runs the deficit up without giving us a return on jobs, that \nbasically does little to address the market manipulation and blackout \nsituations that happened in the past and, as I am sure my colleague \nfrom New York will talk about, really sticks some Americans with the \ndeep pocket expenses of cleaning up waste.\n  Let's not pass this legislation. Let's listen to America. Let's \nlisten to what those newspapers are saying because they are the first \nshot at this legislation and they understand. Let's go back to work, \neven if it means next year. Let's go back to work and let's put an \nEnergy bill together that America can be proud of. Let's make it a goal \nof our generation that we are going to get off our foreign dependence, \nbut we are going to do it the right way--the Members of this body will \nwork together to get that legislation done.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I only need 5 minutes of time, and I can yield back the \nrest of my time to my colleague from Washington to finish. I know she \nhad an hour.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 21 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent I be given 5 minutes, and the \nremainder of that 21 minutes goes back to my colleague from Washington \nState.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington for \nher stellar leadership on this issue. She has been just a beacon on \nthis bill, on which it is appropriate to have a beacon. She is the \nbeacon from Washington State, and I thank her for the good work she has \ndone.\n  I thank my colleague from New Mexico. We are good friends. I regret I \nfeel so strongly about this legislation in opposition to him. But I \nbelieve this is the worst legislation that I have seen in my over 20 \nyears in the Congress. It is bad for what is in it, and it is bad for \nwhat is not in it. I will speak at much greater length on those issues \nwhen I have more time, but I would just like to mention a few things.\n  It is laden with special interest provisions. There is no question \nabout it. So many people got little things for their States. Some of \nthem are good, some of them are not good. When you add them up they are \nextremely expensive. It is hard to believe in an administration that is \nwatching costs so much that a bill that was originally $8 billion \nshould balloon to $23 billion. This includes $1 billion to build a \nnuclear reactor in Idaho. I understand we need projects in people's \nStates to sort of grease the wheels of legislation, but at $1 billion a \nshot?\n  There is so much bad in this bill. To me, the two worst provisions \nare the MTBE and the ethanol provision: MTBE, taking people's \nlivelihood they put into their home; their homes are ruined. Their only \nhope is for the oil companies, which knew how bad MTBEs were and didn't \ntell anybody, to help pay. We pulled the rug out from under tens of \nthousands of present homeowners, and millions of future homeowners who \ncannot even live in their homes anymore. They can't take a shower. They \ncan't drink the water. And we are saying: Tough luck. We are giving the \nMTBE industry $2 billion to close. We don't give a small store owner \nany money when they close. In addition, we say you are absolved from \nyour mistakes and the taxpayers, the homeowners, pick up the bill.\n\n  The ethanol provision, I have such disagreement with so many on my \nside of the aisle I am not going to get into it. Suffice it to say, if \nyou want to subsidize corn, good. Don't make the drivers of New York \nState or Washington State or some of the other States on the coasts pay \nfor it. I believe this can raise our gasoline prices 4 cents to 10 \ncents a gallon in my State, and in many others. That is not how we do \nthings around here. It is not how we should do things around here.\n  How can we be asked to support a bill that does that?\n  But the worst thing about this bill is what my colleague from \nWashington mentioned, which is the missed opportunities. If there was \never a time, if there was ever a perfect storm to create a real energy \npolicy in this country, one that we don't have, it is now. We have 9/\n11, and everyone realizes how we have to become independent of Middle \nEastern oil. We had Enron, and everyone realizes the problems in \ntrafficking in electricity and in the grid and that things have to be \nchanged. We had the blackouts this summer, and everyone realizes the \ngrid that we have can't be piecemeal anymore.\n  These are perfect opportunities to get our hands around the policy \nthat will serve us well for the future. Nothing is in there. It is not \nsimply that there are special interests and a policy, but there are \nspecial interest provisions and they take the place of any real energy \npolicy. That is what so bothers me about this bill.\n  China is adopting more stringent CAFE standards than we are. Should \nthat make us wonder what we are doing?\n  I read history. Great empires, great countries--and I love this \ncountry. It has been the most wonderful thing for my family that has \never happened--begin to lose it when they fail to come to grips with \nreality. We have a reality here. We have three realities. We are\n\n[[Page S15154]]\n\njust fiddling while Rome burns. We are dancing on our merry way and \ngiving out a little bit of pork here and a little bit there and a \nlittle bit here and not dealing with the fundamental energy problems we \nface.\n\n  I will have more to say later. I thank the Chair. I thank my \ncolleague from Washington for her courtesy. I yield the remainder back \nto her.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, does the Senator from Illinois wish to \nspeak? I yield to the Senator from Illinois 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been waiting to speak. I didn't \nunderstand what happened.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe the Senator from Washington has time remaining \nand yielded 5 minutes to me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. After that, are we finished?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I will probably have about 10 minutes left and we will \nwrap up.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nyielding.\n  Consider this: You buy a home in a neighborhood and you start hearing \nabout people around your neighborhood who are getting sick. It turns \nout it is not just a common, ordinary sickness. It is serious; it is \ncancer. Then you are puzzled and start wondering: Is there something in \nthe water. Isn't that the first thing you ask? Then you find out there \nis something in the water. It turns out it is something called MTBE. \nYou never heard of it before. They explain to you, it is in the \ngasoline in your car. Incidentally, at that service station on the \ncorner--the one where they dug up the tank--that tank was leaking. The \nleaking gasoline from that tank contained MTBE, and it got down so low \nthat it got into the water supply of the village in which you live. The \nwater you have been drinking and giving to your kids contains MTBE.\n  Studies have shown that MTBE can be cancer causing. Think about that. \nTotally innocent and unsuspecting, you have now learned that a public \nhealth hazard that threatens your family, the value of your home, and \nyour community is linked to something you had never seen before and \nnever heard about.\n  So what do you do? You are concerned about the health of your family. \nBut you turn around and say: Whoever is responsible for that additive \nthat threatens my family and my home and my community needs to be held \naccountable.\n  That is what America is all about. Nobody gets off the hook. So \npeople go to court. They say to the oil company: Did you know that MTBE \nin your gasoline could threaten public health? Well, it turns out they \ndid. They knew for a long time.\n  They also knew that if that MTBE got in the environment, that didn't \ndisappear, it stuck around forever. A tiny amount of it could be \ndangerous to thousands, if not millions, of people. They knew it. They \ncontinued to make it. They continued to sell it. They knew all along \nthat people would get sick and some would die as a result of that \nproduct.\n  Should they be held accountable or should they be let off the hook?\n  Turn to our Energy bill and look at section 1502 which answered that \nquestion for America. The makers of MTBE are given safe harbor. It \nsounds great, doesn't it. Here is what it means. You cannot sue to hold \nthat oil company or maker of MTBE accountable for that deadly additive \nthat is poisoning people and causing cancer if it is a product \nliability lawsuit--can't do it. But we have decided that in order to \nstrike a political bargain here, we are going to let the oil companies \noff the hook.\n  What does the family do? What are they supposed to do about water \nthey can't drink, where people are sick in their neighborhood and where \nhouses are losing value in a community that is scared to death? We tell \nthem to read the Energy bill we are producing here. That is the best we \ncan do for you. We can't answer your problems. We can tell you that we \npassed a good bill and the oil companies love it.\n  The Senator from New Mexico came to the floor earlier and very \ncandidly--I salute him for this--said you had better understand the \ndeal. If you want to help ethanol, you had better let the MTBE \npolluters off the hook. Otherwise, there is no deal.\n  We have spent 20 years producing ethanol. My State produces more than \nany State in the Union. I have proudly stood behind this product \nbecause I believe it is good, it is healthy for the environment, and it \nreduces our dependence on foreign oil. But I have said to my friends \nback home who support ethanol and I will say it on the floor: If the \nbargain I have to strike for ethanol is to turn my back on families who \nare dying from disease because of MTBE, the deal is off. The deal is \noff. That is unjust. It is immoral. It is wrong. If that is what it \ntakes to promote ethanol in America, I will not be part of it; \nabsolutely not. Count me out.\n\n  That is a basic injustice, to say those oil companies would not be \nheld accountable for their wrongdoing in order to promote the ethanol \nindustry. It is a deal with the Devil. It is a Faustian bargain, and I \ndon't want to be a part of it, and no Member of the Senate should \neither.\n  If this is as good as it gets on the floor of the Senate, shame on \nall of us. This bill should be stopped in its tracks. We ought to send \nthe people back to the committee and say start over and get the work \ndone. America's energy future depends on thoughtful, visionary \npolicies. It doesn't include this kind of a deal with oil companies to \nlet them off the hook.\n  How in the world can you turn your back on these families who, \nthrough no fault of their own, are facing these terrible health \nproblems? These families can't go to court now to hold the oil \ncompanies that knew better accountable. That is what this bill does.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has been very candid. I admire his \ncandor. But his candor tells the story. We can do a lot better.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership on electricity \nand protecting our public lands, and other areas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I will not take all 10 minutes. I know \nwe have other colleagues in the Chamber. I wish to make one final \npoint.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois for continuing his talk about this \nissue as it impacts his State and national policy which we are all \ntrying to fight. But many of my colleagues know that on one provision \nin the Energy bill relating to Enron, we really tried to make a point. \nIn fact, 57 Members of this body passed an amendment, albeit on the \nAgriculture appropriations bill because we couldn't get it on the \nEnergy bill when we recessed in August, which basically said we think \nmarket manipulation has taken place and something needs to be done \nabout it.\n  In fact, at that time I argued that in this legislation we ought to \nhave a prohibition on the types of market manipulation that actually \nhappened with Enron and include that in the Energy bill. My colleagues \non the other side of the aisle drafted language that basically \nprohibited one of the Enron abuses but not all of the Enron abuses. But \nin a separate piece of legislation, we got 57 of my colleagues--a \nmajority of Senators--to say, Let's say that market manipulation on \ncontracts was wrong.\n  That language still exists in a conference committee on Agriculture \nappropriations. That language is sitting there hoping we will get it \nout of conference, even though the industry is lobbying against it. \nYes, that is right. The remnants of Enron are lobbying against it.\n  What do we do? In this conference report, we basically change current \nFederal law and say those contracts shouldn't stand. We go one step \nfurther in the Federal Power Act and say manipulated contracts are not \nin the public's interest.\n  This legislation should be defeated alone on the fact that it \ncontinues the Enron price gouging. We as a body failed to stand up to \nthat kind of activity. We can say all we want about the reforms we have \nwith the SEC, all the reforms we had on auditing, but in our energy \npolicy we have done nothing to be the policemen on the street. These \nenergy companies, under this legislation, are still going to run free \nto continue to manipulate market. Not only that, we are putting in this \nbill that it is OK to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues: Please, in the next 24 hours review this \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S15155]]\n\ncarefully. It has so many issues that are the wrong direction for our \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up to the special interests that have \npromulgated this bill and say no to the conference report.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator McCain is on the list we made as \nthe next speaker.\n  I ask if I could speak for about 2 minutes before Senator McCain. He \nhas indicated yes.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, my good friend from the \nState of Washington went through a series of newspapers and read what \nnewspapers had to say. I will not do that. But I suggest that she and \nother Senators, instead of reading what the newspapers have to say, \nread what their constituents have to say.\n  I want to cite some constituents of hers and of everyone else in the \nSenate and what they have had to say. The Solar Industry of America \napplauds this. They are the largest group of American businessmen \ninvolved in development of solar energy. They sent a letter in full \nsupport, along with the National Hydropower, American Coalition for \nEthanol, Renewable Fuels, National Biodiesel Board, American Soybean \nBoard, North American Electric Reliability Council. While we are on \nthat one, let me suggest that the board that looked at the blackout we \nhad in the Northeast and just issued a report. I will talk about it \nlater.\n  Most interestingly, the biggest thing they found that caused that \nblackout was the violation of reliability standards. Those standards \nare in this legislation. That will not happen again. The study group \nsays we have taken care of them in this legislation. Do not forget, if \nwe do not pass this, they are out the window. Who knows when we will \nget back to them.\n  The National Rural Electric Coops of America, a letter of full \nsupport; the Large Public Power Council; the APPA, the American Public \nPower Association; Coalition for Renewable Fuel Standards--totally in \nsupport. I have a multi-industry letter in support of this bill from \nInterstate Natural Gas, National Association of Manufacturers, Ocean \nIndustries, National Corn Growers, North American Manufacturers \nAssociation, Edison Electric Institute, and Domestic Petroleum Council.\n  Some day before the debate is over I will finish reading the names of \ngroups supporting the bill. The point I make, it is one thing for the \neditors of our newspapers to write about a bill, it is another for the \nthousands and thousands of businessmen, large and small, who are going \nto benefit from this, to be writing what they think about the bill. \nRemember, most of the things they are talking about are not in the law \nnow. Throw away this bill and we have thrown away the things they say \nare necessary for their continued operation in the United States.\n  The biggest and most important is the wind industry in America, large \nand small, that produces wind energy for the United States. It is a \ngrowing new industry. Listen clearly: It is growing because it has a \nsubsidy. For those who do not like subsidies, we can cut it off and \nthere will be no more wind energy produced for who knows how long, \nmaybe 10 years. Maybe that is what some would like. Without this bill, \nthe current production credit for wind energy is gone. This bill starts \nit and continues it. It will be gone. It will not be there.\n  We can talk a lot about special interests, about where the money is \ngoing, where the $2.6 billion a year is going over the next 10 years. \nWe have an American energy use of $450 billion a year. We are trying to \nmove it around the edges. It does not seem to this Senator to be an \nexorbitant amount of money or an exorbitant effort to produce a variety \nof energies, diversity of source, and diversity of base so we are not \ntotally dependent again on a source such as natural gas, soon dependent \non it from overseas.\n  Overall, there are problems with the bill, yes; problems we had to \nconcede, yes. But overall, it is a bill that will work.\n  I will answer MTBE concerns at least once a day, but I don't think \ntwo or three times a day. I have done it once. I will ask other \nSenators who are familiar with the subject, including the Senator in \nthe chair, to answer these concerns. Suffice it to say, some of the \ndescriptions about MTBE in this bill are wrong.\n  I have given my best shot at it, but I will close with a very simple \nexample. If you use Folgers Coffee and produce hot water that is too \nhot, you sell it and burn somebody with the coffee, I doubt very much \nif you will sue Folgers Coffee. That is the issue of MTBE. It is a \nlegitimate, valid product, certified by the United States of America to \nbe used. For those who use it right, we have said they will not be \nliable. For those who use it wrong, and there are many who have, they \nwill remain liable. In 15 years there will no longer be any more of \nthat.\n  I say to the corn growers, we have the same issue looming over us on \nalcohol and ethanol. We have said there, too, the product is not \nliable; using it improperly does create liability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think this legislation is very timely \nbecause if we pass it, Thanksgiving will come early for the Washington \nspecial interests. The American public will be presented with an \nenormous turkey stuffed with their tax dollars. Tell your constituents \nto save their holiday Turkey carcasses because this farsighted bill \neven provides subsidies for carcasses used as biomass to generate \nenergy.\n  We cannot discuss the bill without looking at the fiscal condition of \nthe United States of America today. According to recent reports, \nGovernment spending, thanks to the Congress, grew at 12 percent. We are \nlooking at a half a trillion budget deficit next year. We have gone \nfrom a $5 trillion surplus over the last few years to a multitrillion-\ndollar deficit. So what do we do? We are passing a bill that will \nincrease the deficit by at least somewhere around $24 billion.\n  By the way, I am really sorry we have not gotten the bill. I \nunderstand it is 1,200 to 1,600 pages long. Of course, we are \nconsidering it without even having a chance to observe it, but it is \nprinted in the Record. I imagine the Record is pretty big.\n  Adding to this feast, this bill also contains the other white meat. \nOf course, I am referring to pork. I fear for the passage of a 1,200-\npage, pork-laden bill. The outbreak of Washington trichinosis will be \nso severe we will be forced to have a field office for the Centers for \nDisease Control right next to the Capitol. I am not saying this will \nnot generate some energy, not at all. It will fill the coffers of oil \nand gas corporations, propel corporate interests, and boost the deficit \ninto the stratosphere.\n  Indeed, I have stated on several occasions the name of this bill \nshould be the ``Leave No Lobbyist Behind Act of 2003.'' Given the \nmagnitude of the largess offered in this bill, I hardly know where to \nbegin. I feel somewhat like a mosquito in a nudist colony. I hardly \nknow where to begin.\n  At a time when it is crucial for our national security and economic \nwelfare that we pursue a new course toward energy independence and \nglobal environmental protection, the provisions in this bill take \nexactly the wrong direction: increasing our dependence on conventional \nfuels; increasing environmental degradation; increasing our energy use; \nincreasing our national debt; and diminishing protection for consumers \nand public health.\n  Let's start at the top of the corporate subsidy heap. We have the \nbiggest increase in corn and cash this Congress has ever seen, doubling \nthe national ethanol mandate. A doubling. Gasohol production is the \nworst subsidy-laden energy use ever perpetrated on the American public, \nand it starts with sweet corn. Ten percent of the corn grown in this \ncountry is used to produce ethanol. Corn producers, like producers of \nother major crops, receive farm income and price supports.\n  Let me remind my colleagues in the 107th Congress this body passed a \nfarm bill which appropriated more than $26 billion in direct assistance \nto corn growers over 6 years. That is an average of $4.3 billion in \ndirect subsidies\n\n[[Page S15156]]\n\neach year just to corn growers. But obviously, they have not gotten \nenough. But add it up, and we are over $3 per gallon of ethanol.\n  The cost to consumers does not stop with the production of energy. \nEnvironmental costs of subsidized corn results in higher prices for \nmeat, milk, and eggs because about 70 percent of corn grain is fed to \nlivestock. A GAO report concluded, ``ethanol tax incentives have not \nsignificantly enhanced United States energy security since it reduced \nUnited States gasoline consumption by less than 1 percent.'' So if we \ndouble it, maybe we will have less than 2 percent. It takes more energy \nto make ethanol from grain than the combustion ethanol produces. \nSeventy percent more energy is required to produce ethanol than the \nenergy actually in ethanol. Every time you make 1 gallon of ethanol \nthere is a net energy loss.\n  The National Academy of Sciences concluded in 2000 that ``the use of \ncommonly available oxygenates in Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) has little \nimpact on improving ozone air quality and has some disadvantages.'' \nThey found that oxygenates can lead to higher nitrous oxide emissions, \n``which are more important in determining--ozone levels in some \nareas.''\n  Reformulated gasoline, without oxygenates like ethanol, are widely \navailable and are superior to gasohol. California has started a program \ncalled the ``Cleaner Burning Gasoline,'' which has better fuel economy \nand overall efficiency than gasohol.\n  I believe it was in recognition of this fact that the House and \nSenate both passed Energy bills that would remove the Clean Air Act \nrequirement to include an oxygenate in reformulated gasoline. But, the \noverall economic and environmental benefits of no longer requiring an \noxygenate is wiped out by the $2 billion ethanol mandate doubling \nethanol production in this bill.\n  Another subsidy for ethanol producers is a partial exemption for the \nmotor fuels excise tax, which is paid to the Highway Trust Fund. \nPresently, corn-to-gasohol producers take a $.052 per gallon exemption \nfrom the $.18 per gallon excise tax fuel producers are required to pay \ninto the Highway Trust Fund.\n  According to a recent General Accounting Office study, between 1979-\n2000, this exemption has cost the Highway Trust Fund between $7.5 and \n$11.2 billion.\n  While a tax credit in this bill, called the Volumetric Ethanol Excise \nTax Credit Act of 2003, attempts to change this trend, it merely \nprovides the option for gasohol producers to pay the entire $.18 per \ngallon excise tax to the Highway Trust Fund, and claim a $.052 per \ngallon credit on their income tax. The credit would come from general \ntreasury funds, and leave the Highway Trust Fund income in place, most \nblenders will continue to take the exemption, which is an immediate \ndiscount, rather than switching to the credit. This is a useless \nprovision which won't actually bolster the Highway Trust Fund, or the \nU.S. Treasury. In fact, with doubled ethanol usage, the Federal \ngovernment stands to lose even more in fuel tax revenue in the upcoming \nyears.\n  The national ethanol consumption in 2002 was 2.1 billion gallons. \nMultiply that by 52 cents per gallon, and you see how much revenue the \nhighway trust fund has lost in excise tax in this past year alone. \nAbout $1.1 billion. How much more, then, of taxpayer funds, will be \ngiven back to the ethanol producers, as ethanol production and \nconsumption doubles? The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the \nethanol mandate will cost $2 billion over the next 5 years.\n  For decades the largest ethanol producer has been Archer Daniels \nMidland, producer of more than one-third of all ethanol in 2002, and \nwhose nearest competitor has the capacity to produce one-tenth of ADM's \ncapacity.\n  The excise tax exemption from ethanol has been estimated to account \nfor more than $10 billion in subsidies to ADM--one corporation with $10 \nbillion in subsidies--from 1980 to the late 1990s. In fact, it has been \nestimated that every dollar in profits earned by Archer Daniels Midland \ncosts the taxpayers $30.\n  Speaking of highly objectionable fuel additives, I must join my \ncolleagues who have spoken against the MTBE liability waiver.\n  Mr. President, it is an outrage to see a product liability waiver for \nproducers of MTBE retroactive to September 5, 2003. This nullifies the \nlawsuits against MTBE producers that were filed after September 5, such \nas the case last year in the Superior Court in California, where a jury \nfound that MTBE was a defective product and resulted in a settlement in \nwhich MTBE producers agreed to pay more than $50 million to clean up \nMTBE-contaminated water supplies.\n  Who is going to pay to clean it up now? This provision to shield MTBE \nproducers from product liability could, according to the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, cost taxpayers--taxpayers, not industry--$29 \nbillion to clean up contaminated ground and surface water.\n  In 1998, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted an MTBE survey of water \nwells in industrial areas, commercial areas, residential areas, and \nmixed urban areas nationwide, and also estimated that cleaning up the \nMTBE-contaminated sites in soil and water nationwide is approximately \n$29 billion.\n  Just when you believe this bill cannot get any worse, it does.\n  Mr. President, $800 million--I usually go through these bills, and we \nfind pork in the hundreds of millions, sometimes billions. This exceeds \nall of my past experiences. Mr. President, $800 million for a loan \nguarantee to subsidize the creation of a brandnew polluting, coal \ngasification plant in an economically depressed area of Minnesota. This \nnew company, Excelsior Energy, was formed by lobbyists and executives \nwith ties to a company that filed for bankruptcy after amassing a $9.2 \nbillion debt and being fined $25 million for market manipulation.\n  This brand new giveaway, which was in neither the House nor Senate-\npassed Energy bills, is estimated to cost between $2 billion to $3 \nbillion. While this technology turns coal into a synthetic gas that can \nbe combusted more efficiently, coal plants continue to be a leading \nsource of global warming and should not be subsidized with scarce \ntaxpayer dollars. Further, this $800 million loan guarantee does not \nrequire Excelsior Energy to meet any concrete job creation goals or \nstandards. In a time of $400 billion annual budget deficits, why should \nU.S. taxpayers cover the cost of a new plant that will not even \nguarantee jobs? Minnesota already has a powerplant owned by Exel \nEnergy. Now they need Excelsior Energy, a new plant burning more \ncarbon?\n\n  Mr. President, $95 million for a subsidy for a process known as \n``thermal depolymerization.'' This is a good one. Now you can get a tax \ncredit if you compress Turkey carcasses into energy. ConAgra Foods and \nChanging World Technologies, the two companies that would benefit from \nthis giveaway, have built the only commercial ``thermal technology'' \nplant, which is located in Carthage, MO. The plant would convert \npoultry waste products from ConAgra's Butterball Turkey plant into \nenergy.\n  After including their cash cows and all the polluter pork they could \nfind, energy conferees have now moved on to tax breaks for turkey. I \nencourage my colleagues to save their leftover turkey this year after \nThanksgiving dinner. Instead of making sandwiches the next day, how \nabout turning in your poultry for a tax credit?\n  An amendment was added Monday night--Monday night--to authorize the \nlignite coal-fired electrical generating plant, which would employ \nclean coal technology to provide energy for a rapidly growing region. \nThis amendment was not included in either the House or Senate passed \nenergy bills.\n  Another provision that we understand was inserted at the eleventh \nhour, and was never reviewed by either the House or the Senate, would \nsuspend important environmental reviews to facilitate the construction \nof uranium processing facilities in New Mexico by the consortium, \nLouisiana Energy Services. A Time magazine article that appeared \nearlier this year raised serious questions about one of the consortium \nmembers, which it characterized as ``a European consortium linked to \nleaks of enrichment technology to, yes, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea--as \nwell as to Pakistan.'' The article in Time magazine quotes a high-level \nU.S. nuclear security administrator as saying ``to have this company \noperating in the\n\n[[Page S15157]]\n\nU.S. after it was the source of sensitive technology reaching foreign \npowers does raise serious concerns.''\n  I want to add, I do not know if that is true or not. I do not know if \nthe Time magazine story is true or not. We do not know because we never \nhad any scrutiny of the amendment. But I think it is a serious issue. I \ndo not know.\n  In addition to possible security concerns suggested by the time \narticle, this extraordinary rider raises critical environmental \nconcerns.\n  Even though I understand that both Tennessee and Louisiana have \nrejected this facility, the Energy bill rider shortcuts the NEPA \nprocess and meaningful judicial review of the Environmental Impact \nStatement, for the construction of this facility in New Mexico. To add \ninsult to injury, the provision further requires the Government to \nacquire the waste and dispose of it for a price that is possibly \nsignificantly less than the cost.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Time magazine article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Time Magazine, Jan. 21, 2003]\n\n                  Nukes: To Pyongyang From Nashville?\n\n\nBackers of a proposed uranium enrichment plant have a bad history with \n                            keeping secrets\n\n                           (By Adam Zagorin)\n\n       Is President Bush's ``axis of evil'' campaign about to be \n     undermined in his own backyard? A proposed uranium enrichment \n     facility planned in Hartsville, Tenn. (pop. 2,395) raises \n     just that question. One of the plant's principle backers is \n     URENCO, a European consortium linked to leaks of enrichment \n     technology to, yes, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea--as well as \n     to Pakistan.\n       Sources tell TIME that senior Bush appointees, upset by the \n     ongoing crisis with North Korea, have held detailed \n     discussions in recent days on the need to stop leaks of \n     nuclear technology to rogue states. ``To have this company \n     operate in the U.S. after it was the source of sensitive \n     technology reaching foreign powers does raise serious \n     concerns,'' a high-level U.S. nuclear security administrator \n     told TIME, the first public comment by a Federal official on \n     the proposed plant's ownership. ``The national security \n     community or the new Homeland Security Department will need \n     to look at this.''\n       Concerns about URENCO first emerged more than 10 years ago \n     when thousands of centrifuge parts, based on URENCO designs, \n     were discovered by U.N. inspectors in Iraq after the Gulf \n     War. A one-time URENCO scientist, known as the ``father'' of \n     Pakistan's nuclear bomb, is said to have taken URENCO \n     centrifuge blueprints and information on the company's \n     suppliers to his homeland, later passing similar sensitive \n     material to North Korea and Iran.\n       The company that wants to build the new Tennessee \n     enrichment plant is called Louisiana Energy Services. A \n     consortium of U.S. and foreign companies in which URENCO has \n     a major financial role, LES insists that the link between \n     URENCO and nuclear proliferation is ``long ago and far-\n     fetched at this point.'' URENCO itself has denied authorizing \n     leaks of technology to rogue states.\n       The only previous attempt by LES to build an enrichment \n     plant involved a multi-year effort in the 1990's targeting a \n     small town in Louisiana. Closed Congressional hearings on \n     Iraqi attempts to acquire nuclear weapons were held not \n     long before, and delved into URENCO's record. \n     Subsequently, powerful Michigan Democrat John Dingell \n     raised concerns that the LES plant in Louisiana might \n     violate provisions governing the movement of classified \n     technology from foreign countries under the Federal Atomic \n     Energy Act. That issue was never resolved, but LES gave up \n     attempts to build the Louisiana facility amid controversy \n     over its impact on nearby African-American residents.\n       With its latest effort in Tennessee, LES seems especially \n     anxious to avoid a reprise of those controversies. In an \n     unusual move, LES has asked for a greenlight from the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission without the usual public comment on \n     various environmental, safety and security issues. But groups \n     like the Sierra Club and the National Resources Defense \n     Council contend that this will simply, ``reduce the . . . \n     licensing procedure to a flimsy rubber stamp.'' LES plans to \n     file its 3,000 page license application with the Federal \n     government by January 30, to be followed by a review process \n     that could take at least a year.\n       Also controversial are unanswered questions about the \n     disposal of the Tennessee plant's radioactive waste. \n     Officials in Tennessee have reached a tentative agreement \n     with LES to cap the amount of waste and, last week, the \n     company announced that the material would not stay in \n     Tennessee permanently. But it offered no details as to where \n     the waste might be transferred, a process that can be subject \n     to complex federal licensing procedures.\n       So far few Tennessee politicians have taken a position on \n     the new enrichment plant. That includes Sen. Bill Frist, the \n     new Senate Majority Leader, who has remained neutral on the \n     proposed plant in his home state. But he plans to follow the \n     debate ``very closely,'' says an aide.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. There are also four proposals known as green bonds that \nwill cost taxpayers $227 million to finance approximately $2 billion in \nprivate bonds. One of my favorite green bond proposals is a $150 \nmillion riverfront area in Shreveport, LA. This riverwalk has about 50 \nstores, a movie theater, and a bowling alley. One of the new tenants in \nthis Louisiana riverwalk is a Hooters restaurant. Yes, my friends, an \nEnergy bill subsidizing Hooters and polluters, probably giving new \nmeaning to the phrase ``budget busters.'' Although I am sure there is a \ngreat deal of energy expended at Hooters, I have never been present. \nPerhaps something has been missing in my life.\n  This bill was developed in a secret, exclusive, partisan process, but \nit is no secret anymore. In the last few days, editorials have appeared \nin papers throughout the country. Here are a few choice words from \nvarious papers.\n  One thing that is worthy of note, Mr. President, is that for the \nfirst time in my memory, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal \nboth editorialize strongly against this bill. It is on the rarest of \noccasions that the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times--the Wall \nStreet Journal: ``The Grassley Rain Forest Act,'' which refers to: \n``Special applause goes to Senator Chuck Grassley for grabbing millions \nto build an indoor rain forest and a million-gallon aquarium in lush, \ntropical Iowa. ''\n  Of course, the New York Times editorial, titled ``A Shortage of \nEnergy,'' describes how the bill is a very serious one. Today China's \nmessage on energy--where it goes into a report from China--is that the \nChinese are worried about their increasing reliance on foreign oil. The \ndifference is, the Chinese are ready to do something about it, where \nCongress is not. Indeed, loopholes in the Energy bill could make \nAmerican cars less efficient than they are. While the Chinese say their \nmain concern is oil dependency, not global warming, more efficient cars \nshould help on that, too. And where are our American leaders? \nFeathering nests rather than imposing discipline on the Nation's fuel \nuse.\n  I will not go through all of the editorials that I have seen, but it \nis overwhelming. Everybody who has looked at this bill realizes that it \nis a terrible mistake. It seems to me that this is the result of a \nbroken process, a process that is conducted behind closed doors.\n  I still do not have the bill in front of me. None of us do. I guess \nit is printed in the Record. I understand, because it is 1,200 pages \nlong, the Record might be long.\n  There was very little, if any, consultation with other Members of the \nSenate. My understanding is the Democratic side was cut out of it \ncompletely. And we are given a few short hours to examine a 1,200-page \n``Energy bill.''\n  I want to return to my initial comments. It is serious when we are \nlooking at a $\\1/2\\ trillion debt next year, when we have growth in the \nsize of Government of 12 percent. What has happened to the Republican \nParty? What has happened to the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution? What has happened to the lockbox where we were going to \ntake your Social Security money and put it into an account with your \nname on it? Instead, we have a $20 billion and some energy bill loaded \nwith wasteful porkbarrel projects most of us had not either seen or \nheard of until the last few hours.\n  I hope we can muster 40 votes--I hope so--because I think we have to \nrestore some kind of fiscal sanity, some kind of environmental sanity \nto this Nation. This legislative process needs to be fixed.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I see the manager of the bill. Senator \nDorgan is going to speak. It is my understanding that Senator Collins \nwishes to speak following Senator Dorgan. Does Senator Domenici wish to \nspeak in between?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, I think I will wait.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from Maine have an idea how long she is \ngoing to speak?\n\n[[Page S15158]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I say to the Senator from Nevada, about 12 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that she be given 15 \nminutes.\n  On our side, the next speaker would be Senator Akaka. As we have done \nduring this day, we have gone back and forth on speakers, so after \nSenator Collins, Senator Akaka would be recognized.\n  Would you like to be recognized after Senator Collins?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is what I thought I said.\n  Mr. REID. And do you have any idea how long you wish to speak?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. REID. So Senator Domenici for 15 minutes and then Senator Akaka. \nHow long would he like?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we substitute Senator Inhofe for me and my 10 \nminutes and I will come later?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let's say 15. It probably will be 10.\n  Mr. REID. Just so we don't get the time out of balance, Senator Akaka \nwants 30 minutes. So Senator Domenici would follow Senator Inhofe. \nBecause we are taking a little extra time here, we would have two \nRepublican speakers, Inhofe for 15 minutes and Domenici for 15 minutes \nfollowing Senator Akaka.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me make a request of the assistant minority leader. \nSince Senator Akaka is going to take 30 minutes, would it be possible, \nafter the conclusion of the remarks by Senator Dorgan and Senator \nCollins, to have me go so we would have two at this point and then go \nto Senator Akaka for 30 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. That would be fine. He would be followed by Senator \nDomenici, and then we would have Senator Jack Reed go after that for 20 \nminutes. Senator Akaka for 30 and Senator Reed for 20. I so ask the \nChair to approve our unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to listen to \nsome of the presentations today. I especially listened to my colleague \nfrom Arizona and found it interesting. This is a serious discussion for \nthe Congress. I find much with which to agree with virtually all of my \ncolleagues.\n  My friend from Arizona just described the serious fiscal policy \nproblem. He says we are spending more money. He mentioned the Congress. \nIt is true that spending is up substantially. The President has \nrecommended very large spending increases for the military budget, very \nlarge spending increases for homeland security, very substantial cuts \nin revenue. We have a fiscal policy that does not add up. There is no \nquestion about that. It starts with the President's fiscal policy and \nbegins and ends as well with the Congress. But we have to have a fiscal \npolicy that adds up.\n  Our economy is dependent on energy. If we don't put in place an \nenergy policy that addresses our concerns about energy and the need for \nthis economy to be satisfied with the energy that is required, we won't \nhave an economy that produces revenue and jobs. If, God forbid, \ntomorrow night a terrorist interrupted the supply of foreign oil, our \neconomy would be flat on its back. Fifty-five percent of that which we \nuse, in terms of oil resources, comes from outside our borders. Much of \nit from troubled regions of the world.\n  I have said for a long while that we need to do four things in an \nEnergy bill. We need to incentivize additional production. The fact is, \nI want to see us move towards a different energy construct and a \ndifferent energy future.\n  But we are going to use fossil fuels in our future. We are going to \nuse coal, oil, and natural gas. So the question is, how do we \nincentivize additional production of those fossil fuels while at the \nsame time protecting our country's environment, and then, importantly, \nhow do we conserve? A barrel of oil saved is equal to a barrel of oil \nproduced. Conservation is a very important part of an Energy bill. So \nyou have production and conservation. Third, you have efficiency. The \nefficiency of all the appliances and the things we use in our daily \nlives is a very important area of conservation.\n  And fourth, and very important, the issue of renewable and limitless \nsources and supplies of energy. Those four things need to be in energy \nlegislation.\n  I will describe what is wrong with this bill, and there is plenty. \nThis bill was, in my judgment, constructed behind closed doors in a \nmanner that was arrogant. It is not going to happen again. Never again \nare we going to allow conferees to be appointed here in the Senate and \nthen have a conference in which Democrats are told they can't \nparticipate. That is what happened in this conference. That is not \ngoing to happen again. The next time someone asks consent to appoint \nconferees, we are going to ask the prospective chairman of that \nconference, Is this going to be a conference in which you close the \ndoors and do it in secret with no Democrats included? Because, if so, \nyou don't get consent. We are sorry. We are not going to proceed. This \nwill not happen again because it is arrogant. It should not have \nhappened this time. The process was wrong.\n  Let me talk about what that process has wrought. Some good things and \nsome not so good. My colleagues have raised a series of concerns and \nobjections about this bill. I agree with many of them.\n  I offered an amendment in the conference committee to deal with MTBE \nand strip the provision out of this bill that provides protection for \nthose oil companies that produce MTBE, the fuel additive. That \namendment was defeated. But I offered that amendment because I feel \nstrongly that this protection should not be in this bill. I strongly \nsupported the amendment to put the Renewable Portfolio Standard in this \nbill. It ought to be in the bill.\n  The failure to include the 10-percent requirement for electric \nutilities to produce electricity, 10 percent of their electricity from \nrenewable sources, that requirement needs to be in energy legislation. \nIt is not here. That is a serious deficiency. There are others.\n  Let me also say that this bill has some elements that are important. \nIn the area of production, providing incentives for production in \ncertain areas is very important. Let me take coal as an example. Coal \ncan cause some very serious consequences for our environment. But we \nare going to continue to use coal. So we need an aggressive provision \nin the legislation dealing with clean coal technology so that we can \nuse coal in a manner that is not degrading to our environment. There is \na very serious attempt in this bill to address clean coal technology.\n  This piece of legislation deals perhaps more aggressively than we \nhave ever contemplated with respect to renewable and limitless sources \nof energy.\n  Wind energy. This extends the production tax credit for 3 years. We \nwill see the unleashing, I believe, of substantial new projects to \nbuild wind farms in which you take energy from the wind and you extend \nAmerica's energy supply. That will happen as a result of this bill.\n  Biodiesel, biofuels, a range of areas dealing with renewable sources \nof energy, are incentivized in a significant way in this piece of \nlegislation.\n  My colleague spoke about ethanol. One of the strongest provisions in \nthe bill, in my judgment, is doubling the requirement for ethanol in \nthis country. We are banning MTBE, and for good reason. We are going to \nreplace it with ethanol and double, to 5 billion gallons, the \nproduction of ethanol. Don't tell me that isn't good for this country. \nIt is good to extend our energy supply by growing energy in the fields, \nand it is renewable. You can do it year after year. It produces new \nmarkets for family farmers, extends our energy supply, and is good for \nthis country's environment.\n  Those who call ethanol a boondoggle, in my judgment, don't understand \nit. It is far preferable to extend our energy supply by growing energy \nin our fields, producing the agricultural commodity from which you \nextract the alcohol to make ethanol, have the protein feedstock for \nanimals, extend our energy supply, clean our air, and relieve our \ndependence on foreign oil. That is a huge step forward for this \ncountry. It is not a boondoggle, it is good public policy.\n  Now let me talk about conservation just a bit. One of the things I \nhave been very concerned about is something called efficiency. This \ndeals with all the things we use every day--stoves,\n\n[[Page S15159]]\n\nrefrigerators, toasters, air-conditioners--these appliances all use \nelectricity. What are the efficiency standards by which we should \naspire to conserve electricity and energy?\n  This bill includes nearly the identical efficiency standards that we \nwrote as Democrats when we controlled the Senate. That title, in this \nbill, is a good one. I support that title. It promotes conservation in \na strong and positive way.\n  I believe my colleagues who talk about deficiencies in this bill with \nrespect to the areas dealing with consumer protections are right. I am \nvery concerned about that. But with respect to electricity reliability, \nthe standards in this bill are good ones. They address the issues, not \nall, but most of the issues that are related to the recent blackouts, \nwhich caused electricity outages for 50 million people in this country.\n  As I mentioned before, there are several things in this bill I don't \nlike. As I reviewed this measure last weekend, I asked myself whether \nor not we would advance this country's interest if we passed this \nlegislation? I concluded that, yes, we would. But, we leave a lot \nbehind. There will be a lot left to do and to correct if we pass this \nlegislation, but, nevertheless, I concluded that deciding not to \nembrace the advancements in renewable and limitless supplies of energy \nwould be a mistake. Deciding not to embrace those reliability portions \nin the bill would be a mistake because we need them. Deciding not to \nhave the clean coal technology that will allow us to continue to use \ncoal without degrading our environment--it would be a mistake not to \nembrace that.\n  To decide not to embrace the efficiency standards in this bill for \nvirtually all of the appliances we use would be a mistake.\n  MTBE should not have been included and I tried hard to take it out. \nThere are other provisions in this legislation that I don't like and \nthey ought to be taken out as well. There are provisions that should be \nin the bill that are not there. The protections for consumers should \nhave been stronger. If we are going to repeal PUHCA, then we need \nstrong provisions protecting consumers. This falls short, in my \njudgment.\n  However, I believe, on balance, this legislation will advance our \ncountry's interests in energy production, and we need to produce more. \nAdditionally, I believe this legislation charts a new course that looks \nat a different kind of energy future, a future I strongly support. That \nfuture is hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cells. I have been working on \nthis initiative for a number of years, believing we cannot continue to \nrun gasoline through carburetors. We cannot continue, as we have for a \ncentury, to just stick liquid gasoline through the carburetors and \ndecide that is what our future is going to be. That is our past and we \nshould realize if we keep doing that, we lose.\n\n  When we began producing automobiles in this country a century ago, we \nput gasoline through the carburetor. Do you know what we do with a 2003 \ncar? We put gasoline through the carburetor.\n  The power from that gasoline is much less efficient than going to a \ndifferent kind of energy future, using hydrogen and fuel cells, which \nwould double the efficiency of getting power to the wheel. Hydrogen is \neverywhere. We can produce it, we can transport it, we can store it, \nand we can move toward a different future that will relieve us of our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  I believe strongly that the $2.15 billion in this bill for the \nhydrogen initiative should have been doubled. I fought like the dickens \non the floor of the Senate and elsewhere for an increase in this \nfunding. It did not happen. The fact is, a $2 billion start is not \ninsignificant.\n  The President proposed in his State of the Union Address something I \nhad already introduced in the Congress as legislation, which is that we \nmove toward hydrogen and fuel cells, as a new energy future. The reason \nit is important and the reason I support it is because the fastest \nrising part of our energy consumption is transportation. Why? Because \nwe have decided our automobile fleet has, is, and perhaps always will \nbe a fleet that has a carburetor through which you run gasoline. That \ndoesn't make any sense to me.\n  We need to make a decision at this point. Let's pole-vault over some \nof these issues and create a new type of energy future. Some \nenvironmental organizations said that when the President proposed this \ninitiative in his State of the Union he was just making an excuse not \nto deal with CAFE standards, and so forth.\n  I don't know what the motives are at the White House. I disagree with \nthe President on a lot of things. But I do know this: If we just keep \nthinking that 25 years from now, and 50 years from now, our kids, their \nkids, and their grandkids ought to be running gasoline through \ncarburetors, we lose. That is a philosophy of yesterday forever. I \ndon't believe it satisfies the interests and the needs of this country.\n  You cannot be a world economic power without addressing the issue of \nenergy. We use an enormous amount of energy. We need strong \nconservation standards, and, frankly, I looked at this bill skeptically \nlast Saturday morning because I worried that the efficiency standards \nwould not be there. But they were--almost the same standards we \nproduced as a Democratic committee when we controlled the Senate.\n  We need conservation and incentives for new production of fossil \nfuels in a way that protects our environment. We need strong incentives \nfor the use of renewables. But as important as those measures are, we \nalso need to think differently about the future. That is why the \nhydrogen title in this piece of legislation is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  My colleague from New Mexico is in the Chamber. He will not like the \nfact that when I started I said this process was an arrogant one. I \ntold him during the process, at a time when I was a conferee and was \nlocked out of the meetings, on the floor--and I don't care whether he \nlikes my saying this or not--``You would not accept that in a million \nyears. You would be shouting from the rooftops.''\n  Again, because my colleague wasn't in the Chamber, this process was \nawful. This process will not happen again because we will not allow \nconferees to be appointed--we simply won't allow that--until the \nprospective chairpersons from the House and Senate agree to have real \nconferences, where both parties are allowed to have substantive \ndiscussions on the pending legislation.\n  Having said all that, and being upset about the way this conference \nprocess worked, my main interest today is what is in this legislation \nfor the country. Does it advance this country's interests or does it \nretard them? Is this a huge giveaway that does nothing to address the \ncountry's energy interests? Is it just laden with pork? Is it \nworthless? Should we start over?\n  As I look at this bill in the four areas I talked about a year ago--\nproduction--production that is sensitive to the environment; \nconservation--conservation that is real; efficiency--efficiency that \nreally does address those products that we use every day in our lives \nand the standards by which we improve them and make them more \nefficient; and finally, limitless and renewable sources of energy--in \nevery one of those four categories, I think this legislation has \nprovisions that commend it for the future of this country.\n  I can think of probably a dozen areas that I want to strip out of \nthis bill, and I can think of a dozen provisions I want to put in this \nbill. I can't do that because this is a conference report, and also \nbecause I had limited opportunity to do it the other evening when we \nhad a bifurcated, abbreviated conference.\n  Having said all that, I don't think in this Chamber you ever give up. \nThe Renewable Portfolio Standard, that is coming. It was kept out of \nthis legislation in conference because some people had the clout to do \nthat, but it is going to happen. As sure as I stand at this desk in the \nSenate, I will demand and enough of my colleagues will demand, a \nrenewable portfolio standard by which we say to the electric utilities \nin this country that 10 percent of what you produce must come from \nrenewable energy. As sure as I am standing here, it is going to happen \nbecause we will make it happen. Not in this bill because it is a \nconference report and we cannot amend it.\n  The question is not what is left out or what is in. The question is, \nDoes this product in the aggregate promote this Nation's energy \ninterest as we move forward? Does it advance us or retard\n\n[[Page S15160]]\n\nus in terms of our desire to do something about energy? Although it is \na tough choice, I conclude the right choice is to adopt this conference \nreport.\n  I regret that I disagree with some of my colleagues. I am usually on \nthe floor fighting for the same interests for which they fight for. I \ndon't come to the floor to challenge their assertion that the MTBE \nprovisions shouldn't be in here. I happen to agree with them. I don't \nchallenge their assertion that there should be better consumer \nprotections. I agree with them. But I also hope they understand that \nwhen you take a look at a bill which has something that is historic in \nrenewable fuels and limitless fuels, limitless sources of energy--yes, \nethanol especially, but wind energy, solar, and so many other areas of \nrenewable energy--and when you have legislation that has real and \nsignificant standards of efficiency that represent significant \nconservation, and when you have legislation that incentivizes the \ncurrent production of fossil fuels in a way that allows us to continue \nto use them in a manner that is safe for our environment, such as the \naggressive use of clean coal technology, in my judgment--speaking only \nfor myself--that meets the standard of deciding whether or not this \nlegislation advances our country's interests.\n  Let us pass what is good and fix what is wrong. We have time to do \nthat as we move ahead in the coming years.\n  For all of those reasons, I choose to advance this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield before he yields the floor?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have on my right a diagram. I wish it \nwere bigger, but I think the Senator from North Dakota can see it.\n  The Senator spoke about midway through his speech about our growing \ndependence, and one of the dependencies he spoke of was natural gas. It \nis almost incredible--we should show the American people this diagram \nfor them to see what has been happening to their country--the red or \npink is the annual use of natural gas in our generating capacity for \nelectricity. If we look back to 1990, the pink is hardly a little \nsliver, and go out to 2003 and we see that almost the entire generating \ncapacity of the country is natural gas.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota has so eloquently stated this \nafternoon, it is clear we can't continue down that path. We have to do \nsomething about it.\n  First, I will take whatever criticism he has lodged today with \nreference to how the bill evolved. I guess it is pretty fair to say \nthat very few people get the luxury, privilege--or whatever it is--of \nhaving to write one from beginning to end and get it to the floor. I \nwas given that privilege this year. It could have been done a different \nway, some of which the Senator from North Dakota has suggested. For \nthat I thank him, and I hope we will do better if we have a chance \nagain.\n  I also think that his genuine interest in hydrogen as a fuel is not \ngoing to go unnoticed. He is right out there ahead of everybody, and he \nis right.\n  Some people stand up and tell us: Why don't you change the CAFE \nstandards and reduce dramatically the fuel use of each car that \nAmericans drive? I don't know how the Senator from North Dakota feels \nabout it, but I have been at it long enough to know that the Senate \nwill not do it and the House will not do it. The question is to find \nanother way to do it.\n  I think Senator Dorgan's notion of having to use another fuel is the \nappropriate one to be putting our resources, our energy, and our \nenthusiasm behind with our major researchers and our major companies. \nIf what we got in here is not sufficient, I will join Senator Dorgan as \nsoon as we can and try to put in more.\n  I would like to see what they do with some of the agreements that are \nadvocated for the use of this money and how we use our technology to \nheat up that hydrogen so it is usable. I am sure Senator Dorgan would \nlike to see that happen soon, too.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his words. Whether they be \nwords that agree with me or words that disagree, I think his conclusion \nis the one that a vast majority of Senators should make, that we should \nnot throw this package away. We should do it. I know one of his \ninterests is ethanol, and I don't say this just because it happens to \nbe a big interest of his, but there is no question that part of the \nbill that was hardest to get, and it took the longest and it made most \nof us frustrated was how do we get that maximum ethanol issue quantity \nthat he described today. It was nigh unto impossible to get the numbers \nout of the House and out of their writing committees, but we did. We do \nnot get any of these provisions, I regret to say, unilaterally, \nunscathed, with no commitments of any kind extracted. I am just hopeful \nthat the good outweighs the bad in terms of the compromises we made to \nget us there.\n  In my State and Senator Dorgan's State and adjoining States, there \nare thousands of people who see this bill a little differently than \nsome of those who don't care about ethanol. I heard a Senator say that \nwouldn't be part of a bill because he didn't think we even should do \nit, but I don't think that is the Senator's people. I don't think it is \nthe thousands of people represented by these letters of support.\n  Second, the Senator from North Dakota is absolutely right on \nrenewable resources. We are beginning to make a big show as Americans--\nsolar, wind is beginning to kick up its heels. We have a very powerful \ntax incentive in this bill. If this bill doesn't pass, it doesn't \nexist. If it doesn't exist, I don't know what happens to the fast start \nand the moving along of these technologies. I am not sure.\n  I have been told by the biggest manufacturers and those who sell this \nenergy that it will stop. Windmills will stop turning within 3 or 4 \nmonths because the tax credit will disappear. I don't want that to \nhappen, especially since we are making some very big headway.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say with respect to wind energy, if \nthe production tax credit isn't extended, the windmills will not stop \nturning. We have very efficient turbines, but the projects that are \nalready planned and ready to go simply will not happen. We won't have \nthe initial capacity for wind energy because without the production tax \ncredit, it will not exist.\n  Let me make this point. If energy policy is analogous to a novel, \nthen this is a chapter, and we might well decide this chapter ought to \nbe rejected. I come to the conclusion that it is a chapter that is \nprobably worthwhile and is a starting point. I want to at some point in \nthe future amend it, change it, and improve it, but the choice for us \nis: Do we do nothing and pray that we don't have further blackouts or \nfurther price spikes, or, God forbid, a terrorist interrupting the \nsupply of energy?\n  Or do we enact the proposed legislation and consider it the first \nbrick of a foundation by which we start to construct an energy policy \nthat provides the best of what both political parties has to offer? I \ncome down on the side of believing this ought to be advanced.\n  There are a series of things I have explained that I believe are \nimportant in this legislation, so I will make one final point. Earlier, \nmy colleague from Arizona talked about the cost of this bill. We have a \n$10 trillion to $11 trillion economy. This economy will only grow if it \nhas a supply of energy. If tomorrow, for some reason, our supply of \nforeign oil were shut off, this American economy would be lying flat on \nits back. Talk about consequences for jobs and devastating consequences \nto opportunities in this country. We have to think through all of this \nand plan ahead.\n  This legislation is not as comprehensive, as wise, or as bold as I \nhoped it would be, but it is a start. I go back to the issue of \nhydrogen. My colleague talked about natural gas. We are going to face \nnatural gas price spikes again this winter. We have serious supply \nproblems. We have significant problems in a range of energy sectors, in \nthe short and intermediary term with respect to supply and demand. I \nthink we should offer no apology for supporting increased efforts to \nproduce additional fossil fuels. We have to do that.\n\n[[Page S15161]]\n\n  This legislation has something very important in it dealing with \nclean coal technology, which I strongly support. So I again regret that \nI come to a different conclusion than some of my colleagues. I hope my \nconclusion is right. At this point, as I look at this country's needs \nand as I balance legislation that has some good features to it, some \ngood titles in it, with some things that should never have been put in \nit, as I balance all of that, I ask the question: Does this advance the \ncountry's energy interest? Do I believe on balance that it makes sense \nto proceed? The answer for me is yes, and that is why I intend to vote \nto support this conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to \nthe conference agreement on the Energy bill we are debating today.\n  Our Nation needs a balanced energy policy that will increase supply, \ndecrease demand, reduce our reliance on foreign oil, and protect our \nenvironment. Unfortunately, the Energy legislation before us fails to \nstrike this necessary balance. In fact, it would be poor energy policy, \npoor environmental policy, and poor fiscal policy. It favors special \ninterests, it contains billions of dollars in wasteful subsidies, and \nit fails to promote energy conservation. It would be bad for Maine's \nelectricity consumers, it would be bad for Maine's manufacturers, and \nit would be bad for Maine's environment.\n  I am very disappointed that the renewable energy provision that I \ncoauthored with Senator Bingaman was not included in the final version \nof this legislation. This provision would have required that 10 percent \nof our electricity come from clean, renewable energy sources by the \nyear 2020. A majority of the Senate conferees voted in favor of this \nproposal, but unfortunately the House voted to remove it, thus passing \nup an important opportunity to increase fuel diversity, decrease \nnatural gas prices, and reduce greenhouse gases.\n  This legislation would do very little to reduce our dangerous and \nincreasing reliance on foreign fuels. The United States is nearly 60 \npercent reliant on foreign oil, and this number is projected to \nincrease in the coming years, reaching as high as 70 or even 75 percent \nin the next decade to 15 years.\n  Senators Landrieu and Specter and I joined to offer an amendment to \nthe Senate Energy version that directed the President to devise a plan \nto save 1 million barrels of oil per day by the year 2013. We did not \ndictate how that should be done. It could be done by increasing fuel \nefficiency standards for our trucks and cars. It could be done by \nmoving toward more energy-efficient appliances. There are many ways \nthat goal could be accomplished.\n  Not surprisingly, our amendment enjoyed widespread support in the \nSenate. In fact, it passed by a vote of 99 to 1. Inexplicably, the \nconferees voted to drop that provision from the final bill.\n  This legislation also contains numerous wasteful and very expensive \nsubsidies, including a 5-billion-gallon ethanol mandate that will \nsubsidize corn production in the Midwest at the expense of higher gas \nprices in New England. Ethanol is more expensive than gasoline. It is \ndifficult to transport, it is of dubious value to the environment, and \nit does little to reduce our reliance on foreign fuels. In fact, \nstudies show that it takes about 4 gallons of oil to produce 5 gallons \nof ethanol. If the goal were to reduce reliance on foreign fuels, we \nwould be much better off increasing automobile fuel economy standards \nor mandating other achievable efficiency improvements.\n  The liability waiver for MTBE manufacturers also does not belong in \nthis bill. The gasoline additive MTBE is a suspected carcinogen and has \ncontaminated a number of ground water supplies in my home State of \nMaine, and I know it is also a problem in the home State of the \nPresiding Officer.\n  In 1998, for example, a ground water system serving 5,000 people and \noperated by the Portland Water District was contaminated by MTBE. This \nincident cost the Portland water district $1.5 million. The liability \nprovisions in this legislation will leave MTBE manufacturers with \nlittle incentive to help clean up contaminated water supplies. The \nlikely result will be that municipal ratepayers will have to shoulder a \nmajority of the cleanup costs.\n  The electricity title of this bill is particularly troubling to me \nbecause it is biased against the Northeast. Three months ago, the \nlargest blackout in our Nation's history illustrated the fundamental \nflaws in a haphazard and poorly regulated electricity market.\n  Just today, the General Accounting Office, at my request, released a \nnew report on electricity restructuring that analyzed the blackout and \nidentified what steps should be taken to ensure greater reliability of \nthe electric grid. Unfortunately, the recommendations that are in the \nGAO report fly in the face of what has been done in the legislation we \nare debating today.\n  Electricity regulators in the areas most affected by the blackout in \nthe Northeast and the Midwest have stated that the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, known as FERC, needs to move ahead with \nstandardized electricity markets in order to improve the reliability of \nour markets. Since electricity flows across power lines without regard \nto State boundaries, we need clear and consistent electricity rules \nthat apply to the entire Nation. Unfortunately, this legislation would \nactually prohibit FERC from moving ahead with standardized markets for \nanother 3 years. I am astounded by that.\n  Earlier this year, many of us representing States in both the \nNortheast and the Midwest wrote to the conferees to share our views on \nthe electricity issues that were being debated in the conference. We \nquoted our regulators on the impact of delaying these FERC rules. \nSpecifically, we stated:\n\n       Our States feel strongly that any delay of SMD [the \n     standard market design] hurts efforts to provide reasonably \n     priced and reliable electricity to consumers and businesses.\n\n      In fact, Ohio Governor Bob Taft, in testimony before the \nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee, stated that he believes that any \ndelay would ``impose an intolerable risk on the nation.''\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We urge you to reject proposals to further delay FERC's \n     ability to address issues which have a direct effect on the \n     cost and reliability of electricity, for millions of our \n     constituents.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letters we sent to the \nconferees be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in view of our urging the conferees to \nnot interfere with FERC going ahead with these commonsense and \nnecessary regulations, you can imagine my disappointment to discover \nthat this bill, in fact, delays these regulations by FERC for 3 years.\n  I am also very troubled by the subsidies for pollution control \nequipment for some of our Nation's dirtiest powerplants. Why should \ntaxpayers pay for pollution control technologies for 40-year-old coal-\nfired powerplants that were grandfathered under the Clean Air Act? \nRecently, when three advanced natural gas plants were built in Maine, \nthese plants installed state-of-the-art, advanced pollution control \ntechnologies without any subsidies, without being subsidized by the \nAmerican taxpayers. The cost of this technology was borne by \nelectricity consumers in the State of Maine and other States in the \nNortheast. The cost of electricity from the oldest coal-fired \npowerplants has long been subsidized through exemptions from the \npollution controls mandated by the Clean Air Act. To further this \nsubsidy by authorizing billions--billions--of taxpayer subsidies for \nthe dirtiest plants makes no sense at all, and it will have the effect \nof continuing to ensure a disparity in the price of electricity between \nregions in which pollution and other costs are subsidized and regions \nsuch as ours, in New England, which are not the beneficiary of these \nsubsidies. That is not fair. It is not fair to our taxpayers, and it is \nnot fair to our electricity consumers.\n  I am further disappointed by the inclusion of language in the \nelectricity title which will undercut the nationwide development of \nclean power generation. This language, which is known as the \nparticipant funding language, effectively negates the benefits of the \ncombined heat and power provisions that Senator Carper and I worked so\n\n[[Page S15162]]\n\nhard to include in this bill. The participant funding language actually \ncreates a disincentive for clean energy generation by allowing monopoly \nutilities to shift the costs of transmission upgrades onto clean power \ngeneration, such as combined heat and power--the cogeneration plants.\n  This provision is particularly harmful to our manufacturers, many of \nwhom use combined heat and power to generate products and jobs.\n  The last thing we need in this country is another disincentive for \nour manufacturers. In the Northeast in particular, manufacturers are \nalready struggling to cope with high electric rates. The last thing we \nshould be doing is shifting more of the costs on to them.\n  The legislation would also increase greenhouse gas emissions, waste \nnatural gas and other already scarce fuels, and harm air quality.\n\n  The bill's failure to address climate change is yet another \ndisappointment. It seems a near certainty that greenhouse gas emissions \nwill increase by hundreds of millions of tons under this legislation. \nYet the entire climate change title has been stripped from this bill. \nIf we are going to spend billions of dollars on oil and gas and coal \nprojects that will increase greenhouse gas emissions, then at least we \nshould determine whether such an increase in emissions could cause an \nabrupt and potentially dangerous change in our climate.\n  Unfortunately, the abrupt climate change provisions that I authored \nwere also omitted from the final version of the bill.\n  In summary, this bill does not offer the balanced energy policy that \nAmerica needs. It does not do enough to increase energy efficiency or \nrenewable energy. It does not promote conservation. It does not protect \nour environment. It does not give FERC adequate authority to provide \nreliable electricity markets. And it will not reduce our reliance on \nforeign oil.\n  I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of ending the debate on \nthis legislation, and I call on my colleagues to take a close look at \nthe provisions of this bill. I believe as they delve into this bill \nthey will realize that it is fundamentally flawed and should be \nrejected.\n  In doing so, we would save the taxpayers some $80 billion, and we \nwould signal our support for a more balanced energy policy for this \nNation.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman: We are \n     writing to urge you to continue our nation's efforts to move \n     toward competitive wholesale electricity markets that will \n     benefit consumers and businesses. National competitive \n     markets, where multiple buyers and sellers can negotiate \n     bargains and pass cost savings along to consumers, are the \n     best approach to the challenges facing the electricity \n     industry.\n       We would like to bring to your attention a number of issues \n     addressed in the electricity title of the Senate Energy Bill \n     (S. 14) that have implications for residents and businesses \n     in the Northeast-Midwest region.\n       Delay of Standard Market Design--S. 14 and the proposed \n     substitute amendment delays the implementation of the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) standard market design \n     until July 2005. Electricity markets have outgrown state \n     boundaries. We are writing to express our concern with the \n     proposed delay of standard market design and the provision to \n     make participation in regional transmission organizations \n     voluntary. The delay has serious implications for residents \n     and businesses in the Northeast-Midwest region and throughout \n     the nation.\n       A standard market design would streamline the wholesale \n     electricity industry, encourage transmission investments and \n     move the lower 48 states toward a more competitive \n     electricity market. Congested power lines, which are the \n     result of the current electricity system, cost customers and \n     businesses throughout the United States billions of dollars \n     each year, whereas competitive wholesale power markets could \n     deliver billions of dollars in economic benefits.\n       Schwab Capital Markets detailed the importance of \n     standardized markets to increasing investment in our nation's \n     transmission grid and electricity generation.\n       Testifying before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Air \n     Quality, Christine Tezak with Schwab states: ``We believe \n     that capital will be less expensive for all market \n     participants if FERC continues (and is permitted to continue) \n     its efforts to provide reasonably clear and consistent rules \n     for this business . . . Schwab WRG continues to view \n     continued efforts to move forward with the restructuring of \n     the electricity industry to be the best investment \n     environment for the widest variety of participants in the \n     electricity marketplace--whether they provide generation, \n     transmission, distribution or a combination of these \n     services--and most importantly, the most likely to provide \n     sustained long-term benefits to consumers.'' Further, Ms. \n     Tezak stated: ``Congress needs to decide whether or not it \n     still believes in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. Today, Congress \n     is becoming an increasing part of the reason capital is hard \n     to attract to this business. Congress is calling for FERC to \n     slow down, Wall Street is frustrated FERC won't move \n     faster.''\n       S. 14 makes participation of federal utilities in Regional \n     Transmission Organizations voluntary. Federal taxpayer \n     dollars were used to develop and maintain Federal power \n     marketing agencies such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and \n     Bonneville Power. The energy generated by these facilities \n     should benefit all Americans. TVA and Bonneville should be \n     required to participate in RTOs so communities throughout the \n     United States have access to the power generated at these \n     Federal facilities.\n       The Energy Bill must put national interest above the \n     interest of a few vertically-integrated utilities that want \n     to maintain regional monopolies. We encourage you to support \n     standardizing electricity markets and prevent further delay \n     of these efforts.\n       Participant Funding--S. 14 and the proposed substitute \n     amendment directs FERC to establish rules to ``ensure that \n     the costs of any transmission expansion interconnection be \n     allocated in such a way that all users of the affected \n     transmission system bear the appropriate share of costs.'' \n     The language requires FERC to fairly align the costs and \n     benefits of transmission upgrades, a judgment that can \n     include a consideration of relevant local factors. This is \n     not only the most equitable approach but also the one most \n     likely to ensure that transmission development will keep pace \n     with growing electricity demand.\n       Combined Heat and Power--S. 14 currently contains the \n     ``Carper-Collins'' language which keeps in place incentives \n     to operate combined heat and power facilities until true \n     competition exists in electricity markets. This language \n     retains, for a limited time, the provisions of the Public \n     Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) which require utilities \n     to provide back-up power and buy electricity from qualifying \n     combined heat and power facilities. As soon as competitive \n     electricity markets are established, these requirements are \n     repealed. Since combined heat and power saves energy, reduces \n     greenhouse gas emissions, increases energy independence, and \n     is good for the competitiveness of American manufacturing, we \n     urge you to retain such provisions.\n       We urge you to complete the work Congress started with the \n     Energy Policy Act of 1992 to provide reliable, low-cost \n     electricity to customers. Please stand strong against \n     pressure to reverse court on Congress' efforts to establish \n     better working, competitive markets, and to continue working \n     towards competitive electricity markets.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jack Reed, Olympia J.

Pete Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Energy Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Energy Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member: As the \n     Conference Committee on the Energy Policy Act of 2003 \n     continues its deliberations, we would like to bring to your \n     attention an issue of great concern to us.\n       We believe the Energy Bill must set forth a policy that \n     will complete the work that Congress started with the Energy \n     Policy Act of 1992. The vision of Congress and President \n     George H.W. Bush in 1992 was to transition our nation's \n     electricity industry to competitive wholesale power markets. \n     The vision of today's Congress should be to complete the \n     transition to competitive markets by allowing the Wholesale \n     Power Market Platform (WMP) of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (FERC) to move forward.\n       Wholesale power markets remain the best approach to \n     optimizing our country's energy resources by increasing \n     generation efficiencies, stimulating investment in new \n     technologies and infrastructure, providing greater choice in \n     energy sources, especially in renewable power, and passing \n     cost savings onto consumers. Wholesale power markets have \n     naturally grown into regional bodies, spanning multiple state \n     boundaries. The recent blackouts that impacted many of our \n     states clearly illustrate the regional nature of our \n     electricity grid. Events that occur in one state have impacts \n     in other states.\n       Moreover, while we respect the need for certain regional \n     variations among power market structures, we firmly believe \n     that any Energy Bill should not harm those regions of the \n     country that want to move forward with efforts to bring the \n     benefits of\n\n[[Page S15163]]\n\n     competitive power markets to consumers. Accordingly, we urge \n     the passing of an Energy bill that will appropriately reflect \n     the physical and business realities of the electricity \n     business by allowing the FERC to implement its WMP.\n       The FERC's Standard Market Design proposal and subsequent \n     Wholesale Power Market Platform are the logical and necessary \n     responses to the problems experienced by nascent regional \n     wholesale power markets. WMP seeks to standardize market \n     rules while adhering to regional variations and allows FERC \n     to oversee the process of Regional Transmission Organization \n     (RTO) formation and participation. The timely implementation \n     of WMP is critical in achieving the efficient, seamless, and \n     non-discriminatory wholesale power markets that will \n     optimize our nation's energy resources. Delay will only \n     serve to further injure much needed investment in \n     generation, transmission and demand response facilities \n     that are the foundation of our nation's economic well-\n     being.\n       The health of our state economies depends upon the free \n     flow of interstate commerce governed at the federal level to \n     ensure consistent, clear and fair laws over state lines. \n     Similarly, vibrant competitive power markets rely on the free \n     flow of electrons through state and regional boundaries. To \n     the extent there is a standard set of rules, states with \n     either competitive retail markets or vertically-integrated \n     utility service will benefit in terms of greater \n     efficiencies, greater reliability and reasonably priced \n     electricity that our homes and businesses need.\n       Furthermore, a delay in the implementation of the SMD \n     rulemaking will only serve to add uncertainty to potential \n     investments in our energy infrastructure and negate years of \n     progress made in the rulemaking process by the FERC, state \n     commissions and market participants alike. Consider the \n     testimony of Christine Tezak of Schwab Capital Markets before \n     the House Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality: ``Congress \n     needs to decide whether or not it still believes in the 1992 \n     Energy Policy Act. Today, Congress is becoming an increasing \n     part of the reason capital is hard to attract to this \n     business. Congress is calling FERC to slow down, Wall Street \n     is frustrated FERC won't move faster.''\n       Specifically, we believe that an energy conference report \n     should:\n       Support FERC's Efforts to Promote Competitive Wholesale \n     Markets--Our states feel strongly that any delay of SMD hurts \n     efforts to provide reasonably priced and reliable electricity \n     to consumers and businesses. In fact, Ohio Governor Bob Taft \n     in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee \n     stated that he believes that any delay would ``impose an \n     intolerable risk on the nation''. We urge you to reject \n     proposals to further delay FERC's ability to address issues \n     which have a direct effect on the cost and reliability of \n     electricity for millions of our constituents.\n       Promote Regional Transmission Organization (RTOs)--\n     Effective, well-functioning regional transmission \n     organizations and independent system operators are necessary \n     for the creation of well-designed, competitive regional \n     markets. The Electricity Title should not disrupt existing \n     regional markets nor stall their development in regions that \n     want to develop them. RTOs and ISOs are a key to effectively \n     managing the increasingly interstate flow of electricity and \n     are critical to the success of electricity restructuring. \n     Increased participation in RTOs will help address the \n     structural problems in our grid that created conditions for \n     the recent blackout. RTOs will help our nation improve our \n     ability to respond to problems in the grid by having an \n     effective regional ``traffic cop'' with a reliability mission \n     to manage any future incidents. They will also help improve \n     the climate for investment in transmission infrastructure to \n     enhance the reliability of the grid in the first place.\n       We urge you to complete the work Congress started with the \n     Energy Policy Act of 1992 to provide reliable, low-cost \n     electricity to consumers. Please stand strong to continue the \n     efforts of Congress to establish well-functioning, robustly \n     competitive wholesale power markets while creating a federal \n     policy that would bring much needed certainty to our nation's \n     energy sector.\n       Thank you for your consideration of these comments and we \n     look forward to working with you to ensure the Electricity \n     Title respects the difference among regions while moving \n     forward with efforts to bring the benefits of competitive \n     power markets to all American consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Rick Santorum, Jack Reed, Olympia J.

Lugar.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate. I \nhave come to some conclusions. First of all, one of the things the \nSenator from Maine said that I agree with is this bill does little to \nreduce our reliance upon foreign countries for our ability to run this \ngreat machine called America. I would like to have had more provisions \nin there. I would have liked to have had some more generous nuclear \ngeneration provisions, maybe ANWR, and a few things that would more \ndirectly address this. I am hoping we will be able to do this in the \nfuture.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, when he was talking about the bill, \nsaid there were several things in here that he didn't like, and many \nthings in here that he would have liked to have had in here. I feel the \nsame way. That is almost by definition the sign of a good bill because \nneither one of us is real happy with it. However, we both are going to \nsupport this bill.\n  I think we could have gone further. I have been concerned for many \nyears about our dependency, going all the way back to the Reagan \nadministration when Don Hodel, who was the Energy Secretary at that \ntime, and I used to go around the country to explain to people in \nconsumption States that our reliance upon foreign countries for our \nability to fight a war is not an energy issue but a national security \nissue.\n  Finally, this is the first approach. I have to say President Reagan \ndidn't really address this, the first President Bush didn't address it, \nPresident Clinton didn't address it. This President is addressing it. \nThis may not be perfect, certainly it is far from perfect, but it is \nthe first major step since 1980 to correct a problem we all agree is \nthere.\n  In deference to the time that we have here I am going to concentrate \non one thing. There are a lot of things I would like to talk about \nbecause I chair the Environment and Public Works Committee. There are a \nnumber of issues that are within my jurisdiction. I thank the manager \nof this bill, Senator Domenici, for his willingness to let me have \ninput even though I am not on the conference over some of these issues \nthat would have been in my committee.\n  My concern right now, and what I want to address, is the whole idea \nof the ethanol and MTBE safe harbor provisions. It has been treated as \na red herring. I would like to go over what it really is and what it is \nnot. What we have heard on the floor is good rhetoric from the trial \nlawyers, but it is not factual.\n  The premise of the ethanol and MTBE safe harbor is simple: If the \nFederal Government approves and mandates a product, such as it did with \nethanol and MTBE, that product should not be considered ``a defective \nproduct by virtue of the fact that it is, or contains, such a renewable \nfuel or MTBE.'' So let's walk through this and see what the safe harbor \nprovision does.\n  The ethanol and MTBE safe harbor states:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State \n     law, no renewable fuel, as defined by section 211(o)(1) of \n     the Clean Air Act . . . used or intended to be used as a \n     motor vehicle fuel containing such renewable fuel or MTBE, \n     shall be deemed a defective product by virtue of the fact \n     that it is, or contains, such renewable fuel or MTBE.\n\n  That stands to reason. That is perfectly legal. Yet that is the \nprovision to which most of these people are objecting. How can it be \nreasonable if we mandate something by law and then turn around and say \nit is defective by definition? It is just not reasonable.\n  We know that Congress is mandating renewable fuels in this conference \nreport. The energy bill states:\n\n       Not later than one year after the enactment of this \n     subsection, the Administrator [of the EPA] shall promulgate \n     regulations ensuring that motor vehicle fuel sold or \n     dispensed in the United States . . . contains the applicable \n     volume of renewable fuel. . . .\n\n  That is in essence the language of the legislation that we are \nconsidering today.\n  MTBE was also similarly mandated. The Clean Air Act Amendments of \n1990 signed into law by the first President Bush clearly states:\n\n     [t]he oxygen content of gasoline shall equal or exceed 2.0 \n     percent by weight. . . .\n  At that time, Congress knew the only two additives that could be used \nwere MTBE and ethanol. And the Record shows that.\n  For example, on March 29, 1990, Senator Tom Daschle, the author of \nthe floor amendment that established this 2-percent standard, stated \nduring debate:\n\n       The ethers, especially MTBE and ETBE, are expected to be \n     major components of meeting a clean octane program.\n\n\n[[Page S15164]]\n\n\n  Under certain forms of an oxygenate mandate, Senator Daschle went as \nfar as to note that:\n\n       EPA predicts that the amendment will be met almost \n     exclusively by MTBE, a methanol derivative.\n\n  Senator Daschle recognized what we all know: There are substantial \nbenefits to using MTBE as far as environmental protection is concerned. \nIn the floor debate on the 2-percent standard, Senator Daschle cited \nevidence that:\n\n       NOX, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide are \n     dramatically reduced by adding the oxygenate MTBE to \n     gasoline.\n\n  So it is clear that Congress mandated ethanol and MTBE in 1990, and, \nin this conference report, is increasing the mandate on ethanol.\n  Let me go on reading the ethanol and MTBE safe harbor. The safe \nharbor applies only:\n\n       If it [ethanol or MTBE] does not violate a control or \n     prohibition imposed by the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency under section 211 of such Act, and the \n     manufacturer is in compliance with all requests for \n     information under subsection (b) of such section 211 of such \n     Act.\n\n  So the safe harbor in this conference report applies only if you are \nin compliance with all the tough fuel requirements of the Clean Air \nAct.\n  So to review so far, if ethanol or MTBE is used as required by the \nFederal Government and is in full compliance of the Clean Air Act, it \nshould not be found defective. Alternatively, if a party does not meet \nthe requirements of the Clean Air Act, the safe harbor does not apply, \nstating that:\n\n     the existence of a claim of defective product shall be \n     determined under otherwise applicable law.\n\n  It can still be exercised if they don't comply.\n  Most importantly, the safe harbor does not impact numerous legal \nmechanisms available for cleanup and damages. Specifically, the safe \nharbor states that:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect the \n     liability of any person for environmental remediation costs, \n     drinking water contamination, negligence for spills or other \n     reasonably foreseeable events, public or private nuisance, \n     trespass, breach of warranty, breach of contract, or any \n     other liability other than liability based upon a claim of \n     defective product.\n\n  In all those other cases, it remains unchanged. The safe harbor does \nnot apply to anything except liability based upon a claim of defective \nproduct, assuming they have complied with the Clean Air Act. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  As the energy conference report clearly states, the safe harbor does \nnot affect liability under other tort theories. Tort law provides a \nremedy when there is a breach of a duty resulting in harm to a person, \nproperty, or intangible personal interests. The following types of \nactions have been used in environmental cases. These are actions where \nrecovery took place:\n  Trespass--interference with the plaintiff's possessory interest in \nhis land. Is that affected by safe harbor? No.\n  Nuisance--intereference with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment of his \nproperty--that is not affected by safe harbor.\n  Negligence--may be a basis for product liability actions, as well as \nactions involving the release of allegedly toxic materials. negligence \ncould be based on the design of manufacture of the product, or failure \nto give warnings necessary to make the product safe. Is this affected \nby safe harbor? No. It is not affected.\n  Breach of implied warranty--similar to strict products-liability--is \nnot affected by safe harbor.\n  Under breach of express warranty--if a manufacturer, distributor, or \nretailer makes express promises regarding a product, the party is \nliable if the product fails to perform as promised and that failure \nleads to injury. It is not affected by safe harbor.\n  The only thing that is affected is in the areas we have been \ndiscussing.\n  Moreover, this safe harbor in no way shape or form impacts any \nenvironmental law. The safe harbor provision would not affect \nliability, and therefore response, remediation and clean-up, under \nFederal and State laws. The facts of a given situation would dictate \nwhich of the following statutes would be most appropriate for an \naction. Here are examples of environmental laws that could apply. The \nfollowing are not impacted: The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, \nRCRA; Clean Water Act; Oil Pollution Act--OPA; Comprehensive \nEnvironmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act--CERCLA or \nSuperfund; not to mention natural resource damages available under OPA, \nCERCLA, and the Clean Water Act. They are not impacted.\n  Furthermore, the leaking underground storage tanks provision in this \nenergy conference report greatly enhances the amount of resources \navailable to states and localities through the underground storage \nfunds.\n  If the language and the impact are so clear, why is the debate so \nmuddy? The answer is because trial lawyers stand to lose billions.\n  What is the positive affect of this safe harbor?\n  Liability protection is consistent with environmental protection. \nWithout some stability in liability risk, powerful disincentives will \nbe created to continued manufacturing of clean-fuel additives. Why \nshould we manufacture clean fuel additives if there is no protection? \nClean fuel programs have saved thousands of lives across the country. \nOpposition to commonsense legislation may endanger those most \nsusceptible to air pollution impacts by reducing the ready supply of \nclean fuel additives.\n  Failure to limit liability endangers future energy security and clean \nair. Simply put, additive manufacturers will be extremely reluctant to \ninvest in MTBE replacement additives without some sense of certainty \nthat the Federal Government will not allow those investments to become \nthe basis of undue liability. In other words, as additive manufacturers \nseek access to capital, demonstrating a responsible Federal role in \nliability limitation may be crucial to justify future investments in \nclean additive manufacturing. It is simply a supply and demand \nargument.\n  In conclusion, I ask my colleagues to look at the facts. The fact is \nthat the safe harbor is a fair and important provision in an important \npiece of legislation, which is critical to our national and economic \nsecurity.\n  The safe harbor only applies to defective products claims.\n  I believe very strongly we need to have that clarification.\n  I repeat one more time what is actually written into the law. It says \nif the Federal Government approves and mandates a product such as \nethanol or MTBE, that product should not be considered a defective \nproduct by virtue of the fact that it is or contains such renewable \nfuel or MTBE which is mandated by law. I appreciate the opportunity to \nclarify that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express a profound sense of \ndisappointment. The Nation needs an energy bill. We need a \ncomprehensive blueprint for an energy policy that will take us in new \ndirections, away from dependence on declining reserves of fossil fuel \nand foreign sources of oil. We need a policy which will reconcile \ngrowth and energy conservation in our transportation, manufacturing, \nutility, and consumer sectors across the nation. We need to bring down \nthe high costs of electricity and gasoline for the country, \nparticularly in my state of Hawaii, and pursue greater energy \nindependence from petroleum products. The conference report does not \nmake these goals achievable.\n\n  I believe a comprehensive energy bill is possible. As a senior member \nof the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I am familiar \nwith cutting-edge technologies and approaches to generating energy. I \nwas closely involved in crafting the energy bill that we considered \nearlier this year under Senator Domenici's leadership. I also \ncontributed heavily to the energy bill that passed the Senate under \nDemocratic leadership last year.\n  I wish to thank the senior Senator from New Mexico for his \npersistence in drafting this energy bill under extremely difficult \ncircumstances. The energy policies that we are addressing in this \nlegislation cover a vast range of authorities and a patchwork of unruly \nregional alliances. This translates to an enormous challenge, and I \nappreciate Senator Domenici's hard work in the face of this intractable \nsituation. I want to make it clear that I have not given up on the \nopportunity to have an energy bill and I will continue to work\n\n[[Page S15165]]\n\nwith my colleagues to shape an energy bill for the continental United \nStates as well as for Hawaii and Alaska, which often have special \nenergy needs.\n  Unfortunately, the report that has emerged from the conference \ncommittee does not bear much resemblance to either of the two earlier \nbills, this year or last year, that had bipartisan support. I rise \ntoday to express my disappointment with the outcome of the conference \nreport for several reasons.\n  I am particularly concerned about Title VIII, the hydrogen title. \nDuring the Committee's consideration of S. 14 earlier this year, the \nhydrogen title authorizing research and development, demonstration \nprojects, and buy-back and fleet provisions was carefully worked out by \na bipartisan group of Senators on the Committee. Even though my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, is not on the Committee, he \ncontributed mightily. The hydrogen title was based on the Spark \nMatsunaga Hydrogen R Act, which has been the basic authority for \nfederal hydrogen programs for the last 20 years. I introduced a bill to \nreauthorize the Matsunaga Act earlier this year, along with Senators \nDomenici, Bingaman, Bayh, Lieberman, Kyl, Reid, and Inouye. I continue \nto believe that the Matsunaga Act's basic focus on renewable R for \nthe production of hydrogen is a critical component of a national \nhydrogen R program. I greatly appreciate the vision of Senator \nDomenici, who led the effort earlier this year to craft the hydrogen \ntitle in S. 14, along with myself and Senators Bingaman, Dorgan, \nAlexander, Wyden, Schumer, and Harkin who dedicated time and energy to \nthe bipartisan compromise. Title VIII was agreed to unanimously in the \nCommittee in markup.\n  Title VIII, as it was crafted earlier this year, contained a robust \nauthorization of hydrogen research, development, and demonstration \nprojects to lead us into the hydrogen future. The title was later \nsuccessfully amended on the floor during debate on S. 14, led by my \ngood friend and colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. Senator \nDorgan offered an amendment, which I cosponsored, to include important \nmeasurable goals and timelines for the commercial introduction of \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicles.\n  The federal government should be a leader in introducing hydrogen to \nthe federal fleet of cars, trucks, and vans that are used to accomplish \nour government's business. Not many people realize it, but the federal \ngovernment has a fleet of about half a million transportation units \nthat, as a by-product of using fossil fuels, emit nitrogen oxides, \nozone, and other pollutants. The original hydrogen title sought to \nusher in a transition to a fuel cell fleet.\n  The revised hydrogen title in the conference report eliminates key \nfederal purchase requirements for vehicle fleets, stationary power, and \nhydrogen fueling infrastructure. It provides only the vaguest guidance \nto the Secretary of Energy of voluntary projects to shape demonstration \nprograms.\n  Why are we going to spend $1.4 billion over six years on the \nproduction of hydrogen energy by way of a demonstration project using \nnuclear energy to produce hydrogen? We cannot decide what to do with \nour nuclear waste as it is now. Why are we going to produce waste by \nusing nuclear material to produce hydrogen? We need to explore the \nproduction of hydrogen using renewable resources, and we need to spend \na great deal more on it than this conference report provides. Hydrogen \nmay fuel the economy of the future, but we must take action now to \nensure that it comes from renewable sources for those parts of the \ncountry that will not or cannot host nuclear facilities.\n  The new hydrogen title, authorizes less funding through 2008 than we \nagreed on in the Senate earlier this year. It eliminates key \ndemonstration programs and federal purchase requirements that I believe \nare critical to ensuring a hydrogen future. Mr. President, the hydrogen \ntitle is a pale ghost of what it was when it left the Senate on July \n31st of this year.\n  This bill has some hopeful features. It provides tax incentives for \nwind, solar, and geothermal energy--but not enough. It encourages \nenergy efficiency in household appliances and homebuilding. I am \npleased that the report contains provisions that I specifically \nrequested for energy studies in Hawaii and insular areas, and for non-\ncontiguous areas to opt-in to the ethanol trading system. I thank \nSenator Domenici and Senator Bingaman for their assistance on these \nprovisions, which take into account the unique energy situation faced \nby more remote states and territories. I also am pleased that Senator \nDomenici has included provisions of a bill I introduced earlier this \nyear, S. 1045, to designate an office in the Department of Energy and a \nprocess within the Department for safely disposing of Greater-Than-\nClass C, GTCC, radioactive waste. According to a General Accounting \nOffice study that I requested on this topic, we need a stronger plan \nfor continued recovery and storage of GTCC waste until a permanent \ndisposal facility is available.\n  The conference report has some objectionable features. It provides \nwaivers for manufacturers of MTBE, thus leaving it to counties and \ncities to pay for the cleanup of groundwater contamination. There must \nbe a better solution than that. We cannot leave the burden of cleaning \nup drinking water contaminated by gasoline additives to local \ncommunities.\n  The conference report also has objectional omissions. It does not \ninclude fuel economy standards which significantly increase the fuel \nefficiency of automobiles--a vital component of a comprehensive energy \npolicy. The American people want to spend less money on gasoline, be \nless dependent on foreign supplies of oil, seriously address the issue \nof climate change, and breathe cleaner air. Strong fuel economy \nstandards address these needs. The conference report fails to address \nthe accumulation of greenhouse gases, which I have spoken about several \ntimes on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed in the conference report. It will \nnot open the door for radically new energy futures such as hydrogen or \neven liquefied natural gas. It will not alleviate the high prices of \nenergy in the Nation. And it will not reduce our dependency on foreign \noil.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nthrough the Chair, how long does the Senator wish to speak? There are \nother Senators who wish to speak. There is no rush. I want to know when \nthey should come over.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Approximately 15 minutes.\n  Madam President, I join my colleagues on the floor to make relatively \nbrief remarks about this very important energy bill.\n  As a member of the Energy Committee that has worked very hard to \nproduce this bill, and as confident as I am that a majority of the \npeople in Louisiana want us to produce a good and balanced bill, I want \nto stand to support the bill that is before us and to urge our \ncolleagues to vote yes on this measure. I commend the chairman from New \nMexico and the ranking member from New Mexico on the Senate side and \nthe chairman and the ranking member on the House side for producing a \nbill that is truly the best bill this Congress can produce.\n  Is it a perfect bill? Absolutely not. Does it leave some very \nimportant sections out that many of us would like to see? Absolutely \nyes. Does it address every regional concern? No. And no national bill, \nno bill that comes out of this Congress, would ever be able to make \neach region perfectly happy because energy, of all issues, is not \nreally a Democrat or Republican issue. It really is based on the \nregions of the country from which we all come.\n  Some regions consume a great deal more energy than they produce. Some \nregions and states, like Louisiana, are a net exporters of energy. We \nare proud of that fact. We get beat up a lot about it from people who \ndo not necessarily understand the oil and gas industry, but we are \nproud to drill in environmentally sensitive ways for oil and gas and \nproud that we contribute so much to nations energy supply.\n  So we will never have a bill that is going to satisfy the regional \nand parochial interests of every Member. I am convinced, having worked \non this Energy bill, or something like it, for the\n\n[[Page S15166]]\n\n7 years I have been in the Senate, that this is the best bill this \nCongress can put forward.\n  The second point is, after we pass this bill--and I am confident we \nwill pass and the President will sign it, there is nothing that \nprevents us, either individually or as a Congress, from stepping \nforward in the next few months or years to make improvements and \nadjustments to the bill. We can continue to push for policies that \nincrease our supply, increase new and renewable fuels, improve our \nconservation, and make this Nation more energy self-sufficient.\n  But we have not had an Energy bill since 1992. In that bill, Congress \nrevolutionized wholesale electricity markets, encouraged renewable \nenergy production through tax incentives and streamlined and reformed \nthe licensing for nuclear facilities.\n  In this bill, one of the things I am proudest of, working with \nSenator Domenici, is to improve, increase and facilitate the \nconstruction and licensing of new nuclear facilities because I believe \nit is time for the United States to have a renaissance in its nuclear \nindustry, so we can increase the supply of energy and drive down prices \nfor all of our consumers, whether they be residential, industrial, or \ncommercial.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the United States cannot \nrecognize the importance of nuclear energy as a component of our energy \npolicy. Many developed countries, such as France, have realized the new \nand exciting technologies in this area that make nuclear safe, clean, \nand reliable. In France, approximately 80 percent of all their \nelectricity consumption is produced by nuclear power.\n  I am also very proud of the fact that we have, for the first time, \nrecognized the tremendous contribution that Louisiana and Texas and, to \na certain degree, Mississippi and Alabama make in producing oil and gas \noff of our shores.\n  We have sent to the Federal Government billions and billions of \ndollars of tax revenues. We have produced many jobs. We are doing our \npart in Louisiana to make our Nation energy self-sufficient, and we are \nproud of it because we think for every hour we work, every month we \ncontribute, every year we send money, we put our troops less at risk \nhaving to defend America's interests for oil and gas and energy \nsupplies around the world. It is something that people in Louisiana are \nvery proud of.\n\n  The fact is, there is something for all of us to gain from this \ncompromise bill. We need to move forward on this bill, in my opinion.\n  No. 1, it increases our domestic production of energy and, therefore, \nlowers the prices for everyone. It is hard to estimate what the \nlowering of the prices will be, but this bill addresses that concern \nand make steps towards providing a variety of energy sources.\n  Second, it creates new jobs. So for everyone who is concerned, it \nlowers unemployment. There is not a Senator in this Chamber who is not \nconcerned about increasing employment rolls and lowering unemployment \nrolls. This bill, by creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, will, in \nessence, do that.\n  We also take steps to conserve, not as many steps as this Senator \nwould have liked to take. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nHawaii and others, including Senator Dorgan, who spoke about the missed \nopportunities in this bill. They encouraged us to really step up for \nconservation measures and I agree. The Presiding Officer made some very \nappropriate and, I thought, discerning remarks about our missed \nopportunities for conservation. We have missed some opportunities, but \nthere are still, in this bill, some very excellent conservation and \nresearch and development initiatives to be proud of.\n  I might remind the Democratic caucus, our No. 1 objective--not my No. \n1 objective but the No. 1 objective of our Democratic caucus--was not \nto drill in ANWR. There is no drilling of ANWR in this bill. Other \nDemocrats objected to more drilling off the coast of Florida. There is \nno more drilling off the coast of Florida in this bill. There were \nDemocrats who objected to drilling in the Great Lakes. There is no \ndrilling in the Great Lakes. So for those who wanted not only energy \nconservation but, in their view, environmental protections, this bill \nrepresents that compromise.\n  Let me say a word about natural gas because it is very important to \nLouisiana. Demand is exceeding supply and prices have been abnormally \nhigh for the better part of this year. The growing gap between demand \nand supply has been apparent for some time. Presently our demand is 22 \ntrillion cubic feet annually. The Energy Information Administration \nprojects that the demand will increase by over 50 percent by the year \n2025. There is a naturally occurring abundance of natural gas. If we \ndon't do something about producing more of this precious resource the \ngap between what we need and what we consume is only going to grow. We \nmust act now. If we don't, the problem will continue to drive up prices \nand make our industries noncompetitive with industries in Europe and \nAsia, Africa, and other parts of the world. Natural gas is at the heart \nof helping this Nation to secure and stabilize its employment sector.\n  In the short term, we provide royalty relief for ultra deep gas \nwells, something I worked on. I am proud that is in this bill. In the \nlong term, the bill provides for the construction of a natural gas \npipeline--a great deal of controversy. The bottom line is this pipeline \ncould bring 65 trillion cubic feet into the market over the next 10 or \n20 years. It is gas we need, gas we are going to use, and gas that will \nlower prices.\n  In addition to all of that, it is going to put several hundred \nthousand people to work. Whether you are in Alaska or other States, a \nlot of people could use jobs right now. This is a jobs bill.\n  Let me say a word about coal. We don't produce a lot of coal in \nLouisiana, but there are some States that do. I guess I have a great \ndeal of sympathy for States that, like Louisiana, utilize their natural \nresources. West Virginia and Pennsylvania are natural resource-based \nStates. Why shouldn't the people of those States get to use the natural \nresources they have to create jobs and to do it in a way that helps \nkeep the environment clean?\n  We have some clean coal technology in this bill. It might not be \nperfect, but what is the alternative? Shut down all the coal mining in \nthe country, put thousands of people out of work, and drive up energy \nprices? Let's use the technology and encourage the development of even \nbetter technology. We have over 250 years of coal reserves in this \nNation. The people of our Nation deserve to use those reserves \nresponsibly to their benefit.\n  I am proud that this bill includes some important renewable fuel \nstandards. In addition to some of the other issues that have been \ndiscussed in this bill, we promote wind power. That is very exciting. \nYou wouldn't imagine, though, that we are going to have some of the \nsame interesting debates we have had over oil and gas production; that \nis, ``not in my backyard.'' I want the energy, but I don't want to see \nthe rigs.\n  I was quite amused by the fight that went on in Massachusetts or off \nthe east coast about where we are going to put the windmills. People \nwant wind power, but they don't want the windmills that produce the \npower. Unless our technology can put windmills underground and have the \nwind go underground, I don't know how we can avoid the aesthetics \nissue.\n  Since I am used to seeing oil rigs, I kind of like the way they look \nand most certainly enjoy fishing around them because they make \nexcellent places to fish that we in Louisiana have understood now for \nquite some time. I am encouraging wind power and hope we won't have the \nsame ``not in my backyard'' attitude that we have had about other ways \nto produce energy. Certainly, wind is a very interesting source of \npower and evidently something that we will never run out of. It is an \nendless supply.\n\n  We are encouraging wind power in this bill and solar energy which is \nquite exciting. I happened to visit some of the most outstanding solar \ninstitutes in the world, one of my last visits to Israel several years \nago. I was very encouraged by the technology that is ready to come on \nthe market with the right kind of encouragement and incentives. Many of \nthese are in this bill. We can create new building materials that can \nlead the way to the 21st century.\n  This bill includes $300 hundred million for solar programs, several \nhundreds of millions of dollars for wind\n\n[[Page S15167]]\n\nand energy production, and $500 million in grants for biomass programs. \nBiomass is another example of a new and exciting technology which takes \nother materials to create energy. It serves to move us to a more \ndiverse portfolio of supply to produce the energy we need for our \nNation.\n  Another important part of this bill is the increased authorization \nfor the Low Income Heating Assistance Program. Being from Louisiana, a \nState that is hot most of the year, and that we have had a hard time \nexplaining to people that you can die from heat as well as die from \ncold, we have not been able to get the low-income housing assistance \nprogram directed to Southern States. This bill accomplishes that. For \nSouthern States, this is very important to help our people who pay high \nenergy bills and need the air-conditioning, not for comfort but \nliterally to keep them from dying or expiring in some of the hottest \nand most humid weather. We are very happy that this increased \nauthorization is in this bill.\n  Finally, I know the chairman from New Mexico and the ranking member \nwill work with us to put some real teeth in the freedom car proposal \nthat the President has launched and I support. It is not strong enough \nin this bill, but, as I said, nothing will stop us from coming back and \nputting real time frames and real measures of success.\n  Mandates for hydrogen fuel cells in our Federal fleet could be added \nto this bill. But our clean schoolbus technology, some other things \nthat are in this bill, make it, on balance, a very fine bill and one \nthat this country needs.\n  Again, this is not a Democrat or a Republican bill. It is really a \nbill in which regional interests are at stake. But from the perspective \nof Louisiana and particularly in the South, places that produce a lot \nof energy, this bill gives us relief. It gives us hope that natural gas \nprices can be reduced. It produces jobs, and it helps us lower the \nunemployment rate as well as makes our country more energy self-\nsufficient.\n  For all of those reasons, I will give my vote and support to the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized for 20 minutes.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we are debating at the moment the Energy \nbill, but there is another major initiative that we are all \nconsidering. That is the Medicare bill. I would like for a moment to \nspeak about the Medicare bill.\n  We have a history. For 38 years, Medicare has been a central part of \nthe life of America, not just seniors in America but every American \nfamily. Now we are being asked to consider, in the waning days of this \nsession, fundamental changes not just to the addition of a pharmacy \nbenefit for seniors but fundamental changes to the structure of the \nMedicare Program. We are being asked to do so in the waning hours of \nthis session of Congress.\n  What we have seen from the situation in the committee is that it was \na period of negotiation between very few people, producing fundamental \nchanges for our Medicare system. It is important, I believe, to look at \nsome of the changes today.\n  Much of the discussion that has taken place in the conference with \nrespect to this proposal has not really been how best to use the $400 \nbillion for pharmacy benefits for seniors but, rather, to make profound \nchanges in Medicare, which I believe undermine, in the long run, the \nMedicare Program.\n  One could suggest that the original $400 billion budget allocation \nfor pharmaceutical benefits for seniors was too meager. But we could \nhave addressed at least how to make that money go as far as we could \nrather than simply using it as, I believe, a subterfuge in some \nrespects to make changes to Medicare that have been promoted by many--\nparticularly conservatives--for years previously.\n  The purpose of S. 1 and H.R. 1 was supposedly to craft a \npharmaceutical benefit. Indeed, what happened is much more profound and \nmore pervasive and indeed will go to undermine our Medicare Program, \nnot strengthen it. I have serious reservations.\n  We all recognize that seniors need relief. Again, the $400 billion \nwas a small part of the relief they need. It has been estimated by CBO \nthat seniors will spend a total of $1.8 trillion on pharmaceuticals \nfrom 2003 to 2012, the 10-year period this bill will likely cover. The \n$400 billion, in context, is just a fraction of what seniors will pay. \nNevertheless, we could have provided, I believe, much more focused, \ntargeted, and beneficial relief to seniors than has been accomplished \nby this bill. More than that, we could have avoided these very serious \nand deleterious changes being proposed for Medicare.\n  Let me address a few issues. There is an issue in the bill that has \nbeen discussed, which is cost containment. It represents sort of a \ndoublespeak, if you will. I believe if you asked most of my seniors \nabout cost containment, they would say, hallelujah, finally, you are \ngoing to bring down the cost of the pharmaceutical drugs.\n  Wrong. In the language of this bill, cost containment is limiting the \namount of money the Federal Government will contribute to the Medicare \nProgram--not just pharmaceuticals but to the Medicare Program. In fact, \nif you look at what they have done with respect to the cost of \npharmaceuticals they have made it very difficult for the Federal \nGovernment, through the Medicare Program, to negotiate lower prices.\n  Once again, if you asked any senior in this country, or any American, \nabout cost containment, in the context of pharmaceutical drugs, they \nwould say it has to be the reduction in the costs charged to seniors, \nnot a reduction of the contribution this Government will make for \nseniors. It has turned the whole notion of containment upside down, \ntopsy-turvy. Again, it will go a long way not to help seniors but to \ncontinue the unchecked increases in pharmaceutical costs we have seen.\n  There are reasons for this. Frankly, everyone has to recognize that \nrevolutions in pharmaceuticals have provided a higher quality of health \ncare in the United States. But my expectation, and my hope, was that if \nwe were talking seriously about a Medicare benefit for seniors with \nrespect to pharmaceuticals, we would have been able to use the market \npower of a nationwide Medicare Program to control prices--not set them \nbut control them through the marketplace.\n\n  A large number of beneficiaries, purchasers, could go to \npharmaceutical companies, through the Medicare system, and negotiate \nprices, which represents the buying power of millions of seniors. That \nis not going to happen because, quite deliberately and consciously, \nthis program fragments seniors; it creates regions where certain \nprograms will vie for the business of seniors through the Medicare \nsystem. That is not going to control costs. Yet we are talking about \ncost containment, not in that context at all but in the notion of just \nlimiting the contribution we will make.\n  Again, I think what we have to recognize is that this is not going to \nbe the way to deal with the crisis we face today and the crisis of the \nyears ahead.\n  There is a provision in the legislation which essentially says that \nas the Medicaid Program exceeds 45 percent of the general fund \ncontribution--our contribution to Medicare exceeds 45 percent of total \nprogram expenditures, and then the President must submit a plan to \nCongress, and there is pressure for Congress to move. But that is a \nrather arbitrary and artificial way to approach the cost of Medicare.\n  First of all, it doesn't consider the number of beneficiaries. It \ndoesn't consider other factors, such as quality issues. It is an \narbitrary device which I think will not control the real costs, which \nis the cost of drugs, but it will really inhibit and hamper our ability \nto serve our seniors. Again, this is one aspect of the legislation that \nI find particularly troublesome.\n  There is another doublespeak, and that doublespeak is premium \nsupport. Again, if you asked any senior in Rhode Island, Michigan, or \nMaine about premium support, they would say: Hallelujah, you are going \nto help me pay my premium; I have been waiting for that. That is not \nthe case. It is helping the private insurance companies by assisting \nthem not only in their operating expenses but with their bottom line in \nthe process. That is not what most people thought about when we talked \nabout premium support.\n\n[[Page S15168]]\n\n  It will provide wide variations of premiums throughout the country, \nState by State, and even within States, region by region. Essentially, \nit will also encourage cherry-picking, a term we are all familiar with, \nin which these private companies that are being encouraged to now go \nafter the seniors' business will be able to structure their marketing \nand their appeals to take the healthiest, younger seniors, leaving the \nolder seniors--the most vulnerable and most expensive--to be covered in \nthe Federal program. This will be great for their bottom line, but it \nwill drive the cost of traditional Medicare up and up, and it will run \nright back into the cost containment trap we set up.\n  Medicare will be less ``efficient'' than private plans. Therefore, it \nwill be subject to increased Federal pressure to lower the cost. All of \nthis violates a fundamental principle of insurance, which is that you \npool risk by aggregating a range of risk. You don't segregate the \nhealthiest people and say we will ensure just those--well, if you are a \nprofitable private insurance company, you do. But if you are trying to \nplan for a national program to assist seniors, you certainly don't do \nthat.\n  It also defies the fundamental facts of history. In 1965, when the \nMedicare Program was created, seniors could not get health insurance \nbecause they were expensive to insure. They were a bad risk. No private \ninsurance company would step up in any systematic way to insure them--\nunless you were phenomenally wealthy and you could probably pay for all \nof your medical care out of your wealth. For the average senior, in \n1961, 1962 and 1963, you were not getting private insurance. That is \nwhy we stepped in. That hasn't changed.\n\n  Seniors today are still, on average, much more expensive to insure \nthan younger people because of the nature of life and nature of disease \nand morbidity--all of this. This legislative proposal totally ignores \nthat 35 years of history and the experience we all have.\n  Again, going back to our experience, it was not uncommon when I was a \nyoungster, teenager or younger, to visit homes of my friends and there \nwas at least one grandparent there--a grandmother or grandfather. Why? \nBecause their health needs required somebody to care for them. It was \nthe families, the 40-year-olds, 35-year-olds. Much of that changed in \n1965 because now seniors had the ability to obtain health care \ncoverage.\n  This whole system is being threatened by premium support, which will \nincentivize private insurers to come in and attract and subscribe the \nyoungest healthiest seniors, leaving the traditional Medicare Program \nwith the older, most expensive population to cover; and, again, all of \nthis is leading into that trap in which cost containment will tell the \nFederal Government, oh, stop, we are paying too much money for seniors.\n  I believe this is, again, a profoundly poor concept, and it is \nfurther complicated and exacerbated by another aspect. We are creating \na $12 billion stabilization fund, again, for private insurers. We are \ntaking Medicare money, the money which our seniors--in fact, all \nAmericans believe we are earmarking for senior health care and setting \nup a fund--a slush fund--that will provide further incentives to \nprivate health care purveyors and further unbalance the playing field \nbetween traditional Medicare and these new private plans.\n  We could have done much with this stabilization fund. We could have \nlowered the so-called donut hole when benefits expire for some seniors \nand then renew themselves after several thousand dollars of additional \nexpenses. We could have closed that gap. We could have done a lot of \ncreative, innovative things that not only would have assisted seniors \nbut would also make a real concerted effort to control the cost of the \nprogram in a principled way. Yet we didn't do that.\n  We have created a situation in which, again, the deck has been \nstacked against traditional Medicare and against, I believe, the logic \nof insurance of aggregating as many risks as possible across regions, \nacross the country, across ages from the youngest seniors to the oldest \nseniors, the healthiest seniors to the ones who are sick and frail.\n  We are also going to hit and create a situation where we will give \nincentives to these companies to fragment the Medicare system. Frankly, \nif insuring seniors was a profitable area of endeavor, 35 years ago we \nwouldn't have had to step in and create Medicare. If it was a \nprofitable endeavor today, we wouldn't have to have a $12 billion \nstabilization fund, and we wouldn't have to have premium support.\n  We will spend more money than we have to and we will get less for our \nmoney and seniors will get less in terms of the benefits, not just \npharmaceutical benefits but the overall Medicare Program. I emphasize \nagain, this is not just trying to tailor and contain the cost of \npharmaceuticals. This applies across the board.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my friend from Rhode Island for laying out in a \nclear and concise way what our concerns are about this bill.\n  Madam President, wouldn't the Senator agree that our first goal \nshould be to do no harm, rather than the items he is talking about? \nThat the first goal of any plan to provide Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage should be to make sure people are paying less and getting more \ncoverage and getting more help? This bill doesn't do that, does it?\n  Mr. REED. I concur with my colleague from Michigan. Our first goal \nshould have been to do what we told seniors for years we were going to \ndo: help them buy pharmaceuticals, not change, undermine Medicare but \nto help them buy pharmaceuticals.\n  We could have applied all that $400 billion to do that. We didn't. We \nhave stabilization funds to encourage private health concerns to \ncompete with the traditional Medicare Program; we have health savings \naccounts, with billions of dollars there to encourage the insurance \nindustry to sell health care plans to individuals. All of that very \nscarce money could have been used simply to say how much can we help \nthe seniors to buy drugs and maintain our program. I agree with the \nSenator.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I may ask another question, what the Senator is \nsaying is there are billions of dollars being used in this plan on \nitems that have nothing to do with helping pay for medicine, helping \npeople get their care; is that right? The Senator is talking about \nbillions of dollars going to HMOs, to insurance companies to help them \ncompete against Medicare, which costs less, and that money could be \nused to buy medicine for people?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator from Michigan is absolutely right. I said this \nbefore. This represents, in some respects, the greatest bait and switch \nin the history of the Republic. Seniors think they are getting \npharmaceutical protections, and they will wake up and discover the \nMedicare Program they thought was there forever has been changed \nirrevocably.\n  Indeed, even the pharmaceutical protection is not that extensive, \ncomprehensive, or effective. The Senator's point about the cost of \ntraditional Medicare is well taken. We already have experience with \nthis. We have had the Medicare+Choice plans. These are private plans \nthat are not able to provide a benefit as cheaply as traditional \nMedicare.\n  The 2003 Medicare trustees report estimated that reimbursement from \nmanaged care enrollees would exceed traditional Medicare costs. We are \nreimbursing HMOs more to care for their Medicare beneficiaries than we \nare through the traditional Medicare Program. We know that. That is \n2003. That is the report of the trustees of the Medicare system. Yet we \nare still under this illusion that if we pour more money into the \nprivate HMOs through slush funds, through premium support--through all \nsorts of mechanisms--somehow we will change the reality.\n  We are not going to change the reality. The reality is that this \ngeneral Medicare Program is efficient, is effective, it has stood the \ntest of almost 40 years, and it is a system that I think every American \nsees as being effective, efficient, and, indeed, an important part of \ntheir family's well-being in the future as it has been in the past.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I may continue with questions, when the Senator is \nsaying this shifts money to HMOs and to insurance companies, I assume--\nat least my understanding of HMOs is--you don't choose your own doctor. \nWe\n\n[[Page S15169]]\n\nare talking about seniors who now can go anywhere. I know in Michigan, \nthey can go from the Upper Peninsula over to Detroit over to the west \ncoast and the cost is the same. They can choose their doctor and go to \nthe hospital they want.\n  Madam President, is it true that what Senator Reed is talking about \nwill take away people's ability to choose their own doctor and \nhospital?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator from Michigan is right again. Not only do you \nnot have the ability to choose your own doctor, but sometimes it is the \nHMO that chooses you. We had the experience in Rhode Island of seniors \nsigned up for HMO programs and the HMO said: We are not making enough \nmoney; we are leaving. They left the seniors high and dry. They found \ncare by going back to the general Medicare system or another HMO. They \nfound coverage, of course.\n  This is a one-way street. It is not a two-way street. You get to do \nwhat they tell you you can do. That is the way they make money. It is a \nprofit-making enterprise. Frankly, there is nothing wrong with that, \nand if we were the managers of these companies, we might be pursuing \nthe same techniques of carefully selecting our beneficiaries and \nquestioning the doctors in every instance about whether this procedure \nis right or wrong. In fact, the greatest criticism of HMOs comes not \nfrom seniors but doctors. They can't abide working with them. It is \naccountants, not health care people, who are making the decisions.\n\n  We are setting this system up again. It is unbelievable, in some \nrespects, that having had the experience of Medicare+Choice, having had \nthe experience of a private insurance system that wouldn't touch a \nsenior in 1965, and having the success of Medicare, we are entertaining \nthese notions as if this is a good change, this is a good thing. We \nhaven't learned.\n  This represents a triumph of aspirations or hope over the facts and \nreality of 30-plus years of experience and of the dynamics of the \nmarketplace.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for her intervention because it has \nbeen useful in clarifying the discussion.\n  There is one other area that concerns me, and that is the notion of \nmeans testing. In the doublespeak of this bill, it is not means \ntesting, it is income relating. It is like cost containment and premium \nsupport. It is income relating. It is really means testing.\n  What it does is it begins to lower the effective subsidy that the \nFederal Government provides the seniors based on their income. Frankly, \nstarting off at a level of $80,000--you may say, well, maybe it is not \ntoo bad; maybe people that comfortable should be able to pay.\n  The point is, it begins to add another way in which we will segregate \nparticipants in the Medicare system because if your subsidy falls from \n75 percent, which is what it is roughly today, down to 20 percent, that \nwill be wealthy Americans, if this plan goes through, what it does is \nstart raising questions: Why should I be in Medicare?\n  If I have to pay copays and I have to do this and I only get small \nsupport, why should I be in Medicare? A multiple class of health care \nis being created in this country. For all these reasons, I hope we have \ntime to debate. I hope we have time to look at the legislation very \ncarefully and not in the last few moments vote because time ran out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nClinton be allowed to speak following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I first want to again commend my friend from Rhode \nIsland for his comments in laying out the concerns that many of us \nhave. In thinking about this and thinking about my coming to the \nSenate, I came with a very important goal. One of my top priorities has \nbeen to help create a real comprehensive Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. Part 2 of that is to lower prices for everyone, for our \nseniors, so that the Medicare dollars, those precious dollars, can be \nstretched farther, but also for our businesses who are paying for very \nhigh health care costs.\n  We know about half of that is due to the explosion of prescription \ndrug prices. So for businesses, for workers, for families, we have, I \nbelieve, an obligation to do everything we can to create more \ncompetition and more accountability to bring prices down. I came to the \nSenate with those two goals for health care for our seniors, as well as \nlowering prices for everyone.\n  Even though the bill that passed the Senate was not at all what I \nwould personally have written, it had good bipartisan give-and-take. We \npassed a bill that I was willing to support in the Senate. Even though \nI believed it was just a first step, there was much more that could be \ndone. We did include a strong bill to close patent loopholes and allow \nunadvertised brands, called generic brands, on the marketplace for \nbetter competition. We did create a low-income benefit that I believe \nwas very good for seniors and a number of other provisions, helping our \nrural health providers, as well as all of our doctors and hospitals and \nother providers.\n  Now we are in a situation where, unfortunately, instead of the \nbipartisan effort that we came forward with in the Senate, we have seen \na plan put forward primarily by only one side, and, unfortunately, one \nthat goes way beyond the scope of any bill dealing with prescription \ndrugs.\n  On the positive side, it does have positive provisions that can be \npulled out if we choose not to move forward with this bill. I would \nhope in a bipartisan way we could pull out providing for rural health, \npull out provisions for our physicians who continue to be cut and \nthreatened with cuts as they are providing care for our hospitals and \nhome health and nursing homes. We can do that if we want to. We can \npull that out and pass that. It is very positive.\n  When we look more broadly at this bill, it is not a comprehensive \nprescription benefit under Medicare. It is not even a good first step. \nAs my colleague from Rhode Island said, it feels like bait and switch. \nWe are talking about prescription drug coverage, and we are going to \nend up dismantling Medicare. We started out talking about: How do we \nhelp seniors pay for their medicine? How do we make sure folks are not \nchoosing between food and medicine and paying the utility bill? How do \nwe make sure we do not continue to have the explosion in prescription \ndrug pricing that is affecting every part of our economy and every \nfamily in this country? That is what we started out to do.\n  Now we find ourselves in a situation where the fight that started to \nadd a drug benefit to Medicare is turning into a fight to save Medicare \nas we know it, to save it as a universal health care benefit, the only \none we have in this country.\n\n  I view this as a matter of values and priorities. I am very proud of \nthe fact that in 1965, this Congress and the President of the United \nStates came together and decided that we, as Americans, were going to \nsay to those 65 and older and the disabled in this country that health \ncare would be there for them; regardless of where they live, regardless \nof their situation, health care would be for them.\n  Now, what has happened? Well, we have seen the quality of life \nimprove for older Americans. We have seen people live longer as a \nresult of the benefits of Medicare. Those over the age of 85 are the \nfastest growing part of the older generation. Why? Because Medicare has \nmade sure that health care is available, the doctor is available, the \nhospital is available, and so on. This is not a bad thing. This is a \ngood thing. This is a great American success story that we should be \ncelebrating together, not beginning the process of unraveling the \npromise of Medicare.\n  When I explain to folks what is before us, they look at me, frankly, \nlike I am crazy. When we say, well, we have a deal for you; a quarter \nof Medicare beneficiaries would pay more for their prescription drugs \nunder this plan, not less, not even the same but more. That is because \n6 million seniors who are the poorest of the poor, who are on Medicaid, \n6 million seniors who really are choosing between their food and their \nmedicine would end up paying more under this plan than they would \nstaying under Medicaid.\n  Another issue of particular concern to my State, up to 3 million \nseniors could lose their current coverage. In Michigan, I have a whole \nlot of folks who have worked hard their whole life,\n\n[[Page S15170]]\n\nsometimes giving up a pay raise to get good health care and to get a \ngood pension. In fact, in my State of Michigan, it is estimated that \n138,810 Medicare beneficiaries would lose their retiree health benefits \nunder this plan. How in the world can that be a good idea? How in the \nworld can we say to people, ``We have a deal for you; you are going to \nlose your coverage as a result of this plan''? We started out saying we \nare going to put together a voluntary prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare, and now we are seeing a situation where people would actually \nlose benefits.\n  In Michigan, 183,200 Medicaid beneficiaries, the poorest of the poor \nseniors, will pay more for their prescription drugs that they need, and \n90,000 fewer seniors in Michigan will qualify for low-income \nprotections--90,000 fewer than in the Senate bill that we worked on, on \na bipartisan basis, because of the assets test and the lower qualifying \nincome levels.\n  I see my friend from Iowa, who I know has worked very hard on this \nlegislation and who led the effort in the Senate that resulted in a \nbill that many of us embraced because it was a true, honest, bipartisan \neffort. I thank him again for that. This bill does not reflect what we \ndid in the Senate. It does not reflect what we did on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Unfortunately, even though hours and hours have been spent on this \nissue, we find ourselves in a situation where too many of the folks we \nrepresent will be worse off than they are now. That is of deep concern \nto me.\n  I am also very concerned that we are not seeing the competition put \ninto this bill that would lower prices. When we talk about bringing \nprescription drugs back from Canada in particular, which is right next \nto my State of Michigan, that is something near and dear to me and the \npeople I represent. It takes only 5 minutes to cross a bridge or a \ntunnel to go to Canada to bring back prescription drugs. Many of them \nare made in the United States. In fact, most of them are made in the \nUnited States, sold in Canada for 50, 60, 70 percent less, and then \nbrought back.\n  In some cases they are prescription drugs that are made by American \ncompanies but actually manufactured in other countries--Lipitor, \nmanufactured in Ireland; Viagra, manufactured in Ireland. They have a \nway to safely bring those back to the United States, working with the \nFDA and the companies. With a closed supply chain, they can do that.\n  There is absolutely no reason we cannot do that through our licensed \npharmacists in the local drugstore or the licensed pharmacists in the \nhospital. There is no reason we cannot do that if we want to do that. \nIt is just as safe. It can be crafted to be exactly the same, and just \nas safe, by allowing our local pharmacists to bring back these lower \npriced drugs to the local pharmacy rather than doing what is happening \ntoday, which is too many folks getting in a car or a bus and going to \nCanada.\n  I do have concerns about folks going through the Internet more and \nmore, or mail order where they are not working with a physician, not \nworking with a pharmacist, and don't know the interactions of their \ndrugs and may not know, in fact, where those drugs are coming from. \nThat is something we ought to be tackling as well from a safety \nstandpoint, but that is different from reimportation. That is different \nthan giving licensed pharmacists the ability to do business with a \nlicensed pharmacist in other countries and, in particular, Canada where \ntheir system is so much like ours in terms of safety.\n  I am very concerned that that provision is not in this bill, despite \na heroic effort among House Members, a bipartisan effort to pass a bill \nthat would do what needed to be done to create that competition.\n  Also, I am very concerned that we have a lessened provision in here \nrelating to closing patents and allowing more generic drugs to compete \non the market because those things would really bring prices down.\n  Although we have yet to see everything in final form, it is my \nunderstanding there is actually language that doesn't allow Medicare to \nbulk purchase, to negotiate on behalf of all of our 39 million seniors \nto get a big group discount to lower prices.\n  Essentially, on top of our poorest seniors paying more, those with \ncoverage possibly losing their coverage, we are being told that our \nprecious tax dollars and Medicare dollars are going to be forced to pay \nthe highest prices for prescription drugs. In fact, because our \nuninsured pay the highest prices in the world, I think it is fair to \nsay we would be paying the highest prices in the world for Medicare \nprescription drugs. That means the dollars are spread even thinner than \nthey would be. In order for us to really spread these precious dollars \nas far as they can be spread, we need to bring prices down. This bill \nnot only does not allow competition, it stops Medicare from group \npurchasing in order to bring the price down.\n\n  Thank goodness we don't include that language for the VA and our \nveterans. In the VA, we negotiate for our veterans for prescription \ndrug coverage. We don't pay retail as the Federal Government. We don't \npay retail. We get somewhere between a 30 percent and a 40 percent \ndiscount.\n  That is exactly what the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want to \nhappen under Medicare, which is exactly why there is no competition in \nhere. There is no ability to group purchase in terms of overall \nMedicare leverage.\n  This is a bill celebrated by the large pharmaceutical companies, \nbecause they know they are going to get a whole new group of folks, \ntheir customers, who will be locked into the highest possible prices.\n  I know they have a reason to celebrate. I understand. There are six \ndrug company lobbyists--probably more with this bill but at least six--\nto every one Senator. They must be celebrating. But I know the seniors \nof this country and the disabled, when they see what is really \nhappening--unfortunately, it doesn't take effect until 2006 so they \nwon't really be able to see what is happening until then--but once they \nsee it, they are not going to be celebrating. They are, in fact, going \nto be very angry.\n  We can do better than this. We have to do better than this. There is \nno reason we can't come together, as we did when this bill was before \nthe Senate, and work out something that makes sense. People are \ncounting on us to do that. They are trusting us to do that.\n  Unfortunately, what is in front of us is much more about making sure \nwe are protecting special interests than the people's interests. This \nis much more about HMOs and insurance companies and pharmaceutical \ncompanies than what seniors are going to be doing tonight when they \ndecide if they are going to be able to have dinner or they are going to \nhave to wait because they have to buy the medicine tomorrow.\n  We can do better. I hope we will. If what comes before us is what we \nhave heard and what I have described tonight, I will strongly oppose it \nand do everything I possibly can to join others to oppose this and send \nthis back to the drawing board.\n  I saw some numbers this morning of a poll done in the last couple of \ndays of those 55 and older, describing this plan. It was interesting to \nme, of those polled, 65 percent who were members of AARP said: Go back \nand go to work and get it right. Don't pass this.\n  I agree with those 65 percent of the people. I know they reflect the \npeople I represent in Michigan. I urge we go back to work and get it \nright.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this is a day of considerable activity \naround the Senate because we have two significant pieces of legislation \nthat are drawing the attention of Members who come to this floor to \nexpress their opinions. It is hard to know where to start. There are \nsignificant problems and issues with both the Energy bill and the \nproposed Medicare bill. But because they have only recently been \nprovided--with the Energy bill only in the last 24 to 48 hours finally \nbeing made available; with the Medicare bill still not being available \nin its full form--it is difficult to know what to say because, although \nwe have the outlines of legislation, we don't have the full details, \nand we certainly don't have adequate time to digest and analyze these \nimportant matters.\n  So, I am sure that, like others, I am somewhat bewildered by the rush \nto deal with these two bills, to force action before the Thanksgiving \nholiday on such grave matters before our country.\n\n[[Page S15171]]\n\n  I want to say just a few words about the Energy bill, and then I want \nto say a few words about the Medicare bill, because I think it is \nimportant that the country understand what is at stake with both of \nthese significant changes.\n  With respect to the Energy bill, I am strongly opposed to it. I think \nit is bad for my State of New York and I think it is bad for our entire \nNation. Yet I am very disappointed to find myself in this position \nwhere I feel compelled to oppose something called an Energy bill. There \nare provisions in this bill that are good, ones that I have worked on \nand have supported and am very pleased that they made their way into \nthe final product.\n  Of course, after the August blackout, I wanted to do everything I \ncould in my power to ensure that New Yorkers never had to go through \nanything like that again. I thought certainly in the face of a massive \nblackout that this body and our friends on the other side of Capitol \nHill would rally together to take appropriate steps to increase the \nreliability of our electricity transmission and distribution system. \nWhat could be more obvious? The lights went out, and they went out \nbecause of failures and problems within that system.\n  Unfortunately, the Energy conference report did not get that job \ndone, which to me is job one. I know the bill's proponents point to the \nfact that it includes mandatory enforceable reliability standards. I \nagree. Reliability rules are important. There should be mandatory rules \nwith penalties, but those rules are not terribly meaningful if the \nentities that operate and manage the transmission system are unable to \nplan for and respond to crises. For that, you need a transmission \nsystem to be operated on a regional basis so responses can be \ncoordinated on a regional basis and connected up to a national grid. At \nthe very least, you need regional transmission organization.\n  What have we found out today? There has been a report issued about \nwhat happened to cause the blackout. Although details are not yet fully \navailable, we know there were a number of causes for what happened to \nus on August 14. The fact is, no one appears in charge of the \nsprawling, heavily loaded, and troubled part of the transmission grid \nrunning around Lake Erie. A portion of the Midwestern grid centered in \nOhio has long worried industry regulators.\n  The Energy bill that passed the House yesterday and which is now \nbefore us would create operating rules to lessen the risk of blackouts, \nbut it does not overcome that region's fragmented line of authority \nwhere control is shared by 23 different power and transmission \ncompanies. The bill before us prevents the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission from setting up regional transmission organizations--so-\ncalled RTOs--that can effectively coordinate transmission on a regional \nbasis.\n  If you are supporting this bill because you think it will prevent \nfuture blackouts, you had better take another look at the bill.\n  I start with this point because it is absolutely critical to my \nconstituents and because there has been a lot of talk about how we had \nto move this bill because of the blackout. But how ironic it is that we \nmove a bill which does very little to solve the problems that have now \nbeen analyzed and pinpointed as being at the root of what happened to \nus in August.\n  That is just one of many problems with the bill. I join many of my \ncolleagues in expressing dismay about the MTBE provision in the \nlegislation.\n  First, the bill provides a retroactive liability waiver for MTBE \nproducers. This provision turns the so-called polluter-pay principle on \nits head. It basically says to communities from New York to California: \nGuess what; we may have contaminated your groundwater, we may have \ncontaminated your wells, and we are not going to help you clean it up.\n  I heard some of my friends on the other side say: Wait a minute; it \ndoesn't remove liability from people who negligently used MTBE. The \nfact is, there is no good use for MTBE. It is a contaminant. It \npollutes water. Whether somebody poured it in fast or poured it in \nslow, the result is the same.\n\n  We don't know the full cost of these cleanups. I have read estimates \nthat it could be on the order of $29 billion nationwide. In New York, \nwe are coming to grips with that kind of extraordinary cost, especially \nin light of the budget problems that we face.\n  Paul Granger, superintendent of the Plainview, NY, Water District, \nhas provided estimates to my office about contamination on Long Island, \none part of our State. But it is a beautiful part that has an \nunderground water aquifer from which we draw water for Long Island. Mr. \nGranger estimates that testing the 130 supply wells known to be \ncontaminated by MTBE will cost between $990 million to $1.4 billion. If \nyou divide the 3.3 million Long Island population into that cost range, \nthe MTBE drinking water cleanup costs will range from $118 to $315 per \nperson. The cost impact for a typical family of four trying to make \nends meet would be from $472 to $1,206 per family.\n  With respect to the Plainview Water District, Mr. Granger informs me \nthat in the event that MTBE wellhead treatment is required at all of \nits facilities, the average monthly cost for water will jump by 49 \npercent.\n  As far as I can tell, this is another one of these unfunded mandates \nwe like to pass around here. You have problems with water contamination \ndirectly caused by a contaminant that was manufactured by large \nconglomerates. They have deep pockets, and they could at least \nparticipate or contribute to helping to clean up water systems on Long \nIsland, across New York, and across our country.\n  Well, you are out of luck. Is that fair? I don't think it is fair. I \ndon't think it is fair to the people of Plainview, NY. But it is fair \nif you consider it along those terms for the MTBE producers.\n  Apparently, that is all that matters to the people who put this bill \ntogether. Maybe they don't have this problem in their States, although \nI have looked at the numbers. It looks as if all but 8 or 10 States are \naffected by MTBE. The costs associated with cleanup--where is money \ngoing to come from? Is this body going to pass on the billions and \nbillions of dollars that are going to be needed to clean up our water \nsystems across our country?\n  I can't imagine under our current budget situation that is a likely \npossibility. Therefore, what are we going to have happen? Once again, \nthe taxes on local people will rise--again, another unfunded mandate \njust like special education, just like No Child Left Behind, and so \nmuch else that we passed in this body and then let somebody else pay \nfor it.\n  New York City, which obviously has a very significant water issue, \nhad been taking action to try to get some help in paying the bills and \nhad sued the MTBE producers. Under this bill, their lawsuits are going \nto be thrown out of court.\n  I find it hard to understand why local governments aren't going to be \npermitted to protect themselves and to get the resources from the \npeople who profited from producing and selling MTBE. I thought that is \nthe way the system worked. Somebody said it is the trial lawyers. I \ndon't think so. Mr. Granger in Plainview, NY, and the city of New York \nare trying to protect their water supply. Yes, they may have to go to \ncourt to do that. Why should they be prohibited in this bill from doing \nso?\n\n  As bad as the MTBE liability waiver is, the bill doesn't stop there \nwhen it comes to the MTBE producers. Unbelievably, the bill provides $2 \nbillion in grants to MTBE producers. What about grants for the water \nsystems of our country? What about lending a helping hand to Plainview, \nNY, and all the other places in my State that are looking at tens of \nmillions of dollars to clean up their water supply?\n  I can't understand how anybody can go home from this body and go back \nto wherever they represent and look into the eyes of their fellow \ncitizens and say: Not only did we tell your mayor and your city council \nand your county leaders they couldn't sue, we are going to give $2 \nbillion to the folks who polluted your water but not a penny for you.\n  I wasn't on that side of this argument. Nevertheless, that is what is \nin this bill.\n  There are many other problems in this bill. The numerous rollbacks of \nenvironmental and health protections deeply concern me.\n  I hope we will be able to revisit those and try to figure out ways to \navoid\n\n[[Page S15172]]\n\nturning the clock back on making our air cleaner, on helping people \navoid the ill effects of pollution and contaminants in their emissions.\n  But there is so much else in this bill that, unfortunately, I believe \nwill set us back. It is a shame because there are many ways this could \nhave turned out differently, that we could have had the good provisions \nwithout so many of the egregious ones being put into this legislation.\n  I will now turn to the other issue we are confronting in the Senate. \nI don't see how we can deal with a Medicare bill of this significance \nat this time when, so far as my office knows, we still do not have the \nfinal bill as I came to the floor. We will have a lot of explaining to \ndo to our constituents.\n  Every Member hoped we could get a bill to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit for our seniors. They need it and they deserve it. I wish I \ncould support this bill. Analyzing what we are able to find out and \nwhat the likely impacts will be leads me to conclude that not only will \nthis bill not deliver on the promise of a drug benefit for our seniors \nbut it will mean the slow, but steady unraveling of the Medicare \nsystem.\n  Let's look at some of the people who will be directly affected by \nthis 1,100-page bill. I cannot avoid mentioning this is a long bill. I \nam not sure anyone has read it yet--maybe some staff person in the \nbasement has read it all--but it is 1,100 pages. I remember another \nlong bill 10 years ago, a bill to change the whole health care system, \nnot just tinkering with Medicare and trying to provide a benefit.\n  A lot of our seniors are asking: What does this mean? Who can tell me \nwhat is in it? How will it affect me? On an individual level, that is \nan impossible question to answer. We do not know who is a winner or \nloser. My office is being inundated with calls from constituents, \nasking: I am a senior in New York City living on a small pension; what \ndoes this do for me? Or a widow in Buffalo, with high drug benefits: \nWhat does this do for me? We do not know yet.\n  Here is what we do know. At first glance, there are a number of \ngroups who definitely lose under this legislation. The numbers in the \ngroups add up to about 25 percent of all Medicare recipients, 10 \nmillion or so. This bill causes retirees to lose benefits they \ncurrently have. At least 2.2 million retirees will lose under this deal \nand over half of them have incomes below $30,000. In New York, over \n200,000 Medicare beneficiaries are likely to lose their retirement \nbenefits.\n  As a result, my phones are ringing off the hook over this. People are \nsaying: I have good benefits; I do not want this if it will take away \nthe good benefits.\n  I have to say, honestly, based on my reading, the assessment on the \nnumbers who will lose, I may even be a little conservative. \nNevertheless, there will be a loss.\n  We could have done more to avoid having 2.2 million lose, but the \nconferees chose instead to spend $12 billion on a slush fund for \nprivate insurers and $6.8 billion on tax breaks that will undermine \ninsurance coverage even beyond Medicare.\n  It is fair to say this bill threatens benefits that people already \nreceive from their employers. There is no argument it is going to take \nthat reality and turn it into something other than what it is. It is a \nbitter pill to swallow.\n  This bill also threatens to reduce drug coverage for the 6 million \npeople who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. I have spoken \nabout the so-called dual eligibles before because they are the people \nabout whom I am most concerned. They are the lowest-income, sickest \nMedicare beneficiaries. Many rely on Medicaid right now for drugs \nbecause Medicare does not cover drugs. This bill bars Medicaid from \nproviding drugs not covered by the new Medicare plan. That is a \ndeparture from the practice for all other Medicare benefit gaps. This \nwill affect nursing home residents, people with disabilities, and the \ntruly indigent nationwide. We estimate it will affect 440,000 in New \nYork alone.\n\n  If we look at the New Yorkers who are eligible for both Medicaid and \nMedicare, right now they can get access to any drug they need and they \ncan access most any pharmacy. This bill will increase their copays, \nlimit their choice of drugs, and restrict the pharmacy network.\n  HIV/AIDS patients are particularly affected since this bill only \nrequires coverage of two drugs in any class. HIV/AIDS patients need \nmultidrug cocktails that may require more than two such drugs and often \nrequire very specific medicines that are prescribed for their \ncondition. Some drugs they might take or have taken for a period of \ntime could eventually encounter resistance within their bodies. For \nthose patients, this provision on dual eligibles does a grave \ninjustice.\n  The millions who currently receive coverage through State \nprescription drug assistance programs, such as the one we have in New \nYork called EPIC, are also at risk. In New York, over 400,000 seniors, \nnearly a quarter of our Medicare beneficiaries, rely on EPIC, which \ndoes not have a formulary and often offers better coverage than what a \nsenior will be able to get under this bill. The compromise in the bill \nputs seniors in EPIC at risk of a new formulary, higher copays than \nthey have now, and places limitations on the pharmacies they can use. \nIt will force the New York Legislature to change the law and the design \nof EPIC, assuming they even want to continue it.\n  I have also asked that seniors who will either have to disenroll from \nthe current EPIC plan or will have to enroll in two plans to continue \nto qualify for drug coverage be given a grace period so they are not \npenalized if, in the confusion and disruption of this transition, they \ndo not understand what they have to do to continue to get whatever \nState program is available because they have to sign up for a new \nMedicare benefit program to continue with EPIC.\n  I recently heard from the people who are finalizing the bill that the \nnew formularies, limitations on pharmacies, and higher copays will not \nonly affect seniors in State prescription programs but also veterans \nwho depend on the VA and members of the military in TRICARE, many of \nwhom currently pay very low and in some cases zero copays. Again, the \nmillions who have coverage throughout these programs will be worse off \nthan they are now.\n  What about the issue of premium support? For those 6 million seniors \naffected by the premium support experimental demonstration, overall \nMedicare premiums will increase yet again; this time, as the price of \nprivatization.\n  MedPAC has studied this issue and found that private plans cherry-\npick. That means they pick the healthiest seniors to be in their plans. \nThat is how they make a profit. If you are insuring the healthiest \npeople, you do not have to pay as much money as if you insure people \nwho are not so healthy. Therefore, they try to attract the healthiest \nbeneficiaries. That way, they get a big payment for those healthy \nbeneficiaries and they, frankly, do not have to pay much out when it \ncomes to beneficiaries needs.\n  The GAO has said the population is so much healthier that the \nMedicare+Choice plans are now overpaid by 19 percent when one considers \nthe health condition of their beneficiaries.\n  If fee-for-service has to compete and it is the only plan willing to \ncontinue to serve the sickest and costliest patients, anyone who wishes \nto keep their regular fee-for-service Medicare will see their cost \nrise, probably up 5 percent each year. But who knows how high that \npercentage will go in the future? Ultimately, the 6 million seniors \nacross the country who are going to be put in the demonstration \nexperiment will pay more just to maintain their Medicare benefit.\n  This is not just an academic exercise for me because New York is \nlikely to be one of the States with residents chosen for this \nexperiment. Our seniors will be used as guinea pigs, so to speak, in \nthe rush to try to in some way prove that Medicare, which has the most \ncost-effective delivery system, which has provided a guaranteed benefit \nthat is the same across the country now for nearly 40 years, is somehow \ninadequate and unable to really deliver the goods. So we are going to \nsee what happens when over 500,000 New York seniors who reside in areas \nthat could be chosen for premium support are thrown into that mix, and \ntold that you are just going to have to pay those higher prices, and \njust shovel that money out the door to the HMOs and other health \ninsurers that are going to be standing there with their hands out.\n\n[[Page S15173]]\n\n  But the bill does not just create a radical scheme for Medicare; it \nreally does take aim at our whole system of insurance by the inclusion \nof these so-called HSAs. They used to be called MSAs, medical savings \naccounts; so now I guess they are health savings accounts. The new name \ndoes not change the fundamental problems with these proposals.\n  By promoting these accounts, these provisions will allow wealthy and \nhealthy seniors to get tax benefits. But it would also mean increased \npremiums of as much as 60 percent for those who wish to keep their \ncurrent private insurance.\n  To arm the enemies of Medicare, there is a so-called cost containment \nprovision which designates an arbitrary cap on Medicare. We are bound \nto hit that cap as the baby boomers age. Once we hit it, that \nguarantees that current Medicare benefits will be on the chopping block \nyear after year. So I have to send out a big warning to everybody on \nMedicare, but also to those like me who are not that far away from \nMedicare, that we are looking at the dismantling of this program, and \nwe are moving back toward a survival of the richest and the fittest.\n  Now, considering all those harmed by the bill, you would think we \nwould be getting a generous drug benefit out of all of this. Well, in \nfact, we do not. Many seniors will be paying more out of pocket for \ndrugs under the skimpy benefit in this proposal than they are now \nwithout any so-called drug benefit at all.\n  Every single senior in this country will pay more out of pocket than \nthey do now for doctor services in 2005. That means that before the \ndrug benefit even starts, seniors will be hit with increased cost-\nsharing. Seniors can expect a 10- increase in their Part B deductible \nright away, and yearly increases after that for the first time in \nhistory. Those increases are pegged to grow at a rate faster than \nseniors' Social Security checks.\n  In addition, the drug premium may be $35 a month, on average, but it \nincreases so quickly that seniors will be left paying more and more for \nlittle additional benefit.\n  As we know, this bill creates a new insurance structure where seniors \nwill continue to pay premiums for part of the year even though they are \nreceiving zero benefit at the same time. Now, I don't know. I don't \nthink we have ever passed an insurance plan in this country where you \nare told you have to pay all year but there are going to be a few \nmonths in the year that you don't get sick, don't get hurt, don't have \nan accident because you will be out of luck.\n  There is not an insurance commissioner in this country who would \ngladly allow such an insurance policy to be marketed in their State. \nYet here we are. Seniors will pay premiums, even in the so-called gap \nmonths, when they have no benefits.\n  Then the $35 premium goes up to $40, and then nearly doubles, \nreaching $60 by 2013. I think that is a burden for seniors if the \nbenefit they return is not guaranteed all year, every year, and if it, \nin and of itself, may not even meet the cost they put into the system.\n  I have heard from some analysts that the break-even point for seniors \nin this bill is $835. Now, 40 percent of seniors spend less than that \non drugs each year. According to the analysis I was given, this bill \nwill actually represent a net loss to 40 percent of our seniors if they \njoin. That is a lot of seniors. We are talking about 16 million or so. \nThey will end up paying more in costs in premiums than they receive in \nreturns. So when all is said and done, this is a bill that decreases \nsome people's benefits, eliminates other people's benefits, and costs \nmore to many.\n\n  I think history has demonstrated the political repercussions of such \nexperiments that go right to the heart of what people value the most; \nnamely, their health.\n  But now, even though there are many losers in this bill, I want to be \nfair. There are also some winners. They are many industries and some \nindividuals. But there are winners. A recent study found this bill will \ngive drug companies a $139 billion windfall. Because there is no cost \ncontainment in the bill, the drug companies are assured of their \nprofits.\n  Furthermore, the health plans--already overpaid 19 percent compared \nto what Medicare is paying for seniors in traditional Medicare--will \nreceive another 7 percent on top of that in addition to the $12 billion \nslush fund in this bill.\n  Now, there may be some help in this bill for some of the 12 million \nor so Medicare beneficiaries without any kind of drug coverage--not \nthrough Medicaid, not through Medicare+Choice, not through the VA, not \nthrough TRICARE. They simply do not have it. Maybe some among those 12 \nmillion might be winners but only if they make it through a thicket of \nconfusion and hit a moving target.\n  Because, let's face it, this is a very complicated bill. It is going \nto be very complicated to implement. I remember hearing a lot of \ncomplaints about that bill of 1,300 pages, the Health Security Act back \nin 1994, and that dealt with the entire health care system, not just \nwith seniors.\n  Now, all signs show this bill is not seeking to add prescription \ndrugs; it is seeking to change the whole health care system. I have to \ngive them credit, they got it to 200 pages less, so that is some \naccomplishment.\n  I think we ought to look at what is going to be facing seniors as \nthey try to make decisions about their health care.\n  What I have done is to take the tales of two seniors, to look at what \nthe differences would be, and what a typical senior would face when \ntrying to determine what they could have under this bill.\n  The first tale concerns a retired small business owner in New York \nCity, an urban senior. Now, this senior has many choices in the first \nyear, 2006. He looks at his choices. He has PPOs and HMOs and private \ndrug plans and Medicare. He has choices. So he takes a look at his \nchoices and decides to stay in traditional Medicare. He picks the \nprivate, stand-alone drug plan with the lowest premium of $35 a month.\n  He gets into that plan.\n  Then he discovers, too late, that his drug that he has been taking \nfor a few years is not on the private insurer's formulary. So even \nthough he has had bad side effects from the drug that is listed, he has \nto go through a lengthy appeals process. Although he eventually wins \nhis battle with the private insurer, he has had to pay out of pocket \nfor the drug in the interim.\n  So suppose what he is suffering from is, let's say, diabetes--a very \ncommon disease among our seniors. In the process of trying to get on \nthe right drug, trying to pay for the drug he has been on, he is locked \ninto this plan and he cannot change until the next year.\n\n  Now, let's go to year 2, 2007. So let's say the private drug insurer \nplan the senior was in has dropped out of Medicare, which happens all \nthe time because its low premium, the $35 a month premium, could not \nsustain enough profit. But our elderly gentleman does not mind because \nhe wanted to switch anyway. He did not want to stay in that drug plan \nbecause they did not treat him well.\n  So he chooses another private drug insurer and he pays a higher \npremium. This time he decides to go with a more expensive premium, \nthinking he is going to get more of what he needs. He pays $50 for drug \ncoverage on top of his now $79 Part B premium. But he makes absolutely \nsure his drug for diabetes is on the plan's preferred drug list and he \ncan continue to see his doctor.\n  During the year, however, the private insurer changes its formulary--\nthere is no rule that says it cannot--so that his drug gets assigned a \nhigher coinsurance amount. Although the plans can change what they \ncover during the year--it can be the old bait and switch: Sign up with \nus. Your drug is on the formulary; and 6 months later, no, it is not--\nthe senior cannot get out of the plan until the year is up.\n  So year 3, our senior does the math. This is a man who has really \nbeen working on this. He has spent a lot of his waking hours trying to \nfigure out this maze of so-called benefits.\n  To stay in traditional Medicare, he will pay the monthly premium of \n$83 in 2008, plus at least $50 for prescription drugs, in addition to \nrelatively high copayments. The private insurer he was with has dropped \nout. If he joins an HMO, he can pay $75 for base Medicare coverage, \nplus $42 for prescription drug coverage. Now he is up to $192 a year \nextra to stay in regular Medicare, and he has to worry about whether or \nnot the private drug plans are going to change on him again as they \nhave in the past.\n\n[[Page S15174]]\n\n  You could make this even worse because suppose that the HMO plan no \nlonger recognizes his doctor, and if he joined he would be stuck again \nfor another year. It just goes on and on. I am not looking forward to \nexplaining this to my 84-year-old mother. We are going to have to set \nup a whole gigantic bureaucracy of individual case counselors to try to \nexplain to seniors what this all adds up to. And this maze, this \ntotally confused picture, is what is available in an urban area where \nat least there are choices for seniors. Let's look at what happens to a \nwoman who lives in upstate New York.\n  Let's pick an 85-year-old widow who has had a stroke. She hasn't had \ndrug coverage before. She has lived on a Social Security payment and a \nsmall pension from her late husband. She took regular trips across the \nborder to Canada, though, because we are lucky in upstate New York. We \ncan just go right across that border, or we used to be able to go right \nacross that border. She could afford those drugs because they were a \nlot cheaper, and they were absolutely the same drugs. She takes five \ndifferent drugs on a daily basis.\n  In the first year, 2006, no private HMOs or PPOs plan to come to her \ntown. She is up in the north country, up near the Adirondack Park. For \nanybody who has been up there, it is really beautiful. It is isolated, \nand it is really rural. She loves living there, and she wouldn't live \nanywhere else.\n  Well, she has never had any of these private plans in her community \nbefore, and she doesn't know what is going to be available to her. So \ntwo of the new private drug-only plans are offered. One has monthly \npremiums of $60; the other has monthly premiums of $50. The lower \npremium plan has a complicated set of copayments that tends to be \nhigher, when you add it all up--assuming somebody helps you figure out \nhow to add it all up--than the higher premium plan. But she goes ahead \nand chooses the $50 plan, and she sees some relief. But she calculates \nthat with annual drug costs below the catastrophic benefit, she is \nstill not getting a very good deal because for her, she is still paying \nabout 70 to 80 percent of what she had before.\n  Now year 2--and this happens all the time in rural areas, as we \nknow--the private plan drops out of Medicare. That is a common \nexperience for rural residents. So Medicare must provide a fallback \nplan. This plan seems quite good to our widow. She pays $5 less than \nwhat she paid in the private plan the previous year, and her \nprescription drug benefits are covered. But year 3 the local papers \nannounce that the payment rates for HMOs, which are 30 percent above \nthe local cost of traditional Medicare, have finally attracted an HMO \nto the area. Remember, we are pumping all this premium subsidy out \nthere. We have billions and billions of dollars to entice folks to come \nto the North Country and other areas.\n  Well, this creates a dilemma for our senior because she now has to \ndetermine with whom she can go and who is going to take best care of \nher because if the HMO comes, maybe it will attract some competition. \nAnd let's say that another private drug-only insurer shows up. Medicare \nis providing bonuses to private plans who come to the area. So as a \nresult, remember, even if it only lasts for just a year, even if it \ndoesn't have your drug on the formulary, even if it no longer is \naffordable for you, once you have two competing private insurers, there \nis no fallback plan as an option. So the senior faces the so-called \nchoice of monthly premium increases of $24 to stay in traditional \nMedicare or just $1 more per month to join the HMO. Given that this \ndifference is $288 a year, it is not even a choice. That would wipe out \nher annual increase in Social Security benefits.\n\n  She feels forced to go into the HMO. She loses her doctor, she loses \nthe drug that she needs, and she has to go through an appeal. I can \nguarantee you, there is not going to be a lot of appeals courts in \nisolated areas like the North Country. So it is going to take a while \neven to go through this. Now this 87-year-old woman is having to fight \nfor, litigate for, argue for the drug her doctor says she needs, or her \nformer doctor, because she can't go to him anymore because there is no \naffordable regular Medicare fallback. So she is stuck with one of these \ntwo private plans. Here today; gone tomorrow.\n  The lesson I draw from this is whether you live in a rural or an \nurban area, your choices are tilted toward enrolling in HMOs and PPOs. \nI think that is a shame.\n  Medicare's strength, a reliable system of coverage and \npredictability, will have been replaced by a complex, insured-driven, \ncherry-picking system. There may be some seniors who will be helped \nunder this bill. I hope I am healthy enough when I reach that age that \nI am not going to be disadvantaged by whatever we have in place, but I \nfind it hard to explain how we could end up with a bill that is so much \nnarrower, so much more uncertain than the bill that received a majority \nof votes in the Senate last year, the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill.\n  Among those who might gain under this bill, they are not only small \nin number, they don't even know who they are. I asked seniors this \nmorning at a big meeting: Who among you knows for sure that you won't \nget hit by the fine print in the bill? How many of you really believe \nyou are winners under this bill? Don't you wonder why nobody is really \ntelling you everything you need to know to be an informed citizen, to \nmake a decision in your own mind that you can then tell your elected \nofficials what you think should be done?\n  We are on a course to passing a bill where no senior watching or \nlistening to this debate is going to be sure that he or she will be \nhelped. We have pushed it past the next election so the full burden of \ntrying to figure it out won't really fall on anybody until 2006. And if \nyou look at this chart, it is kind of hard to draw any other \nconclusion. If you are a retiree, you would have no idea of knowing \nwhether your former employer will keep you or drop you. If you are \npoor, you be poor enough to get coverage under Medicaid. And if you \nare, you may no longer get all the coverage you need for your needs. If \nyou are sick, will you be sick enough to be covered under Medicaid, and \nunder this bill will Medicaid really cover your particular health care \nneeds? If you are in a nursing home, are you going to be really left to \nfend for yourself in a nursing home in a State prohibited from \nproviding Medicaid wraparound funding. And your health needs will \ncompete with those of children and other needy people? If you are in a \nState prescription drug program, you will pretty likely be a loser as \nwell. If you are in the premium support guinea pig category, good luck, \nbecause I think you will see that you are going to have an amazing \nobstacle course to try to run.\n  I must say many of the obstacles confronting our seniors are \ntriggered by decisions we have had made for us in this conference that \nwas quite small in number and exclusive in membership and came out with \na product that is going to be very hard to defend. It will be \nparticularly hard to defend if we look down the road and we see the \nthreats to Medicare on the horizon.\n  I have heard colleagues say--and I respect this--that this bill is \nnot perfect, but it is all we could get. I understand that perspective. \nThere is good and bad in every bill. I don't think since I have been \nhere I have voted for a perfect bill or voted against a totally bad \nbill. I understand that perspective. I am grateful this bill does take \nsteps to help our rural and small community hospitals to resolve some \nof our teaching hospital issues and to address the absolutely \ncompelling physician payment issues. We should be addressing those \nimportant matters, but not in the context of a bill which will further \nundermine the program providing the capacity for hospitals and doctors \nto provide decent care at an affordable cost.\n  This bill has too many flaws for us to go forward. The privatization \nscheme that is tied into this bill, in a box with a big bow saying \nprescription drugs, is one that will make structural changes to this \nprogram which has been the bedrock of protecting our seniors and \nguaranteeing them the health care they have needed.\n  So I hope we can still salvage this bill. I hope we can still try to \nkeep faith with our seniors. I think we should postpone dealing with it \nbeyond the forced deadline of right before Thanksgiving, so that \neverybody has a chance to read and evaluate it.\n  But if we are required to go forward, then I certainly cannot be a \nparty to a bill that I think will undermine health\n\n[[Page S15175]]\n\ncare for our seniors, fail to provide the benefit that is advertised, \nand lead to the slow and steady unraveling of Medicare, which I \nconsider to be one of the great achievements of our country in the 20th \ncentury.\n  On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of seniors I represent, who \nare definitely losers under this bill, I have to respectfully request \nthat we go back to the drawing board, that we try once again to do a \njob on a bill that will really help our seniors, and that we not take \nsteps that will undermine the guarantee of health care under Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is there a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I don't think we are rushing into the \nprescription drug bill, nor are we rushing into the Energy bill. We \nhave been wrestling with those bills for an interminable period of \ntime--years. They have been up and down and debated and discussed, and \nconferees have worked their hearts out on these bills.\n  We are spending, on prescription drugs, an additional $400 billion. I \ndon't believe anyone is going to be hurt by this effort. AARP has \nreviewed this bill and they support it. They would like it to spend \neven more, but they are supportive of this bill as a historic effort.\n  There is no doubt, with regard to prescription drugs, that there is \nthe potential to provide the poor in this country, many of whom this \nvery day are choosing between food and drugs that they need for their \nhealth, with prescription drugs essentially for free, up to 150 percent \nof the federal poverty level. A huge percentage of the seniors in this \ncountry are going to have access to necessary prescription drugs, \nvirtually free, under this bill.\n  If there is any problem with it, I suggest that maybe we have done a \nbit too much, that we could have been somewhat more restrained and \nfocused less universally on this bill. But conferees debated it and it \nis a bipartisan effort by Democrats and Republicans in both the House \nand the Senate. Now we have a bill and we will have to see how it goes.\n  I hope to be able to support it because I told my people in Alabama \nthat I wanted the people who could not afford drugs to have them paid \nfor. This change does, fundamentally, make sense. At the present time, \nwe pay for your surgery, we pay for your heart operations, but we will \nnot pay for the drugs that we know will help prevent a heart operation. \nWe will not pay for the drugs that could avert the need for a kidney \ntransplant, but we will pay for the kidney transplant. It is an odd \nthing.\n  I will take a few moments to talk about the MTBE question. It is a \nmatter that has become a big point in the debate on the Energy bill. \nFrankly, I think it is a bit overdone. Some senators have said that if \na company makes a product, the company ought to pay for it if their \nproduct causes damage. But that is not true. That is not the law in \nAmerica.\n  That is not classical American liability law, tort law. As a matter \nof fact, it is an indication that this Congress and this country is \nlosing its discipline on what is a legitimate basis for a lawsuit.\n  You can say, well, they made MTBE and it got into the water system in \nthis community; therefore, the maker of MTBE ought to pay for it. They \nsay that is what the law ought to be and they ought to pay.\n  Would somebody say Folgers should be responsible if a Folgers brand \nof hot coffee burned somebody in a McDonald's restaurant, or that \nMcDonald's should be liable? If somebody takes a can of Campbell's soup \nand smashes a guy on the head with it, is the maker of the can of soup \nliable? Certainly not.\n  Let me share a couple of things. After 9/11, we realized we were \nfacing a situation in which airlines had suffered a dramatic loss of \nridership. Somebody woke up and said: Wait a minute, they are going to \nsue the airlines for 9/11. Why? Well, maybe somebody was asleep at the \nswitch when a terrorist got by, so we can sue them. They think the \nairlines have a lot of money and they can pay for everybody and \neverybody will make lots of money. We can attach liability to them.\n  Congress, in considering that, passed legislation that would \ncompensate the victims in New Jersey and their families for $1 million \nor $2 million each. As a consequence of that, they would waive \nliability claims against the company. The airlines' planes were seized, \ncommandeered by terrorists. In truth, in the history of America, under \nclassical law, the airlines are victims just as much as the owner of \nthe Trade Center towers is a victim. We are in a situation in which the \nlawsuits in America, having eroded classical constraints on them, too \noften are successful in suing whoever is standing around--whether they \nhave any real liability or not.\n  I think about the gun liability question. There are over 60 Senators, \nincluding Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, who support legislation to \nprotect gun manufacturers, under certain circumstances, from liability. \nWhy? Because cities and other groups, for political reasons, are suing \nthe gun manufacturers because someone used their gun and committed a \ncrime with it.\n  Well, under the classical rule of law--and I used this defense in one \ncase--a person is not responsible for an intervening criminal act. The \ngun manufacturers make a gun that does what it is supposed to do. You \naim it and point it and a bullet hits something or somebody. That is \nwhat the gun is supposed to do. The Federal Government passes \nlegislation about how and to whom you can sell a gun, under what \ncircumstances. They have to sign a statement, and there is a waiting \nperiod. They have to certify that they are not a drug addict or they \nhave not been convicted of a felony. Then they can buy the gun, under \ncertain circumstances. States have even more rules, and they comply \nwith that. But they want to go further. They want to sue the gun \nmanufacturer because somebody took a legal product, sold according to \nFederal law, and used it for a crime. They want to sue the gun \nmanufacturer because I guess they think the gun manufacturers have a \ndeep pocket of money. That is not what we ought to be about.\n  The MTBE was essentially a Government requirement over a decade ago. \nIt is an oxygenate. It was produced and it did what we required to be \ndone in order to improve air quality in America. The EPA could have \nstopped it if they had wanted to, but they never stopped utilization of \nit. It was encouraged. It was passed by Senator Daschle, who introduced \nan amendment that required it to happen. Everybody knew MTBE would be \nthe product utilized more than any other product as an oxygenate to \nmeet the environmental regulations.\n  So you say, well, if they put it in the water system, they ought to \nbe liable. Right, if they put it into the water system, they ought to \nbe liable. But if they didn't put it in the water system, they ought \nnot to be liable. It is getting into water, but not because it is \nburned in the engines and goes through the environment and settles into \nthe water. The argument is that some water aquifers are being polluted \nwith MTBE as a result of leaking from tanks and from pipelines and \nmatters of that kind.\n  It is legitimate, fair, legal theory that if a manufacturer of MTBE \nallowed its pipeline to leak or allowed the storage tanks to leak and \nthe chemical got into the water system, then you can sue him. That is \nwhat we ought to be doing.\n  As I understand the language in this bill, it does not prohibit that \nkind of lawsuit. If you allow it to escape negligently into the system, \nthen you are liable. That is what classical American law is all about. \nThat is what it has always been about. However, it has never been about \nthe producer of a substance being liable for pollution if somebody else \ntakes it and dumps it into the water system of America. How ridiculous \ncan that be? The person who dumped it in the water system is the one \nwho ought to be liable and ought to pay.\n  As I understand the language in the bill, that is all that it says. \nYou have to be the one who was responsible for letting it get into the \nwater system. Maybe it is a local gasoline distributor who has a bunch \nof old tanks that leak and that person allowed it to get into the \nwater. Is a manufacturer somewhere that didn't have any contact\n\n[[Page S15176]]\n\nwith this company liable for the leak? Certainly not. If we have any \nlegal discipline left in this country, certainly not. But that is where \nwe are heading.\n   I also know there have been a good many problems with leaking tanks \nin this country. There is a big trust fund--I believe there is $2 \nbillion in that fund--in case the gas station or the small gasoline \ndistributor has gone bankrupt, doesn't have insurance, or doesn't have \nany money. What happens then if some of these even more dangerous \nchemicals, certainly more dangerous chemicals than MTBE, leak? Who \nwould pay? This fund will pay.\n  The point is, Shouldn't we make sure we are thinking clearly about \nthis issue? What is wrong with having within this legislation language \nthat affirms a classical understanding of liability? That is what it is \nall about.\n  Companies get nervous. You get a water system that has some MTBE in \nit, which is not a cancer-causing substance, it is not a disease-\ncausing substance, according to every report I have seen. If enough of \nthe substance gets into the water, it will have a bad taste and \nunpleasant smell, and it is bad--we don't want it in our water system--\nbut it has not proven to be any kind of significant health hazard, to \nmy understanding----\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Has the Senator been in a home that has MTBE pollution?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No, I have not.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the Senator--Mr. President, I ask the Senator a \nquestion--I suggest the Senator might want to go to a home with MTBE \npollution before the Senator makes the representation the home is \nlivable.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I didn't say the home. I understand the water smells. \nIs the Senator aware of any report that says MTBE is a cancer-causing \nsubstance?\n  Mr. GREGG. I didn't suggest that MTBE was cancer causing. The Senator \nsuggested it is not a health hazard. I ask the Senator, if a person \ncannot live in their home, is that not a health hazard? If a person \ncannot take a shower, is that not a health hazard? If a person cannot \ndrink the water, is that not a health hazard?\n  Is that the Senator's position, that if you cannot live in your home, \nif you cannot shower, if you cannot drink the water you, therefore, do \nnot have a health hazard? Is that the Senator's position?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator's position is this--if someone polluted \nyour water so you can't drink it, and did so to the required degree of \nnegligence and liability, they are responsible for it and should pay.\n  The question is, What if you didn't do anything that justifies a \nlawsuit? What if you had no connection whatsoever? You made MTBE and \nsomebody takes it and pollutes your house with it. Who is responsible? \nI can tell you what the law has been historically in America.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The person who caused the action, made the house \nuninhabitable, that is who should pay; not the person who made the \nsubstance.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it the Senator's position that if a person cannot use \ntheir house, cannot use the water, cannot take a shower, that person \nshould be barred from suing the potential people who are responsible \nfor that and that a State that has brought an action on that issue \nshould have a law passed by the Congress which says that action brought \nby that State will no longer be in existence?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Two questions there. One is the existing lawsuit \nquestion. The Senator makes a legitimate point and expresses a \nlegitimate concern. Frankly, I am not sure it is fully meritorious, but \nhe certainly raises a legitimate concern.\n  The second point is, Who should be responsible? That is the question. \nThat is all, as I understand it, this legislation deals with.\n  If this legislation were to say that the person who is responsible \nfor putting the MTBE in a New Hampshire citizen's home was not liable, \nI would oppose it. But if they took asphalt and dumped it in somebody's \nhome, should the asphalt maker be liable if they were not responsible \nfor putting it in that home? That is the legal question with which we \nare dealing.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it, therefore, the Senator's position that the \ndetermination of whether or not the person who polluted the water in \nthat home which is no longer livable, can't take a shower and can't \ndrink the water, that the person who seeks redress on that should have \nthe Congress unilaterally decide that a product which appears to have a \nfairly significant proximity to the problem should no longer be subject \nto liability simply because the product has been designed in a certain \nway, and that it should be the Congress--many Members of Congress never \nhaving even been in that home or a home of a similar nature--that \nshould eliminate the capacity of that individual to have redress in a \nlawsuit? Would it not be a court's decision or jury's decision to make \nthe determination if the product was produced without defect, that \nproduct should not be liable rather than the Congress unilaterally \ndeciding that product should not be liable?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for the question. I think it is a \ngood one. I just hosted and chaired a hearing on the question of \nrestaurants that sell food that might cause obesity. The question is, \nIs a restaurant that makes a good cake responsible for somebody's \nobesity? They made the product that perhaps made the person overweight \nand obese, but they are not responsible for it. Should Congress act?\n  I think it is perfectly appropriate and fair that the Congress set \nthe rules for litigation in America. We established when the statute of \nlimitations runs. We established a lot of rules. In fact, we \nestablished basically that MTBE should be used. It was a congressional \naction that required this to be done before I arrived in the Senate.\n  I don't know how the Senator from New Hampshire voted on that \nlegislation. It was a good Government environment bill at the time. \nSenator Daschle, I believe, was the prime sponsor of it.\n  The question is this, Companies make a substance. Somebody else \nspills it in the environment. Now we are going to have the person who \nmade it, because maybe they have good insurance, pay for cleaning up \nany place in America that this stuff was spilled? I don't think so. Of \ncourse, we have in this bill liability protection for ethanol, and the \nHouse stuck in the liability protection for MTBE. It really was not \nconsidered in the Senate, I admit, but I think it is appropriate we \nfollow through with it. At least I believe there is a strong \njustification for it. I don't believe this bill should be blocked on \nthat basis.\n  Mr. TALENT. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. TALENT. I wonder if the Senator's position isn't similar to mine, \non the point the Senator from New Hampshire raised, that we at least \nshould not refuse to vote on a bill that could mean millions of jobs \nfor everybody in the country in all sections of the country because of \none provision in the bill which could perhaps be fixed or compromised \nin some other legislation. I wonder if that isn't the Senator's \nposition.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is a very good point. I know a number of \nSenators who favor this bill said they would be open to consider \nreforming it on a short basis if there was any abuse. Any language of \nthis kind deserves to be carefully examined. I understand New Hampshire \nhas filed a lawsuit that might be prohibited by this legislation, so I \ncan understand the Senator from New Hampshire being concerned about \nthat.\n  From what I understand, if the fundamental principle in the \nlegislation appears to be sound, I can be supportive of it. If, in its \napplication, it is unfair and unjust, I would be prepared to support \nreform.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the Senator for yielding for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, it is a real pleasure for me to come down \nand speak on behalf of the Energy Policy\n\n[[Page S15177]]\n\nAct. I want to begin by congratulating those involved in the conference \ncommittee who reached an agreement upon it.\n  I saw my friend, the senior Senator from Iowa. He certainly did \nyeomen's work on behalf of a provision that is very important to us in \nMissouri: The renewable fuel standard, as well as the biodiesel tax \ncredit. I am going to begin my brief remarks and end them by commenting \non those provisions. They stand to create hundreds of thousands of jobs \nin the short term around the country and in the long term have the \npotential not just to revolutionize family production by bringing in a \nwhole new wave of value-added enterprise but also help create energy \nindependence for this country.\n  As we have said on this floor on many occasions, when we are able to \ngrow our own fuel, by growing corn, by growing soybeans, and turning \nthem into fuel that we can burn in our cars, it just revolutionizes \ninternational relations in the world and also helps the environment and \nprotects the economy as well. This bill is a major step in that \ndirection. For that reason alone, I think it deserves to be voted on \nand passed.\n  There are provisions in this bill, as the Senator from North Dakota \nsaid before in his very eloquent remarks, that all of us would pick out \nor change if we could. But this is one Energy bill that this Congress \nhas had to write for a very diverse country. I would suggest, when we \nare trying to come out of a recession, when we are trying to create \njobs, when we are trying to achieve energy independence for this \ncountry, now is the time for statesmanship, not obstruction. Now is the \ntime for compromise rather than confrontation over discrete points of a \nvery big bill. Now is the time to move forward with all the good parts \nof this bill that we know are going to create jobs, that we know are \ngoing to help create energy independence, that we know are going to be \ngood for the environment, with a view toward getting together afterward \nand helping to fix or reform the parts of the bill about which we may \nhave some doubts. I hope we can do that. I hope we can get a vote on \nthis bill.\n  I hope in particular that we will not see that weapon, the \nfilibuster, hauled out to stop us from even expressing an opinion on \nthe first national energy policy that this Congress has ever really \npassed.\n  We have heard much discussion in the last week or two about the \nimportance of jobs. I very much believe in that. We cannot do anything \nwe want to do in this country, we cannot do education, we cannot have \nhealth care, we cannot have defense, we cannot have opportunity without \nprosperity, and we cannot have that without jobs. This bill flat \ncreates jobs. It will protect hundreds of thousands of jobs against \nbeing lost. It will create nearly a million. The natural gas and coal \nprovisions, which are not those over which Missouri has a parochial \ninterest but which I strongly support, would create more than 400,000 \ndirect and indirect new jobs just through the construction of the \nAlaska natural gas pipeline, which will at the same time bring \naffordable energy to the lower 48 States, 38,000 direct jobs, 80,000 \nindirect jobs, an estimated 400,000 jobs from the multiplier effect. \nThe investment the bill provides for in clean coal technology creates \n62,000 jobs; 40,000 construction jobs created by the construction of \napproximately 27 large new clean coal plants.\n\n  When we use this clean coal technology and we make coal \nenvironmentally safe, we secure America's energy future because we have \nhundreds of years of reserves of coal. There is no reason not to move \nforward so as to create the possibility of reliance upon that even more \ngreatly in the future, if necessary.\n  The renewable fuel standard I will discuss in a few minutes. Nuclear \nenergy, building a first of its kind nuclear reactor to co-generate \nhydrogen will create 3,000 construction jobs and 500 long-term high-\npaying, high-tech jobs. I toured the nuclear energy plant in Missouri \nin Callaway County just a few weeks ago. It is the wave of the future. \nWe can have more nuclear energy plants like that securing energy for \nour people around this country. This bill is a key to achieving that.\n  Some examples of job losses that the Energy Policy Act will prevent \nin the future, these are job losses we have had in the past: The Potash \nCorporation, one of the world's largest producers of fertilizer \nproducts located in Northbrook, IL, and Canada, that spends $2 million \nper day on natural gas, has announced layoffs at its Louisiana and \nTennessee plants.\n  Economists predict that Louisiana's chemical industry will lose more \nthan 2,000 jobs in the next 2 years. I have had people come and visit \nme from the chemical industry saying they are being forced to push jobs \noffshore because of the high cost of energy. I have had manufacturers \nin Missouri tell me that the high cost of energy and the \nunpredictability of the cost of energy is driving jobs offshore. It \ndoes not have to be that way. We can have an energy policy that \nencourages all different kinds of energy--the traditional forms, the \nalternative forms. This bill does that.\n  No, the bill is not really liked too much, if I may so, by those on \nthe extreme ends of either part of the political spectrum. There are \nsome who do not want the Government involved at all, even in \nstimulating the production of supply of energy. There are others who \nfor other reasons on the other side of the spectrum do not want the \nprivate market to be stimulated for the production of energy. But \nAmericans are out there, Missourians are out there, worrying about the \nloss of their jobs, worrying about what opportunities are going to be \navailable in the future. Access to affordable, stable supplies of \nenergy of all kinds is a key to this country's prosperity and \nindependence, and that is what it comes down to.\n  Those of us on the Energy Committee, on both sides of the aisle in \nthe Senate, have had that target in view from the minute that we began \nwriting this bill. The Senator from Tennessee is certainly well aware \nof that because of the major part that he played in it.\n  I close by talking about the special importance of the renewable \nfuels section of this bill. Everybody back home is so pleased that we \nhave recognized in this Congress, by an overwhelming margin, the \nimportance of ethanol and biodiesel to this Nation's energy supply. The \nbill will increase ethanol production and the use of ethanol \nthroughout our national economy to 5 billion gallons by the year 2012. \nIt will create 214,000 jobs, $5.3 billion in new investment in \nrenewable fuels production facilities. The biodiesel tax credit of a \ndollar is groundbreaking for the production of biodiesel in this \ncountry. With this tax credit, we can expect biodiesel, in just a few \nyears, to be in the same situation that ethanol is now, and a few years \nafter that the situation that ethanol will be in in the future, one of \nthe mainstays of energy production. These are a key to value-added \nenterprises as well.\n\n  I will never forget on a day I was traveling around central Missouri \nand I talked to some corn farmers and they were talking about commodity \nprices. They were pretty depressed, and there has been a lot of reason \nto be depressed about prices of corn in the last 2 years. They did not \nreally see a lot of hope. These were great producers, efficient \nproducers, but they knew even if prices creeped up, one change in the \ninternational situation might push them down again. Then I went to the \nethanol plant in Macon, the same kind of producers, but these were \ninvestors in the ethanol plant. One of them pulled me aside. There was \nan air of optimism there, an air of energy. One of them pulled me aside \nand said: Jim, the good thing about this is when the price of corn goes \ndown, I just make more money off the ethanol. That is what value-added \nenterprises mean to family production in this country.\n  If we lose family farmers, if we lose the family production sector in \nthis country, we lose something that we cannot recover, the values that \ngo with an attachment to and a belief in the land. Value-added \nenterprises, of which the chief is renewable fuel, is the future for \nfamily producers. It is the future for energy independence in the \ncountry as well.\n  We are proud in Missouri, as I know the Presiding Officer is proud in \nMinnesota, of the leadership role we have played in the production of \nethanol. We expect to have a leadership role, we do, and expect our \nleadership role to grow in the production of biodiesel. That is what \nthis bill provides for.\n\n[[Page S15178]]\n\n  I close by saying that although there are many parts of the bill that \nare going to help Missouri, there is no question about that, and I am \nenthusiastic about it, I am pleased to have participated in writing a \nlot of the bill, and pleased to vote for it, there are many parts of it \nI like. This renewable fuels section is really important to Missouri. \nAgriculture and tourism are the two biggest parts of Missouri's \neconomy.\n  This bill is a joint effort. I think it is idle for any section of \nthe country or any group of Senators who want a particular kind of \nenergy to believe that they can get what they want for their section of \nthe country, or that they can get what they want for the kind of energy \nsupplies that they favor apart from a bill like this that helps \neverybody pull together. We cannot unravel this thing and pass a bunch \nof different bills. It is not going to happen. We are one country. We \nhave to rely on many different sources of energy, but it has to be one \npolicy. We have to have it all in one policy. It is not going to be \nperfect, but it is going to make a difference for the future. To the \nextent that it is not perfect, we can work on it.\n  I would so much rather have a view of legislation that says, look, we \nwould rather go ahead knowing that we will take what is good and we can \nwork on the things that we are concerned about than stopping everything \nbecause we cannot achieve that perfection given the state of human \nnature and the realistic possibilities in which we have to operate.\n  I am going to be pleased to support this bill. I urge Senators who \nhave greater doubts than I do, or maybe who have themselves dug in on \none issue or another, to try to work out an arrangement with the \nbipartisan group of Senators who have pushed this bill for so long. I \nknow the Senator from New Mexico is ready to talk. The leadership is \nready to talk. I am hopeful we will see the leaders on both sides of \nthe aisle supporting this bill.\n  Now, as I said before, is the time for us to pull together and send a \nclear signal to this country that we can and will pass a comprehensive \nnational energy policy that will create a stable and affordable supply \nof energy for years to come and allow our entrepreneurs, our \nmanufacturers, our farmers, our small business people, to move ahead \nwith the predictability that a stable energy supply gives them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Unemployment Insurance Extension\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know we are still under consideration \nof the Energy conference report and many Members have been to the floor \ntalking about the prescription drug conference report as well.\n  Before we adjourn, whatever date that is, sometime in the very near \nfuture, hopefully before the Thanksgiving holiday, it is imperative \nthat this body take a stance and pass the unemployment benefit \nextension before we go home.\n  We are in the same position we were in virtually a year ago. What has \nchanged? The economy might have gotten slightly better but not really \nmuch better. We have a .4 percent improvement in the unemployment rate. \nWe in Washington State are still just above 7 percent in unemployment.\n  The reason we do the unemployment benefit extension program at the \nFederal level is to help States, which includes those that have been \nhardest hit by unemployment, get some extra weeks of unemployment \nbenefits. It has been a successful program in the times of downturns of \nour economy. During the first Bush and Clinton administrations, when \nour economy was not doing so well, we basically extended Federal \nunemployment benefits for a total of 30 months. At that time, the \nbenefits were at the Federal level, 20 additional weeks.\n  We are at this point in time now where we have extended the Federal \nprogram in this recession for about 22 months. Yet while we have seen a \nslight economic improvement, as I said, .4 percent, I believe it is not \nenough to continue the improvements we would like to see in our \neconomy.\n  In an economic downturn, make no mistake about it, working Americans \nwould rather have a paycheck than an unemployment check. But giving \npeople an unemployment check in times of tough economic situations \nhelps our economy overall. Every $1 spent on unemployment benefits \ngenerates $2.15 of stimulus. That is mortgage payments paid, health \ncare bills that are met, a continuation of the economy at the most \nstable level we can have when we are not seeing job increases.\n  It is vitally important, before we adjourn--we have spent all this \ntime debating judges and there was a good debate on both sides--we get \nback to some of the basic issues that need to be accomplished before we \nadjourn. Certainly unemployment benefits, I believe, should be that \npriority.\n  What is going to happen in December if we adjourn sometime next \nweek--this program expires at the end of December. What is likely, if \nthat happens, is we will see 90,000 people at the national level fall \noff this benefit program and as many as 2 million people in the first \nseveral months of the year could be without unemployment benefits.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I hope the economy improves. But I don't \nthink we are seeing an indication it will improve that rapidly that \nsoon. To leave these people without benefits at a time when we could be \nstimulating the economy is irresponsible.\n  For Washington State, the numbers are similar. We have about 200,000 \npeople in Washington State who will exhaust their benefits in the first \n6 months of 2004. I would rather those people be receiving some \nbenefits and having the certainty of receiving those benefits now, even \nif it is a shorter extension period.\n\n  The challenge we ran into last December as we bantered back and \nforth--and, actually, the Senate did the right thing in the eleventh \nhour by passing the unemployment benefit extension; the House decided \nnot to act on it. What happened was we left many Americans without \ncertainty of the unemployment benefits.\n  Some of my colleagues believe nothing happened, that when we got back \nin January we reconstituted that program and people did not lose a \nthing. That is not true. I know constituents who made alternative \nplans, not knowing whether Congress had the intention of extending the \nunemployment benefit program. There was not the certainty. I had \nconstituents who took money out of pension programs with 30 percent \npenalties, basically trading off their long-term investment for short-\nterm return because they did not think we were going to extend \nbenefits.\n  We ought to give working Americans some certainty that as this \neconomy continues to struggle, we are going to be there with \nunemployment benefits.\n  My colleague from Nevada has cited several times that many Members of \nCongress voted to terminate this program. In the 1990s, after we had \nthe 30 months of an extension of employment benefits by both the Bush \nand Clinton administrations, and after we had a 1.2 percent improvement \nin the unemployment rate, yes, we curtailed that program. However, we \nare doing less now, less under more severe economic conditions, than \nthe first President Bush and President Clinton did during that time \nperiod. They went for 30 months. They had a Federal program that was 20 \nweeks instead of the 13 we have now, and they only curtailed the \nprogram once they saw a better return to the economy.\n  I encourage my colleagues to put this bill on the priority list for \nthe next several days. Let's figure out a way to give unemployed \nAmericans some certainty as they face the holiday season. Let's give \nthose millions of people who are going to be impacted by not having \nthis Federal program continued some relief and know we will be also \nholding up our economy. Let's not say to people that this Congress went \nahead and passed tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans, did a \nvariety of things that may have been targeted tax credits, but failed \nto extend to hard-working Americans the unemployment benefit program \ninto which they have paid.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to legislative \nsession\n\n[[Page S15179]]\n\nand the Finance Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nS. 1853, a bill to extend unemployment insurance; that the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration; the bill be read the third time \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have had a number of Senators come \nto the floor in support of the bill and others who have used this as an \nopportunity to highlight their opposition to one aspect of the bill or \nanother. The bill finally establishes a comprehensive energy policy, \nand I do urge my colleagues to look at the bill not just piece by piece \nbut in its entirety. Chairman Domenici had to negotiate a whole range \nof tough issues to put together a bill that requires a very fragile \nbalance, as people even more fully understand this and come to the \nfloor to address different aspects of the bill.\n  I understand there are some Members who want to preserve their rights \non this legislation and who don't want to allow a time limitation. But \ngiven the importance of the legislation, at this juncture I send a \ncloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate to the conference \n     report H.R. 6, the energy policy bill to enhance energy \n     conservation and research and development, to provide for \n     security and diversity in the energy supply for the American \n     people, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Pete Domenici, John Cornyn, Mike Crapo, Larry \n           Craig, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Michael B.

Mr. President, in these difficult days when the brave \nmen and women of our Armed Forces face such great dangers in Iraq, we \ncontinue to mourn the losses of our heroes who gave their lives in past \nwars. One of those heroes is Major Richard W. Cooper, Jr., of Holyoke, \nMA, and his loss is very much in our minds now. Major Cooper was a \nnavigator aboard a B-52 bomber from Westover Air Force Base. He was on \none of the final bombing runs in the Vietnam War in 1972, and his plane \nwent down on December 19 of that year. He has been listed as Missing in \nAction ever since. The Air Force never gave up the search and recently, \nhis remains were discovered and identified through the Joint Task Force \nFull Accounting operation in Vietnam. Next month, on December 19, at \nlong last, 31 years to the day after his final mission for our country, \nMajor Cooper will be laid to rest with full military honors in \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  Major Cooper earned many decorations for his loyal service to our \ncountry, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, and we honor his \ngreat courage. Our Nation has often called its sons and daughters into \nharm's way, and their families bear the scars of battle forever. \nAmerica owes an enormous debt of gratitude to Major Cooper and his \nfamily, and our thoughts and prayers are very much with them now. \nMassachusetts is proud of him and so is our country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to honor a Virginia \nSoldier, CWO Sharon T. Swartworth, who was tragically killed in action \nin Iraq on Friday, November 7, 2003. I want to express gratitude, on \nbehalf of the Senate, for her service to our Nation. The American \npeople, I am certain, join me in expressing their prayers and \ncompassion to her family.\n  CWO Sharon T. Swartworth entered the Army shortly before her \neighteenth birthday, her father signing the papers allowing her to \nenlist early. ``She traveled around the world before she was assigned \nto the Pentagon.'' She understood the importance of her present \nassignment and despite the personal risk, wanted to serve the United \nStates and the people of Iraq during this critical time.\n  A warrant officer of the Judge Advocate General's Corps, she served \nas the primary adviser to the judge advocate general on all matters \nconcerning legal administrators in the Army. She was temporarily in \nIraq to process awards for deserving soldiers and to ensure the legal \nneeds of soldiers were being met.\n  CWO Sharon T. Swartworth leaves behind: her son, William III; her \nhusband, William, a captain of the Naval Medical Corps; and her father, \nBernard Mayo.\n  I, among many friends and colleagues, attended the ceremony at \nArlington Cemetery. Her family, who has borne this tragedy with \ndignity, are brave souls who have sacrificed so much for this Nation. \nWe owe them and the other families who have lost their loved ones a \ndebt of gratitude.\n  She was an exceptional woman with a bright future and family in front \nof her. Her father related, ``She did it all, and we can be proud of \nher. She was a soldier.'' I can not craft a finer eulogy. The \nCommonwealth of Virginia and the entire Nation shall mourn her loss.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to learn yesterday \nof the death in Iraq of another of Vermont's sons. LT Pierre Piche of \nStarksboro, VT was one of 17 brave young soldiers who died in the crash \nof two Blackhawk helicopters last Saturday. This brings to five the \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S15180]]\n\nVermonters who have given their lives in Iraq.\n  The newspaper articles reporting on the death of Lieutenant Piche, \nand also on the Nov. 7 death of SSG Scott Rose, a young man whose wife \nand parents in-law are from Springfield, VT, bring home the heart-\nwrenching pain felt by those who have lost a son or daughter, mother or \nfather, sister or brother, or close friend in this war.\n  Lieutenant Piche was Lisa Johnson's only child. Ms. Johnson speaks of \nthe daily anxiety she faced hearing the reports of dead and wounded and \nwondering if it was her son. At first, she turned for consolation to \nher father, a World War II veteran. Tragically, he died in July. \nHearing reports of the helicopter crash last Saturday, she spent the \nrest of the weekend with her stomach in knots until she received a \nphone call from her daughter in-law, Cherish, with the simple, chilling \nwords ``They're here.''\n  Army officers had come to Lieutenant Piche's home to tell his wife \nthat the lieutenant was dead. An hour later, officers arrived at Ms. \nJohnson's home to deliver the same message.\n  Staff Sergeant Rose became a father for the first time on July 31. He \nnever saw his child, though. He already had left for Iraq and was \nunable to get home on leave before the tragic crash that ended his \nlife. His wife Michele Rose is now left to raise their infant daughter \nin his absence.\n  I have been concerned throughout this conflict, and most particularly \nduring the recent debate on the President's request for an additional \n$87 billion, that our focus on the financial costs and broader \nstrategic and tactical questions associated with the war has blinded us \nsomewhat to the brutal anguish faced by those who have lost a loved one \nin Iraq. We must never forget that each and every casualty suffered in \nIraq delivers a crushing blow to many here at home. Moreover, we must \nhave sympathy for the terrible anxiety faced daily by the families of \nmen and women serving in Iraq. This war has many victims and we must \nnot lose sight of their pain.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the two newspaper \narticles detailing this war's effects on the lives of these two Vermont \nfamilies.\n  There being objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Nov. 18, 2003]\n\n                   Fifth Vermont Soldier Dies in Iraq\n\n                         (By Brent Hallenbeck)\n\n       Starksboro.--Pierre Piche last spoke to his mother a few \n     weeks ago by phone from Iraq. He told her he wanted to come \n     home to his wife of 3 years and earn his master's degree so \n     he could become a teacher.\n       His mother had recently sent him a rubber koi fish, and he \n     said he planned to have a pond filled with the tranquil \n     Japanese fish. ``He tried not to focus on how dangerous it \n     was getting over there. He just wanted peace,'' his mother, \n     Lisa Johnson, said Monday afternoon at her home in \n     Starksboro. ``He was determined to do what he needed to do to \n     keep his men safe and get home.''\n       Piche, 28 and 16 of his fellow soldiers died Saturday when \n     their Black Hawk helicopters crashed, possibly as a result of \n     enemy fire, in Mosul, Iraq. The crash is the single deadliest \n     incident since the war began in Iraq 8 months ago.\n       Piche, a first lieutenant with the Army's 101st Airborne \n     Division, is the fifth soldier with Vermont roots to die in \n     the war. He is the only child of Lisa Johnson, who has wanted \n     to pull Piche back into her arms ever since he was deployed \n     to Iraq a month before the war began.\n       ``I wanted to take him home. When your child goes into \n     something dangerous, a mother goes and gets him,'' Johnson \n     said, fighting tears. ``It's been a pretty hellish time since \n     February.''\n       Piche grew up in Colchester, where he attended Malletts Bay \n     School. His mother remembers that Piche was a complex child \n     who would ask heavy questions about the origins of the \n     universe or the workings of the human body and expect, almost \n     demand, an answer.\n       ``When he was born I called him my Mr. Magoo because he was \n     this very serious little boy,'' she said, pointing to a \n     photograph of her and her 2-year-old son sitting in the \n     woods. The child was wearing an expression that was intense \n     but wise. ``He was like a little old man right away,'' she \n     said.\n       He was also ``full of all the right kind of mischief,'' \n     according to Hugh Johnson, who became his stepfather when \n     Piche was 6. He remembers once that his stepson tried \n     unsuccessfully to ride his bike up a boat ramp on dry land. \n     ``Suddenly there was a great tumbling of boy and steel,'' \n     Hugh Johnson said.\n       The family moved when Piche was 9 to South Hero, where he \n     attended Folsom School. Lisa Johnson said he demonstrated his \n     kindly nature by taking in all sorts of animals, from dogs \n     and cats to iguanas, chickens and geese.\n       The family moved to Starksboro when Piche was 14. He went \n     to private school in Connecticut, then college, including for \n     a time the University of Vermont. He graduated from Middle \n     Tennessee State in 1998 after majoring in political science.\n       Piche was always patriotic and believed in serving his \n     country, his mother said. While in college he joined the Army \n     Reserve and soon after entered the Army full-time, rising \n     through the ranks of the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell, KY, \n     where he and his wife, Cherish, made their home.\n       Pierre Piche made his final visit to Vermont last \n     Christmas. Friends and family came to Starksboro for festive \n     holiday parties. He took Cherish Piche, who has lived in the \n     South most of her life, out for snowmobile rides and sledding \n     expeditions.\n       War in Iraq was looming last December, and Piche and his \n     mother knew he was likely to be deployed. ``I deliberately \n     avoided that subject,'' Lisa Johnson said. ``He didn't want \n     to talk about it either. We knew, and there wasn't any \n     point.''\n       She held out hope he would be safe. Months earlier, he had \n     switched jobs, from a command post to maintenance duties that \n     would perhaps be less risky. ``The idea was he wouldn't be \n     out there on the front line,'' Hugh Johnson said.\n       Piche arrived in Iraq 9 months ago, and the Johnsons \n     followed the news intently from Starksboro. Whenever Lisa \n     Johnson heard a soldier died anywhere near where she believed \n     her son was she would cry, and immediately struggle to gather \n     her senses--as a social worker, she said it was essential to \n     be composed.\n       Her father, Robert Fusco of Jonesville, would console her. \n     A World War II veteran, Fusco would tell her Piche was well-\n     trained, smart and vigilant, and would make sure he and his \n     soldiers would come home. ``Anytime I got scared my father \n     would tell me to toughen up,'' Lisa Johnson said. Fusco died \n     of heart failure July 8, proud to the end of his grandson's \n     accomplishments.\n       Piche e-mailed his mother often, and recently sent photos \n     showing him in his cropped brown hair and brown camouflage \n     while holding an automatic weapon.\n       Another photo showed him in uniform holding a dog. Lisa \n     Johnson said he frequently discovered abandoned pets in Iraq \n     and tried to find good homes for them. ``Even in the middle \n     of chaos he could find good things,'' she said. ``That's what \n     good guys do.''\n       Piche's unit was being moved from one location to another \n     Saturday, a move he was dreading. He told his mother that \n     Iraq was becoming a more dangerous place--more aggressive, \n     less predictable.\n       She heard Saturday about the two helicopters crashing in \n     Mosul. ``I spent the rest of the weekend in knots,'' she \n     said. She and Cherish Piche spoke by phone all day Saturday, \n     telling each other that they hoped by some fluke Piche was \n     not on either of those helicopters, and just couldn't get to \n     a computer to e-mail either of them to say he was safe. Then \n     Cherish Piche called Sunday afternoon. Her words were simple: \n     ``They're here.'' Army soldiers had come to her home at Fort \n     Campbell to say that her husband was dead.\n       An hour later, at 5 p.m., two soldiers came to the gray \n     Cape Cod on Big Hollow Road to give Lisa and Hugh Johnson the \n     same news. ``I just said, `No, no, no,' and I went outside \n     and I was crazy,'' Lisa Johnson said. She wandered through \n     the miles of woods behind her home. ``I just cried and \n     screamed--`No, it can't be, it just can't be.' ''\n       Hugh Johnson said he knows that if he could, his stepson \n     would have been trying to save his fellow soldiers until the \n     last minute. Pride doesn't translate to solace, not when \n     parents are mourning the loss of a son who was always giving \n     to others. ``It's such a waste,'' Hugh Johnson said. ``He \n     should have had another 60 years of doing that.'' ``I'm proud \n     of him and I'm proud of him no matter what,'' Lisa Johnson \n     said. ``That doesn't make his dying any easier.''\n       The Johnsons and Piche's widow are making funeral \n     arrangements while awaiting for his body to return home. Lisa \n     Johnson said they hope to bury him near his grandfather, \n     Fusco, at Holy Rosary Cemetery in Richmond.\n       Meanwhile, the family is welcoming a constant flow of \n     visitors bearing generous amounts of food and any words of \n     consolation they can muster. The food and the words are \n     appreciated, Lisa Johnson said, but not important. ``All that \n     matters,'' she said, ``is that they loved him.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 18, 2003]\n\n        Soldier Killed in Iraq Will Be Eulogized in Springfield\n\n                          (By Susan Smallheer)\n\n       Springfield.--An Army soldier who died in Iraq without ever \n     holding his newborn daughter will be eulogized with full \n     military honors Saturday in Springfield. Staff Sgt. Scott C. \n     Rose, 30, whose wife, Michele, is from Springfield, will \n     receive full military honors and a special farewell Saturday \n     at St. Mary's Catholic Church, according to Rose's father, \n     Alfred Rose of Fayetteville, N.C.\n       Rose was one of six soldiers who died on Nov. 7 near Tikrit \n     when their Black Hawk helicopter came under attack, exploded \n     and fell to the ground. He had been in Iraq since April. Rose \n     was the crew chief.\n\n[[Page S15181]]\n\n       Alfred Rose said his son and his wife met at North Carolina \n     State University and married, living at Fort Campbell, Ky., \n     the base of the 101st Airborne Division. Michele (Basso) Rose \n     gave birth to their daughter Meghan Louise at Fort Campbell \n     on July 31, and the baby never met her father, the elder Rose \n     said.\n       Rose said that he was able to hook up a Web camera so his \n     son could watch the baby over the Internet from Iraq, but \n     that he died before he was able to get leave and come home to \n     visit his new daughter. She is the couple's only child.\n       Rose said his son died with three of his fellow crew \n     members, all of whom were very close friends. According to \n     news reports, the Black Hawk was transporting two officials \n     from the Army's Judge Advocate General corps from the \n     Pentagon when the helicopter was hit.\n       Alfred Rose, himself a retired lieutenant colonel from the \n     82nd Airborne Division, said his son's mission on Nov. 7 was \n     to transport ``command and control'' personnel from Mosul to \n     Tikrit. His son was the crew chief.\n       He said his son was born in Attleboro, Mass., but grew up \n     in North Carolina, attending high school in Fayetteville. He \n     was captain of the wrestling team and also played soccer, was \n     also involved in drama and debate. He graduated second in his \n     class and attended North Carolina State on a full Navy \n     scholarship.\n       But he switched to the Army even after receiving orders to \n     the Navy's prestigious flight school in Pensacola, Fla., his \n     father said, to combine his love of flying and his wish to be \n     a family man. Navy flight training involves six month stints \n     on aircraft carriers. ``However, the world situation turned \n     sour and he was deployed nearly continuously from Bosnia to \n     the NCO School in Virginia and immediately to Iraq. Scott \n     badly wanted to join his unit, which was already over \n     there,'' his father recalled.\n       His father called him ``the Tom Cruise of the Lancer flight \n     line, he loved his work, he loved to teach others.'' ``He was \n     one of those rare great men, soldier, leader, husband, father \n     . . . our son,'' he said.\n       The elder Rose said his son's unit was not expected back \n     from Iraq until February or March 2004. According to an \n     article in the Fayetteville Observer, Rose had started flying \n     when he was 14 years old. In college, he started studying \n     aeronautical engineering, but switched to history.\n       His son called his helicopter ``Goat 26431.'' He named it \n     so in honor of his grandfather's military aircraft, which was \n     also nicknamed Goat. His grandfather also died on active \n     duty.\n       The father said his son's helicopter came under fire the \n     morning of Nov. 7. A second Black Hawk helicopter was \n     following close behind and was not hit, but Rose said those \n     in the second helicopter heard the impact of the weapon, saw \n     flames erupt and his son's helicopter crash. At the time the \n     helicopter was hit, they were about 280 feet above the ground \n     and had slowed to make a landing in a designated area.\n       His son received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, as well \n     as the Army Commendation medal. His wife's father and \n     stepmother, Alfred and Paula Basso, live on Poppe Road in \n     Springfield, according to William Young, director of the \n     David Memorial Chapel, which is working closely with the \n     military to plan Saturday's funeral. Details of the service \n     are still being worked out, according to a spokesman at the \n     funeral home.\n       Young said Rose would not be buried in Vermont as his \n     remains were being cremated. The elder Rose said that a \n     memorial account in his son's name has been set up to benefit \n     his infant daughter at the Bryant Credit Union in \n     Springfield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/19/senate-section/article/S15181-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On October 25, 2003, a Miami, FL, teen was charged with a hate crime \nafter police say he harassed a 19-year-old woman driving with a gay \npride sticker on her car.\n  The teen leaned out of his car window at a traffic light to make an \nobscene gesture toward the young woman and said to her, ``We hate \nfaggots . . . we kill people like you.'' The truck pulled up to her \nagain at the next light where he continued to make lewd comments and \ngestures. The teen cut in front of the woman and hit his brakes, \ncausing the woman's car to swerve, according to police. Police say the \ndriver then swerved his truck three times towards the woman's car, \nrunning her off the road.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/19/senate-section/article/S15181-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15181-S15182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SBA ASSISTANCE FOLLOWING HURRICANE ISABEL\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I wish to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues the well-coordinated and rapid response of the good people \nfrom the United States Small Business Administration in the days and \nweeks that have followed the disaster caused by Hurricane Isabel.\n  Virginia is still recovering from this terrible natural disaster. In \nVirginia, initial assessments indicate that 1,062 homes were destroyed; \nover 8,800 homes sustained major damage; 1.8 million customers lost \nelectricity of varying duration from a day to over a week; there were \n28 deaths in the Commonwealth; crop losses are in the tens of millions; \nand total damages are in the billions to homes, businesses, \ntransportation and other infrastructure facilities.\n  Our Commonwealth was devastated and the residents of Virginia, as \nthey always do, have come together to help neighbors repair damages, to \nhelp families find housing and to console those who lost loved ones in \ntheir time of grief.\n  Soon after the storm cut across Virginia, and the economic impact \nbegan to be felt, I contacted Small Business Administration leaders, \nseeking to bring direct assistance to these affected businesses. On \nSeptember 22, SBA representatives responded quickly. My colleague, John \nWarner, and I toured the significant damage to many flooded small \nbusinesses in Old Town Alexandria, VA.\n  The quick response, expertise and enthusiasm of the SBA leaders gave \nhope to small business owners who were upset at the great losses and \nburdened by damage to their infrastructure, uncertainty when to reopen, \nloss of inventory, very little capital and lost incomes. The people saw \nthat there was help, that it was not just their own sweat, worry and \nfurrowed brows, but that the SBA was there to assist them directly.\n  Herb Mitchell, associate administrator for the Office of Disaster \nAssistance at the SBA, Anthony Bedell, associate administrator for the \nOffice of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, Sue Hensley, associate \nadministrator for the Office of Communications and Public Liaison and \ntheir leader Melanie Sabelhaus, Deputy Administrator for the SBA walked \nwith us while we viewed the damage first hand, talking with business \nowners who were able to ask specific questions and receive answers and \nsolutions.\n  On the spot, Melanie Sabelhaus of the SBA also set up an onsite \nBusiness Disaster Recovery Center with the local Chamber of Commerce in \nOld Town Alexandria to help business owners who suffered loss. Our top \npriority was to get small businesses dried out, disinfected and back in \nbusiness, and I am proud that this team effort has proceeded \nsuccessfully. By getting our boots in the mud, we were able to get a \ndirect, human response to promptly assist distressed small business \nowners, who are the backbone of the American economy.\n  Later the same week they answered my call and came with me again to \nsoutheastern Virginia, to places such as Burwell's Bay in Isle of Wight \nCounty, Suffolk and Wakefield in Sussex County. There we witnessed the \nterrible devastation. People there not only experienced great trauma, \ndifficulty and loss, they were still without power, looking to the SBA \nfor assistance, which was able to provide human, personal attention to \nhelp get them up and running again. Small businesses such as Cameron \nChemical and the Marina Restaurant, whose owners we were able to talk \nwith, which were forced to close their businesses indefinitely, and \nwhich together employ dozens of hard-working Virginians were given \nhands-on assistance by the SBA to reopen in a timely manner. Low \ninterest loans, business disruption assistance from the SBA visibly \ncheered their faces with hope and gratitude. Traveling with me again \nwas Melanie Sabelhaus, along with Anne Bradbury, assistant \nadministrator for congressional affairs and Becky Brantley, assistant \nadministrator for disaster assistance.\n  I commend the Small Business Administration's leadership, under the \ndirection of Administrator Hector\n\n[[Page S15182]]\n\nBarreto, Jr., and the entire team at the SBA. They responded to each of \nmy requests and demonstrated knowledge, experience and genuine care by \nhelping small businesses get clean, dry, rebuilt and open again for \ncustomers and employees. Their enthusiastic outreach truly gave hope to \nmany owners and employees. And, as a U.S. Senator, one can often try to \nget Federal agencies to help people. From my perspective, the Small \nBusiness Administration is demonstrably one of the very best lead teams \nin the Federal Government. On behalf of Virginians, I thank them for \ntheir special care. Many small entrepreneurs are open for business due \nto our efforts. It is a satisfying job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/19/senate-section/article/S15182-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life \nand legacy of Delegate Pete Rawlings. He was a big man with a big \nheart--who leaves an indelible mark on the people of Maryland.\n  The Baltimore Sun said Delegate Rawlings had ``the passion of a civil \nrights activist and the analytical mind of a mathematician combined \nwith the savvy of a backroom pol.'' I think that captures him \nperfectly.\n  Delegate Rawlings used America's unique opportunity structure to \nbuild a life of accomplishment and of service. But more importantly, he \nexpanded that opportunity structure for thousands of others. In over a \nquarter century in the House of Delegates, Pete Rawlings was known as a \nman of principle who put his principles into action.\n  Mathematician and politician, educator and leader, Pete Rawlings may \nbe best remembered for his untiring advocacy to improve education for \nall. He was an unfailing advocate for education. He used his power and \ninfluence to provide an unprecedented State commitment to education, a \n$1.3 billion commitment that the State recognized it would be \nconstitutionally bound to fulfill. Maryland's schools are better today \nbecause of Delegate Rawlings.\n  The passing of Delegate Rawlings is a tragedy, but his life was a \ntriumph. His wife, Dr. Nina Cole, and his children, Wendall Rawlings, \nLisa Rawlings, and Councilwoman Stephanie C. Rawlings Black are in my \nthoughts and prayers.\n  I ask that an editorial from the Baltimore Sun be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Nov. 16, 2003]\n\n                                  Pete\n\n       He'd thunder and preach, he'd deplore and beseech, he'd \n     count pennies and votes and usually come out on the money.\n       With the death Friday of Del. Howard P. ``Pete'' Rawlings, \n     Maryland lost an extraordinarily gifted leader and one of the \n     most accomplished politicians of his era--known for both a \n     tight fist and a caring heart.\n       Mr. Rawlings' intellectual grasp of policy detail and \n     instinct for mastering the levers of power propelled him to a \n     top post in the General Assembly. His greatest contributions \n     arose, however, from his willingness to take on the unpopular \n     yet critical tasks of fiscal management.\n       He never forgot his West Baltimore constituents, yet he had \n     the rare courage to sometimes tell them no.\n       Such was the force of his conviction that he managed not \n     only to survive such battles but to prosper. His remarkable \n     legacy includes a new generation of political leaders he \n     mentored along the way.\n       As a freshman delegate, part of a tiny minority of black \n     lawmakers, Mr. Rawlings claimed his seat on the House \n     Appropriations Committee in 1979 and immediately started \n     breaking the rules. He publicly questioned every spending \n     item, including those dear to the hearts of his committee \n     mates, wanting to know what good the money would do for ``his \n     people.''\n       Colleagues rolled their eyes. Who was this guy? They were \n     used to machine-backed black legislators who were reliable \n     votes, and to the ``screamers'' who would grandstand in \n     protest of the system but never get anything done. In Mr. \n     Rawlings, they found the passion of a civil rights activist \n     and the analytical mind of a mathematician combined with the \n     savvy of a backroom pol.\n       He was quickly tagged as a ``comer,'' was named to a \n     subcommittee chairmanship and by 1992 was awarded the gavel \n     of Appropriations Committee chairman.\n       Running Appropriations in Annapolis isn't like in Congress, \n     where the bounty flows seemingly without limit. In Maryland, \n     the budget has to balance. Mr. Rawlings made it his business \n     to try to ensure the taxpayers' money was being spent wisely.\n       He battled with Baltimore mayors and officials of Morgan \n     State University. He authored reforms in education, housing \n     and health care. He brought home the bacon as he saw fit.\n       The strongest testimony to his style may be his endorsement \n     of Martin O'Malley in the 1999 mayoral race against black \n     competitors, thus awarding the job of running a majority-\n     black city to a white politician Mr. Rawlings thought better \n     qualified.\n       Much of Mr. Rawlings' success stemmed from the sense that \n     he was not interested in power for its own sake, but for what \n     he could accomplish. That, and a deep bass voice that boomed \n     with such moral authority it seemed to come from the heavens.\n       His passing robs Baltimore of its most effective and \n     empathetic advocate. All of Maryland, though, is poorer for \n     his loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/19/senate-section/article/S15182-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15182-S15183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     COMMENDING MAJOR FIRMAN RAY ON RECEIVING THE SILVER STAR MEDAL\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure and pride \nto rise today to honor a true Montana hero--MAJ Firman Ray. Major Ray \ngrew up in Butte and Stevensville. He attended the University of \nMontana. To this day, he remains a staunch Grizzly fan. His mother \nTempie Ray is a retired high school librarian in Stevensville. Firman \nis the nephew of Carl and Martha Davis from Dillon. At the Montana \nConstitutional Convention, I was Carl's intern. Furthermore, Firman's \nwife Sheila Hall Ray was my son's babysitter when we lived in Missoula. \nFirman and his family are 100 percent Montana.\n  MAJ Firman Ray has a distinguished career with the Army and he is \nonly getting started. He has excelled in each of his positions since he \nwas commissioned in 1991. Firman also survived the 9/11 attack on the \nPentagon where his office was hit by the terrorists.\n  Today, we recognize MAJ Firman Ray to receive the Silver Star for \ndistinguished gallantry in action against the enemy in Somalia in 1993. \nThe Silver Star is the third highest medal awarded for combat service \nand the fourth highest medal that a soldier may receive. The Silver \nStar is awarded to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the \nU.S. Army, is cited for gallantry in action against an enemy of the \nUnited States while engaged in military operations involving conflict \nwith an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign \nforces engaged in conflict against an opposing armed force in which the \nUnited States is not a belligerent party.\n  For those reasons and so many more, I am honored to announce that \ntoday MAJ Firman Ray will finally receive the distinguished Silver Star \naward for his valorous performance of duty with the U.S. Army in \nSomalia that is long overdue.\n  Many of you may remember the movie, ``Black Hawk Down.'' MAJ Firman \nRay, then Lieutenant Ray, was part of the team that the movie, Black \nHawk Down, portrayed. It was during the predawn hours of September 25, \n1993, that a U.S. Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter was shot down in \nMogadishu, Somalia. Lieutenant Ray was part of AT Platoon that was \ngiven the mission to conduct a search and rescue operation at the \nhelicopter crash site. Clearly understanding the urgency of the \nsituation, Lieutenant Ray took his two lead MK-19 gun vehicles and \ninstructed them to quickly advance to the crash site. Upon entering the \nsite, intense small arms fire and sporadic rocket propelled grenade \nfire erupted. The gunners under Lieutenant Ray's command were able to \ndestroy three enemy positions in a building just north of the crash \nsite. While attempting to again secure the site, another firefight \nensued on the west side. Lieutenant Ray dismounted and on the run, \ndodged under considerable fire to position the gun vehicles to \nestablish security. Lieutenant Ray's unit was again under fire two more \ntimes where Firman moved the gun vehicles into strategic positions that \nwere vital to\n\n[[Page S15183]]\n\nsuppressing enemy fire. Once the perimeter was finally secured, \nLieutenant Ray assisted in collecting the remains of the soldiers \nkilled in the helicopter crash.\n  Shortly afterwards, the stillness was broken by yet another attack \nand a firefight resumed. During the next 30 minutes of battle and under \nfire, Lieutenant Ray ran to and from each gun vehicle's position, \ndirecting counter fire and ensuring adequate ammunition. The mission \nwas complete and all personnel and sensitive equipment attempted to \nwithdraw to the airfield. Lieutenant Ray directed his rear security gun \nvehicle to assume the lead and, again, enemy militia began firing with \nsmall arms and RPG's, inflicting casualties. With four blocks to go, \nLieutenant Ray remained dismounted and slowly moved south, deftly \ncrossing intersections proven treacherous by prior American casualties.\n  From the onset to outcome, Lieutenant Ray was first in and last out. \nHe performed his duty with bravery and poise. He is a decisive leader \nwho inspires fierce soldier loyalty, trust, and cohesiveness. Because \nof his quick and intelligent decisions, and due to his confident \ndirection, Lieutenant Ray's platoon, under the most extreme battle \nconditions, provided the decisive ingredient to the success of the \nmission. Due to his combat performance, Firman Ray is deserving of the \nSilver Star for distinctive recognition as an exceptional soldier and \nleader of men.\n  I commend Major Ray for his heroic efforts in Operation Restoration \nHope and I am proud that he receives the Silver Star today. He \nexemplifies valor, bravery, and courage. Major Ray put his life on the \nline to defend our country. He put his life on the line to save his \nmen. For that, we all owe him a huge debt of gratitude.\n  We are proud to call MAJ Firman Ray a Montanan. And as Montanans and \nAmericans, we are eternally grateful for his selfless service to our \ncountry, which has made our Nation a safer place and has helped to \npromote and defend democracy across the globe.\n  Firman, as you know, receiving a Silver Star Medal is quite an \naccomplishment. I can think of no one more deserving than you. From one \nMontanan to another, thank you for your commitment to your country, \nservice to your community, and for making America safer for each and \nevery one of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/19/senate-section/article/S15183-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/19/senate-section/article/S15183-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/19/senate-section/article/S15183-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 254.

A bill to require the mandatory expensing of stock options \ngranted to executive officers, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Stock Option \nAccounting Act. This bill has been a long time in the making. It is a \nstrong bipartisan bill that addresses the important role stock options \nplay in our economy.\n  As an Accountant, and as a member of the Senate who was a small \nbusinessman for many years, I tend to believe most of the issues we \naddress in Congress should be examined with an eye toward preserving \nthe strength and integrity of our small business sector, and ensuring \nthat the regulations that govern it are fair and preserve and promote, \nrather than discourage, innovation and competition.\n  I think that's something we can all agree on, so I know I won't have \nto go into too much detail about the importance of our small business \nsector, especially our small, high tech businesses. When it comes to \nsmall businesses, especially our high technology centers, we truly are \nthe envy of the world. Our talented and creative engineers and \ninventors have paved the way for innovations in advanced technologies \nand computer software that other countries will always try to imitate.\n  Here in the United States, our Small Business Administration is well \naware of the importance of that sector to our Nation's economy. Nearly \n23 million strong, small businesses represent more than 99.7 percent of \nall employers, employ more than half of all private sector employees, \ngenerate 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs annually, create more than 50 \npercent of nonfarm private gross domestic product (GDP) and produce 13 \nto 14 times more patents per employee than large patenting firms.\n  Last week, I chaired a hearing in the Banking Committee's \nSubcommittee on Securities and Investment that featured testimony from \nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the small business \ncommunity. It became quite evident during the hearing that FASB is ill \nequipped to conduct economic impact studies of the accounting standards \nthat it adopts even through its one of their precepts. FASB may be able \nto conduct a cost analysis of an accounting standard proposal \ndetermining the costs of computers and additional manpower necessary to \nimplement a new statement. But, it does not have the expertise to look \nat the comprehensive impact a new standard may have on the economy.\n  In addition, as the hearing progressed, it was evident that FASB is \nnot listening to small businesses, and not taking their concerns \nseriously about a standard that FASB Board members stated was ``set in \nconcrete'' prior to an official comment period on any draft proposal.\n  At the hearing, small business witnesses testified about how they are \nworried that the expensing of stock options would make this form of \nemployee compensation prohibitive. They said it would make it very \ndifficult if not impossible to attract and retain talented employees. \nIt would also have a detrimental effect on the entrepreneurial nature \nand spirit of our country. In all of my years listening on this issue, \nnot one small business owner has spoken in favor of expensing stock \noptions.\n  After the hearing, I was more convinced than ever that legislation \nlike this bill was needed to address the issue of the expensing of \nstock options.\n  A key element of FASB's current structure is its independence and I \nwant to make it clear that I support that principle. FASB's \nindependence, like freedom, must be earned--and it's independence does \nnot provide a shield that absolves FASB of accountability and due \nprocess.\n  When it comes to the issue of stock options, a case can be made that \nFASB took up the project with a pre-ordained result in mind. It's no \nsurprise, therefore, that the process that was established to pursue \nthe matter seems to reflect a project that was begun with the end in \nmind. There is enough evidence there to at least make one wonder.\n  First, FASB doesn't seem to have given much consideration to the more \nthan 200 public comment letters they received. The public comments made \nby FASB Board Members seem to also reflect a skewed process, as does \nthe lack of response to the many high tech companies that have visited \nwith FASB in the past several months. In addition, FASB has refused to \nconduct real road tests to actual valuation methods.\n  According to the FASB website ``Facts about FASB 2003-2004,'' the \nBoard follows certain precepts in the conduct of its activities. They \nare: 1. To be objective in its decision making and to ensure, insofar \nas possible, the neutrality of information resulting from its \nstandards. To be neutral, information must report economic activity as \nfaithfully as possible without coloring the image it communicates for \nthe purpose of influencing behavior in any particular direction. 2. To \nweight carefully the views of its constituents in developing concepts \nand standards. However, the ultimate determinant of concepts and \nstandards must be the Board's judgment, based on research, public input \nand careful deliberation about the usefulness of the resulting \ninformation. 3. To promulgate standards only when the expected benefits \nexceed the perceived costs. While reliable, quantitative cost-benefit \ncalculations are seldom possible, the Board strives to determine that a \nproposed standard will meet a significant need and that the costs it \nimposes, compared with possible alternatives, are justified in relation \nto the overall benefits. 4. To bring about needed changes in ways that \nminimize disruption to the continuity of reporting practice. Reasonable \neffective dates and transition provisions are established when new \nstandards are introduced. The Board considers it desirable that change \nbe evolutionary to the extent that it can be accommodated by the need \nfor relevance, reliability, comparability and consistency. 5. To review \nthe effects of past decisions and interpret, amend or replace standards \nin timely fashion when such action is indicated.\n  Precept number 3 greatly interests me. I am very concerned that FASB \nhas repeatedly refused to consider the economic consequences of its \ndecisions. The mandatory expending of all employee stock options has \nserious economic, labor, trade and competitiveness implications. These \nissues fall squarely within the jurisdiction and oversight of Congress. \nIt's not hard to imagine what would be said of Congress if we failed to \ntake note of the economic implications of the actions we take on the \nfloor.\n  Simply put, at the end of the day, if FASB is going to earn its \nindependence, it will have to adhere to a process that is objective, \nfair, open and balanced. So far, FASB seems to be more concerned about \ngetting the job done--than in getting it right.\n  That is why I am offering legislation that will expense the stock \noptions given to the top five executives of a company, exempt small \nbusinesses and start up companies, and set conditions for the expensing \nof broad-based options for the remaining employees. I treat the three \ngroups differently in this matter because a very real and strong \naccounting distinction exists between the two types of workers.\n\n  First of all, in a very real sense the top five executives of an \norganization\n\n[[Page S15189]]\n\nare different from the general employee group in the manner in which \nthey are treated by the SEC and the manner in which their compensation \nis defined and distributed from an accounting perspective.\n  The top five executives, for instance, are treated differently when \nit comes to their compensation and a wide range of other matters. Proxy \nrules, for instance, require significant additional disclosures from \nthe top five executives than they do of any other group.\n  Second, from an accounting perspective, there is a clear distinction \nbetween executives and the broad employee group. In their recent book, \nIn the Company of Owners, Professor Joseph Blasi and Douglas Kruse \nconcluded, based on extensive research, that options granted to all but \nthe top executives in a company are not labor income, but a form of \ncapital income.\n  To quote from their book, ``They represent risk sharing profits that \nworkers receive on top of their normal market wages and benefits. As \nsuch, it makes little sense to deduct the value of those options from \nprofits.''\n  In addition, Blasi and Kruse found that, ``options turn employees \ninto economic partners in the enterprise. As such, they stand to share \nin the stock appreciation that they help to bring about. . . . Options \nprovide an additional dimension to their employment relationship, \nallowing workers to participate in both the risks and the rewards of \nproperty ownership. . . . There's substantial economic evidence that \noptions bring workers capital rather than labor income. . . . The \nearnings workers get from options comes on top of their regular market \nwage.''\n  In contrast, options for top executives function more as labor \nincome, particularly in companies without broad based option plans. \nThese top executives bargain for their entire ``compensation'' package \nand, in many cases, stock options represent a large part of the total \npackage. Their negotiations about compensation are distinctly different \nthan other employees.\n  That brings me to our bill and its purpose--or, to continue with my \nline of reasoning--If these two groups should be compensated \ndifferently for their efforts when it comes to stock options, how \nshould it be done?\n  Our legislation would mandate a valuation method of the options given \nto the top five executives that does not require companies to predict \ntheir future stock price volatility. One of the members of the Option \nValuation Group, Fred Cook, appointed by the FASB strongly recommended \nthis method--one where stock price volatility is set at zero so that \ncompanies don't have to use a crystal ball and try to predict their \nfuture stock price.\n  Another key principle in our legislation is the requirement that FASB \ndevelop a method of ``truing up''--or correcting errors--that are made \nwhen stock option estimates are made at grant date. There are several \nother areas where estimates are made in financial statements, and then \ncorrected over time as the precise facts are learned. Today, no such \ncorrections are made in the stock options area--a fundamental flaw in \nthe system.\n  To address these issues, the bill has three major components. First, \nthe bill would target executive compensation. A company would be \nrequired to expense immediately options of the top five highly \ncompensated individuals at a company. The Securities and Exchange \nCommission already requires this information in annual statements and \nproxy statements. In addition, it would provide investors with a \nclearer understanding of the stock options of top company officials. \nThis also would work in conjunction with the self-regulatory \norganization's rules, approved last week by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, to require shareholder approval of stock option plans.\n  Second, small business would be exempt from expensing stock options. \nThe exemption for small businesses would follow the current SEC rules \nfor defining small businesses. The bill would allow small companies a \n3-year grace period after an initial public offering prior to a company \nbeing required to expense stock options. This would allow a sufficient \nperiod of time to work out any initial volatility after the initial \npublic offering.\n  Finally, the bill would not permit the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to recognize a stock option expensing standard unless two \nthings happen. First, companies must be able to recognize the true \nexpense of stock options on their financial statements. Currently, FASB \nwants companies to expense stock options upon the grant date of an \noption. Unfortunately, the current valuation models for stock options, \nBlack-Scholes, binomial, Crystal Ball, and others, are horrible \nindicators of the true cost to a company stock options.\n  The bill would require that a company be able to ``true-up'' its \nfinancial statements when a stock option is exercised, lapses or is \nforfeited. If the cost goes up then the company must record the \nincrease when an option is exercised. Likewise, if an option lapses or \nis forfeited then a company should be able to wipe those previously \ntaken expenses off its balanced sheet. This is only fair.\n  The second item prior to an accounting standard to be recognized is \nthe completion of an economic analysis study by the Secretary of \nCommerce and the Secretary of Labor. This study would look at how the \nuse of stock options may stimulate economic growth in our nation's \neconomy. In addition, the study would relate how stock options \nexpensing could effect the competiveness of U.S. companies in \ninternational markets.\n  I strongly believe that this bill is essential to our economic \nstrength. It is clear that FASB is not listening to small business and \ntherefore is not listening to the future of our country. FASB is \ntherefore ill equipped to make the economic analysis decisions to \ndetermine the true effect of stock option expensing on our economy.\n  In addition, the bill also targets the invasion's need for greater \ninformation on executive compensation. I ask my colleagues to take a \nserious look at this bill and to support its passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Summary of Key Provisions of the Enzi-Reid Stock Option Accounting \n                               Reform Act\n\n\nmandatory expensing of stock option held by highly compensated officers\n\n       The legislation requires that the chief executive officer \n     and the next four most highly compensated executive officers \n     shall expense their stock options in the annual reports filed \n     with the Commission.\n       Expensing the options granted to the CEO and next four most \n     highly compensated executive officers would go into effect \n     immediately.\n       This is consistent with information that must be filed with \n     the Commission as part of Securities Exchange Commission \n     Regulation S-K and part of proxy statement filings pursuant \n     to Securities Exchange Act Rule 14.\n       The section would require that the '`fair value'' of a \n     stock option would be equal to the value that would be agreed \n     upon by a willing buyer and seller taking into account all of \n     the characteristics and restrictions imposed upon the stock \n     option.\n       In light of the extreme inaccuracy of existing stock \n     valuation models (e.g., Black Scholes, binomial, etc.), \n     particularly with regard to the factor that requires \n     companies to predict the volatility of their stock price, the \n     legislation requires that the assumed volatility of the \n     underlying stock option shall be considered zero.\n\n\n                        small business exemption\n\n       The legislation exempts from the top five expensing \n     requirement all small businesses as defined currently by the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Regulation S-\n     B.\n       The legislation also delays stock option expensing of a \n     small business issuer until three years after an initial \n     public offering has taken place. This would allow a small \n     business issuer's stock to settle down from the initial \n     volatility of the initial public offering.\n\n\n   prohibition on expensing; ``truing up'' requirement; and economic \n                              impact study\n\n       The legislation prohibits the SEC from recognizing any \n     stock option expensing accounting standard set by a standard \n     setting body unless and until: 1. The expensing standard \n     recognizes the true expense of the stock option on a \n     company's financial statement when the option is exercised, \n     expires or is forfeited, a ``truing up'' requirement; and 2. \n     A comprehensive economic impact study has been conducted by \n     the Departments of Commerce and Labor.\n       As to the first requirement above, currently, stock options \n     must be expensed based upon the grant date of the option. \n     There is no ``truing up,'' or correcting, errors made at the \n     time of grant when subsequent events prove the initial \n     estimates to be inaccurate. The legislation requires that \n     when an option is exercised, expires or is forfeited, the \n     company would reconcile the actual expense to\n\n[[Page S15190]]\n\n     the company to the amount expensed previously upon the date \n     of grant.\n       As to the second requirement, the legislation requires the \n     Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor to conduct \n     and complete a joint study on the economic impact of the \n     mandatory expensing of all employee stock options. The study \n     will address: 1. the use of broad-based stock option plans in \n     expanding employee corporate ownership to workers at a wide \n     range of income levels with particular focus on non-executive \n     workers; 2. the role of such plans in the recruitment and \n     retention of skilled workers; 3. the role of such plans in \n     stimulating research and innovation; 4. the effect of such \n     plans in stimulating the economic growth of the United \n     States; and 5. the role of such plans in strengthening the \n     international competitiveness of United States' businesses.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Enzi, Ensign, \nBoxer, and Allen for their hard work and continued efforts on this \nissue.\n  It is with pleasure that I introduce bipartisan legislation, the \nStock Option Accounting Reform Act of 2003, that is good for economic \ngrowth and the American way.\n  We have to protect investors and stockholders by ensuring that our \nNation's accounting standards are transparent, open and balanced. At \nthe same time, we don't want to choke the entrepreneurial spirit of \nstart-up companies with too much bureaucratic red tape.\n  This legislation achieves just the right balance. It gives regulators \na framework to protect the integrity of the accounting process, but it \ndoesn't stifle free enterprise.\n  This bill requires a joint study by the Department of Labor and \nDepartment of Commerce to help FASB (Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard) treat stock options fairly. It will help regulators valuate \nstocks for accounting purposes. It will curb stock option abuse by \nrequiring the top five executives at large companies to expense their \noptions. This will provide a true picture of a company's financial \nhealth.\n  Finally, it will protect small businesses and start-ups that rely \nupon stock options to attract good employees.\n  This bill is good for emerging companies and good for consumers. It's \na balanced approach that deserves broad bipartisan support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH:\n  S. 1892.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1895, introduced earlier today by \nSenator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1895) a bill to temporarily extend the programs \n     under the Small Business Act and the Small Business \n     Investment Act of 1958 through March 15, 2004, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support passage of the \nSmall Business Administration Continuation Act of 2003. This bill \nprovides a short-term extension of the Small Business Administration \nand all of its programs. In particular, it ensures the continuation of \nthe SBA's 504 loan program, Small Business Investment Company program, \nand other activities currently conducted by the SBA, which must be \nextended before Congress adjourns this year. I am pleased to be joined \nby Senator Kerry, the ranking member of the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship, in supporting this bill.\n  On September 26, 2003, the Senate unanimously approved the Small \nBusiness Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003, \nS. 1375, which I introduced as the chair of the Committee on Small \nBusiness. That bill provides for the 3-year reauthorization of the SBA \nand its small business programs, including the 504 loan program and the \nSBIC program.\n  The reauthorization bill will continue the SBA's role in assisting \nAmerican small business to thrive and grow, through the agency's \nlending, entrepreneurial development, and government contracting \nprograms and services. Most importantly, it will enable the agency to \nhelp small businesses continue creating new jobs for our economy. \nAccording to the SBA, for the years covered by the reauthorization \nbill, an estimated 3.34 million jobs will be created or retained as a \nresult of the reauthorization programs.\n  While the Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary \nReauthorization Act provides for the continuation of these programs, \nthe other body has been delayed in its consideration of legislation to \nreauthorize the agency. The SBA's programs that rely on appropriations \nwill be continued once the Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary \nappropriations legislation for Fiscal Year 2004 is enacted. However, \nseveral of the SBA's programs and activities, like the 504 loan and \nSBIC programs, do not rely on appropriations. As a result, they are in \njeopardy of shutting down without the bill before us today, and that's \na result America's small businesses simply cannot afford.\n  I am confident that we can enact legislation to reauthorize the SBA \nonce the other body has completed work on its version of the bill. In \nthe interim, we must ensure that the SBA can continue to offer the \nentire range of its programs to our nation's small businesses, which \nare the driving force behind our current economic recovery. With small \nbusinesses comprising 99.7 percent of all businesses in the United \nStates, employing 57 percent of the total private-sector workforce, and \naccounting for approximately 40 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, \nthey deserve nothing less!\n\n  The 504 loan program, one of the agency's flagship lending programs, \nallows small businesses to obtain long-term, fixed-rate financing to \npurchase\n\n[[Page S15208]]\n\nland, buildings, or equipment. In the past four fiscal years, the SBA \nhas provided guarantees for more than 20,000 loans through the 504 Loan \nProgram, for a total of approximately $8.6 billion, and these loans \nhave allowed small businesses to create or retain more than 445,000 \njobs.\n  The SBIC Program utilizes private venture capital, with matching \nFederal funds, to provide financing to small businesses, many of which \nhave found it difficult to obtain financing from traditional venture \ncapital firms, both because of the businesses' small size and because \nof difficult economic trends. Since the start of Fiscal Year 1999, \nsmall business investment companies supported by the SBA have made more \nthan 15,800 investments in small businesses, with a total value of \n$16.9 billion. This critical long-term or ``patient'' capital for small \nbusinesses has led to the creation and retention of approximately \n481,000 jobs during this period.\n  Both of these programs are critical to our efforts to provide \nnecessary capital to small businesses so that those businesses can \nprovide the jobs and the growth to improve the Nation's economy. In \naddition, both of these programs rely on fees charged to the program \nparticipants, rather than on Federal appropriations, to fund their \noperation. Because neither program requires any Federal funds, the SBA \nneeds legislative authorization to collect the fees that operate the \nprograms and ensure that they function at a zero subsidy rate. \nCurrently, the authorization for these fees has been temporarily \nextended under the present continuing resolution.\n  With the close of the First Session of the 108th Congress rapidly \napproaching, we must act now to ensure that the SBA and its programs \nare continued. The bill before us achieves that goal by extending the \nauthorization for the agency and its programs through March 15, 2004. \nThat will provide ample time for the other body to pass its \nlegislation, for us to reconcile the differences, and for the president \nto sign a long-term reauthorization bill for the SBA.\n  This legislation is absolutely necessary for America's small \nbusinesses. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and thereby \nensure that the SBA, and in particular the 504 loan and SBIC programs, \nwill continue to serve small businesses and enable small businesses to \nobtain the financing they need, as they contribute so greatly to the \nrevitalization of our national economy.\n\n  In summary, the Small Business Administration Continuation Act of \n2003 is a straight extension of the authorization for the Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA, and its programs at their FY 2003 levels \nthrough March 15, 2003. Currently, the SBA and its programs are \noperating under the provisions of the Continuing Resolution. The bill \nalso increases the fee authorization for the Small Business Investment \nCompany, SBIC, program so that it can continue operating at a zero \nsubsidy rate for 2004. The SBIC fee level was increased in the last \nContinuing Resolution and that increase is merely continued in this \nbill to avoid statutory interpretation problems.\n  While the Senate has passed a 3-year reauthorization of the SBA, S. \n1375, the House has not completed work on its reauthorization bill. In \norder to provide time for the House to act and the bills to be \nreconciled, this bill extends the SBA's authorization on a short-term \nbasis so the agency can continue providing its critical lending, \nentrepreneurial development, and government contracting programs to the \nNation's small businesses.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, as the ranking Democrat of \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I join the \ncommittee's chair, Senator Olympia Snowe, in introducing a bill to \nextend for 4 months--through March 15, 2004--the authority to operate \nthe Small Business Administration's programs. It is our hope that it \ncan be expeditiously considered by the Senate.\n  Enacting this bill before Congress adjourns for the holidays is \ncritical in order to continue making accessible to small businesses the \nmany needed resources, from long-term loans to technical and \ncontracting assistance, of the SBA. Among those that would be in \njeopardy of closing are the agency's loans for growing businesses \nthrough what's more commonly referred to as the 504 loan program, \ncertain established Women's Business Centers, the contracting program \nto assist minority-owned small businesses, the program to provide \nsurety bonds to small contractors through so-called ``preferred \nsureties'' and one of the agency's venture capital programs.\n  The agency's 504 program is more important than ever to our small \nbusinesses and the economy. The need could not be clearer, with demand \nfor loans up 25 percent in both the number of loans made and the total \ndollar amount in loans made. As the year came to a close, these loans \npumped more than $3 billion into our local economies through thousands \nof small businesses. Remarkably, making these loans available to small \nbusinesses costs the taxpayers nothing because the borrowers, lenders \nand certified development companies cover costs of the program through \nfees. While it requires no appropriations to guarantee these loans, \ncontinuation of the program depends upon the ability of the lenders to \ncharge fees, which must be specifically permitted by Congress. This \nprogram is extremely successful and should absolutely continue. I \nbelieve I speak for many when I say that the Congress wants the lending \ncommunity to continue devoting resources to 504 loans, keeping this \naffordable financing available to small businesses. We fully intend to \nprovide authorization for 3 years when the SBA's comprehensive \nreauthorization bill is enacted in early 2004.\n  I feel just as strongly about the importance of continuing the SBA's \nventure capital programs. Specifically, we need to make clear that the \namount of fees that can be charged to participating securities venture \ncapital firms is increased from 1.38 percent to 1.46 percent. Venture \ncapital has been very scarce over the past few years, and this program \nhas been responsible for more than 50 percent of the number of deals \nmade in this country. In spite of the industry's rough times, the \ncommittee is supportive of the Small Business Investment Company \nprograms and wants to see more successes like Staples and Callaway golf \nlead the way in their industries and create jobs.\n  Extending the Women's Business Center Sustainability pilot program--\nwhich is made permanent in both the House and Senate SBA \nreauthorization bills--is tremendously important to the 86,000 women \nbusiness owners across the Nation who use the entrepreneurial \ndevelopment assistance each year. Without the continuation of the \nagency's authority to operate pilot programs, it is possible that the \nSmall Business Administration could misinterpret Congress's strong \nsupport for this pilot and discontinue funding 55 centers in over 40 \nstates, closing over half of the most experienced and active women's \nbusiness centers. In 1999, when I authored the Women's Business Center \nSustainability pilot program, it was my intention to continue the most \nproductive and well-equipped women's business centers, knowing that \ndemand for such services was rapidly growing. Today, with women-owned \nbusinesses opening at one-and-a-half times the rate of all privately \nheld firms, the need for women's business centers is even greater. \nUntil Congress makes permanent the Women's Business Center \nSustainability Pilot program, as intended in already passed \nlegislation, an extension of authority is vital--not only to the \ncenters themselves, but to the women's business community and to the 18 \nmillion workers employed by women-owned businesses around the country.\n\n  We also need to ensure the continuation of the agency's contracting \nassistance. One type of assistance in particular is the Small and \nDisadvantaged Businesses, SDB, Certification program. It was created to \nassist small businesses through government contracting, access to \ncapital, management and technical assistance, and export assistance. \nThe program was originally implemented to help Federal agencies reach a \n5 percent goal of utilization of these essential businesses incurred to \naddress discrimination and under-utilization of certain firms in \nFederal contracting.\n\n[[Page S15209]]\n\n  The positive implications of this program have grown beyond the \nexpectations of even the authors of the original legislation. By \nsupporting these socially and economically disadvantaged businesses, \nthe Federal Government has helped these entrepreneurs revitalize \nneighborhoods, create jobs, and encourages real, measurable economic \ngrowth. The program has shown to be a resounding success, however, a \ngreat deal of work still needs to be done. Moreover, the Federal \nGovernment has failed to meet the 23 percent government-wide goal for \nsmall business utilization in Federal procurement. Agencies have \ncontinually failed to meet the goals for socially and economically \ndisadvantaged, women owned businesses, service disabled veteran owned, \nand HUBZone firms, all of which contribute to the overall 23 percent \ngoal. Part of the problem faced by small businesses participating in \nthese programs and by those attempting to enforce small business \nutilization goals is the perception that these goals are intended to be \na maximum set-aside for small firms. They are not. They are minimum \nthresholds. The continuation of the SDB program throughout the \ngovernment will help Federal agencies continue to utilize these small \nbusinesses and continue to foster business development and in much \nneeded sectors of the economy.\n  I would like to make clear that this bill is not intended to \ninterfere with any program, pilot program or authority that has a \nlonger authorization, like the Small Business Innovation and Small \nBusiness Technology Transfer programs. If there are any doubts about \nour intentions, the bill is structured to keep all programs, pilots and \ninitiatives operating that could have expired between September 30, \n2003, and March 15, 2003, and to keep them operating as on September \n30.\n  I commend our committee, and the leadership of our chair, Senator \nSnowe, for deliberating and passing our comprehensive reauthorization \nbill in July and look forward to working with our colleagues in the \nHouse to pass a final bill in early 2004.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed \nin the Record.\n  The bill (S. 1895) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1895\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we worked for several hours this afternoon \non the conference on the omnibus. Significant progress was made. The DC \ntitle was closed. The VA-HUD title was closed. The Commerce-State-\nJustice is one open item. But that should be resolved quickly tomorrow, \nwhich leaves Agriculture and Labor-HHS.\n  I think that is what we have left. I think progress was made. Another \ncouple of hours tomorrow and we should be able to finish that. That \nwould bring that very important bill to the floor. At this stage, it \nappears that Senators Stevens and Byrd have done an outstanding job, \nhaving just dealt with those appropriations bills and not extraneous \nmaterials, as some talked about doing.\n  I think this is something that, in a relatively short period of time, \nif things continue like this in conference, should not take a lot of \nfloor time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just to add to the comments of the \ndistinguished assistant minority leader, the Medicare conference, I \nbelieve, will be held tomorrow, and most probably tomorrow morning, \nalthough I am not sure if a final announcement or determination of the \ntime has been made. It will be made a little later tonight.\n  Substantial progress has been made on that conference as well. There \nare a few numbers coming in from CBO over the course of tonight. Once \nthey are back, that conference will be held.\n  What our colleagues have just heard is that, on the omnibus, \nsubstantial progress has been made. And on what we are addressing on \nthe floor--energy--real progress is being made. Also, in terms of \nMedicare prescription drugs, real progress is being made. People are \ncollaborating. Everybody understands that we will be here probably each \nday, every day until we finish the Senate's business.
