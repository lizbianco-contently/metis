Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 1805, the gun liability bill. A unanimous consent \nagreement worked out by the managers last night means we will \ndefinitely make significant progress on a number of issues throughout \nthe day, and we will complete action on the bill on Tuesday. Senators \nshould be aware the agreement covers amendments to be offered today and \non Tuesday, but we do expect additional amendments to be offered and \nvoted on tomorrow and during Monday's session of the Senate. Those \nSenators who are not covered by the agreement should work with Senators \nCraig and Reed of Rhode Island to work through their amendments before \nTuesday morning.\n  The first vote of the day should occur between 10:30 a.m. and 11:30 \na.m. Members will be notified of rollcall votes throughout the day and \npossibly into the evening.\n  I wish to use a few moments of leadership time to comment on the \nbill. We will proceed right on the bill. It is going to be a fast-paced \nday. An agreement was worked out last night. I think we have a good \ngame plan. We will finish the bill on Tuesday and we will start right \nin.\n  The bill, S. 1805, has broad bipartisan support. We will be \nconsidering a lot of amendments. We will debate those amendments, and \nwe have the time agreements to see that they are considered fairly. \nThis bill is bipartisan, with 10 Senators from the Democratic side of \nthe aisle supporting it. The bill also has 45 Republican cosponsors. I \nknow we can move quickly and process these amendments and move toward \nfinal passage of this important legislation.\n  There is a common misconception that the gun industry is a large and \npowerful industry, and it is simply not. In fact, the firearms trade is \na relatively small industry. In 1999, the industry collectively made \nless than $200 million in total profits--just $200 million. To put that \nin perspective, Home Depot, a company with which we are all familiar, \nnetted $4.3 billion in 2003. That one company made more than 20 times \nthe profit of the entire firearms business.\n  In 2003, Wal-Mart, a highly competitive retail chain, profited a \nhefty $9 billion. And if we look at a chain such as Starbucks, even \nStarbucks sees bigger profits than the American firearms manufacturers.\n  I mention that because the issue is not of size or relative size. The \nreal issue is that the gun manufacturing industry employs people with \nproductive jobs, well-intentioned, well-meaning, good jobs. These are \nvaluable jobs, and most of these jobs actually are in rural \ncommunities. Those are the communities that, in many ways, need jobs \nthe most in this day and time.\n  Often, these gun manufacturers are the largest employer in these \nsmall communities and, as a consequence, these ruinous lawsuits do not \njust threaten the manufacturers; they end up threatening the whole \ntown, the whole community itself.\n  Still, we have the antigun crusaders who insist that the firearms \nbusiness, one of the most regulated industries in America today, must \nbe brought to heel. Why? They believe the gun manufacturers themselves \nshould be responsible for the criminal actions of other\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\npeople. They believe it is OK to allow lawsuits to achieve some sort of \npolitical end.\n  Clearly, I do not agree and a majority of people in this body do not \nagree. Indeed, most Americans certainly do not agree. Most Americans \nthink this is just blatantly unfair.\n  Our Constitution protects the right to keep and bear arms. Indeed, 33 \nStates have passed laws to preempt frivolous gun lawsuits--33 States. \nStill today, we have the antigun crusaders who are, in effect, aided \nand abetted by the special interest trial lawyers charging ahead.\n  Since 1997, more than 30 cities and counties have sued firearm \ncompanies in an attempt to force them to change the way they make guns \nand the way they sell guns. In California, then-Gov. Gray Davis signed \nlegislation explicitly authorizing lawsuits against gun manufacturers.\n  Because the firearms business is relatively small, one big verdict, \none substantial verdict could bankrupt the entire industry. In \nCalifornia, that is a real possibility.\n  Never mind that every trial court that has heard these municipality \nlawsuits has thrown them out in whole or in part. Appellate courts in \nthree States have overturned lower court verdicts and allowed the suits \nto go forward. Thus, it is critical we act now.\n  If the gun industry is forced into bankruptcy, the right to keep and \nbear arms will be a right in name only. Lawsuits have already pushed \ntwo companies into bankruptcy. Even if some gun manufacturers are able \nto hold on, the prices for firearms will be so high that owning a gun, \nsuch as a hunting rifle, will be a privilege only the wealthy can \nafford.\n  There is one other important and little known aspect of the issue. \nAmerica relies on private gun manufacturers to equip our soldiers and \nlaw enforcement officers with sidearms. The guns our police officers \nuse, the guns that our soldiers carry, are made in the United States by \nAmerican workers.\n  We are all agreed, no one wants guns in the hands of criminals. There \nare thousands of laws and regulations to stop illegal gun sales, but we \ndo not want these frivolous, unnecessary lawsuits to strip police \nofficers and soldiers of their sidearms. Do we really want unfair \nlitigation to cripple our national security? The answer clearly is no, \nand thus we will act and we will act over the course of today, \ntomorrow, Monday, and complete this action on Tuesday.\n  The bill before us is narrowly tailored. It is focused. It is fair. \nIt is equitable. It ensures that private parties are held responsible \nfor their actions and that is why this bill comes to this floor with \nbroad bipartisan support. That is why passing this bill is the right \nthing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/26/senate-section/article/S1612-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to consideration of S. 1805, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1805) to prohibit civil liability actions from \n     being brought or continuing against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition \n     for damages resulting from the misuse of their product by \n     others.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are now on S. 1805. Last night, Senator \nReed and I worked into the evening with our colleagues and leadership \non both sides to craft a unanimous consent that now governs us through \nlate next Tuesday. It establishes a variety of amendments that will be \nvoted on over the course of today. Some will be offered and set aside \nto be voted on on Tuesday. On Tuesday, other key amendments will be \nvoted on and then final passage.\n  I am sure there are some Members on both sides who might have \namendments that were not listed to be considered for votes today and/or \nTuesday. What I would ask them to do is come to the Chamber and talk to \nSenator Reed and myself to see if we might work those out certainly. We \nare happy to take a look at them. There may be an opportunity late \nTuesday and possibly Friday to offer additional amendments. The \nunanimous consent request does not preclude any Member from doing that.\n  I said very early on yesterday that we wanted an open, robust debate \non this issue. Clearly, 75 Members of this Senate, in a very bipartisan \nway, said let's get on with it, with the cloture vote yesterday. We \nspent the day then fashioning an agreement that brings us to where we \nare this morning. I believe it is possible Senator Daschle will be in \nthe Chamber in a few moments to offer a perfecting amendment, then \nSenator Boxer will have an amendment on gunlocks.\n\n  I believe the agreement that is in front of us gives us something \nthat oftentimes is very hard to achieve in the Senate, and that is a \nprocedure and a final passage locked into an agreement. While Senator \nReed and I worked late into the evening, as I mentioned, to allow that \nto happen, and all sides gave a little in it, what I think we have in \nfront of us is just that, an agreement that allows a variety of \nSenators, who have been prominent in this debate on both sides of the \nissue, to offer their amendments and to have a vote.\n  The timelines are very limited. We are not going to filibuster in any \nof this. It is clear that when there are\n20-, 30- and 60-minute time limits to be shared equally, it does shape \nand limit the debate in a way that many of us would like to see.\n  Certainly on Tuesday, key votes are going to be the McCain-Reed gun \nshow loophole and Senator Feinstein's gun ban, or assault weapon ban as \nit is argued. Those clearly will be the dominant issues on one side. \nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, conceal/carry will be another one \nvoted on on that day, and possibly debate. I will debate that along \nwith Senator Campbell today. It is on the list to accomplish today. \nPossibly we will also have another amendment to be voted on on Tuesday \nwhich deals with Washington, DC, and some of the gun laws that free and \nlaw-abiding citizens have to cope with in this city.\n  That is the character of what we have been able to put together. \nSenator Reed, the manager on the other side, is now in the Chamber. I \nyield the floor for any comments he would wish to make. Timewise, we \nhope Senator Daschle can make it to the Chamber to offer his amendment, \nbut if he cannot, at this moment I see no reason Senator Boxer could \nnot proceed with her amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho has indicated we \nworked late last evening to craft a unanimous consent that will allow \nseveral important amendments to be debated today, and continuing on \nthrough Tuesday. It represents a recognition that there are serious \nissues to discuss. Now we are at the stage of not only discussing those \nissues but also taking amendments up and voting on them. I know Senator \nDaschle will be here in a moment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to yield to the Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. We have explained to the majority that we would, in fact, \nask consent that Senator Boxer be allowed to offer her amendment. \nSenator Daschle is occupied at the present time. If necessary, I could \noffer it on his behalf, but I think it would be better if he offered it \nhimself. So we ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer be allowed to \ngo forward with her amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2620\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2620.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, to \n require the provision of a child safety device in connection with the \ntransfer of a handgun and to provide safety standards for child safety \n                                devices)\n\n       On page 11, after line 19, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who worked late into the night to put forward a list of \namendments this body would consider. I am very proud my amendment made \nthe list. It is an amendment this Senate has supported before. It is an \namendment that will protect our children from violence, and what could \nbe more important to us as we gather here every day than to protect our \nchildren?\n  My measure would do two things. First, it would require that every \nhandgun sold in this country come with a child safety device. The \namendment is very broad on what that could be, so it really isn't a \nmicromanaging type of amendment. This device could be a lock using a \nkey or a combination, a device that locks electronically, it could be a \nlockbox, or technology that is built into the gun itself. Many of the \nfolks working on this type of technology are very enthusiastic about \nit.\n  There is no question in my mind, there is no question in the minds of \nthe police in my State who just had a press conference on this issue, \nif we were to agree to this and it were to become the law of the land, \nthe number of children involved in accidental shootings would go way \ndown. So that is the first thing we do. We require some type of a lock \nwhen you buy a handgun.\n  Second, my amendment would make sure child safety devices are \neffective and that they are not shoddy or of poor quality. One of the \nworst things we could do is pass a bill that requires these devices and \nthen the device doesn't work. That would be a terrible thing for our \nfamilies. So the bill requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nto establish standards for the design of these locks and these boxes \nand a standard for their performance. We want to make sure, when \nparents use a child safety device, that they are confident it will work \nas intended.\n  In 1999 the Senate passed an amendment by a vote of 78 to 20 to \nrequire that all handguns in this country be sold with a child safety \ndevice. The majority of our colleagues very strongly\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\nsupported this in quite a bipartisan way. I believe we should again \nagree that we need to protect our children from accidental gun \nshootings.\n  My home State of California recently enacted an excellent child \nsafety device bill. It requires that all licensed dealers and \nmanufacturers equip the guns they sell with State-certified child \nsafety devices. This is a very important bill for my State and I am \nproud of my State for doing it. But it is clear that the States along \nCalifornia's border do not have this requirement. Not one of those \nStates has child safety device laws. That means even if California--and \nwe do--has a good law, anyone can purchase a gun without a safety lock \nfrom a border State and return to California with it. Therefore, the \nprogress we hope to make in California will be set back because we \ndon't have a uniform and standard law.\n  The other important feature of our bill that impacts Californians is \nthat while there is a State-certified standard for gunlocks in my \nState, those standards have not been set by the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, and everyone agrees that the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission is the premier organization in the country that sets the \ngold standard. Again, I think it is very important that we have this \ntype of standard because, as many colleagues point out, the \nmanufacturers of these devices deserve some guidance. California may \nhave one set of standards, we could have another set of standards in \nNew York, or in the Midwest, and we are going to have a potpourri of \nstandards floating around rather than what I call the gold standard of \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\n  The other important point for my people of California--again, they \nhave the safety lock law--is that the amendment allows for a Federal \ncause of action for violations of this child safety requirement. So if \nin fact there is a serious problem with a child safety lock, and the \nState for some reason doesn't get its act together, doesn't put the \ncase together, and so on, there will be a Federal cause of action. It \nis kind of a double protection for the children.\n  I would like to talk about the need for this amendment for a moment. \nI have a chart that shows the statistics. In the United States of \nAmerica, in our great country, the greatest country in the world, a \nchild or a youth is killed by an accidental shooting every 48 hours--\nevery 48 hours. Where do these statistics come from? The FBI. For every \nchild killed by a gun, four are wounded. Where does that come from? The \nArchives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, December--I am assuming \nthat is 2000--volume 55, No. 12.\n  What does this mean, when you multiply it out? Thousands of children \nare injured or killed by guns every year in this country. According to \nthe CDC, the rate of firearm deaths of children under the age of 14 is \nnearly 12 times higher in the United States than in 25 other \nindustrialized countries combined.\n  Let me repeat that. The rate of firearm deaths of children under the \nage of 14 is 12 times higher in the United States than in 25 other \nindustrialized nations combined.\n  Colleagues stand up and say: Guns don't kill people; people kill \npeople. If you want to, say: Guns don't kill children; children kill \nchildren. Yes, children kill children because they pick up a gun and \nthey fire it at a friend. They fire it at a brother. They don't \nunderstand the consequences of this. More than 22 million children live \nin homes with guns. I want you to envision this--22 million children \nlive in homes with guns. More than 3.3 million of those children live \nin homes where the guns are always or sometimes kept loaded and \nunlocked.\n  Too many children are playing with real guns found in their parents' \nbedroom or a friend's home, and too many children are killed in this \ncountry because they are doing what children do: They are exploring; \nthey are being curious. I don't know how many times I have heard \nstories with tearful parents saying: I kept that gun away from my \nchild. It was far away from my child. It was in the highest, darkest \ncorner of the deepest, tallest closet in my house. I never thought my \nbaby could climb up and find that gun.\n  Well, they do. They do. Children are smart. They are tenacious. They \nare energetic. One study found that when a gun was in the home, 75 to \n80 percent of first and second graders knew where their parents kept \nthat gun. Seventy-five to eighty percent of first and second graders \nknew where their parents kept that gun.\n  In this country, we do so much to protect our children. We worry \nabout them, as we should; it is our responsibility. We make sure that \nin a car they are put in a child seat facing in the right direction so \nthey don't have a tendency to get hurt in an accident. We have airbags \nto protect them. We protect them from shoddy toys, such as Play-Doh \nthat they could eat and could hurt them. We set standards. We set \nstandards for Teddy bears, for toys. We care about our children.\n  I wrote the afterschool law we have here with Senator Ensign. We love \nour children, every one of us--our own children, our children's \nchildren. We are here to protect the children. That is part of our job.\n  So let me reiterate, one study found that when a gun was in the home, \n75 percent to 80 percent of first and second graders knew where the \nparents kept that gun. So even if that gun is in a closet, at the top \nof a closet, under towels or blankets, kids are tenacious and they find \nthe guns. But if they found a lockbox and they couldn't open it, they \nwould be protected. If they grab that gun and it had a child safety \ndevice on it and they tried to shoot, it wouldn't go off. If the gun \nhad technology built in it so that only when the parents held it it \nwould fire, they would be protected.\n\n  It seems to me in this day and age when we are losing a child or a \nyouth to an accidental shooting every 48 hours, we ought to be \nabsolutely united in doing something about it.\n  I want to show you the face of a beautiful young man, Kenzo, a \nCalifornian, 15 years old, with his mom. His friend, Michael, while \nplaying with a gun, shot Kenzo Bix, and he is gone forever. If that gun \nhad had a child safety device on it, it wouldn't have happened.\n  I will give you some other stories.\n  Just this January in Indio, CA, a 17-year-old boy named Jason Weed \ndied after his 14-year-old brother accidentally shot him in the head. \nThe other boy was showing him the gun in the home when it accidentally \nwent off, lodging a bullet in the small boy's head. If that gun had had \na safety device, and if the amendment we already passed here--the Kohl-\nHatch-Boxer amendment that passed here the last time--had been adopted \nin the other body, if it had been signed into law, Kenzo would be \nalive; and this child I just talked about, Jason Weed, would be alive.\n  Then there is a story from Florida. There are so many stories, and we \njust picked a few.\n  A 3-year-old, Colton Hinke, and his 2-year old sister Kaile were \nplaying in her parents' bedroom when Colton found an unlocked, loaded \nhandgun in the drawer. A neighbor heard the shot and rushed to the \nscene and found Kaile on her back, her face pale, her lips blue, and a \nsmall hole in her chest. She was in shock, and she was rushed to the \nhospital, but it was too late.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was told I had 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I believe under the order 30 \nminutes were equally divided. The Senator's 15 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask for one additional minute from each side so I \ncan conclude?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so very much.\n  There is another incident where a 1-year-old girl was critically \ninjured by her 3-year-old brother. This little girl survived.\n  I could go on, but I don't have the time at this point.\n  Let's pass this measure. I know Senators DeWine and Kohl have an \namendment to change my bill in a very small way. I don't have a problem \nwith that. I will be supporting that. I just know the overriding \nconcern of mine, and I really do think most people in this body who \nvoted for this the last time, is let us protect our kids. Let us do it \nin a smart way. It is the right thing to do for the families of \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S1615]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have someone who will speak in opposition \nto the Boxer amendment. There is a second-degree amendment on its way. \nIt is not yet ready. It is coming; sometimes I don't know from where. I \nask unanimous consent that the amendment be temporarily set aside. In \nkeeping with the unanimous consent agreement that was entered last \nnight, at some subsequent time there will be the opportunity to offer \nthe amendment Senators Kohl and DeWine are going to offer as a second-\ndegree amendment to Boxer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we expect a second-degree amendment to be \nhere to modify and perfect the Boxer amendment.\n  I want to speak about the Boxer amendment because I in no way \ndiscredit--I guess the best way to say it--fail to recognize the same \nkind of concerns Senator Boxer has expressed. She is correct. The \nSenate has expressed its will on this issue in the past. But let me \nbring you up to date about what the gun industry is doing now. Clearly, \nthe gun industry is responding very quickly to new technologies and \nwhat is available to make sure firearms are safe, if you will, from the \ncuriosity of a child and a child who might misuse it. Tragically \nenough, when children find a firearm, there is great curiosity.\n  There are organizations out there that have worked awfully hard to \neducate firearms owners and parents about the reality of a gun placed \nin a home in an unsafe environment, or not locked behind a door, or in \na situation where a child can't gain access to it. That is simply \ncritical in the responsible ownership and handling of a gun.\n  Ninety percent of new guns in the United States are already sold with \na safe storage device. The Senator from California is right, the \ndevices vary, but so do guns and so do the conformation and structure \nof guns. It will be very difficult to suggest that one size fits all.\n  The industry, with its engineers and its technology and its \ncomputers, is devising trigger locks and safety devices that fit the \nparticular firearm. This is done through a voluntary program with the \nfirearms industry. Tremendous numbers of gunshops today--responsible, \nfederally registered gunshops--are providing free of charge a trigger \nlock or a safety device as the weapon is sold. Many States and locales, \nsuch as Texas, have distributed safety devices free of charge, either \nin cooperation with the firearms industry or on their own initiative.\n  Trigger locks are mechanical devices. Like all mechanical devices \nthey can fail if they are not well designed, and if their owners are \nnot instructed on how to use them properly. The Consumer Product Safety \nCommission recently tested 32 types of gunlocks and found 30 could be \nopened without a key. That is why, clearly, uniformity is necessary. \nThe Senator spoke to that uniformity. But quality gun manufacturers in \nthis country are already providing safety devices which are critical \nand necessary.\n  What I am trying to suggest is these devices are not a panacea that \nreduces all accidents. Clearly, if we can get most handguns in America \nin safe and responsible hands and in homes with safety devices or \nlocked in a safe or locked in a device where a child cannot gain \naccess, that is going to reduce the kinds of tragic accidents that \noccur when a small child in a curious way finds the gun that may not \nhave been placed in a safe place by a parent.\n  Gunlocks are designed to address what I believe is a narrow range of \nthreats. At the same time, when a child's life is lost, how tragic it \nis, and all of us understand that. Of course, then it makes tremendous \nnews and the world wonders why this is happening. The reason it happens \nis because in many instances there was a parent who was less than \nresponsible, who really didn't lock that gun up.\n  At the same time, let's also recognize the phenomenal complication \ninvolved. Sometimes guns are placed in locations in homes for security \nand for safety, and easy access is critically important if that gun is \nto be used for the purpose of personal and property safety depending on \nthe area in which a family lives or an individual lives.\n  At the same time, that does not deny the responsibility that is \nimportant. Gunlocks address that narrow range of threats. Clearly, they \nwill deter the casual curiosity of a small child far more readily than \nit will deter what I say is the committed thief or the person bent on \nmurder and mayhem. Some suggest a gunlock means a thief in the house \nwill not steal the gun. Wrong. That simply is not the case. It simply \nmeans the thief will take the gun, take it out, knock the gunlock off, \nhave it cut off, take it away so they can have access to a stolen \nfirearm. That is the reality of thieves stealing guns.\n  This narrow range we are talking about and that we want to make sure \nstays is to deter that casual curiosity of the small child. The \nfirearms industry is already trying to develop standards to improve \nthese devices. The industry has sought the creation of an industry \nstandard for gun safety locks through the American National Standards \nInstitute. The ANSI review process is well underway. In other words, \nbecause the gun industry is a responsible industry, they are well out \nin front of us already on legislation. No, there aren't absolute \nmandatory requirements across the Nation. But recognizing the reality \nand the tragedy that occurs on occasion, we want to make sure, and the \nindustry certainly wants to make sure, that they are well out in front \nof it.\n  In a few moments we will have a second-degree perfecting amendment to \ndeal with this issue. I will reserve the remainder of my time until \nthat amendment is here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Under the terms of the order, Senator Kohl has 15 minutes \nwhen he offers his second-degree amendment. We have been advised he \nwill not use that entire amount of time, so at this time I ask consent \nthat Senator Boxer be allowed to use 4 minutes of the time under the \ncontrol of Senators Kohl and DeWine. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I take this time to respond to the point made that the \ngun manufacturers are taking care of the child safety locks and that we \ndo not need to have this law.\n  The experts in this whole field have turned out to be the National \nSAFE KIDS Campaign. This is a bipartisan organization that has one \nmission only and that is to protect our children. When they saw these \nstatistics that are still occurring today, they said enough is enough. \nA child or youth is killed by a firearm every 3 hours. This has not \nchanged.\n  In 1997, the gun manufacturers said they would work on this \nthemselves, that they did not need a law. Research assessing the \ncompliance with this agreement found most manufacturers were not \nproviding locks and those that did offered low-quality devices where \nthe locks just fell off and did not work.\n  The SAFE KIDS Campaign is urging us to include a provision to issue \nsafe standards for gunlocks. This is very important.\n  My colleague says this is taken care of. It is not taken care of. We \nstill have children dying. We still have our constituents calling with \nthe tragic cases. I read some of the cases, but not all of them, case \nafter case, kids finding out where there is a gun, grabbing it and \ntrying to act out a fantasy, not understanding this is a lethal weapon \nthat can kill or maim a brother, a neighbor, a friend.\n  We did not tell the makers of aspirin, we know you are good \nmanufacturers. They are good manufacturers. We do not tell them, please \nmake a childproof cap. They have to make a childproof cap. There are \ngood manufacturers out there. I applaud them. But if you look at our \nbill and the way it works, we are not mandating a particular one-size-\nfits-all solution. We are very careful to\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\nsay we know there are many different handguns--this only applies to \nhandguns; in my State we have one that applies to rifles and long guns, \nbut this is just a handgun--we say you can have in your array of \nproducts a box that locks. You can have the technology built in the \ngun. You can have a combination lock.\n  I appreciate my friend does not like to put regulations on gun \nmanufacturers and dealers. I understand that. And I understand he \nbelieves they are the best of the best of the best. But the problem is, \nour kids are dying in the home. They are smart. They find out where the \nguns are. I cannot understand why this is not something we would all \nsupport. The last time it came to the Senate, we had a huge vote. I am \nhoping we will have a similar vote.\n  Look to the people. We are in charge of a lot of issues. The National \nSAFE KIDS Campaign is about one issue, the safety of kids. They are \nbipartisan. They are begging us to make this the law of the land. The \nSenate did it once before. The Senate should do it again.\n  Children living in the South have an unintentional shooting death \nrate that is 7 times that of children living in the Northeast. That is \na fact the National SAFE KIDS Campaign has shown. All we need to do is \nsee the rate our kids are dying and compare it to 25 other countries to \nsee our kids are at a great disadvantage. We can do something today. I \nhope we will.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Boxer \namendment be set aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2621\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. And then I ask consent that I be recognized to offer an \namendment, and I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2621.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To clarify the definition of qualified civil liability \n                    action, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 7, line 19, strike ``including'' and all that \n     follows through page 8, line 19, and insert ``including, but \n     not limited to--\n\n       ``(I) any case in which the manufacturer or seller \n     knowingly made any false entry in, or failed to make \n     appropriate entry in, any record which such person is \n     required to keep pursuant to State or Federal law, or aided, \n     abetted or conspired with any person in making any false or \n     fictitious oral or written statement with respect to any fact \n     material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition \n     of a qualified product; or\n       ``(II) any case in which the manufacturer or seller aided, \n     abetted, or conspired with any other person to sell or \n     otherwise dispose of a qualified product, knowing or having \n     reasonable cause to believe that the actual buyer of the \n     qualified product was prohibited from possessing or receiving \n     a firearm or ammunition under subsection (g) or (n) of \n     section 922 of title 18, United States Code;''.\n\n       On page 9, lines 1 and 2, strike ``or in a manner that is \n     reasonably foreseeable'' and insert ``, or when used in a \n     manner that is reasonably foreseeable, except that such \n     reasonably foreseeable use shall not include any criminal or \n     unlawful misuse of a qualified product, other than possessory \n     offenses.''.\n       On page 9, strike lines 12 through 21, and insert the \n     following:\n       (C) Rule of construction.--The exceptions enumerated under \n     clauses (i) through (v) of subparagraph (A) are intended to \n     be construed to not be in conflict, and no provision of this \n     Act shall be construed to create a Federal private cause of \n     action or remedy.\n       On page 10, strike lines 13 through 18, and insert the \n     following:\n       (C) a person engaged in the business of selling ammunition \n     (as defined under section 921(a)(17)(A) of title 18, United \n     States Code) in interstate or foreign commerce at the \n     wholesale or retail level, who is in compliance with all \n     applicable Federal, State, and local laws.\n       On page 11, line 7, strike the semicolon and insert ``; \n     and''.\n\n       On page 11, strike lines 8 through 15, and insert the \n     following:\n       (B) 2 or more members of which are manufacturers or sellers \n     of a qualified product, and that is involved in promoting the \n     business interests of its members, including organizing, \n     advising, or representing its members with respect to their \n     business, legislative, or legal activities in relation to the \n     manufacture, importation, or sale of a qualified product.\n       On page 11, strike lines 16 through 19, and insert the \n     following:\n       (9) Unlawful misuse.--The term ``unlawful misuse'' means \n     conduct that violates a statute, ordinance, or regulation as \n     it relates to the use of a qualified product.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I acknowledge, again, as I did yesterday, the \npartnership that I have had especially with Senator Craig, Senator \nBaucus, and others in the Senate. I express my gratitude to Senator \nCraig and my appreciation for his efforts at accommodating many of the \nconcerns we have had as we address this bill.\n  I intend to support this bill, in part because of the acknowledgement \nof the need to address some of these concerns, as we do with this \namendment.\n  The amendment we are offering right now strikes a balance between the \nneed for the safety of Americans and the rights of gun manufacturers \nand dealers. That balance is critical. We recognize the vast majority \nof gun owners and manufacturers and sellers are honest and decent \npeople who obey the law and ought to be recognized for their honesty \nand the contributions they make to our economy.\n  The firearm industry is an important source of jobs, not only in \nthose States where those jobs actually are dedicated to the manufacture \nof firearms but to all other States where not only the manufacture but \nthe sale and distribution of those products are so much a part of our \neconomic base.\n  But we should not invalidate the legitimate claims from being heard \nin court when those claims have a basis in fact--cases involving kids, \ncases involving defective products, cases involving gun dealers or \nmanufacturers who broke the law.\n  So our concern was, as originally drafted, the legislation adversely \nimpacted many of these cases. That is why I went to Senator Craig and \nSenator Baucus and others and expressed the hope that we could address \nsome of these issues and concerns in a way that would accommodate a \nsolution. And that is what I believe this amendment does.\n  We have worked in a bipartisan manner. I would hope this legislation \ncould certainly be supported in a bipartisan manner. It goes a long way \nto balancing what are the rights of victims as well as the needs of the \ngun industry.\n  Our amendment makes several key changes in the legislation that was \noriginally offered. It ensures the cases in which Federal or State laws \nhave been broken can move forward. There was some lack of clarity with \nregard to that particular need. It restores the basic product liability \nstandards so, in particular, if a child is injured by a defective gun, \nthe victim's loved ones can still hold accountable those responsible. \nIt includes a provision to remove immunity from dealers who sell to \nstraw purchasers; that is, purchasers who have no interest in buying \nthe gun for themselves but passing on the gun, selling the gun to \nsomebody who should not have it. Finally, it ensures that only trade \nassociations connected to the business of manufacturing and selling \nfirearms would be covered.\n  I think all of these changes--and many more; there are eight specific \nchanges--do a great deal to enhance the bill, to make it a better, \nstronger bill and, at the same time, address the concerns that many of \nus have had. It strives to preserve the long-term vitality of an \nimportant American industry, one that is very important to people in \nthe West and Midwest, in particular, but all over the country. It \nprotects the rights and safety of the American public.\n  So I am very appreciative of the effort that has gone into this \namendment. This took a lot of time, a lot of negotiation. Obviously, \nthe subtleties in some of the language has more than a subtle impact \nultimately on how legislation is interpreted and how laws are \nultimately enforced. We think this amendment takes us a long way in \naddressing the needs of both our manufacturers as well as those who are \nconcerned for safety on the streets and in our neighborhoods today.\n  Madam President, I might just take a moment, if I could, prior to \nrelinquishing the floor, to talk about another matter. I appreciate the \naccommodation of my colleagues in so doing.\n\n[[Page S1617]]\n\n      America's Unfulfilled Treaty Obligations to Native Americans\n\n  Madam President, all week long, tribal leaders from Indian nations \nthroughout America have been in Washington for the winter conference of \nthe National Congress of American Indians.\n  They include leaders from the Great Sioux Nation of South Dakota, and \nmany others. Democratic Senators just met with many of these leaders; \nand some are in the gallery now, listening to these words. I am honored \nby their presence.\n  South Dakotans are very proud of our State's tribal heritage. Some of \nthe greatest leaders South Dakota has ever produced were Native \nAmericans. They include Crazy Horse, the legendary warrior-leader; a \nman of extraordinary nobility, the great Lakota spiritual leader, \nSitting Bull.\n  Sitting Bull helped lead his people in defense of their lands. When \nit became clear that defeat was inevitable, he helped lead his people's \nefforts to secure a fair and just peace.\n  In negotiating the treaty under which the Lakota ceded their lands, \nSitting Bull asked representatives of this Government: ``Let us put our \nminds together and see what life we can make for our children.''\n  More than a century later, the tribal leaders who have come to \nWashington this week are asking us to do the same thing: ``Let us put \nour minds together and see what life we can make for our children.''\n  Last July, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released a report that \nhas already become a landmark. It is entitled ``A Quiet Crisis.'' It \ndocuments the harsh realities of life in Indian country today. I ask \nunanimous consent that the executive summary of the report be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We cannot undo the damage caused by more than a century \nof neglect and broken promises in 1 year or even one decade. But we \nmust make honoring our trust obligations under those treaties we signed \na real priority now. And we must take steps this year to address two of \nthe most urgent obligations of Native Americans.\n  The first of these obligations is the need to find a just and fair \nsettlement of the Indian trust dispute. Partly because so many American \nIndians live on remote reservations, not many Americans understand what \nthe Indian trust fund dispute is about. It stretches back to the 1880s, \nwhen the U.S. Government broke up large tracts of Indian land into \nsmall parcels, which it then allotted to individual Indians and tribes.\n  The Government, acting as a ``trustee,'' took control of the Indian \nlands and established individual accounts for the land owners. The \nGovernment was supposed to manage the lands for account holders. It \nwould negotiate sales or leases of land, and any revenues generated \nfrom oil drilling, mining, grazing, timber harvesting--or any other use \nof the land--was to be distributed to the account holders and their \nheirs. But that is not what happened.\n  The Indian trust fund has been so badly mismanaged for so long by \nadministrations of both political parties that today no one knows how \nmuch money the trust fund should contain. Estimates of how much is owed \nto individual account holders range from a low of $10 billion to more \nthan $100 billion.\n  The people who are being hurt by this mismanagement are some of the \npoorest people in America. Many live in houses that are little more \nthan shacks, with no heat, no electricity, and no phones. Many of them \nare elderly. They have been waiting their whole lives for money that \nbelongs to them--money that our Government is holding and refuses to \naccount for.\n  Ten years ago, Congress passed legislation requiring the Department \nof the Interior to make a full and accurate historical accounting of \nall trust assets and obligations. Seven years ago, a banker named \nElouise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet Indian Nation, sued the \nDepartment to force it to comply with our order.\n  Last fall, a Federal judge finally agreed. It seemed that was going \nto be the beginning of the end of the trust fund dispute, and it was \nnow finally within reach.\n  Then, shockingly, the administration and leadership in Congress on \nthe other side, behind closed doors, added language to the 2004 \nInterior appropriations conference report ordering the Interior \nDepartment actually to ignore and defy the judge's ruling. Clearly \nunconstitutional, it violates the separation of powers and due process \nprotections.\n  It has become increasingly clear that this administration's interest \nis in limiting the Government's financial exposure rather than seeking \na just settlement of the trust dispute. Despite its obligations to \nconsult with the tribes, the Interior Department is now trying to push \nthrough its own plan to reorganize the Indian trust.\n  Tribal leaders have not been consulted. Deep skepticism and \nopposition in Indian country continues to exist.\n  Earlier this month, the administration sent Congress its budget for \nnext year. It now makes deep cuts in every program affecting Indians, \nexcept one. There is a 50-percent increase for the Department's trust \nreorganization plan.\n  The BIA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, divides America into 13 \nregions. Yesterday, congressional and tribal leaders held a ``summit'' \non trust reform. At that summit, the tribal representatives to BIA in \nall 13 regions pleaded with Congress to slow the Department's \nunilateral reorganization of the trust.\n  No trust reorganization plan can succeed without the involvement, \nsupport, and leadership of the tribes. It is time for Congress to take \na more active role in trust reform. Three things are essential.\n  First, we need a new round of comprehensive public hearings. This \nweek, Senator Ben Nigthorse Campbell announced that the Indian Affairs \nCommittee would hold hearings. I thank him.\n  Second, congressional meddling in the Cobell litigation must end. The \n``midnight rider'' putting court orders on hold must not be extended; \ncourts must be allowed to do their job. Last year Senators McCain, \nJohnson, Inouye and I introduced a bill, the American Indian Trust Fund \nManagement Reform Act Amendments, requiring the Interior Department to \nconduct an historical accounting for all trust assets.\n  Third and finally, the Federal Government should start budgeting for \nan eventual solution. Money in those accounts belongs to Indians, and \nthe Government cannot continue to hold it. Last year, In introduced the \nIndian Payment Trust Equity Act. It would create a $10 billion fund to \nbegin making payments to trust holders who have received an objective \naccounting of their trust assets.\n  Somehow, the Federal Government must put its money where its mouth is \nand begin making trust holders whole. The complexity of the challenge \ncannot be used as an excuse to continue denying account holders what is \nrightfully theirs.\n  Another injustice that must end is the chronic underfunding of the \nIndian Health Service. The report last summer by the Civil Rights \nCommission, and another by the Centers for Disease Control, show that \nNative Americans live sicker and die younger than other Americans as a \nresult of inadequate health care. The Indian Health Service budget \naccounts for one-half of 1 percent of 1 percent of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services budget. The health system with the sickest \npeople and the greatest needs get the smallest increases.\n  Last week, I held health care ``town hall meetings'' on Pine Ridge \nand Rosebud reservations in South Dakota. We expected 200; we got 700. \nI heard horrific, heartbreaking stories. People talked about losing \nparents, children, and spouses because health care wasn't available. \nSome people had waited months to see an IHS doctor. Finally, they \ncouldn't take the pain any longer. They went to a non-IHS hospital, and \nthey ended up with hospital bill they couldn't pay, so they lost their \ngood credit rating as well as their good name.\n  It is unacceptable that the Federal Government spends twice as much \non health care for Federal prisoners as it does for Indian children and \nfamilies.\n  It is immoral that sick people are turned away every day from IHS \nhospitals and clinics in this country unless\n\n[[Page S1618]]\n\nthey are in immediate danger of losing life or limb.\n  ``Life or limb'' is not a figure of speech. It is an actual standard \nfor care, and it is a national disgrace.\n  Last March, I offered an amendment to the budget resolution to \nprovide $2.9 billion in order to fully fund one part of the IHS budget. \nUnfortunately, every Republican Senator voted against it. They offered \nan amendment with $292 million, one-tenth of the amount we proposed. It \nwas inadequate, but we accepted it, only to find when we went to \nconference, the Republicans killed their own amendment in conference. \nWe tried repeatedly last year to increase funding by $2.9 billion, and \nwe will do so again this year.\n  More than a century ago, our Government signed treaties with the \nIndian nations promising to provide them and their descendants three \nthings forever: health care, education, and housing. The Federal \nGovernment must now keep its promise and provide these benefits which \nthe Indian people have already paid for in full with their lands.\n  Tribal leaders are in Washington this week asking once again that we \nlive up to our ideals.\n  Let us put our minds together and see what life we can make for our \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The federal government has a long-established special \n     relationship with Native Americans characterized by their \n     status as governmentally independent entities, dependent on \n     the United States for support and protection. In exchange for \n     land and in compensation for forced removal from their \n     original homelands, the government promised through laws, \n     treaties, and pledges to support and protect Native \n     Americans. However, funding for programs associated with \n     those promises has fallen short, and Native peoples continue \n     to suffer the consequences of a discriminatory history. \n     Federal efforts to raise Native American living conditions to \n     the standards of others have long been in motion, but Native \n     Americans still suffer higher rates of poverty, poor \n     educational achievement, substandard housing, and higher \n     rates of disease and illness. Native Americans continue to \n     rank at or near the bottom of nearly every social, health, \n     and economic indicator.\n       Small in numbers and relatively poor, Native Americans \n     often have had a difficult time ensuring fair and equal \n     treatment on their own. Unfortunately, relying on the \n     goodwill of the nation to honor its obligation to Native \n     Americans clearly has not resulted in desired outcomes. Its \n     small size and geographic apartness from the rest of American \n     society induces some to designate the Native American \n     population the ``invisible minority.'' To many, the \n     government's promises to Native Americans go largely \n     unfulfilled. Thus, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, \n     through this report, gives voice to a quiet crisis.\n       Over the last 10 years, federal funding for Native American \n     programs has increased significantly. However, this has not \n     been nearly enough to compensate for a decline in spending \n     power, which had been evident for decades before that, nor to \n     overcome a long and sad history of neglect and \n     discrimination. Thus, there persists a large deficit in \n     funding Native American programs that needs to be paid to \n     eliminate the backlog of unmet Native American needs, an \n     essential predicate to raising their standards of living to \n     that of other Americans. Native Americans living on tribal \n     lands do not have access to the same services and programs \n     available to other Americans, even though the government has \n     a binding trust obligation to provide them.\n       In preparing this report, the Commission reviewed the \n     budgets of the six federal agencies with the largest \n     expenditures on Native American programs and conducted an \n     extensive literature review.\n\n\n                       department of the interior\n\n       The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), within DOI, bears the \n     primary responsibility for providing the 562 federally \n     recognized Native American tribes with federal services. The \n     Congressional Research Service found that between 1975 and \n     2000, funding for BIA and the Office of the Special Trustee \n     declined by $6 million yearly when adjusted for inflation.\n       BIA's mismanagement of Individual Indian Money trust \n     accounts has denied Native Americans financial resources that \n     could be applied toward basic needs that BIA programs fail to \n     provide. Insufficient program funding resulted in $7.4 \n     billion in unmet needs among Native Americans in 2000. Of \n     this amount, a shortfall in tribal priority allocations \n     (TPA), which provides such basic services as child welfare \n     and adult vocational training, alone totaled $2.8 billion \n     that year. Over the last few decades, Congress has minimally \n     increased TPA funding. Unmet needs are also evident in school \n     construction. In December 2002, the deferred maintenance \n     backlog of BIA schools was estimated at $507 million and \n     increasing at an annual rate of $56.5 million due to \n     inflation and natural aging and deterioration of school \n     buildings. BIA and its programs play a pivotal role in the \n     lives of Native Americans, but mismanagement and lack of \n     funding have undercut the agency's ability to improve \n     living conditions in Native communities.\n\n\n                Department of Health and Human Services\n\n       Native Americans have a lower life expectancy than any \n     other racial/ethnic group and higher rates of many diseases, \n     including diabetes, tuberculosis, and alcoholism. Yet, health \n     facilities are frequently inaccessible and medically \n     obsolete, and preventive care and specialty services are not \n     readily available. Most Native Americans do not have private \n     health insurance and thus rely exclusively on the Indian \n     Health Service (IHS) for health care. The federal government \n     spends less per capita on Native American health care than on \n     any other group for which it has this responsibility, \n     including Medicaid recipients, prisoners, veterans, and \n     military personnel. Annually, IHS spends 60 percent less on \n     its beneficiaries than the average per person health care \n     expenditure nationwide.\n       The IHS, although the largest source of federal spending \n     for Native Americans, constitutes only 0.5 percent of the \n     entire HHS budget. Moreover, it makes up a smaller proportion \n     of HHS' discretionary budget today than five years ago. By \n     most accounts, IHS has done well to work within its resource \n     limitations. However, the agency currently operates with an \n     estimated 59 percent of the amount necessary to stem the \n     crisis. If funded sufficiently, IHS could provide more money \n     to needs such as contract care, urban health programs, health \n     facility construction and renovation, and sanitation \n     services.\n\n\n              Department of Housing and Urban Development\n\n       The availability of safe, sanitary housing in Indian \n     Country is significantly less than the need. Over-crowding \n     and its effects are a persistent problem. Furthermore, \n     existing housing structures are substandard: approximately 40 \n     percent of on-reservation housing is considered inadequate, \n     and one in five reservation homes lacks complete plumbing. \n     Native Americans also have less access to home-ownership \n     resources, due to limited access to credit, land ownership \n     restrictions, geographic isolation, and harsh environmental \n     conditions that make construction difficult and expensive.\n       While HUD has made efforts to improve housing, lack of \n     funding has hindered progress. Funding for Native American \n     programs at HUD increased only slightly over the years (8.8 \n     percent), significantly less than the agency as a whole (62 \n     percent). After controlling for inflation, HUD's Native \n     American programs actually lost spending power. The tribal \n     housing loan guarantee program lost nearly 70 percent of its \n     purchasing power over the last four years, and the Native \n     American Housing Block Grant has lost funding for three years \n     in a row. Given the unique housing challenges Native \n     Americans face, greater and immediate federal financial \n     support is needed.\n       Housing needs on reservations and tribal lands cannot be \n     met with the same interventions that HUD uses to meet rental \n     housing or homeownership goals in the suburbs or inner \n     cities. Innovation and a more comprehensive approach are \n     needed, and the government's trust responsibility to provide \n     housing to Native Americans must be fully factored into these \n     efforts.\n\n\n                         Department of Justice\n\n       All three components of law enforcement--policing, justice, \n     and corrections--are substandard in Indian Country compared \n     with the rest of the nation. Native Americans are twice as \n     likely as any other racial/ethnic group to be the victims of \n     crime. Yet, per capita spending on law enforcement in \n     Native American communities is roughly 60 percent of the \n     national average. Correctional facilities in Indian \n     Country are also more overcrowded than even the most \n     crowded state and federal prisons. In addition, Native \n     Americans have long held that tribal court systems have \n     not been funded sufficiently or consistently, and hence, \n     are not equal to other court systems.\n       Law enforcement professionals concede that the dire \n     situation in Indian Country is understated. While DOJ should \n     be commended for its stated intention to meet its obligations \n     to Native Americans, promising projects have suffered from \n     inconsistent or discontinued funding. Native American law \n     enforcement funding increased almost 85 percent between 1998 \n     and 2003, but the amount allocated was so small to begin with \n     that its proportion to the department's total budget hardly \n     changed. Native American programs make up roughly 1 percent \n     of the agency's total budget. A downward trend in funding has \n     begun that, if continued, will severely compromise public \n     safety in Native communities.\n       Additionally, many Native Americans have lost faith in the \n     justice system, in part due to perceived bias. Many attribute \n     disproportionately high incarceration rates to unfair \n     treatment by the criminal justice system, including racial \n     profiling, disparities in prosecution, and lack of access to \n     legal representation. Solving these problems is vital to \n     restoring public safety and justice in Indian Country.\n\n\n                        department of education\n\n       As a group, Native American students are not afforded \n     educational opportunities equal to other American students. \n     They routinely face deteriorating school facilities, \n     underpaid teachers, weak curricula, discriminatory treatment, \n     outdated learning tools, and\n\n[[Page S1619]]\n\n     cultural isolation. As a result, achievement gaps persist \n     with Native American students scoring lower than any other \n     racial/ethnic group in basic levels of reading, math, and \n     history. Native American students are also more likely to \n     drop out. The lack of educational opportunities in Native \n     communities extends to postsecondary and vocational programs. \n     Special Programs for Indian Adults has not been funded since \n     1995, and vocational rehabilitation programs are too poorly \n     funded to meet the abundant need. Although 14 applications \n     for such programs were submitted in 2001, only five tribal \n     organizations received funding. Tribal colleges and \n     universities receive 60 percent less federal funding per \n     student than other public community colleges.\n       The federal government has sole responsibility for \n     providing education to these students--an obligation it is \n     failing to meet. Funding for DOEd's Office of Indian \n     Education (OIE) has remained a relatively small portion of \n     the department's total discretionary budget (ranging from 0.2 \n     to 0.3 percent) between 1998 and 2003. OIE funding has \n     undergone several reductions over the last few decades and, \n     in may years, its budget has failed to account for inflation. \n     At no time during the period under review in this report have \n     all OIE subprograms been funded.\n\n\n                       department of agriculture\n\n       The USDA is largely responsible for rural development and \n     farm and business supplements in rural communities. Native \n     Americans rely on such programs to foster conditions that \n     encourage and sustain economic investments. However, \n     insufficient funding has limited the success of development \n     programs and perpetuated unstable economies. Poor economic \n     conditions have resulted in food shortages and hunger. Native \n     Americans are more than twice as likely as the general \n     population to face hunger and food insecurity at any given \n     time. The inaccessibility of food and economic development \n     programs compromises their usefulness. By its failure to \n     make programs accessible to Native Americans, the federal \n     government has denied them the opportunity to receive \n     benefits routinely available to other citizens.\n       USDA's set-aside for the Rural Community Advancement \n     Program fluctuated between 2000 and 2003. The 2004 budget \n     proposes to reduce funding by more than 18.2 percent from \n     2003. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations \n     (FDPIR) lost funding when accounting for inflation (2.8 \n     percent) between 1999 and 2003, reducing available food \n     resources. FDPIR alone is not meeting the food assistance \n     needs of Native Americans since many participants are also \n     enrolled in other food assistance programs. The continuously \n     high rates of hunger and poverty in Native communities are \n     the strongest evidence that existing funds are not enough.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       In short, the Commission finds evidence of a crisis in the \n     persistence and growth of unmet needs. The conditions in \n     Indian Country could be greatly relieved if the federal \n     government honored its commitment to funding, paid greater \n     attention to building basic infrastructure in Indian Country, \n     and promoted self-determination among tribes.\n       The Commission further finds that the federal government \n     fails to keep accurate and comprehensive records of its \n     expenditures on Native American programs. There is no uniform \n     reporting requirement for Native American program fundings, \n     and because agencies self-report their expenditures, \n     available information varies across agencies, rendering \n     monitoring of federal spending difficult.\n       While some agencies are more proficient at managing funds \n     and addressing the needs of Native Americans than others, the \n     government's failure is systemic. The Commission identified \n     several areas of jurisdictional overlap, inadequate \n     collaboration, and a lack of articulation among agencies. The \n     result is inefficiency, service delay, and wasted resources. \n     Fragmented funding and lack of coordination not only \n     complicate the application and distribution processes, but \n     also dilute the benefit potential of the funds.\n       In this study, the Commission has provided new information \n     and analyses in the hope of stimulating resolve and action to \n     address unmet needs in Indian Country. Converting data and \n     analyses into effective government action plans requires \n     commitment and determination to honor the promises of laws \n     and treaties. Toward that end, the Commission offers 11 \n     recommendations, which if fully implemented will yield (1) a \n     thorough and precise calculation of unmet needs in Indian \n     Country; (2) increased efficiency and effectiveness in the \n     delivery of services through goal setting, strategic \n     planning, implementation, coordination, and measurement of \n     outcomes; (3) perennial adequate funding; and (4) advancement \n     of Indian nations toward the goal of independence and self-\n     goverance.\n       Failure to act will signify that this country's agreements \n     with Native people, and other legal rights to which they are \n     entitled, are little more than empty promises. Focused \n     federal attention and resolve to remedy the quiet crises \n     occurring in Indian Country, embodied in these \n     recommendations and the results that flow from them, would \n     signal a decisive moment in this nation's history. That \n     moment would constitute America's rededication to live up to \n     its trust responsibility for its Native people. Only through \n     sustained systemic commitment and action will this federal \n     responsibility be realized.\n\n\n                             Recommendations\n\n        1. The Native American crisis should be addressed with the \n     urgency it demands. The administration should establish a \n     bipartisan, action-oriented initiative at the highest level \n     of accountability in the government, with representatives \n     including elected officials, members of Congress, officials \n     from each Federal agency that funds programs in Indian \n     Country, tribes, and Native American advocacy organizations. \n     The action group should be charged with analyzing the current \n     system, developing solutions, and implementing positive \n     change.\n        2. All agencies that distribute funds for Native American \n     programs should be required to regularly assess unmet needs, \n     including gaps in service delivery, for both urban and rural \n     Native individuals. Agencies should establish benchmarks for \n     the elevation of Native American living conditions to those \n     of other Americans. Agencies should document Native American \n     participation in programs and catalog initiatives.\n        3. Agencies should replicate IHS' Federal Disparity Index \n     assessment for tracking disparities in services and needs. \n     Tribal organizations and Native American advocacy groups \n     should be consulted when agencies develop measures. The \n     results of such examinations should be used to prepare budget \n     estimates, prioritize spending, and assess the status of \n     programs. Congress should require and review unmet needs \n     analyses annually as a component of each agency's budget \n     justification.\n        4. All Federal agencies that administer Native American \n     programs should be required to set aside money for \n     infrastructure building that will benefit all. Such a fund \n     should be jointly managed by the BIA, representatives from \n     each contributing agency, and a coalition of tribal leaders. \n     The contributing agencies should develop memoranda of \n     understanding and other formal coordination mechanisms that \n     outline precisely how the money will be spent.\n        5. Federal agencies should avoid implementing across-the-\n     board budget cuts when the effect on already underfunded \n     Native American programs is so severe. Agencies must prepare \n     budgets that account for the proportionality of Native \n     American funding.\n        6. Native American programs should be situated within the \n     Federal agencies that have the requisite expertise, but \n     agencies should continually improve processes for \n     redistributing funds to other agencies or tribal governments. \n     Funds for a common purpose should be consolidated within a \n     single agency so there is less overlap and clearer \n     accountability.\n        7. To the extent possible, programs for Native Americans \n     should be managed and controlled by Native Americans. \n     Distribution of funds to tribes should be closely monitored \n     by the source agencies to ensure that funds are used as \n     directed in a manner developed in consultation with Native \n     Americans and tribal governments.\n        8. Federal appropriations must compensate for costs that \n     are unique to tribes, such as those required to build \n     necessary infrastructure, those associated with geographic \n     remoteness, and those required for training and technical \n     assistance. The unique needs of non-reservation and urban \n     Native Americans must also be assessed, and adequate funding \n     must be provided for programs to serve these individuals.\n        9. Congress should request an analysis of spending \n     patterns of every Federal agency that supports Native \n     American programs, either by the U.S. General Accounting \n     Office or the Congressional Research Service. In addition, an \n     independent external contractor should audit fund management \n     of all Federal agencies distributing Native American \n     appropriations.\n        10. Each agency should have one central office responsible \n     for oversight and management of Indian funds, and which \n     prepares budgets and analyses that can be compared and \n     aggregated across agencies.\n        11. The Office of Management and Budget should develop \n     governmentwide, uniform standards for tracking and reporting \n     spending on Native American programs. Agencies should be \n     required to include justifications for each Native American \n     project in annual budget requests, as well as justifications \n     for the discontinuation of such programs. They should also be \n     required to maintain comprehensive spending logs for Indian \n     programs, including actual grant disbursements, numbers of \n     beneficiaries, and unfunded programs.\n\n  [Disturbance in the galleries.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Expressions of approval or disapproval are not \nin order.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, we are on the Daschle amendment which I \nsupport. The minority leader has expressed the value of that amendment \nto the underlying bill, S. 1805. I will be very brief about it. We can \nhave a vote on it and immediately move back to the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if there is a need for a recorded vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do not see that need.\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I think we can do this by voice because it is my \nunderstanding that the Kohl second degree is also going to be done by \nvoice vote, so that would eliminate the need for two votes. We could go \ndirectly to the Boxer amendment, as amended.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, when Senator Daschle and I began to visit \nabout the issue of liability to gun manufacturers and responsible \nlicensed gun dealers, we wanted to make sure it was as narrow as I \nexpressed yesterday that it would be. Senator Daschle came up with some \nideas that would strike the ``knowing and willing'' in the preceding \nsentences, potentially increasing the likelihood that this exception in \nthe general immunity afforded under the law would be applicable in any \ngiven case.\n  That is what we did. They are two very distinct provisions. I \ndiscussed them last night. I will not go into them today for the \nrecord. But we handed that work over to the Congressional Research \nService. What they have said is this: Applying these changes to the \nscenarios at issue--and those relate both to manufacturers and gun \nsales--it appears the amendment could have the effect of making it more \nlikely that this exception to immunity would be applicable in certain \nfacts, as established.\n  In other words, we truly have clarified the immunity provision. It is \nevery bit as narrow as we said it was, that all current Federal laws \npertaining to the mismanagement, mishandling, the criminal actions that \nare in violation of a Federal firearm license or that are in violation \nof a manufacturers responsibility are adhered to.\n  I believe the amendment is a good one. It perfects and improves S. \n1805. I encourage its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2621.\n  The amendment (No. 2621) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, under the terms of the order that is now \nbefore the Senate, Senator DeWine and Senator Kohl were to offer an \namendment. Senator DeWine is not offering the amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Kohl be allowed to offer a second-degree \namendment to the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do not object to that request, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2622 to Amendment No. 2620\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise as an original sponsor of the child \nsafety lock amendment. I thank the Senator from California for offering \nthis important measure today. The Child Safety Lock Act significantly \nreduces the incidence of gun-related tragedies in our country among the \nmost vulnerable elements of our population; namely, our children.\n  I have a second-degree amendment I wish to offer now. I send the \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2622 to amendment No. 2620.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, to \n  require the provision of a child safety lock in connection with the \n                         transfer of a handgun)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n                      TITLE II--CHILD SAFETY LOCKS\n\n     SEC. 201.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title and the amendments made by this title shall take \n     effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, as I understand it, there is no need for \ndebate on this amendment. The Senator from California has told me she \nhas no objection to our modifications. So if it is not objectionable to \nthe managers of the bill, I will speak briefly, and then I will yield \nback our time. I will not call for a rollcall vote, and I hope the \nSenate will accept these modifications by voice vote.\n  This amendment will make the Boxer amendment virtually identical to \nthe bipartisan child safety lock amendment that passed with 78 votes in \n1999. Protecting our children from accidental shooting is a concern \nthat crosses party lines, and I am proud that today we get a chance to \nexpress that concern again in an overwhelming and bipartisan way.\n  Every year, children and teenagers are involved in more than 10,000 \naccidental shootings. Close to 800 of those shootings result in a \nsenseless death. And those 800 deadly accidents do not account for the \nthousands of additional gun-related deaths of America's youth each year \nthat result from suicide or intentional shootings. Every 6 hours, a \nyoung person between the ages of 10 and 19 commits suicide with an \navailable firearm. In all, nearly 3,000 children and young people die \nevery year from gun-related injuries.\n  To many of us, this recitation of numbers and statistics is terribly \ngrim. But for the families, the pain associated with those avoidable \ndeaths is unbearable. What is equally tragic is that so many of these \ndeaths could have been prevented. The use of a child safety lock would \nhave, at the very least, stopped hundreds of accidents each and every \nyear.\n  This legislation is simple, straightforward, and effective. It \nmandates that a child safety lock device or a trigger lock be sold with \nevery handgun. Most locks resemble a padlock that locks around the gun \ntrigger and immobilizes it, preventing it from being fired. These and \nother locks can be purchased in virtually every gun store for less than \n$10. They are already used by tens of thousands of responsible gun \nowners to protect their firearms from unauthorized use, and they surely \nhave saved many lives.\n  Support for this commonsense approach to gun safety is widespread. In \n1999, the same child safety lock provision passed the Senate by an \noverwhelming vote of 78 to 20. It was an amendment during the juvenile \njustice debate. This proposal is as popular with the rest of the \ncountry and the law enforcement community as it was with the 106th \nSenate. Polls have shown that 73 percent of the American public, \nincluding 6 of 10 gun owners, favors the mandatory sale of child safety \nlocks with guns. In a survey of nearly 500 of Wisconsin's police chiefs \nand sheriffs, 90 percent agree that child safety locks should be sold \nwith every gun.\n  This legislation has the support of the current administration as \nwell. During his campaign in 2000, President Bush indicated that if \nCongress passes a bill making the sale of child safety locks mandatory \nwith every gun sale, he would sign it into law. Attorney General \nAshcroft affirmed the administration support of the mandatory sale of \nchild safety locks during his confirmation hearings before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The bill is not a panacea. It will not prevent every single avoidable \nfirearm-related accident, but the fact is all parents want to protect \ntheir children. This legislation will ensure that people purchase child \nsafety locks when they buy guns. Those who buy locks are more likely to \nuse them. That much we know is certain. Those who use the locks will be \nprotected from liability if those guns are misused.\n  The Child Safety Lock Act is a modest proposal. Though imposing a \nminimal cost on consumers, it will prevent the deaths of many innocent \nchildren every year. The Senate spoke overwhelmingly in favor of this \nproposal in 1999.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support and vote for the \namendment before us today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am glad the Senator from Wisconsin has \nstepped forward to offer a second-degree amendment. It clarifies the \nnature of damages in civil immunity language. It defines the inoperable \nin the immunity language. It reduces the penalty violation but sets a \ngood one--a $2,500 civil fine. Revocation may be a bit harsh, but there \nis a small clarification in the Rules of Evidence. It takes effect 180 \ndays after enactment.\n  Of course, as I mentioned earlier in the debate--and I will discuss \nthis later after this amendment is accepted--nearly all manufacturers \ntoday comply with this very point as guns leave the factory. So the \nindustry is moving rapidly toward compliance.\n  With that, I think we are prepared to vote on the second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 2622 to amendment No. 2620.\n  The amendment (No. 2622) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REED. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what is the business before the Senate? Is \nit the Boxer amendment, as amended by the Kohl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Boxer amendment, as amended.\n  Mr. REID. What time is remaining on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I will take some of those minutes to \nspeak to the Boxer amendment, as amended. I do oppose this amendment \nand here are some very simple facts why.\n  I have already talked about the industry itself moving rapidly in a \nvoluntary way toward compliance. Clearly, the bill has been improved by \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, but let me suggest this to all of us \nbecause I think we understand it in rather simple terms. The home is a \nprivate place and for the first time the long arm of Government will \nreach into the private place and suggest to the average American how \nthey will store an object in that private place.\n  I am not arguing about the care, the emotion, the concern, and the \nreality, not that at all. I understand that. But I do not believe that \nGovernment ought to be telling the average citizen how they store \nobjects within their home.\n  We are hearing about the tragedies of children losing their life by \nthe misuse of a firearm. I think the Senator from Wisconsin mentioned \nsuicides. My guess is, trigger locks do nothing to suicides. The great \ntragedy of a suicide is that a teenager thinks it out, and if they \nthink it out they are probably going to find the key to the trigger \nlock or they will know where it is as a teenager and that will not stop \nthat tragedy. That is an emotional situation that none of us quite \nunderstand sometimes why teenagers resort to that kind of action and \nviolence.\n  I will talk about the home environment and what is going on in the \nhome environment. Since 1930, accidental deaths by firearms in the home \nhave declined 62 percent. Firearms are now involved in only 1.5 percent \nof accidental fatalities nationwide within the home. Here is the \ntragedy: Deaths caused to children by motor vehicle accidents is 47 \npercent; a child falling down in the home, deaths 15 percent; \npoisoning, 10 percent; drowning, 4 percent; fire, 8 percent; \nsuffocation on small objects going down the throat of a small child, 3 \npercent. More children suffocate by an object lodging in their throat \nthan by finding an improperly stored handgun. Now, those are the facts, \nas we know them. Those facts\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\ncome from the National Safety Council, the National Center for Health \nStatistics.\n\n  Again, I do not dispute the emotion or the concern or the care that \nthe Senator from California has on this issue, but I do dispute the \nright of the Federal Government to enter the home and tell the average \ncitizen they have to comply with mandatory storage laws that exist with \npenalties. I believe that is unnecessary in a free society.\n  I believe safety and responsibility is always necessary, and the \nindustry is rapidly moving in that direction. Ninety percent are in \ncompliance with the fundamental principles of the law itself.\n  This is the thing that concerns me most: Most States already provide \npenalties for reckless endangerment under which an adult found grossly \nnegligent in the storage of a firearm under certain circumstances can \nbe prosecuted for a felony offense. Universal mandatory storage \nrequirements are counterproductive. That is going at the individual, \ninstead of allowing the long arm of the law to come into the home. \nClearly, that is the way it ought to be.\n  We know that no one-size-fits-all requirement can possibly meet the \nneeds of all gun owners, and that is what is being suggested. We have \nalready seen the industry involve science and technology to try to deal \nwith this issue, and they are trying to develop those kinds of \nstandards that work.\n  I have already mentioned that the National Safety Council tested 32 \ntypes of gunlocks and found that 30 of them could be opened without a \nkey. While the industry is rushing to get there, what we are needing, \nand the industry is now doing it, is standardization.\n  In any emergency, and now we are talking about oftentimes why a gun \nis in a home, a trigger lock can handicap a person who needs a gun for \nprotection. While the industry is trying to make them applicable so \nthey can be accessed within seconds or minutes in case the burglar is \nbreaking into the home, the reality is that if the gun is locked away \nin a safe it is ineffective as a use for personal protection in an \nunsafe environment. Those are the kinds of concerns I think all of us \nhave as we talk about these kinds of issues and as we tick away at the \nright of the private gun owner to manage what I believe is a \nconstitutional right in this country.\n  I will give a little bit of history and then I will close. In 1936, \nBritish police began adding the following requirements for firearms \ncertificates: Firearms and ammunition to which this certificate relates \nmust at all times, when not in actual use, be stored in safe and secure \nplaces. That was 1936. What has transpired in British law until today \nis that if one wants to own a gun and they get a certificate to own a \ngun, the British police come into their home and ask where they are \ngoing to store it. They look at where it is going to be stored and if \nthe gun owner does not have a lockbox or if they do not have a safe, \nthey do not own a gun.\n  Will that ever happen in this country? I would hope not. I hope \nAmericans would rebel about the reality of the police entering their \nhome to tell them what to do as it relates to storing an object in the \nhome, especially an object that we believe is a constitutional right. \nThat is the issue at hand.\n\n  Again, I am not going to argue with the reason or the logic that the \nSenator from California has expressed. States are moving now, and I \nthink in some ways responsibly, to encourage, educate, and train. The \nindustry is moving in that direction. To establish a Federal \nrequirement that says this is the way one is going to do it in their \nhome--I believe in a fundamental right of privacy--this is a breach of \nthat right and an entry into the home with the long arm of Federal law. \nI do not think we ought to go there.\n  I hope Senators will join with me in opposing this amendment as \namended by the Kohl amendment. I am prepared to yield back the \nremainder of my time in relation to a vote on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on this amendment all time has been used. \nI ask the good offices of my friend from Idaho to allow the Senator \nfrom California 1 minute to respond to the statements of the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I accept that if I have an additional 1 minute to close \nafter the Senator from California.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the request be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Following that, I would like a moment for a quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that is fine. I would indicate that \nfollowing however long the quorum takes, we would vote on the Boxer \namendment as amended by Kohl. Then I would alert everyone that we would \nthen have a period of time for up to 1 hour, that Senator Campbell--at \nleast the way I understand the order now before the Senate--would have \nup to an hour on his amendment. Senator Kennedy would follow with an \nhour on his amendment. Then two 2 hours would, of course, have gone by. \nSenator Frist has the opportunity to offer an amendment. We do not know \nif he will at the time.\n  My point being on those two amendments, the Campbell and Kennedy \namendments, there will be no votes until Tuesday. But that is a \nsignificant amount of time. Following that, Cantwell has 60 minutes. So \nthis afternoon we should have a lot of debate with no votes in the \nimmediate future. I would simply ask that those Senators be ready to go \nas soon as the vote is completed on this matter.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for that. I yield the floor to the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate my friend yielding.\n  I think this argument has now been joined. The argument Senator Craig \nmakes against this amendment, to me, is just off point. This bill is \nnot a mandatory storage law. This has nothing to do with a mandatory \nstorage law. The fact is we have passed this before, 78 to 20. We are \nnot saying you have to have storage. We are saying that when you go to \nbuy a handgun, it has some type of device on it. We don't mandate what \nthat device is. We say it could be one of five or six different things. \nThere will be standards set. It is not one-size-fits-all. It is not a \nmandatory storage law.\n  I agree with my friend, if the gun manufacturers do this on their \nown, that is great. But as we have learned from the SAFE KIDS Campaign, \nnot all of them are doing it. Some of them are and some of our kids are \nexposed.\n  I have two quick further points to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for an additional minute and give my friend 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me make this point. When my friend compares an \naccidental shooting with a gun resulting in a death to a suicide, I \nwould say that is quite different, because in the tragedy of suicide, \nalthough my friend is quite right, we do try on some of our bridges to \nbuild barriers, but if there is an intent, although we do our best, we \noften fail. But a 3-year-old or 5-year-old child picking up a gun \nreally doesn't know someone is going to die. So it is up to us to make \nsure we do our best. That is all; we do our best.\n  My last point. There are standards for aspirin caps, cribs, Play-Doh, \nTeddy bears, pajamas. There ought to be a standard for a safety lock on \na gun. I don't think we do violence to freedom in any way.\n  I wish my friend were with me on this, but if not, I hope we can \nrepeat the vote we had last time; 78 to 20 sounds really good. I hope \nwe can do that again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief. I don't question the \nsincerity of the Senator from California. I recognize what she is \nattempting to do.\n  The industry is rushing. It is at near 90 percent compliance today. \nWe want firearms to be as safe as possible in this country.\n  Let me close with this. Firearms are involved in 1.5 percent of the \naccidents within a home that involve a child; motor vehicles and \nchildren: 47 percent of the deaths of young children are caused by \nmotor vehicles; falling, 15 percent; poisoning, 10 percent; drowning, 4 \npercent; fire, 3 percent; objects ingested and lodged in the throat in \nwhich they suffocate, 3 percent.\n\n[[Page S1623]]\n\n  As tragic as all of this is, it is a very small number. We are now \nworking aggressively to resolve that. The industry has developed \nstandards. I don't believe these penalties are necessary. I don't \nbelieve this approach of uniformity and Federal mandate is necessary. I \nask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader has indicated it, and \nthe minority is happy to go forward with a vote at this time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2620, as amended. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The senior journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McConnell. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Idaho, did he say the \nCampbell-Leahy concealed-carry bill is the next in line?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I believe that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then I will stay here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. May I inquire of the managers of the bill, if there are a \nfew minutes before you get to this, I would like to take a few minutes \nand speak on the underlying bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes. I see no reason why the Senator could not speak. How \nlong does the Senator intend to speak?\n  Mr. DODD. I see my colleague from Massachusetts. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am trying to find out how we are going \nto proceed. I have seen the agreement. I am just trying to understand \nthe order. We have the concealed weapons amendment and then the cop \nkiller bullets. I thought we had a time limit on those. I am trying to \nfind out.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the order now before the Senate indicates \nthe next amendment is the Campbell-Leahy amendment. That is 60 minutes. \nThe time, of course, is in the usual form. Following that is the \nKennedy cop killer bullets amendment. Following that is the Cantwell \namendment and maybe somebody else in between. That is where we are. I \ndo not see Senator Campbell on the floor.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand we will have an hour. It will be an hour \nequally divided. I will have 30 minutes. I would be glad to yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Connecticut so he can make his comments, \nand we can move the process along. If it is agreeable with the \nmanagers, that is certainly agreeable with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask that Senator Dodd be allowed 10 minutes from \nSenator Kennedy's time on the amendment that will soon be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I will yield for purposes of having the amendment proposed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, let me go first.\n  Mr. DODD. Are you going to take 30 minutes? I would like to be able \nto be heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2623\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senators Campbell, Leahy, Hatch, DeWine, Sessions, and Craig, and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant Journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. \n     Campbell, Mr. Leahy, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Craig, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2623.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 18, United States Code, to exempt qualified \ncurrent and former law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting \n                  the carrying of concealed handguns)\n\n       On page 11, after line 19, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5.

Carrying of concealed firearms by qualified retired law \n              enforcement officers.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let's see if my colleague from Connecticut \ncan agree to this. I intend to take a few minutes to define the bill. I \nhave promised Senator DeWine, I think he only has about 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. If I may proceed and then finish in a few minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will say my statement in a very few minutes. Then I ask \nunanimous consent that we go to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut and then----\n  Mr. DODD. I think I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada had the floor and \nrelinquished the floor. Now the Senator from Utah has the floor. There \nwas a unanimous consent request that was agreed to when the Senator \nfrom Connecticut was yielded 10 minutes from Senator Kennedy's time, \nbut then the Senator from Utah sent up an amendment and reclaimed the \nfloor. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be short. I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut be recognized pursuant to \nSenator Kennedy's granting of time and immediately thereafter the \nSenator from Ohio be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Today I rise and join Senators Campbell, Leahy, Reid, and \nothers I have named on this bill to offer it as an amendment to S. \n1805, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003, which was \nfavorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee with strong \nbipartisan support last session.\n  This amendment, which permits qualified current and retired law \nenforcement officers to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction, \nwill help protect the American public, our Nation's officers, and their \nfamilies. I would note this bill has the overwhelming support of the \nFraternal Order of Police and other law enforcement associations which \nhave vigorously worked in support of this measure.\n  This amendment allows qualified law enforcement officers and retired \nofficers to carry, with appropriate identification, a concealed firearm \nthat has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce \nregardless of State or local laws.\n  Importantly, this legislation does not supersede any State law that \npermits private persons to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms \non any State or local government properties, installations, buildings, \nbases, or parks. Additionally, this amendment clearly defines what is \nmeant by ``qualified law enforcement officer'' and ``qualified retired \nor former law enforcement officer'' to ensure those individuals \npermitted to carry concealed firearms are highly trained professionals.\n  This amendment will not only provide law enforcement officers with \nthe legal means to protect themselves and their families when they \ntravel interstate, it will also enhance the security of the American \npublic, which is long overdue.\n  By enabling qualified active duty and retired law enforcement \nofficers to carry firearms, even if off duty, more trained law \nenforcement officers will be on the street to enforce the law and to \nrespond to any crises that may arise.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment because \npassage of this important legislation will provide that extra layer of \nprotection to current and retired law enforcement officers, their \nfamilies, and the public that we so desperately need.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the cosponsors on this bill, which \nincludes Senator Reid. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reid be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, \nSenator Hatch and Senator Kennedy, for being very gracious in providing \nme a few minutes to address the underlying bill. I know we are going to \ndebate the amendment on concealed weapons, but I wish to share with my \ncolleagues my views on this legislation.\n  I cannot see any amendment that can be offered to this legislation \nthat is going to convince this Senator that the underlying bill \ndeserves support. I am stunned, in many ways, that we are even \nsuggesting this legislation. I can only imagine what the reaction would \nbe if I were to come to the Chamber and offer a similar amendment that \nwould exclude any other industry in the country from the exposure of \npotential liability for wrongdoing.\n  In my State, I represent more gun manufacturers than any other Member \nof this body. I also represent probably more insurance companies and \nmore pharmaceutical companies in the State of Connecticut than almost \nany other State in the country. As strongly as I support the people who \nwork in these businesses and respect what they do, the idea that we \nwould take an entire industry and remove it from the potential of \nliability is rather breathtaking to me in this day and age.\n  I am a great advocate of tort reform, as many of my colleagues know. \nI authored the securities litigation reform bill and wrote the uniform \nstandards litigation bill. I am now working on class action reform. But \nthe idea that we would take an entire industry and give it immunity \nfrom wrongdoing, I think, is rather stunning to this Member.\n\n[[Page S1625]]\n\n  I wish to share with my colleagues some general thoughts. I know \nthere are amendments going to be offered on assault weapons and a \nvariety of other proposals, but I want to put my colleagues on notice. \nI do not think we can offer any amendment to this bill that will \noutweigh the harm done by the underlying proposal and the precedent we \nare setting in this body. We are taking an industry and saying: No \nmatter what you do, no matter how much harm you may cause, you never \nhave to worry about being held liable and accountable for your actions. \nIn this day and age, that this body would so overwhelmingly endorse an \nidea such as this is breathtaking.\n\n  I wish to take a few minutes to say why it is so outrageous. I want \nto add, with all the matters we should be addressing with the limited \ntime in this session, with the thousands of people losing their jobs \ntoday, we have nothing to say about outsourcing. When we have 44 \nmillion Americans without health insurance, we have nothing to say \nabout those issues. We are drowning in budget deficits and trade \ndeficits. We have the worst job deficit since the Great Depression. \nPoverty is increasing, and this Chamber has nothing to say on those \nissues except we are now going to take one group of manufacturers and \nsay: Don't worry about anything, you don't have to ever be held \naccountable for your wrongdoing.\n  This legislation, in my view, is bad policy for a number of reasons. \nFirst, it will have absolutely no impact whatsoever on reducing the \nrate of gun violence in our Nation. In fact, this bill ignores the \ndevastating toll firearm violence continues to have on the country.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there \nwere nearly 29,000 deaths in the United States from firearms in the \nyear 2001 alone--29,000 deaths. That is, of course, 10 times the number \nof lives that were tragically lost on September 11 at the World Trade \nCenter, here in Washington, and in Pennsylvania. In fact, one year of \ngun violence in America nearly equals the number of Americans who died \nin the Korean war and almost half the Americans lost in the entire \nVietnam conflict.\n  The numbers are staggering. These numbers exceed by a huge margin the \nnumber of firearm-related deaths on a per-capita basis in countries \nsuch as Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and France.\n  Among those individuals most affected by gun violence are children. \nIt is not just an incident such as the Columbine High School massacre \nin 1999 or inner-city neighborhood shootings that should make us \nrealize that children are among the most vulnerable to gun violence. \nChildren are also killed or injured by firearms because their parents \ndid not store their guns properly, and the kids used them for \nhorseplay.\n  It is no coincidence then that firearms are the second leading death \namong young Americans ages 19 and under. Approximately 2,700 children \nunder the age of 19 are killed each year as a result of gun violence or \nimproper use of guns.\n  The rate of firearm deaths of children under the age of 14 is already \n12 times higher in the United States than in 25 other industrialized \nnations combined. Let me repeat that. The firearm death rates of \nchildren under the age of 14 is 12 times higher in the United States \nthan in 25 other industrialized nations combined.\n  We are about to exclude an entire industry from even being brought to \nthe bar to question whether or not they might be liable. One study \nnoted the firearm injury epidemic among children is nearly 10 times \nlarger than the polio epidemic in the first half of the 20th century.\n  The human cost of gun-related deaths and injuries is tragic in \nitself, but the economic loss is also significant. According to a study \npublished in 2000, the average costs of treating gunshot wounds were \n$22,000 for each unintentional shooting and $18,400 for each gun \nassault injuries. These costs would undoubtedly be much higher today.\n  Total societal cost of firearms is estimated to be between $100 \nbillion and $126 billion per year. Who pays these expenses? By and \nlarge the American taxpayers do.\n  My colleagues speak against unfunded mandates, and yet this bill, if \nenacted, burdens the Nation's cities and counties with billions and \nbillions of dollars in medical care, emergency services, police \nprotections, courts, prisons, and school security. It is shameful that \nwhile tens of thousands of people are dying each year due to firearms, \nand while the American taxpayers pay tens of billions of dollars to \ncope with the effect of gun violence, the United States Senate is doing \nabsolutely nothing to make our streets and homes safer. In fact, we are \ndoing quite the opposite by our actions today.\n  Second, the legislation will give this industry special legal \nprotections that no other industry in the United States has. Neither \ncigarette companies nor asbestos companies nor polluters have such \nsweeping immunity as we are about to give this industry. In fact, gun \nmanufacturers and sellers are already exempt from Federal Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission regulation, despite the fact firearms are \namong the most dangerous and deadly products in society. We have more \nregulations on toy guns than we do on the ones that fire real bullets.\n\n  Imagine that, a toy gun that you buy from Mattel, the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission issues literally pages of regulations on what \nmust be included in the production of that toy gun. There is not a \nsingle word in the Consumer Product Safety Commission about the \nproduction of a gun that may kill 29,000 people each year in this \ncountry. The National Rifle Association made sure of this exemption 30 \nyears ago, just as highly addictive tobacco products are not subject to \nregulation by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  I have supported tort reform in specific areas where I believe it is \nappropriate. My colleagues know that. At the same time, I recognize \nthat litigation has been a powerful tool in holding parties accountable \nfor their negligence and providing them with incentive to improve the \nsafety of their products.\n  It has been employed on behalf of other potentially dangerous \nproducts, such as cars, lawnmowers, household products, and medicines, \nto protect the health of the American people. The fact that guns are \nalready specifically exempt from the oversight of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission is reason enough, in my view, why we cannot afford to \ngrant the firearm industry legal immunity.\n  If this legislation is enacted, and I know it will be given the \nnumber of cosponsors and how this bill is sweeping through the \nCongress, would it remove any incentive under current products \nliability law for gun manufacturers to make their firearms safer? \nStudies have shown that the technology is both readily available and \nvery inexpensive to install in order to help avoid future gun-related \ntragedies.\n  For example, a load indicator could be included to tell the user that \nthe gun is still loaded. That is never going to happen now, I promise. \nA magazine disconnect safety could be installed by the manufacturers to \nprevent guns from firing if the magazine is removed. Even child \nproofing the gun with safety locks can be done relatively easily. \nHowever this bill is enacted into law, gun manufacturers will lose a \nhuge incentive to include such reasonable safety devices in their \nproducts.\n  I know I am going to hear shortly, well, we just adopted a gun safety \nlock amendment. We did that a few years ago as well. What happened to \nit? It got dumped. That is what happened. Do not have any illusion \nabout these amendments being adopted. My colleagues have been around \nlong enough to know what is going to happen. When this bill leaves the \nSenate and goes down the hall to the other Chamber all of these nice \nprovisions that are included will be dropped, just as they have been in \nthe past.\n  Third, this legislation would close the courthouse door on our \nNation's mayors, gun victims, and law enforcement officers who are \nseeking to hold the gun industry accountable for their negligent \nconduct. Just last week, Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton and \nover 80 other prominent law enforcement leaders from 26 States sent a \nletter to the Senate opposing the legislation.\n  The chiefs warned that passage of the immunity legislation would \nresult in more illegal gun running and deter efforts to develop child-\nresistant guns. In the words of Chief Bratton:\n\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\n\n       The passage of this bill would deliver a devastating blow \n     to justice. The NRA and Congress need to understand that \n     special interest groups cannot come before public safety. Gun \n     stores and manufacturers must be held to the same standards \n     of safety as any other industry. And if they fail to act \n     responsibly, they must pay the price.\n\n  Evidence has been uncovered which reveals that the gun industry has \nbeen engaged in irresponsible behavior for many years. Senator Reed and \nothers have already mentioned one such industry actor: Bull's Eye \nShooter Supply in Tacoma, WA. This gun store claims that it ``lost'' \nthe gun used by the Washington, DC snipers John Muhammed and Lee Boyd \nMalvo as well as more than 200 other guns. Many of these firearms were \nlater traced to other crimes.\n  In fact, Bull's Eye Shooter Supply had no record of the gun ever \nbeing sold and did not report it until after the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms recovered the weapon and traced it back to the \nstore.\n  Even after the rifle was linked to the sniper shootings and the \nnewspapers reported on the disappearance of the guns from Bull's Eye, \nthe rifle's manufacturer, Bushmaster Firearms, declared that it still \nconsidered Bull's Eye a ``good customer'' and was happy to keep selling \nto the shop. The judge in this case has since ruled twice that the suit \nbrought by the families of the DC-area sniper victims against both \nBushmaster Firearms and Bull's Eye Shooter Supply should proceed to \ntrial, and a preliminary appeal of these rulings has been rejected.\n  Nevertheless, this case as well as other important pending and future \nlawsuits against negligent gun dealers and manufacturers would be \nbanned under the Senate bill, according to the opinion of two of the \nNation's most prominent attorneys, David Boies and Lloyd Cutler.\n  There are many other instances of the gun industry not taking steps \nto prevent guns from reaching the illegal market. According to Federal \ndata from 2000, 1.2 percent of dealers account for 57 percent of all \nguns recovered in criminal investigations.\n  Undercover sting operations in Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana have \nfound that such dealers routinely permit gun sales to ``straw \npurchasers,'' that is, individuals with clean records who buy guns for \ncriminals, juveniles, or other individuals barred by law from \npurchasing them. Again, if the Senate bill is enacted, police officers \nshot by a gun bought by a straw purchaser would no longer get his day \nin court.\n  Gun shows are also an important source of guns for criminals. I am \npleased to join my colleagues Senators McCain and Reed in co-sponsoring \nlegislation to close the gun show loophole in the Brady Act. Studies \nhave shown that unlicensed dealers often sell large quantities of guns \nat these shows without having to run criminal background checks or \nkeeping records.\n  Many of my colleagues might recall that a gun show was the source of \nthe firearm purchased Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold before they went on \ntheir murderous rampage at Columbine High School. But again, the Senate \nbill will not hold such negligent gun sellers responsible for the \ninjuries and deaths their firearms cause.\n  Supporters of this legislation contend that there is a gun litigation \ncrisis in America, and that many of the cases being brought against the \ngun industry are frivolous. Nothing could be further from the truth. In \nfact, there are no massive backlogs of claims against gun dealers and \nmanufacturers burdening the court system, as with the asbestos \nlitigation. Only 33 municipalities and one State, New York, have filed \nsuits against gun makers. Not one of these cases has been dismissed as \nbeing frivolous.\n  In fact, 18 cities and counties have won favorable rulings on the \nlegal merits of their cases. These courts have recognized that such \ncases are based upon well-established legal principles as negligence, \nproduct liability, and public nuisance. Important information on the \ngun industry's wrongful actions, which has long been cloaked in secrecy \nfor many years, is being revealed during the discovery process. These \ncases, however, will be precluded, and the information gleaned from \nthem will be lost, if the gun industry is granted the immunity it \nseeks.\n  This legislation is the wrong way for the Senate to proceed on gun \nviolence. Rather than giving special immunity to those manufacturers \nand dealers who wrongfully make and sell guns to criminals, the Senate \nshould be working to protect our police officers and the people they \nprotect.\n  Rather than placing more guns on the streets, the Senate should be \nconsidering more responsible guns legislation, such as making the ban \non assault weapons permanent and closing the gun show loophole. I am \nhopeful that the Senate will have a full and comprehensive debate on \nthese important issues in the coming days.\n  Rather than encouraging reasonable and safe gun use, the Senate is \ndestroying any incentive for gun manufacturers to improve the safety of \ntheir deadly wares.\n  The Senate wisely defeated a cloture motion on the motion to proceed \nto the medical malpractice bill. It should now tell the gun industry \nthat they need to be held accountable for their deeds as is the case \nfor every other industry in America so I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis legislation.\n  I have great respect for my colleagues, but there is no amendment \nthat is going to be adopted in this Chamber that is going to make this \nugly legislation any better. I do not care how much lipstick is put on \nthis one, this is an unattractive bill by any measure, and I am going \nto vote against it no matter what. What we are doing is outrageous. As \nthe Senator who represents more of these manufacturers than any other \nMember in this body, I can say this is flat out wrong and we ought to \nbe ashamed of ourselves for taking an entire industry and not holding \nit potentially liable for the harm that it causes to people across this \ncountry. Thirty thousand people die every year, almost 3,000 kids, and \nwe are about to say to the manufacturer of the products that kill them \nto take a walk and that you never have to show up again in court. That \nis incredible to me that we are about to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I turn the time over to the Senator \nfrom Ohio, let me only say to the Senator from Connecticut, go back and \nread section 4 of the bill.\n  He is a very eloquent Senator, but at the same time this is a very \nnarrow provision. It says if that manufacturer in a State or if a \nlicensed gun dealer violates the law, they are in trouble. You bet we \nmake it to the courthouse. We make it in front of the judge and the \njudge hears the arguments.\n  Let me also refer to one of the Senator's concerned constituents, the \npresident of Local 376 of the UAW, who has lost over 600 jobs in the \nSavage Arms Factory because they have had to spend millions of dollars \ndefending themselves on frivolous lawsuits. So that is a problem.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not yield. To a question, I will respond.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator raised my name. I did not talk about the \nSenator from Idaho. The Senator used my name. May I respond?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have the floor. I would be happy to provide the letter \nto the Senator. I referred to the Senator as an eloquent spokesman and \nI ask the Senator to read section 4 of the bill.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Ohio who is a cosponsor of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be happy to yield another minute to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut so he may respond.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have the floor and I have already yielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The manager of the bill cannot yield the floor \nto another Senator. The Senator has the right----\n  Mr. CRAIG. I allocated him time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can allocate time. Other Senators \nhave the right to compete for recognition, but the Senator cannot \nautomatically give him the right for recognition.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nConnecticut from my time. I do not want\n\n[[Page S1627]]\n\nhim to feel I have impugned his good name in any sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can yield and he can compete for \nrecognition.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take less than a minute to say \nsomething about losing jobs. I have lost 45,000 manufacturing jobs in \nmy State over the last few months. It has nothing to do with this. It \nhas to do with the fact that this administration has decided that \nmanufacturing jobs are producing hamburgers at McDonald's, and believe \nthat outsourcing is a great thing for the country. That is where my \njobs are going, not because of litigation.\n  There have been 33 lawsuits by counties or communities and one by a \nState brought against the gun manufacturers. None of them have ever \ngone anywhere. What are we doing? Tell me there is some great problem \nout here in litigation with my companies losing lawsuits all across the \ncountry.\n  We are a nation of 280 million people. Thirty-three lawsuits by \ncounties, one by a State. The manufacturers never lost one. Why are we \nchanging the law? Why, when 30,000 people die every year, 3,000 kids, \nwhy are we changing the law? There is no justification in fact or in \nlaw to be doing this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I can now yield \na block of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is there a unanimous \nconsent agreement on time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To the Senator's question, the time is \nallocated to both sides. Senator Kennedy is controlling the time for \nthe minority and Senator Craig is controlling the time for the \nmajority. There are 18 minutes 59 seconds remaining under the control \nof Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, ask the indulgence of my colleague from \nOhio, who I guess has the floor now, would he yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Certainly.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of my \nfriend from Connecticut. This is about the raw exercise of political \npower. I do not know how many times in my 31 years I have ever heard a \nSenator stand up on the floor when he represents the greatest number of \nconstituents affected by a bill, who are major players in his State, \nand say he disagrees with their position. We are missing an awful lot \nof that.\n  I acknowledge that this man has some political courage. We all would \ndo a lot better if there were a lot more of it to go around.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho and my \ncolleague from Colorado for agreeing to change the name of this \namendment from the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act to the Steve \nYoung Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act.\n  This name has particular meaning to me. I believe the renaming of \nthis provision is a fitting tribute to a man who dedicated his life to \nkeeping our community safe and free from crime.\n  Steve Young was a dear friend of mine from the State of Ohio. He was \nalso a well-known and well-respected figure in the law enforcement \ncommunity. Steve was elected by his peers to serve as the national \npresident of the Fraternal Order of Police and held this post until his \ndeath from cancer on January 9, 2003. Steve was just 49 years of age at \nhis death.\n  Steve grew up in Upper Sandusky, OH, and was a graduate of Upper \nSandusky High School. He joined the Marion City Police Department in \n1976 and spent his entire law enforcement career as an active-duty \nofficer there. It was in Marion that Steve first became a member of the \nFOP, joining FOP lodge No. 24. He later went on to serve as president \nof this lodge in the year 2000. He received the prestigious lifetime \nhonor of president emeritus.\n  Leadership in the law enforcement community came naturally to Steve, \nas his hard work and dedication earned him the respect and admiration \nof his peers. Steve went on to become active in the Ohio State lodge of \nthe FOP and served first as vice president and then as president, \nrepresenting Ohio's 24,000 law enforcement officers. Through the Ohio \nState lodge, Steve helped to create the Ohio Labor Council. This \ncouncil created a model for improved labor-management negotiation in \npolice forces, a model that has now been adopted in at least 14 other \nStates.\n  Steve's leadership in the Ohio law enforcement community and really \nhis expertise in labor issues earned him a national reputation.\n  In 2001, after serving for 4 years as national vice president, Steve \nwas unanimously elected to serve as the national president of the FOP. \nIn this capacity, Steve represented over 300,000 law enforcement \nofficers and worked to protect their interests, the interests of our \nNation's finest. This was a job I know Steve loved and one he did with \ngreat dignity and pride.\n  While Steve Young had an incredibly successful career with multiple \naccomplishments, I would also like to take a few moments to discuss my \npersonal connection with Steve. I had the privilege of knowing not just \nSteve Young the police officer but also Steve Young the man. Steve was, \nas I said, a dear friend of mine for many years. He was someone in whom \nI had a great deal of trust, and was fortunate to be able to call on \nhim as a trusted adviser. I can't tell Members of the Senate and you, \nMr. President, how often I would call him for advice, whether it was \nwhen I was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio or later when I was a Senator.\n  I had the opportunity to work with Steve for many, many years. I \nrelied heavily on his advice and his counsel. I consulted with him \nregularly on criminal justice matters, and his keen insights have \nhelped shape nearly every piece of crime legislation with which I have \nbeen involved.\n  Steve made a lasting impression on law enforcement, both in Ohio and \nacross our Nation. From pension plans to crime fighting technology, \nSteve's foresight and his vision have helped bring law enforcement into \nthis century.\n  One of the last times I saw Steve he was in Washington for a \nJudiciary Committee hearing. I am fortunate that I had a chance to \nspend a few moments with him that day. It is that meeting that reminded \nme of Steve's humility. He was a humble man. He had no airs about him. \nHe was quiet and self-effacing. He didn't put on a show or try to \nimpress people with his position or his power within the national FOP.\n  But you know, at the same time, his affable nature did not hide the \nfact that Steve Young was also a very strong man: brave, courageous, \nfearless, and tough as nails. After all, he was a policeman, and \nexactly the kind of policeman I would have wanted by my side when I was \na county prosecutor many years ago, the kind of policeman I would have \nwanted helping me if I were a victim of crime, the kind of policeman I \nwould have wanted protecting my children or grandchildren or any member \nof my family. That was Steve Young--a model for all law enforcement.\n  He was a humble, dedicated man who devoted his career to working for \nthe good of his fellow officers, for the good of Ohio, for the good of \nthis Nation. Steve's commitment to our communities was evident in \neverything he did. Criminals were caught because of him and crimes were \nprevented. He was a protector. He was a leader. He was a good and \ndecent, hard-working man for whom I have the greatest respect and \nadmiration.\n  It is fitting that this amendment now is named after Steve Young.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Who yields \ntime? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Leahy is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the managing Senator.\n  I listened to what the distinguished Senator from Ohio said about \nSteve Young. I thought it was eloquent, well put, and I wish to join in \nthose comments. I consider myself very fortunate to have known Steve. I \nthought how important it was that we change the\n\n[[Page S1628]]\n\nshort title of this amendment to ``The Steve Young Law Enforcement \nOfficers Safety Act.'' I remember even talking with Steve a number of \ntimes after he was ill and could no longer travel. Through all of that \ntime, he, in typical fashion, spoke about others and not about himself.\n  I began my public career in law enforcement. To this day, the only \nthing in my personal Senate office that has my name on it is the plaque \nthe police gave me when I left that career in law enforcement to become \na Senator. It is a plaque on the door to my office with my name and \nabove it is the badge I carried as a law enforcement official.\n  One thing I knew during my time in law enforcement, the law \nenforcement officers are never off duty. They are dedicated public \nservants, trained to uphold the law and keep the peace. To enable law \nenforcement officers nationwide to be prepared to answer a call to duty \nno matter where, when, or in what form it comes, I am proud to join \nSenators Campbell, Hatch, and Harry Reid to offer the Law Enforcement \nOfficers Safety Act, S. 253, as it was reported out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, as an amendment to the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. People understand our amendment would permit off-\nduty and retired law enforcement officers to carry a firearm provided \nthey have demonstrated their ability, provided they follow some very \nstrict requirements, and be prepared to assist in dangerous situations.\n  This passed the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 18 to 1. It had 68 \ncosponsors, both Republicans and Democrats, and was strongly supported \nby the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the Law Enforcement \nAlliance of America.\n  I worked with LT Steve Young on this. It was one of the things he and \nI talked about before he died. He was dedicated to it. He knew the \nimportance of having law enforcement officers across the Nation armed \nand prepared, whenever and wherever a risk to our public safety arose. \nThe current national president, MAJ Chuck Canterbury, worked with me \nand others to make this legislation law.\n  We know where community policing and the outstanding work of so many \nlaw enforcement officers have helped a great deal in our crime control \nefforts. But during the last few years, the downward trend in violent \ncrime ended and violent crime rates have turned upward.\n  We also know that more than 740,000 sworn law enforcement officers \nare currently serving in the United States. Since the first recorded \npolice death in 1792, there have been more than 17,000 law enforcement \nofficers killed in the line of duty--17,000. In the last decade, over \n1,700 officers died in the line of duty--170 every year.\n  I think of a very sad funeral I went to in Vermont last summer. The \ntrooper's family was left behind--young children, his widow. Roughly 5 \npercent of officers who die are killed when taking law enforcement \naction in an off-duty capacity, and more than 62,000 law enforcement \nofficers are assaulted annually.\n  Convicted criminals often have long and exacting memories. I still \nhave people come up to me and tell me they remember that I put them in \nprison. This happens to a lot of law enforcement officials. That law \nenforcement officer, the one who arrested the person who went to \nprison, is a target in uniform and out, active, retired, off-duty or \non-duty.\n  So what we tried to do by bringing together Republicans and \nDemocrats, Liberals, moderates, conservatives, is to put together an \namendment designed to establish national measures of uniformity and \nconsistency to permit trained and certified--and I underline that \ncertified--on- and off-duty law enforcement officers to carry concealed \nfirearms in situations so they may respond to crimes immediately across \nState and other jurisdictional lines as well as to protect themselves \nand their families from vindictive criminals.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend from Idaho for yielding time. I \nthink this is an important matter. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I ask how much time our side has \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes. Senator Kennedy has 18 minutes \n59 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Does the Senator from Massachusetts wish to speak at this \ntime?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I saw the Senator from Alabama. I \nhad planned to be here as well, but I would be glad to follow the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for that consideration. If he doesn't \nmind, I would defer our allocation of 10 minutes of time to the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Craig and Senator \nKennedy for the opportunity to speak. I am pleased to hear the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, speak in favor of \nthis amendment. It does indeed have 67 cosponsors. It is designed to \nallow qualified law enforcement officers to carry a concealed weapon \nwhile they are off duty.\n  Back at my home in Alabama, when I drive into the neighborhood, I \nknow that a police officer lives at the corner. It gives me some \ncomfort and my wife comfort. We have discussed it. When we pass that \npolice car parked there, I know if something happened in that \nneighborhood and somebody needed help, he would respond. I also hope \nwhen he is traveling around off duty that he would be allowed to carry \nhis weapon. We pay him to do it when he is on active duty. We pay him \nto carry that weapon and to be ready to respond.\n  It is one of the greatest bargains Americans have for safety and \nsecurity--that law officers would voluntarily, on their own time, be \nwilling to carry a gun and oftentimes step forward at their own risk to \nhelp those in danger.\n  I think it is a very good piece of legislation.\n  If officers who have been trained for 30 years in carrying weapons \nretire, we ought to be glad they are willing to carry them as they \ntravel. We should be glad that active-duty police officers who have \nweapons are able to carry them as long as they have proper \nidentification and the proper training. It would certainly be a \ntremendous cost-free-effort project to improve safety throughout \nAmerica.\n  Qualified law enforcement officers are the only ones who can carry a \nfirearm. They are defined as an employee of a government agency who is \nauthorized by law to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, \nand investigation or prosecution of, or the incarceration of any person \nfor any violation of law. They have statutory powers. The officer must \nbe authorized to carry a firearm and meet the standards established by \nthe agency which requires the employee to regularly qualify in the use \nof a firearm. A qualified law officer is defined as an individual who \nhas retired in good standing. A qualified retired law enforcement \nofficer is one who has retired in good standing from service in a \ngovernment agency for an aggregate of 5 years or more. The officer must \nhave fit the above definition while active, must have a nonforfeitable \nright to the benefits under a retirement plan during the most recent \n12-month period, and have met at his or her own expense the State \nstandard for training and qualification to carry a firearm. Both active \nand retired law officers will be required to carry photographic \nidentification by the agency for which they were or are employed as a \nlaw officer before they can qualify under this effort.\n  Why do police officers need it? First of all, they are often at risk \nthemselves.\n  People forget that there is a war on crime and that many of the \ncriminals are seriously deadly individuals who hold grudges against \nthose who have arrested them. As a former prosecutor for well over 15 \nyears, I have many close friends who are police officers and \nprosecutors. I know everyone has in the back of their minds the \npossibility that some dangerous criminal they apprehended, arrested, or \nprosecuted could utilize force against them.\n  This, first and foremost, provides the officers with a sense of \ncomfort and\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\npersonal security. But more than that, it is a free, available asset to \nAmerica to protect citizens.\n  We have terrorists out there. If we had a terrorist attack in a \nshopping mall, or on the streets, or in some building, or an attack \ngoing on in our community, wouldn't we be pleased that a law officer \nwith a gun was there who would plug this guy if need be to save \ninnocent lives? Wouldn't that be good for America? I think so.\n  It is a frustrating thing, however, for law officers as they move \nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction. This country has a host of different \ngun laws. Gun dealers, gun possessors, and gun manufacturers are \nsubject to the most intense Federal, State, and local regulations. An \nofficer who goes about his duties and goes from one town to the next \ncould find himself going through Boston, MA, and end up in a slammer \nfor doing nothing but being prepared to defend a Boston citizen from a \nmugging or assault or a terrorist attack; or coming to Washington, DC; \nthey could end up in jail. They have some of the toughest laws here--\nmaybe even tougher than Boston. They could end up in jail for doing \nnothing but being prepared to defend people in this community who may \nbe under attack.\n\n  I think this makes good sense. I think it makes good sense for \nFederal legal action because you can't do it piecemeal. Every community \nhas a different rule and a different law. Under the interstate commerce \nclause, I think we have a constitutional right and power to enact this \nlegislation.\n  The question is: Is it good policy? Is it something we should do? I \nthink it is good policy, especially in light of all the proliferating \nrules around this country, all the requirements in every county in \nAlabama, or Massachusetts, every city regulation in Philadelphia where \nthey sue gun dealers--the mayor sues gun dealers, and they get the \nattorneys general in these States to gang up on them and sue them. They \nare doing nothing but manufacturing a firearm consistent with what the \nFederal and State laws are in America. But because somebody used it \nillegally, they want to sue them and put them out of business because \nthey do not like guns. They are not able to do it completely; they are \nnot able to pass legislation in their States or in the Federal \nGovernment to deal with this problem. So they want to use the power of \nlawsuits to do it.\n  That is why I support the underlying bill. I think it is good public \npolicy because all it does is make clear what existing law is, has \nbeen, and should continue to be--that a manufacturer of a legal product \nwho manufacturers it according to the laws and the distributors of that \nproduct who distribute it according to the complex laws all over this \ncountry should not be responsible if there is an intervening criminal \nact by a person who gets his hand on that weapon.\n  What are lawsuits for? Lawsuits historically have been when something \nfails to perform--if a weapon blows up, knocks out your eye, shoots off \nat an angle and hits something it is not supposed to, you should be \nable to sue the manufacturer. But if the gun is legal, if it is \nprepared according to the law and sold, and if some criminal gets it \nand commits a crime with it, why should the manufacturer be responsible \nfor that? It goes against all of our understanding of what appropriate \nrule of liability in America is.\n  We are losing those distinctions. We want to politicize the law. We \nhave Members who, because they cannot win a political vote, want to \nhave some lawsuit--some favorable jurisdiction, whether it is in \nPhiladelphia, or Boston, and they find a judge who is hostile to gun \nownership end up getting the case. They say there are only 30 lawsuits \nof this kind, but if you keep filing these lawsuits, pretty soon you \nmay find 12 people who agree with you, or a judge who agrees with you. \nThe next thing you know, you have a big verdict.\n  The question is: Is it justified? Should a company have to defend \nitself from this kind of a political attack? If they are irresponsible, \nyes. If they violated the law, yes. They should be sued. If the gun is \ndefective, yes. They should be sued.\n  But again, I think there is no more strongly felt issue among law \nenforcement officers in America than their willingness to carry a gun \nand the risk they undertake in doing it because they may even forget \nthey are crossing the State line into another city and end up being \nprosecuted for being prepared to defend the citizens of that \ncommunity. They do not like that. It is troubling to them. Many talk to \nme about it personally.\n\n  I am glad we have overwhelming support in this body to pass this \namendment. I thank the Senator from Idaho for it. I support it and I \nbelieve we will pass it.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Chair to notify me when 15 minutes are up.\n  I hope we are not going to hear in the Senate more about States \nrights and the importance of local communities making local judgments; \nthey are in touch with the local people; they know best what is in the \ninterests of the protection of a local community; or that a State knows \nmore than a Federal Government about how to protect its citizens.\n  Those arguments are out the window with the proposed amendment to the \nunderlying legislation. The amendment we are talking about gives \nactive-duty and retired police officers the right to carry any firearm \non duty or off duty, notwithstanding any State or local gun safety \nlaws, even if the officers' own department rules prohibit the carrying \nof such concealed firearms.\n  I know this is hoping too much, that our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle will restrain themselves from making the argument we always \nhear in the Senate from the other side, pointing over here that the \nFederal Government always knows best.\n  There is a lot of knowledge at the local and State level. Let's \nrespect that. That is thrown right out the window with this amendment. \nThis amendment is overriding gun safety laws that are decided by the \npeople in local communities, overriding State laws, overriding them \npointblank no matter what the State has said. We are talking about \nconcealable weapons that will be able to be carried by police officers \nor retired officers, as well.\n  It is opposed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, \nthe Police Executive Research Forum, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  Let me explain why. This amendment is a serious step in the wrong \ndirection. It will undermine the safety of our communities and the \nsafety of police officers by broadly overriding the State and local gun \nsafety laws. It will also nullify the ability of police departments to \nenforce rules and policies on when and how their own officers can carry \nfirearms. Because of the substantial danger the amendment poses to \npolice officers and communities, it is vigorously opposed by the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police.\n  There is no precedent for what the supporters of this amendment \nintend to accomplish. Congress has never passed a law giving current \nand former State and local employees the right to carry weapons in \nviolation of controlling State and local laws. Congress has never \npassed a law interfering with the ability of State and local police \nchiefs to regulate their own officers carrying of firearms. Do we \nunderstand what this does? Congress has never passed a law interfering \nwith the ability of the States or local police chiefs to regulate their \nown police officers carrying firearms. This amendment does. This \noverrides it.\n  Today, each State has the authority to decide what kind of concealed-\ncarry law, if any, best fits the needs of the community. Each State \nmakes its own judgment about whether private citizens should be allowed \nto carry concealed weapons or whether on-duty or off-duty or retired \npolice officers should be included or exempted in any prohibition. \nThere is no evidence that States or local governments have failed to \nconsider the interests and needs of law enforcement officers. No case \nhas been made.\n\n  Consider, for example, the New Jersey law. In 1995, retired police \nchief John Deventer was shot and killed while heroically trying to stop \na robbery. This incident prompted New Jersey to enact a law allowing \nretired officers to carry handguns under a number\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\nof different conditions. In drafting this law, the New Jersey \nLegislature made a deliberate effort to balance the safety of police \nofficers with the safety of the public at large by including a number \nof important safeguards that are not contained in this amendment.\n  For example, New Jersey law is limited to handguns. This amendment is \nnot. As long as the police officer is qualified to carry one type of \ngun, he can carry any type of gun, any type of concealable weapon. New \nJersey law is limited to handguns. This amendment is not. New Jersey \nlaw has a maximum age of 70. This amendment does not. Under New Jersey \nlaw, retired police officers must file renewal applications yearly. \nThere is no application process here. Under New Jersey, retirees must \nlist all their guns. No such record is required under this amendment. \nNew Jersey gives police departments discretion to deny permits to \nretirees. No such discretion is provided under this amendment.\n  By enacting this amendment, Congress will be gutting all of the \nsafeguards contained in the New Jersey statute as well as the judgment \nof other States that have considered this issue.\n  The sponsors of this amendment have presented no evidence that States \nand local governments are unable or unwilling to decide these important \nissues for themselves. They have offered no explanation why Congress is \nbetter suited than States, cities, and towns to decide how best to \nprotect police officers, schoolchildren, churchgoers, and other members \nof their communities.\n  Congress should bolster, not undermine, the efforts of States and \nlocal communities to protect their citizens from gun violence. In many \nStates, cities, and towns, special places--churches, schools, bars, \ngovernment offices, hospitals--are singled out as deserving special \nprotection from the threat of gun violence.\n  Michigan is a State that prohibits concealed firearms in schools, \nsports arenas, bars, churches, and hospitals. Georgia law allows active \nand retired police officers to carry firearms in publicly owned \nbuildings but not in churches, sports arenas, or places where alcohol \nis sold. Kentucky prohibits carrying concealed weapons in bars and \nschools. South Carolina prohibits concealed firearms in churches and \nhospitals.\n  This amendment will override most such safe harbor laws at the State \nlevel. It will override laws that categorically prohibit guns in \nchurches and in other houses of worship since only laws that permit \nprivate entities to post signs prohibiting concealed firearms on their \nproperty will remain in force. In most States, churches are not \ncurrently required to post signs in order to have a gun-free zone.\n  This amendment will also override laws that prohibit concealed \nweapons in places where alcohol is served. This amendment will override \nState laws and local laws that prohibit carrying concealed weapons in \nplaces where alcohol is served.\n  Surely it is responsible for a State to prohibit people from bringing \nguns into bars, to prevent the extreme danger that results when liquor \nand firearms are together. It is no wonder that in the House of \nRepresentatives, Chairman Sensenbrenner has described this legislation \nas an affront to State sovereignty on the Constitution.\n  At the local level, this amendment overrides all gun safety laws \nwithout exception. In the 1990s, Boston, New York, and other cities \nmade great strides in fighting against crime precisely because they \nwere able to pass laws that address the factors that led to violence, \nincluding the prevalence of firearms in inner cities. As Congressman \nHenry Hyde has said, the best decisions on fighting crime are made at \nthe local level.\n  We saw extraordinary progress in my own State of Massachusetts. We \nwent for 18 months without a homicide. We have strict gun laws in \nMassachusetts. We have very strict gun laws in the city of Boston. This \nlegislation will override it. Not all of the progress was made just \nbecause of the laws, but it was a combination of a variety of different \nevents a few years ago. Tragically, we have seen an increase in \nhomicide with the deterioration of the economy in the recent months and \nyears.\n  By overriding all local gun safety laws, this amendment will \nundermine the ability of cities to fight crime. It will \nindiscriminately abrogate safe harbor laws in Boston, New York City, \nCincinnati, Columbus, Chicago, Kansas City, and many other towns.\n\n  Congress has no business overriding the judgment of States and local \ngovernments in deciding where concealed weapons should be prohibited. \nSupporters have argued this amendment is needed because of the complex \npatchwork of Federal, State, and local concealed-carry laws which \nprevents officers from protecting themselves and their families from \nvindictive criminals. They have distributed lists of officers or prison \nguards who were killed while off duty or in retirement. The stories of \nthese slain men and women are tragic, and their killers deserve to be \nseverely punished. But none--none--of these incidents involved officers \nwho were killed outside their home State. They do not demonstrate a \nneed for a Federal override of State and local gun safety laws.\n  To the contrary, as New Jersey's response to the tragic shooting of \nChief Deventer shows, States and local governments are best equipped to \nimplement policies, regulations, and laws that protect the safety of \ntheir own law enforcement officers, and also protect the public at \nlarge.\n  The supporters have also argued by authorizing officers to carry guns \nacross State lines, in violation of whatever State and local gun safety \nlaws would otherwise apply, they will be able to effectively respond to \ncrimes and terrorist attacks. They apparently envisage a nationwide \nunregulated police force, consisting of retired officers and off-duty \nofficers who are armed while on vacation or traveling outside their \nhome jurisdictions.\n  Allowing off-duty or retired officers with concealed weapons to go \ninto other jurisdictions will only make conditions more dangerous for \npolice officers and civilians. As the executive director of the IACP \nhas explained:\n\n       One of the reasons that this legislation is especially \n     troubling to our nation's law enforcement executives is that \n     it could in fact threaten the safety of police officers by \n     creating tragic situations where officers from other \n     jurisdictions are wounded or killed by the local officers. \n     Police departments throughout the nation train their officers \n     to respond as a team to dangerous situations. This teamwork \n     requires months of training to develop and provides the \n     officers with an understanding of how their coworkers will \n     respond when faced with different situations. Injecting an \n     armed, unknown officer, who has received different training \n     and is operating under different assumptions, can turn an \n     already dangerous situation deadly.\n\n  This amendment neither promotes consistent training policies among \ndifferent police jurisdictions nor limits the conditions under which \nofficers may use their firearms. The idea that more crimes will be \nprevented when more concealed weapons are carried by untrained and \nunregulated out-of-State off-duty and retired officers is pure fiction.\n  It is important to note that in giving off-duty and retired police \nofficers broad authority to nullify State and local gun safety laws, \nthe amendment is not limited to the carrying of officers' authorized \nweapons. In most police departments, officers may seek authorization to \ncarry a range of weapons. If an officer wants to carry a weapon other \nthan his service weapon--typically, a 9 millimeter semiautomatic \npistol--he must prove he is qualified before the department will \nauthorize him to carry it. To become qualified, the officer must \ndemonstrate he can handle that weapon safely.\n  Rather than limiting its provisions to authorized weapons, this \namendment provides as long as an officer at some point received \nauthorization to carry a particular kind of firearm, such as his \nservice weapon, he can carry, concealed, any other kind of firearm \nwhile off duty or retired, even if he never received authorization from \nhis own police department to carry that other weapon.\n  In the 107th Congress, I introduced an amendment in committee \nproviding an off-duty or retired officer could carry a concealed \nfirearm only if he had been authorized to carry that firearm by the \nagency he works for, or if he had been so authorized at the time of his \nretirement. That amendment was rejected by an evenly divided vote, 9 to \n9. Thus, the legislation now before us will give off-\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\nduty and retired officers carte blanche to carry concealed shotguns, \nsniper rifles, or other weapons their own police departments have not \nauthorized them to carry. Its failure to limit this privilege to \nauthorized police weapons--or even to handguns, as New Jersey law \nprovides--will further undermine the safety of American communities.\n  Serious safety problems are also raised by the amendment's override \nof gun-safety laws for retired officers, a category that is defined to \ninclude anyone who has served in a law enforcement capacity for 15 \nyears ``in the aggregate'' before retiring or resigning and taking a \ndifferent job. There is no requirement that a retiree demonstrate a \nspecial need for a firearm. While the amendment provides that an \nofficer must have technically left law enforcement in ``good \nstanding,'' it is well known that sub-par government employees are \nroutinely released from their positions without a formal finding of \nmisconduct. The amendment does not draw a distinction between officers \nwho served ably and those who did not. Officers who retire in ``good \nstanding'' while under investigation for domestic violence, racial \nprofiling, excessive force, or substance abuse could still qualify for \nbroad concealed-carry authority for the remainder of their lives. As \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police has observed:\n\n       This legislation fails to take into account those officers \n     who have retired under threat of disciplinary action or \n     dismissal for emotional problems that did not rise to the \n     level of ``mental instability.'' Officers who retire or quit \n     just prior to a disciplinary or competency hearing may still \n     be eligible for benefits and appear to have left the agency \n     in good standing. Even a police officer who retires with \n     exceptional skills today may be stricken with an illness or \n     other problem that makes him or her unfit to carry a \n     concealed weapon, but they will not be overseen by a police \n     management structure that identifies such problems in current \n     officers.\n\n  Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the amendment is its potential \nto undermine the effective and safe functioning of police departments \nthroughout the country. It removes the ability of police departments to \nenforce rules and policies on when and how their own officers can carry \nfirearms. Police chiefs will lose the authority to prohibit their own \nofficers from carrying certain weapons on duty or off duty.\n  Section 2 of the amendment provides that regardless of ``any other \nprovision of the law of any State or any political subdivision \nthereof,'' any individual who qualifies as a law enforcement officer \nand who carries a photo ID will be authorized to carry any firearm. In \na variety of contexts, including the Federal preemption of State law, \ncourts have interpreted the term ``law'' to include agency rules and \nregulations. The Supreme Court has ruled this term specifically \nincludes contractual obligations between employers and employees, such \nas work rules, policies, and practices promulgated by State and local \npolice departments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I discussed, there is no requirement in the amendment \nthat active-duty officers be authorized to carry each firearm that they \nwish to carry concealed. In other words, once an officer qualifies to \ncarry a service weapon, he will have the right under this amendment to \ncarry any gun, on duty or off duty--even if doing so violates his own \npolice department's rules.\n  Thus, if Congress enacts this legislation, police chiefs will be \nstripped of their authority to tell their own officers, for example, \nthat they cannot bring guns into bars while off duty; that they cannot \ncarry their service weapons on vacation; or that they cannot carry \ncertain shotguns, rifles, or handguns on the job.\n  As the International Association of Chiefs of Police stated in a \nletter to the Judiciary Committee, ``under the provisions of [this \nlegislation], police chiefs and local governments would lose the \nauthority to regulate what type of firearms the officers they employ \ncan carry even while they are on duty.''\n\n       As a result, the legislation would effectively eliminate \n     the ability of a police department to establish rules \n     restricting the ability of officers to carry only department-\n     authorized firearms while on duty. The prospect of officers \n     carrying unauthorized firearms while on duty is very \n     troubling to the IACP for several reasons.\n       First, an unauthorized weapon is unlikely to meet \n     departmental standards. This in turn means that the officer \n     will not have received approved departmental training in its \n     use, and will not have qualified with the weapon under \n     departmental regulations. Carrying an unauthorized weapon \n     thus presents a risk of injury to the officer, fellow \n     officers, and citizens, for the weapon itself may be unsafe \n     or otherwise unsuitable for police use, and the officer may \n     not be sufficiently proficient with its use to avoid adverse \n     consequences.\n       In addition to the risk of injury involved, the carrying of \n     unauthorized weapons is a major source of police civil \n     liability in the U.S. today. An officer who fires an \n     unauthorized weapon in the line of duty risks civil liability \n     for the officer and for the department, even though the \n     shooting may have been otherwise legally justified. A number \n     of civil-suit plaintiffs have contended that the mere fact \n     that the weapon that caused the plaintiff's injury was \n     unauthorized is, in itself, sufficient legal grounds for a \n     finding of liability.\n\nFor these and other reasons, the IACP concluded that this amendment \n``has the potential to significantly and negatively impact the safety \nof our communities and our officers.''\n  Law enforcement executives face extremely difficult challenges today. \nAs crime rates have started to rise again and new concerns about \ndomestic security have emerged, police chiefs are forced to do more \nwith less. The weak economy has forced cities and states to cut back on \nfunding for law enforcement. The administration has tried its best to \neliminate federal funding for such critical programs as the COPS \nUniversal-Hiring Program, the Byrne Grant program, and the Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grant program.\n  The last thing Congress should do now is enact legislation that \nexpands the civil liability of police departments and nullifies the \nability of police chiefs to regulate their own officers' use of \nfirearms and to maintain discipline. By denying police chiefs the right \nto run their own departments, the amendment would deal a severe blow to \ncommon sense and public safety.\n  Each State and local government should be allowed to make its own \njudgment as to whether citizens and out-of-State visitors may carry \nconcealed weapons, and whether active or retired law enforcement \nofficers should be included in or exempted from any prohibition.\n  This amendment will unnecessarily damage the efforts of States and \nlocal governments to protect their citizens from gun violence. It will \nalso expose States and local governments to unnecessary liability and \nnullify the ability of police chiefs to maintain discipline and control \nwithin their own departments.\n  The Nation will be better served if the Senate puts this misguided \nlegislation aside and turns its attention to measures we know will \nreduce crime and enhance the safety of police officers and all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and a half.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the bottom line on this--we are going to \nhave a chance to vote on this next Tuesday--is this is an action by \nCongress to override State-considered legislation and local legislation \non how to protect their local communities. Some States have made the \njudgment that they do not believe they ought to permit concealed \nweapons in bars and churches and other public places, such as in \nschools, because they do not want to have the proliferation of guns in \nschools, they do not want to have the proliferation of guns in bars, \nthey do not believe concealed weapons ought to be in churches. The \nStates and local communities have made that judgment in order to \nprotect their local communities. But somehow we are deciding here in \nthe Senate, on the basis of about an hour and 20 minutes of debate on \nthis, that we are going to override the common good sense of States and \nlocal governments and say: We know best. If you are a police officer or \nretired officer, you can carry that concealed weapon, even though you \nare not trained to be able to use it or authorized to use it, into the \nbars, schools, and churches of this country. That makes no sense and is \na contradiction of what the States and local communities do.\n  How much further do we have to go to kowtow to the National Rifle \nAssociation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S1632]]\n\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand I have 1 minute.\n  The legislation exempts qualified active and retired law enforcement \nofficers from State and local prohibitions on the carrying of concealed \nfirearms. What this means is that active and retired police officers \nwill be able to carry their firearms virtually anywhere in the U.S. \nwithout having to worry about violating any local or State gun laws.\n  The bill is noncontroversial and enjoys wide, bipartisan support in \nboth the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate bill, S. \n253, passed the Judiciary Committee in March 2003 on an 18 to 1 vote. \nThe bill has 67 cosponsors, including Majority Leader Bill Frist, \nMinority Leader Tom Daschle, and every other member of the Senate \nleadership from both sides of the aisle. Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell, a former law enforcement officer, is offering the amendment \nalong with Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch, Ranking Member \nPatrick J. Leahy, and Minority Whip Harry Reid.\n  The House bill, H.R. 218, has 286 cosponsors. In addition to a House \nmajority, the bill has a majority of both the full Judiciary Committee \nand the subcommittee of jurisdiction. In 1999, the House passed a \nnearly identical measure as an amendment to another bill by an \noverwhelming 372 to 53 majority.\n  This isn't a ``firearms issue''--it is an officer safety issue. And, \non 11 September 2001, it became a critical public safety and homeland \nsecurity issue.\n  Law enforcement officers need this bill--it is the number one issue \namong rank-and-file officers today. Policy officers are frequently \nfinding that they, and their families, are the targets of vindictive \ncriminals. A police officer may not remember all the faces of all the \ncriminals he or she has put behind bars, but every one of those \ncriminals will. This legislation gives all police officers the means to \nlegally protect themselves and their loved ones--even if off-duty or \nretired.\n  Public safety and homeland security would benefit immensely from this \nbill becoming law. Law enforcement officers are a dedicated and trained \nbody of men and women sworn to uphold the law and keep the peace. \nUnlike other professions, a police officer is rarely ``off-duty.'' When \nthere is a threat to the peace or public safety, the police officer is \nsworn to answer the call of duty. Officers who are traveling from one \njurisdiction to another do not leave their instincts or training \nbehind, but without their weapon, that knowledge and training is \nrendered virtually useless. These bills will provide the means for law \nenforcement officers to enforce the law and keep the peace--enabling \nthem to put to use that training and answer the call to duty when the \nneed arises. Without a weapon, the law enforcement officer is like a \nrescue diver without diving gear; all the right training and talent to \nlend to an emergency situation, but without the equipment needed to \nmake that training of any use. Given the ongoing threat of terrorist \nactivity against U.S. citizens, it just makes sense to give our first \nline of defense the tools they need in a first responder situation. \nPerhaps the strongest endorsement we can make is that thousands of \nviolent criminals and terrorists will hate to see it pass.\n\n  This is not a States' rights issue and the bill has been carefully \ncrafted to ensure that it conforms to the U.S. Constitution and the \nprecepts of Federalism. Congress has the authority, under the ``full \nfaith and credit'' clause of the Constitution, to extend full faith and \ncredit to qualified active and retired law enforcement officers who \nhave met the criteria to carry firearms set by one State, and make \nthose credentials applicable and recognized in all States and \nterritories in these United States. States and localities issue \nfirearms to their police officers and set their own requirements for \ntheir officers in training and qualifying in the use of these weapons. \nThis legislation maintains the States' power to set these requirements \nand determine whether or not an active or retired officer is qualified \nin the use of the firearm, and would allow only this narrow universe of \npersons to carry their firearms when traveling outside their \njurisdiction. We believe this is similar to the States' issuance of \ndrivers' licenses--the standards may differ slightly from State to \nState, but all States recognize that the drivers have been certified to \noperate a motor vehicle on public roadways.\n  All 50 States require their officers to receive many hours--the \naverage is 48--of firearms training before they leave the academy. \nBefore receiving their appointment, law enforcement officers must meet \ncertain score requirements in order to qualify with their weapon, the \naverage being about 76 percent. No officer with a score below the 70th \npercentile is considered qualified with his weapon.\n  Most States require their officers to requalify with their weapons on \na regular basis. Individual agencies may require their officers to \nqualify more frequently, but they must meet the State's minimum, which \nranges from annually to every 5 years.\n  How Do Retired Officers Qualify: In order to carry under this \nlegislation, a retired law enforcement officer would have to qualify \nwith his firearm at his own expense every 12 months and meet the \nqualifications as an active duty officer in his State of residence. For \nexample, a New Jersey police officer that retires to North Carolina \nmust qualify annually at his own expense and meet the same standards \nthat an active duty officer in North Carolina must meet.\n  Many Federal law enforcement officers currently have the authority to \ncarry their firearms. Training and qualification for Federal law \nenforcement officers is not so dissimilar to that of State and local \nlaw enforcement officers. There have been no issues of concern with \nFederal officers carrying in all jurisdiction, why would there be for \nState and local law enforcement officers?\n\n  There is Congressional precedent on this issue. Congress has \npreviously acted to force States to recognize permits to carry issued \nby other States on the basis of employment in other instances. In June \n1993, the Senate and House approved and passed a law, PL 103-55, \nmandating reciprocity for weapons licenses issued to armored car \ncompany crew members among States. Congress amended the act in 1998, PL \n105-78, providing that the licenses must be renewed every 2 years. This \nprecedent allows armored car guards--who do not have nearly the same \nlevel of training and qualifications as law enforcement officers--to \nreceive a license to carry a firearm in one State and forces other \nStates to recognize its validity.\n  Airline pilots can obtain the authority law enforcement officers are \nseeking. In addition to armored car guards, Congress passed a law \nexempts airline pilots who participate in the ``Federal flight deck \nofficer'' from Federal and State law with respect to the carrying of \nconcealed firearms. Note that this authority is not limited just to the \ncockpit--but also while the pilots are on the ground and off-duty.\n  Congress has the authority to preempt State and local prohibitions on \nthe carrying of concealed weapons and has in the past granted a certain \nclass of persons--based on the nature of their employment and their \nvalue in an emergency situation--the authority to carry firearms in all \njurisdictions. To do the same for law enforcement just makes good \nsense.\n  On the last weekend in June, FOP members from Maryland Lodge No. 70 \nwere packing up their campsite following a 3-day camping trip with \ntheir families in Harpers Ferry. That Sunday afternoon, after many of \nthe officers and their families had left, a gunman opened fire on \nanother camper, wounding him in the lower leg. Detective Timothy Utzig \nand Officer Andrew Albach reacted quickly, instructing their families \nto leave the scene, while they retrieved their firearms and confronted \nthe man. The gunman, yelling incoherently, eventually obeyed the \nofficers' orders to lie down on the ground. After searching him, they \ndiscovered that the man had several more live rounds for his shotgun in \nhis possession. Detective Utzig and Officer Albach held the man until \nWest Virginia authorities could arrive. It was discovered later that \nthe gunman had an extensive criminal history--including a murder \nconviction.\n\n  Sergeant Sam Harmon of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department \nsaid, ``There's no telling how many lives those men saved Sunday \nafternoon. These guys are my heroes for life.''\n  They were certainly heroes, but they were also in violation of West \nVirginia\n\n[[Page S1633]]\n\nState law because they possessed firearms. These brave officers--who \nstopped a gunman's rampage on their day off, outside of their own \njurisdiction--were not charged, but their action placed themselves in \nlegal jeopardy, as well as physical. Had they complied with State law \nthat Sunday, they or their families could have been victims. This is \njust one example of how public safety could be served if this bill were \nmade law.\n  In 1991, off-duty Minneapolis Police Officer Jerry Johnson was \nvacationing in Phoenix, Arizona. He witnessed a man knock an elderly \nfemale to the ground, take her purse, and run. He immediately gave \nchase, without stopping to think that he was unarmed because he could \nnot legally carry a firearm in Arizona. He caught the thief after a \nmile-long foot chase, and fought to subdue him. Had the criminal been \narmed, Officer Johnson would surely have been killed. Now retired, \nOfficer Johnson had to go through a great deal of trouble in his own \nState of Minnesota to get a concealed carry weapon permit as it is up \nto each individual chief whether or not to issue. When he moved into a \ndifferent jurisdiction, he had to get a judge to intercede because the \nchief of police in his new locality initially refused to issue him a \npermit.\n\n  Off-duty and retired officers are often targeted for attack by \nvengeful criminals. Off-duty police officer Tim Brauer was having \ndinner with his family in an Oklahoma City restaurant, outside his \njurisdiction. While in the restroom, he was attacked by a man he had \npreviously arrested. At the time, Oklahoma State law permitted off duty \nlaw enforcement officers to carry their firearms only within their home \njurisdiction. In obeying the law and leaving his firearm at home while \nout with his family, he was left vulnerable to his attacker. Officer \nBrauer suffered severe injuries, but he lived and his family was not \nharmed. Oklahoma law now permits officers to carry throughout the \nState.\n  Officer Shynelle Marie Mason, a 2-year veteran with the Detroit, \nMichigan Police Department, was shot and killed on July 14, 2000, by a \nman she had previously arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. She \nencountered the man while off-duty; he confronted her and shot her \nseveral times in the chest. Though she was not on the clock, her death \nwas considered a ``line of duty'' death and her name appears on the \nWall of Remembrance at Judiciary Square in Washington, DC.\n  Retired New York State Supreme Court Police Officer William Kirchoff, \na 17-year law enforcement veteran who was forced into retirement in \n1989 as a direct result of an injury received when he was assaulted on \nthe job, was the target of a contract assault/attempted murder. Tony \nMattino, a career criminal with a long rap sheet for illegal possession \nof firearms and drugs was arrested and charged with assaulting Officer \nKirchoff's 15-year-old daughter. Mattino was convicted for the assault \nand, prior to sentencing, threatened Officer Kirchoff. On February 21, \n1998, he made good on his pledge. A pizza delivery man arrived at the \nofficer's home. Officer Kirchoff had not placed any delivery order, and \nwould not allow the man inside his home. He did offer the delivery man \nthe use of his cordless phone--at which point he was attacked. the man, \nwielding a metal baseball bat, forced his way into the house, striking \nOfficer Kirchoff more than 10 times. His 10 year-old-son was in the \nhome at the time of the attack. The officer was unarmed and had no \nfirearms on his person or property. Ultimately, Officer Kirchoff was \nable to drive off his attacker, who remains at large to this day. \nMattino is also currently free on probation. Since the attack, Officer \nKirchoff has a license to carry in New York and six other States.\n\n  Detective Donald Miller, a 10-year veteran with the New Bern Police \nDepartment in North Carolina was off-duty on December 23, 2001. He and \nhis wife had just completed a visit to their newborn child in the \nhospital when the detective observed a man driving recklessly through \nthe hospital parking lot. He confronted the man, who drew a handgun and \nfired--striking Miller in the head. Detective Miller, father of two, \ndied 2 days later on Christmas Day. Though he was not on the clock, his \ndeath was considered a ``line of duty'' death and his name appears of \nthe Wall of Remembrance at Judiciary Square in Washington, DC.\n\n  Officer Dominick J. Infantes, Jr., a 7-year veteran with the New \nJersey City Police Department, was attacked by two men wielding a pipe \non July 4, 2001. He died 2 days later from severe head injuries. \nInfantes was off-duty when he asked two men to stop setting off \nfireworks near playing children. He identified himself as a police \nofficer, but the two killers did not believe him because Infantes did \nnot have a gun. Though he was not on the clock, his death was \nconsidered a ``line of duty'' death and his name appears of the Wall of \nRemembrance at Judiciary Square in Washington, DC.\n  In 2000, off-duty Las Vegas Police Officer Dennis Devitte, a 20-year \nveteran was relaxing at a local sports bar when the establishment was \nattacked by three armed assailants. Two of the men opened fire on the \ncrowd, hitting a man in a wheelchair. Officer Devitte did not \nhesitate--he pulled his tiny .25-caliber gun and, knowing he would have \nto get very close to make sure he hit his target, charged a man firing \na .40-caliber semiautomatic. Officer Devitte got within one foot of the \nman, fired and killed the gunman--but not before he was shot eight \ntimes. The remaining two gunmen fled. All six civilians wounded in the \nassault recovered. One witness described Officer Devitte's action as \n``the most courageous thing I've ever seen.'' Officer Devitte lost six \nunits of blood, his gun hand was badly damaged and his knee had to be \nentirely reconstructed with bones taken from a cadaver. And yet, he was \nback on the job 6 months later. For his incredibly heroic actions, \nOfficer Devitte was selected as the ``Police Officer of the Year'' by \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police, IACP, and Parade \nmagazine.\n\n  On the 4th of July, 1999, off-duty Police Officer Alfredo Rodriguez \nof the Nassau County, NY Police Department was driving to Norwich, CT \nwith his wife and four children when he observed a Norwich Police \nOfficer attempt to arrest a highly intoxicated man running in and out \nof traffic. A second man attacked the Norwich officer from behind and \nattempted to take his firearm. Officer Rodriguez, although unarmed, \npulled over, left his family and rushed to the aid of the officer. He \nwas able to free the Norwich officer from a chokehold and disarm the \nattacker, who had successfully gotten the Norwich officer's firearm. \nThe two officers restrained the initial suspect and battled the second \nuntil additional uniformed Norwich officers arrived. Officer Rodriguez \nwas awarded Nassau County's Medal of Distinguished Service for his \nactions, which undoubtedly saved the life of Norwich Police Officer \nPeter Camp.\n  In July 1995, recently Retired Police Chief John Diventer of the \nHanover, NJ, Police Department was with his family visiting his \nfamily's grave plot in Newark, when he observed several robbers attack \ntwo elderly women and steal their purses. He attempted to intervene, \nand was shot and killed, At the time of the chief's murder, retired \npolice officers were not authorized to carry firearms in New Jersey. \nThis incident prompted a change in New Jersey law, which now permits \nretired officers to carry throughout the State.\n  In closing, let me say about the amendment that is before us, \nconcealed-carry, 67 Members of this Senate, Democrats and Republicans, \nbelieve this is a necessary and appropriate amendment to S. 1805. We \nbelieve it is. We think it is important that it be adopted, and that we \nextend these law-abiding, well-trained and schooled law enforcement \nofficers and retirees this opportunity and privilege.\n  With that, Mr. President, my time has expired. I understand we will \nnow lay this amendment aside, to be voted on Tuesday next, and by the \norder of the unanimous consent agreement we arrived at last night, \nSenator Kennedy is now to have the floor to offer one of his amendments \nto be debated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to join Senators Campbell, Hatch and \nLeahy to offer the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act amendment.\n  The purpose of the amendment is simple. It would exempt present and \nretired law enforcement officers from State and local laws that \nprohibit carrying concealed firearms, as long as\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\nthe officers were bearing valid ID issued from their employing agency.\n  The Fraternal Order of Police, representing more than 1,000 Nevada \nlaw enforcement officers and more than 300,000 members nationwide, \nsupports this amendment.\n  They support this bill because it would improve public safety. It \nwould allow law enforcement officers to protect the public, as well as \nthemselves.\n  This amendment mirrors a bill sponsored by more than two-thirds of \nAmerica's Senators.\n  Again, our overwhelming support underscores the fact that this \nmeasure will protect our communities, as well as the brave police \nofficers who serve us so well.\n  As I learned many years ago when I was on the Capitol police force, \nlaw enforcement officers are never truly ``off-duty.'' They are \ndedicated public servants trained to uphold the law and keep the peace.\n  When there is a threat to the peace or to our public safety, law \nenforcement officers are sworn to answer that call--and answer it they \ndo, whether they are on duty or not.\n  Law enforcement officers are always protecting the innocent just as \nthey are always under threat from the guilty.\n  Although a police officer might not remember the name and face of \nevery criminal he or she has put behind bars, criminals have long \nmemories. A law enforcement officer is a target whether in or out of \nuniform, whether active or retired, and whether on duty or off.\n  In fact, roughly 5 percent of officers who are killed in action are \nactually ``off duty'' at the time of their death.\n  This amendment is designed to protect officers and their families \nfrom vindictive criminals, and to allow thousands of equipped, trained \nand certified law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms that \nwill help them protect innocent citizens.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this measure, which will make our \ncommunities safer and protect our brave police officers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2619\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have a half an hour; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to send the amendment to \nthe desk?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe the amendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2619.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To expand the definition of armor piercing ammunition and to \n require the Attorney General to promulgate standards for the uniform \n               testing of projectiles against body armor)\n\n       On page 11, after line 19, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. ARMOR PIERCING AMMUNITION.\n\n       (a) Expansion of Definition of Armor Piercing Ammunition.--\n     Section 921(a)(17)(B) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in clause (ii), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting a semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(iii) a projectile that may be used in a handgun and that \n     the Attorney General determines, pursuant to section 926(d), \n     to be capable of penetrating body armor; or\n       ``(iv) a projectile for a centerfire rifle, designed or \n     marketed as having armor piercing capability, that the \n     Attorney General determines, pursuant to section 926(d), to \n     be more likely to penetrate body armor than standard \n     ammunition of the same caliber.''.\n       (b) Determination of the Capability of Projectiles To \n     Penetrate Body Armor.--Section 926 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d)(1) Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \n     of this subsection, the Attorney General shall promulgate \n     standards for the uniform testing of projectiles against Body \n     Armor Exemplar.\n       ``(2) The standards promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) \n     shall take into account, among other factors, variations in \n     performance that are related to the length of the barrel of \n     the handgun or centerfire rifle from which the projectile is \n     fired and the amount and kind of powder used to propel the \n     projectile.\n       ``(3) As used in paragraph (1), the term `Body Armor \n     Exemplar' means body armor that the Attorney General \n     determines meets minimum standards for the protection of law \n     enforcement officers.''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I mentioned that there had been a \nhomicide in Massachusetts recently, over 18 months. It was juvenile \nhomicide. I ask that the Record be so corrected.\n  As we all know too well, the debate about gun violence has often been \naggressive and polarizing with anti-gun violence advocates on one side \nof the debate, pro-gun advocates on the other. There are deep divisions \nin the country on the issue of gun safety, and the current debate on \nthe gun immunity bill has thus far only served to highlight those \ndivisions.\n  I believe, however, that there are still some principles on which we \ncan all agree. One principle is that we should do everything we can to \nprotect the lives and safety of police officers who are working to \nprotect our streets, schools, and communities.\n  The amendment I am offering today is intended to close the existing \nloopholes in the Federal law that bans cop-killer bullets. Police \nofficers depend on body armor for their lives. Body armor has saved \nthousands of police officers from death or serious injury by firearm \nassault. Most police officers who serve large jurisdictions wear armor \nat all times when on duty. Nevertheless, even with body armor, too many \npolice officers remain vulnerable to gun violence.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, every year between \n50 and 80 police officers are feloniously killed in the line of duty. \nIn 2002, firearms were used in 51 of the 56 murders of police officers. \nIn those shootings, 34 of the officers were wearing body armor at the \ntime of their deaths. From 1992 to 2002, at least 20 police officers \nwere killed after bullets penetrated their armor vests and entered \ntheir upper torso.\n  Some gun organizations have argued that cop-killer bullets are a \nmyth. The families of these slain police officers know better. In fact, \nwe know that armor-piercing ammunition is not a myth because it is \nopenly and notoriously marketed and sold by gun dealers.\n  I direct my colleagues' attention to the Web site of Hi-Vel, \nIncorporated, a self-described exotic products distributor and \nmanufacturer in Delta, UT. You can access its online catalog on the \nInternet right now. Hi-Vel's catalog lists an entry for armor-piercing \nammunition. On that page you will find a listing for armor-piercing \nbullets that can penetrate metal objects. The bullets are available in \npackages of 10 for $9.95 each. Hi-Vel carries armor-piercing bullets \nfor both the .223 caliber rifles such as the Bushmaster sniper rifle \nused in the Washington area attacks in October 2002, and the 7.62 \ncaliber assault weapons. Over the past 10 years, these two caliber \nweapons were responsible for the deaths of 14 of the 20 law enforcement \nofficers killed by ammunition that penetrated body armor.\n  In a recent report, the ATF identified three, .223 and the 7.62 \ncaliber rifles, as the ones most frequently encountered by police \nofficers. These high-capacity rifles, the ATF wrote, pose an enhanced \nthreat to law enforcement, in part because of their ability to expel \nparticles at velocities that are capable of penetrating the type of \nsoft body armor typically worn by law enforcement officers.\n  Another rifle caliber, the 30.30 caliber, was responsible for \npenetrating three officers' armor and killing them in 1993, 1996, and \n2002. This ammunition is also capable of puncturing light-armored \nvehicles, ballistic or armored glass, armored limousines, even a 600-\npound safe with 600 pounds of safe armor plating.\n\n  It is outrageous and unconscionable that such ammunition continues to \nbe sold in the United States of America. Armor-piercing ammunition for \nrifles and assault weapons is virtually unregulated in the United \nStates. A Federal license is not required to sell such ammunition \nunless firearms are sold as well. Anyone over the age of 18 may \npurchase this ammunition without a background check. There is no \nFederal minimum age of possession. Purchases may be made over the \ncounter, by mail order, by fax, by Internet, and there is\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\nno Federal requirement that dealers retain sales records.\n  In 1999, investigators for the General Accounting Office went \nundercover to assess the availability of .50 caliber armor-piercing \nammunition. Purchasing cop-killer bullets, it turned out, is only \nslightly more difficult than buying a lottery ticket or a gallon of \nmilk. Dealers in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia informed the \ninvestigators that the purchase of these kinds of ammunition is subject \nto no Federal, State, or local restrictions. Dealers in Alaska, \nNebraska, and Oregon who advertised over the Internet told an \nundercover agent that he could buy the ammunition in a matter of \nminutes, even after he said he wanted the bullets shipped to \nWashington, DC, and needed them to pierce an armored limousine or \ntheoretically take down a helicopter. Talk about homeland security.\n  In a single year, over 100,000 rounds of military surplus armor-\npiercing ammunition were sold to civilians in the United States. In \naddition, the gun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson, recently introduced a \npowerful new revolver, the .500 magnum, 4\\1/2\\ pounds, 15 inches long, \nthat clearly has the capability of piercing body armor using ammunition \nallowed under the current law.\n  The publication, Gun Week, reviewed the new weapon with enthusiasm: \n``Behold the magic, feel the power,'' it wrote.\n\n       Many of our leaders will buy the Smith & Wesson .500 Magnum \n     for the same reason that Edmund Hillary climbed Mt. Everest: \n     Because it is there.\n\n  Current Federal law bans certain armor-piercing ammunition for \nhandguns. It establishes a content-based standard. It covers ammunition \nthat is, first of all, constructed from tungsten alloys, steel, iron, \nbrass, bronze, beryllium, copper, or depleted uranium or, secondly, \nlarger than .22 caliber with a jacket that weighs no more than 25 \npercent of the total weight of the bullet.\n  However, there are no restrictions on ammunition that may be \nmanufactured from other materials but can still penetrate body armor. \nEven more important, there are no restrictions on armor-piercing \nammunition used in rifles and assault weapons. Armor-piercing \nammunition has no purpose other than penetrating bulletproof vests. It \nis of no use for hunting or self-defense. Such armor-piercing \nammunition has no place in our society--none.\n  Armor-piercing bullets that sidestep the Federal ban, such as that \nadvertised on Hi-Vel's Web site, put the lives of American citizens and \nthose sworn to defend American citizens in jeopardy every single day. \nWe know the terrorists are now exploiting the weaknesses and loopholes \nin our gun laws. The terrorists training manual discovered by American \nsoldiers in Afghanistan in 2001 advised al-Qaida operatives to buy \nassault weapons in the United States and use them against us.\n  Terrorists are bent on exploiting weaknesses in our gun laws. Just \nthink of what a terrorist could do with a sniper rifle and only a \nmoderate supply of armor-piercing ammunition.\n  My amendment amends the Federal ban on cop-killer bullets to include \na performance standard and extends the ban on centerfire rifles, which \ninclude the sniper rifles and assault weapons responsible for the \ndeaths of 17 police officers whose body armor was penetrated by this \nammunition.\n  My amendment will not apply to ammunition that is now routinely used \nin hunting rifles or other centerfire rifles. To the contrary, it only \ncovers ammunition that is designed or marketed as having armor-piercing \ncapability. That is it--designed or marketed as having armor-piercing \ncapability, such as armor-piercing ammunition that is now advertised on \nthe Hi-Vel Web site.\n  Bullets that are designed or marketed to be armor piercing have no \nplace in our society. Ducks, deer, and other wildlife do not wear body \narmor. Police officers do. We should not let another day pass without \nplugging the loopholes in the Federal law that bans cop-killer bullets.\n  This is an issue on which mainstream gun owners and gun safety \nadvocates can agree. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time? The Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have heard over the last few minutes \nwhat might appear, at first listening, to be alarming facts, figures, \nand statistics, but we all know that in any good debate the devil is in \nthe details, and in the details of the Kennedy amendment are some \nhidden secrets that must be brought out so we can understand them.\n  Let me, first and foremost, read into the Record a letter from the \npresident of the Fraternal Order of Police. The Senator has talked \nabout cop-killer bullets and protecting cops on the beat, those who \nwear soft body armor. This is what Chuck Canterbury, the national \npresident of the Fraternal Order of Police, says in a letter to me that \nhe has copied to Senator Frist, Senator Daschle, and to Senator \nKennedy:\n\n       I am writing to advise you of our strong opposition to an \n     amendment Senator Kennedy intends to offer later today----\n\n  In relation to the underlying amendment.\n\n       Senator Kennedy will certainly present his amendment as an \n     ``officer safety issue''----\n\n  And that is exactly what we have heard over the last good number of \nminutes----\n\n       to get dangerous ``cop-killer'' bullets----\n\n  And he talks about how dangerous they are off the shelf.\n\n       Regardless of its presentation, the amendment's actual aim \n     and effect would be to expand the definition of ``armor-\n     piercing'' to include ammunition based, not on any threat to \n     law enforcement officers, but on a manufacturer's marketing \n     strategy.\n  I do believe we saw that language on the Web site that he quoted--a \nstrategy, a rhetorical expression as it relates to an encouragement to \nbuy a given type of ammunition.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The truth of the matter is that only one law enforcement \n     officer has been killed by a round fired from a handgun which \n     penetrated his soft-body armor--and in that single instance, \n     it was the body armor that failed to provide the expected \n     ballistic protection, not because the round was ``armor \n     piercing.''\n       It is our view that no expansion or revision of the current \n     law is needed to protect law enforcement officers. To put it \n     simply, this is not a genuine officer safety issue. If it \n     were, Senator Kennedy would not be offering his amendment to \n     a bill he strongly opposes and is working to defeat.\n\n  It sounds as if not only is the president of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice talking about the facts, he is talking about some reasonable \nlogic.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The real officer safety issue is the adoption of----\n\n  The amendment we just set aside----\n\n     the Law Enforcement Officers' Safety Act.\n\n  That amendment deals with carrying a concealed weapon, to which I \nbelieve the Senator spoke in opposition, which would exempt active and \nretired law enforcement officers from local prohibitions for the right \nto carry concealed firearms.\n  Mr. Canterbury goes on:\n\n       The Kennedy amendment was considered and defeated by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee in March of 2003 on a 10-6 vote. \n     We believe that it should be rejected again.\n       On behalf of more than 311,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I thank you for taking our views on this \n     issue into consideration.\n\n  Here is the president of the National Grand Lodge of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police saying that the Kennedy amendment is not what it is. \nWhat he is, in fact, saying is that the current armor-piercing, cop-\nkilling bullet law in place is the kind of adequate protection they \nneed.\n  I have made that letter available to all of our colleagues as we \ndebate this issue.\n  What will the Kennedy amendment do? I think it is important for us to \nunderstand in reality the impact of expanding this kind of definition \nand understanding.\n  What it does--and I don't know that the Senator intends this \npurpose--is that it begins to eliminate ammunition that is used in a \nlegitimate way for hunting. He is right, Bambi doesn't wear body armor. \nBambi doesn't need to wear body armor. But in the legal sportsmen's \nindustry and in hunting, here are some very common rifles: 30.30 \nWinchester, 30.06 Springfield, 308 Winchester, 300 Savage, 7 mm \nRemington, 270 Winchester, 257 Roberts, 253 Winchester, and 223 \nRemington, just to name a few. We believe based on our interpretation \nof the amendment that this kind of ammunition is eliminated.\n  What we also know is that there is ammunition out there used with a \nrifle\n\n[[Page S1636]]\n\nthat can pierce body armor. That is a fact. But the ammunition we are \ntalking about that is traditionally known as the cop-killer bullet that \nis now outlawed in this country has nothing to do with the rifle. It \nhad everything to do with the pistol, that weapon of choice by \ncriminals in our country, and we know why.\n  Criminals do not walk down the street with a 30.06 over their \nshoulder. Somehow there is the visible factor that denies them the use \nof that rifle. They use handguns. They conceal them. They hide them on \ntheir person. They carry them in a package or in a carrying type of \nvalise. They do not carry rifles. Yet the Senator's amendment goes \ndirectly at the hunting sports; it goes directly at hunting ammunition. \nThis is why at the appropriate time when we have concluded the debate \non the Senator's amendment, I will offer an alternative amendment under \nthe unanimous consent agreement that we think reflects what ought to be \ndone in relation to what the Senator is offering.\n  Let me also add that the most extensive study on this issue pursuant \nto a congressional mandate to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty Act of 1996 was a BATF draft report provided in 1997 to those \nindividuals and organizations that had assisted in a BATF study of the \nissue of armor-piercing ammunition.\n  That study mandated, in response to President Clinton's repeated \ncall, for a ban on bullets capable of penetrating soft body armor. \nThose Presidential statements rightfully concerned many in Congress who \nwere aware that a performance-based ban, and that is what the Senator \nis offering, would outlaw the majority of rifle ammunition used for \nhunting and target shooting worldwide. That is just what I have spoken \nto. If that is the Senator's intent, then I wish he would address that. \nClearly that is what we believe one begins to enter into when they deal \nwith a performance-based standard. The 1997 study took an intelligent \nand honest approach to examining how best to protect the lives of law \nenforcement officers, recognizing the reality that between 1985 and \n1994 no officer in the United States who was wearing a bullet-resistant \nvest died as a result of any round of ammunition having been fired from \na handgun penetrating that officer's armor causing the primary lethal \ninjuries.\n  The study instead focused on how to improve police training, both in \nteaching officers how to defeat snatches by criminals and to encourage \nofficers to wear vests routinely. Legislatively, the 1997 study \nrightfully concluded that to prohibit any of these commonly used \npistol, rifle, shotgun cartridges because they might defeat a level 1 \nbullet-resistant vest would create an unreasonable burden on the \nlegitimate consumer of such cartridges.\n  Combined with the availability of sensible, defensive strategies, the \nexistence of laws restricting the common availability of armor-piercing \nammunition was clearly working to protect law enforcement officers, and \nno attempt to discard the existing law, in my opinion and many others, \nshould be undertaken.\n  At the same time, because the existing laws are working, no \nadditional legislation is necessary or required, certainly that that \ndeals with performance-based standards, because one goes directly at \nammunition used in target practice and in hunting. We do not believe, \nand I would hope the Senator from Massachusetts would agree, that is \nwhat we would intend to do.\n  In conclusion, what I am saying is the current law is adequate. This \nis not perfecting language. This is language to try to defeat the \nunderlying bill, S. 1805. Obviously, the Senator has spoken openly \nagainst that. This is in no way a bill that improves the underlying \nbill itself and we think very questionably does it improve any existing \nFederal law. What it begins to do is what the sporting community and \nthe legitimate owners of firearms have always been fearful of, that if \nthe handgun or the rifle could not be controlled, the ammunition would \nbe targeted and certain classes of ammunition would begin to be \ncontrolled and outlawed, and that is exactly what Senator Kennedy is \nattempting to do with this amendment.\n  I think it is obvious by my statement I will strongly oppose this, \nbut I will offer--or I should say the majority leader will offer--an \namendment finalizing the debate on Senator Kennedy's amendment that we \nthink if there is reason to fine-tune the existing law, then we will \noffer that fine-tuning to make it extremely punitive for anyone who \nmight use armor-piercing bullets that would strike a law enforcement \nofficer in our country, or anyone else for that matter, that would \nresult in injury or death.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just under 19 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I read through the copy of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice. As the Senator pointed out, the truth of the matter is only one \nlaw enforcement officer has been killed by a round fired from a \nhandgun. We are not talking about ammunition in a handgun. We are \ntalking about assault weapons and rifles, and I am talking about the \nFBI. Let's look at what the FBI says.\n  From 1992 to 2002, 20 law enforcement officers have been killed. \nSeventeen out of the 20 were killed with a rifle. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  The Senator referred to the earlier bill we had on the law. I am the \nauthor of that. It took 5 years to get that passed. Five years it was \nopposed by the NRA. I do not doubt it probably is going to take 5 years \nto do something about armor-piercing bullets that can shoot through \nbody armor, through a limousine, or bring down a helicopter. That is \nwhat we are talking about, 17 of the fatal shootings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that tables 10 and 36 of a document entitled \n``Law Enforcement Officers Feloniously Killed by Firearms'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           TABLE 10.--LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FELONIOUSLY KILLED BY FIREARMS\n                                              [Wounded in Upper Torso While Wearing Body Armor, 1992-2001]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Point of entry                      Total     1992     1993     1994     1995     1996     1997     1998     1999     2000     2001\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal................................................      114        5       11       11       10       12       16       14       11       10       14\nEntered between side panels of vest..................       19        1        3        4        2        4        2        1        0        1        1\nEntered through armhole or shoulder area of vest.....       32        1        2        2        3        2        2        1        6        5        8\nEntered above vest (front or back of neck, collarbone       36        1        2        4        2        4        9        6        2        3        3\n area)...............................................\nEntered below vest (abdominal or lower back area)....        8        0        1        0        1        1        0        3        0        1        1\nPenetrated vest......................................       19        2        3        1        2        1        3        3        3        0        1\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                                           TABLE 36.--LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FELONIOUSLY KILLED BY FIREARMS\n                                           [Point of Entry for Torso Wounds and Use of Body Armor, 1993-2002]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Point of entry                      Total     1993     1994     1995     1996     1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal................................................      120       11       11       10       12       16       14       11       10       14       11\nEntered between side panels of vest..................       19        3        4        2        4        2        1        0        1        1        1\nEntered through armhole or shoulder area of vest.....       34        2        2        3        2        2        1        6        5        8        3\nEntered above vest (front or back of neck, collarbone       38        2        4        2        4        9        6        2        3        3        3\n area)...............................................\nEntered below vest (abdominal or lower back area)....       11        1        0        1        1        0        3        0        1        1        3\nPenetrated vest......................................       18        3        1        2        1        3        3        3        0        1        1\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Seventeen of the fatal shootings were done by .223, \n.762, or 30.30 caliber rifles. Armor-piercing ammunition for these \ncaliber rifles is widely advertised and available, and there are no \nrestrictions at all on the deadly ammunition.\n  My amendment will not apply to the ammunition routinely used in the \nhunting rifles or other centerfire rifles. To the contrary, it covers \nonly the ammunition that is designed to market bullets having armor-\npiercing capability. If that definition is not satisfactory to the \nSenator from Idaho, work with me over the weekend to get the right \nlanguage that stops this, and he and I will offer a unanimous consent \nto be able to vote on that on the Senate floor. The Senator knows what \nwe are driving at, the kind of armor-piercing bullets that can \npenetrate the vests our law enforcement officers are going to wear.\n  I know the Fraternal Order feels we are trying to slow this bill \ndown. With all respect to them, I have been the author of the armor-\npiercing bullets for 20 years. I have put it on this. I will put it on \nsomething else. They will support us. The Senator from Idaho will \nsupport it. We will put it on the next bill that comes down here. They \nknow that is not the issue.\n  As I have pointed out, we are talking about the kind that is being \nadvertised on the Web site. Here it is for everyone to see. What in the \nworld is the possible justification for armor-piercing ammunition being \nsold in the United States of America today when we have threats in \nterms of homeland security, and we are advertising armor-piercing \nbullets out of rifles and assault weapons that can penetrate armor and \npenetrate helicopters ought to be permitted in the United States of \nAmerica? The Senator has not given an answer for it. I have not heard a \ngood answer for it.\n  How does this infringe on the hunters in our country? What do we need \nan armor-piercing bullet for to go out and hunt deer? What is the \nreason for that? I still have not received any answer.\n  Oh, it is difficult to define. This is open to a lot of different \ninterpretations. We do not quite know what this will cover.\n  We will work that out. We will work that out. That is not a good \nenough excuse. We are talking about the lives and deaths of these \npolice officers, their families. We will be back again year after year. \nMake no mistake about it, this amendment is not going away. We are \ngoing to come back year after year, and those who are going to vote \nagainst it will have the opportunity to go back and explain it to the \nfamilies of those brave law enforcement officers who are killed.\n  What is the justification for permitting that? What possible \njustification is there for permitting that? There is absolutely none.\n  This is the discussion the General Accounting Office had. It is a GAO \nstudy, which I will put in the Record. The whole section III of it is \nonly 2\\1/2\\ pages. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n III. The Widespread Availability of Armor Piercing Ammunition in the \n                            Civilian Market\n\n       As part of their investigation, GAO agents went undercover \n     to assess the availability of armor piercing fifty caliber \n     ammunition. This investigation showed that military surplus \n     ammunition is widely available.\n       First, GAO agents contacted weapons dealers in Delaware, \n     Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. GAO \n     found that these dealers were willing to sell armor piercing \n     fifty caliber ammunition. According to GAO, the dealers in \n     Delaware, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia informed the agent \n     that purchasing these kinds of ammunition was not subject to \n     any federal, state, or local restrictions. The dealers in \n     Virginia told the agent that this specialized ammunition was \n     illegal to sell or possess in that state. The dealer in \n     Maryland said he would sell such ammunition only to Maryland \n     residents. Although the investigator told the dealers in \n     Delaware, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia that the \n     investigator was a Virginia resident, none of the other \n     dealers warned the agent about Virginia's restrictions.\n       An undercover GAO agent also telephoned several ammunition \n     dealers that advertised specialized ammunition over the \n     Internet. The agent called ammunition dealers in Alaska, \n     Nebraska, and Oregon and recorded conversations in which he \n     purported to be a customer interested in buying ammunition \n     for shipment to Washington, D.C., or Virginia. The agent \n     found that he could secure the purchase of specialized \n     ammunition from any of the three dealers within a matter of \n     minutes.\n       The dealers in Nebraska and Oregon stated that they could \n     make the transaction when the agent faxed a copy of his \n     driver's license with a signed statement that he was over 21 \n     and was violating no federal, state, or local restrictions on \n     the purchase. Although the agent said he was from Virginia, \n     which bans this type of ammunition, neither dealer expressed \n     reservations about selling the ammunition to a Virginia \n     resident. According to the GAO investigator, the dealer in \n     Alaska said he had 10,000 rounds of armor piercing ammunition \n     and would sell the ammunition to the investigator. However, \n     the Alaska dealer said the investigator would have to pick up \n     the ammunition in Alaska because UPS Ground did not ship \n     goods from Alaska to the lower 48 states.\n       The GAO investigator taped the conversations with the three \n     ammunition dealers. These conversations reveal that the \n     ammunition dealers employ an ``ask no questions'' approach. \n     They were willing to sell military surplus ammunition without \n     restriction even after the investigator said he wanted the \n     ammunition shipped to his work address in Washington, D.C., \n     and needed it to pierce an armored limousine or, \n     theoretically, to ``take down'' a helicopter.\n       One of the dealers that GAO contacted was Cascade Ammo, in \n     Roseburg, Oregon. Cascade Ammo is one of Talon's three \n     largest civilian customers of refurbished military \n     ammunition. Although this dealer initially expressed \n     reservations about shipping armor piercing ammunition to \n     Washington, D.C., the dealer ultimately agreed to allow the \n     sale. When asked about the power of the ammunition, the \n     Oregon dealer said he believed armor piercing ammunition \n     would penetrate an armored limousine, as the following \n     interchanges indicate:\n       Agent: I'm very much interested to making sure that these \n     rounds can go through like, the bullet-proof glass. Do you \n     think they'll go through bullet-proof glass?\n       * * *\n       Dealer: Well, in the old days, in the old [inaudible], they \n     used 700 grains, 720 or something. But nowadays they use 660, \n     so they're getting a little more velocity out of it. And, I \n     just can't see glass standing up to that.\n       Agent: How about an armored limousine?\n       Dealer: Yeah, you're using it to test it?\n       Agent: Well, I . . .\n       Dealer: Because we have some people who are testing armored \n     cars. Like 30-06 AP-rounds.\n       Agent: Well, I . . . these would be a lot . . . \n     theoretically the .05 cal should be a lot stronger than a 30-\n     06 . . .\n       Dealer: Right, right.\n       Agent: AP.\n       Dealer: Right . . . So it should go through.\n       Agent: Well, yeah, I guess you say testing against armored \n     limousines . . . Yeah, I'll be testing against armored \n     limousines. But, but it's gotta work.\n       Dealer: Right.\n       The Oregon dealer also was confident the ammunition could \n     ``take down'' a helicopter:\n       Agent: Right. And then, if I theoretically wanted to use \n     these rounds to take down an aircraft, say either a \n     helicopter or something like that, I should be able to take a \n     helicopter down, shouldn't I?\n       Dealer: Yeah, they're not armored. They're not armored to a \n     point that it would stop. If you look at, uh, a military \n     helicopter that's been through, uh, like the ones that came \n     back from Vietnam, they've got, uh, little plates of metal \n     where they weld up the bullet holes. They just take a little \n     piece of metal and they just weld over the bullet holes. It \n     makes the guy, the next guy, feel more comfortable when he's \n     in there.\n       Agent: I guess so.\n       Dealer: (laughing) You don't want to see a bullet hole in \n     there.\n       Agent: Okay.\n       Dealer: So, yeah, it'll go through any light stuff like \n     that.\n       The final interchange with the Oregon dealer included the \n     following passages:\n       Agent: Good. You know, I'm very happy to see that we'll be \n     able to do business here, because, I'm a little bit \n     concerned, because here on the East Coast when you go to buy \n     ammunition--these large, heavy-duty .50 cal--they ask a lot \n     of questions.\n       Dealer: Oh.\n       Agent: And I don't like people asking me questions why I \n     want this ammunition.\n       Dealer: Well, see, they use them out here for hunting.\n       Agent: Um huh. Well, you could say I'm going to be using \n     this for hunting also, but just hunting of a different kind.\n       Dealer: (laughing) As long as it's noth-nothing illegal.\n       Agent: Well, I wouldn't consider it illegal.\n       Dealer: Okay. Alright.\n       The conversations with the other ammunition dealers were \n     similar. For example, the dealer in Nebraska assured the \n     agent that this ammunition would go through metal, an armored \n     limousine, and bullet-proof glass. Later in the conversation, \n     the agent and the dealer discussed whether ordinary ``sniper \n     round'' ammunition or specialized armor piercing incendiary \n     ammunition would best meet the agent's need ``to be using \n     this against . . . an armored limousine and something with \n     ballistic glass.''\n       During the agent's other conversation, the dealer in Alaska \n     claimed his armor piercing ammunition would ``go through six \n     inches of steel up to a 45 degree angle at a thousand \n     yards.'' When the agent explained that it was very important \n     for him to ``defeat an armored-type vehicle,'' the dealer \n     respond that\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\n     ``when them cattle carts come running down your drive, you'd \n     better be able to stop it.'' The agent respond by saying, \n     ``Exactly, but you know, you can think who drives in armored \n     limousines, that's why I'm going to need it someday, those \n     people in armored limousines.'' Audio tapes of these \n     conversations are available on Rep. Waxman's webpage.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is the part I want to read. They had discussions \nwith different dealers, and we can go through some of those, but listen \nto what the Oregon dealer said. He was confident the ammunition could \ntake a helicopter down. This is the agent from the GAO:\n\n       Right. And then, if I theoretically wanted to use these \n     rounds--\n\n  Armor-piercing ammunition of this type--\n\n     to take down an aircraft, say either a helicopter or \n     something like that, I should be able to take a helicopter \n     down, shouldn't I?\n       Dealer: Yeah, they're not armored. They're not armored to a \n     point that it would stop. . . .\n\n  Then it continues. These are the discussions with the dealers. They \ntalk about how they can penetrate the armor plating on automobiles and \nhow they can bring down helicopters, and we are talking about \ncontinuing to let them be sold unregulated in this country, over \n100,000 rounds for it, and the result of which is we are seeing brave \npolice officers wearing those armor-piercing vests killed.\n  What is the possible justification? Why are we so intimidated by the \nNational Rifle Association that we are not willing to deal with armor-\npiercing bullets? That is it. That is it. We haven't heard the \nargument--and I would welcome it--how these kinds of bullets are \nnecessary for hunting. I would love to hear that argument.\n\n  Oh, we need these. I remember when we first offered legislation on \nthe cop-killer bullets in the Judiciary Committee we heard they are \nnecessary because we want to be humane to the deer, and those bullets \ngo on and kill the deer rather than wound it. That is what we heard. \nCop-killer bullets. That was the answer we heard for 5 years before we \nfinally got that passed.\n  I remember the time it passed. It was with the help and support of, \nactually, the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Strom Thurmond. I \nremember it very clearly because I could not understand why we could \nnot make progress. Now we know, with the new technology in this area, \nas we have seen in other areas, exactly what is happening. It is \nputting these police officers more and more at risk. That is why we are \nattempting to do this.\n  We hear from the Senator he is going to offer some kind of other \nsubstitute. Why not do the real thing? What are we going to have, \narmor-piercing bullets ``lite''? So instead of 20 officers being killed \nthere will only be 8? 12? Why not do the whole job? That is what this \namendment will do. It will do something.\n  When this amendment is eventually accepted, and it eventually will \nbe, they will be able to look on page 40, the list of the law \nenforcement officers killed from armor-piercing bullets, and it will be \nempty because we will have done something that will be meaningful. But \nI tell you, we are going to come back every single year. We are going \nto have the FBI, and those numbers are going to continue to go up and \nup, as they are going up, according to the FBI report, with no \njustification whatsoever for including these provisions.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the amendment have 10 \nminutes 11 seconds, the opponents of the amendment have 18 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would like to agree, I would just as soon \nhave each of us have a little time before we vote. I know the \nleadership has it tight, and I know it has been difficult to work, but \nI would rather take 3 or 4 minutes before we vote on Monday. But I \ndon't know whether that is possible. I don't like to ask consent here. \nI welcome the opportunity to continue to discuss this, but I think we \nprobably would have more involved in it later on.\n  I am instructed by the floor staff we will have a very brief time \nprior to the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me respond to the Senator's inquiry. I don't disagree \nwith him. I think it is important we do have some limited time to \ndiscuss the difference between his amendment and what will be known as \nthe Frist-Craig amendment that will be offered in a few moments. That \nis important.\n  I think we have all heard the Senator from Massachusetts very \nclearly. He said he wants to ban assault weapons and rifle ammunition. \nWhat he didn't say, or what he will not say, is that the standards he \nestablishes in his legislation, performance-based standards, ban what \nis currently on-the-shelf hunting ammunition. Does the hunting \nammunition in a high-powered rifle have the ability to penetrate soft \nbody armor? Yes, it does.\n  Does it have the ability to penetrate other soft armor? Yes, it does. \nIs it used for that purpose? No. It is rarely ever found used for that \npurpose.\n  We have a choice. Clearly it is against the law when it is used for \nthat purpose and we all know that and we ought to go at those people \nwho use legitimate firearms in illegal ways instead of trying to \neliminate the firearm or, in this case, the ammunition. But, of course, \nwe know, and all of America's hunters know, they could have a 30.06 in \ntheir gun safe, they could have a 30.30 in their gun safe, they could \nhave a .308 in their gun safe, they could have a .270 in their gun \nsafe, and if they didn't have the ammunition for it, it would be a \nmarvelous historic relic of America's past. Is that what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts wants?\n  He says not. But we all know what performance-based standards do. \nWhen you establish a band through that, that is what you accomplish. \nThe fact is, virtually all hunting and target rifle ammunition is \ncapable of penetrating soft body armor. That is a reality. So by his \ndefinition does that go off the market? I believe it does. That is why \nI think it is unnecessary. That is why the President of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police said the Kennedy amendment is to kill the underlying \namendment or to make it dramatically of less value, and that he and \n311,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police disagree.\n  Probably a good many of them are hunters, and they recognize more \nthan anybody else because they are probably pretty talented people when \nit comes to understanding ballistics. When it comes to understanding \nammunition, they probably know a great deal more about it than Senator \nKennedy or this Senator, Mr. Craig.\n  They say no, it isn't necessary. The current law that the Senator \nspeaks to, that he is proud of--and he should be--is adequate. It does \nprotect. It has removed armor-piercing bullets of the handgun type.\n\n  Now we step into a whole new arena. Historically, those who want to \ncontrol firearms in this country have always said: Oh, no, it is only \nthe handgun we are after because it is the handgun that is most often \nused in the commission of a crime. It is the handgun we want to take \nout of circulation and away from the citizens of this country. Leave \nthe long gun alone. We are all for sportsmen. We are all for hunters. \nWe like guns. They are good guns. Those are bad guns.\n  What the amendment of the Senator is suggesting is--he may not say \nthey are bad guns, but he says their ammunition is bad. And if you take \ntheir ammunition away, then as I said earlier, these kinds of hunting \nrifles will become a marvelous museum piece and a relic of our historic \npast. I don't believe a majority of the Senate will go there. I hope \nthe amendment I will soon offer will provide ample reason to say, yes, \nwe are going to get tough on anybody who uses an armor-piercing bullet \nof any kind that is capable of penetrating a vest, soft body armor. \nThat is what we ought to be about, instead of using the language and \nnot the definition--and using the language and not the reality--and \nusing performance-based bans to eliminate a very large category of \nhunting ammunition and other types of ammunition used for target \npractice and professionally in this country.\n  I strongly oppose and will encourage my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, we have possibly one other Senator wishing to come to \nspeak. Let me check on that. If that is not true, I see no reason we \ncouldn't reserve the remainder of our time or move on to another \namendment.\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just want to remind the Senate what we \nhave just heard. It is a wonderful technique. I don't disparage my \nfriend from Idaho, and he is my friend. But that is to misrepresent \nwhat the amendment does and then to differ with it.\n\n  I have been here several years and I know that technique. It is one \nthat I have used once in a while.\n  People ought to understand, when we are talking about life and death, \nwe ought to be willing to at least deal with the facts.\n  The facts are as described in the amendment about what the definition \nwould be in terms of the armor-piercing bullets. That talks about a \nprojectile for centerfire rifles designed or marketed as having an \narmor-piercing capability that the Attorney General determined pursuant \nto the section 926(d) to be more likely to penetrate body armor than \nstandard ammunition of the same caliber, period.\n  Armor-piercing bullets--as my good friend says, wants to eliminate \nall ammunition for these weapons and, therefore, they will just be \nrelics on the shelves of time.\n  This is what it is; it is written into the amendment: a projectile \nfor centerfire rifles designed or marketed as having armor-piercing \ncapability that the Attorney General determines--not the Senator from \nMassachusetts, not the Senator from Idaho--but the one that has the \ncapability to more likely penetrate body armor.\n  That is what we are talking about--penetrating body armor that law \nenforcement officers wear and which stands between their life and their \ndeath.\n  That is what this amendment does. We have already seen and sadly \nreviewed the statistics that are out there now about the brave officers \nwho have already been killed. We will have an opportunity to do \nsomething about that on Tuesday next. Let us not fail to do so.\n  Over the weekend, if there is language that is necessary to ensure \nthat particular purpose can be achieved with more effective language, \nlet me give the assurance to the Senator from Idaho and others \ninterested who take that position that we are more than glad to work \nthat out.\n  We will not compromise on dealing with the fundamental issue; and \nthat is armor-piercing bullets penetrating those vests or put at risk \nthe lives of brave officers today and in the future.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time. I saw the Senator from the State \nof Washington who I believe is ready to move ahead. I will either yield \nback my time or retain my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask at this moment that the Senator not \nyield time. I have a few moments remaining on my time. I am going to \nask for a very short period of time to go into a quorum call at which \ntime we will come out of it and offer the Frist-Craig amendment. I \ndon't need to debate that for any length of time. That is in the order \nof the unanimous consent. As the Senator from Massachusetts knows, \nthose two then will be set aside to be voted on Tuesday next.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. How much time remains on the current amendment, the \nKennedy amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 6\\1/2\\ minutes and the \nopponents have 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am prepared to yield back if the Senator is, and I will \noffer the first Craig amendment and speak for a few short minutes on \nthat and then move on.\n  Mr. REID. We yield back the time of Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time of the proponent \nof the amendment is yielded back.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding that the Kennedy amendment will now \nbe set aside to be voted on Tuesday next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2625\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I send to the desk the Frist-Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for Mr. Frist, for \n     himself and Mr. Craig, proposes an amendment numbered 2625.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To regulate the sale and possession of armor piercing \n                  ammunition, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. ARMOR PIERCING AMMUNITION.\n\n       (a) Unlawful Acts.--Section 922(a) of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking paragraphs (7) and (8) \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(7) for any person to manufacture or import armor \n     piercing ammunition, unless--\n       ``(A) the manufacture of such ammunition is for the use of \n     the United States, any department or agency of the United \n     States, any State, or any department, agency, or political \n     subdivision of a State;\n       ``(B) the manufacture of such ammunition is for the purpose \n     of exportation; or\n       ``(C) the manufacture or importation of such ammunition is \n     for the purpose of testing or experimentation and has been \n     authorized by the Attorney General.\n       ``(8) for any manufacturer or importer to sell or deliver \n     armor piercing ammunition, unless such sale or delivery--\n       ``(A) is for the use of the United States, any department \n     or agency of the United States, any State, or any department, \n     agency, or political subdivision of a State;\n       ``(B) is for the purpose of exportation; or\n       ``(C) is for the purpose of testing or experimentation and \n     has been authorized by the Attorney General.''.\n       (b) Penalties.--Section 924(c) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence \n     is otherwise provided under this subsection, or by any other \n     provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to \n     any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a \n     crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for \n     an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or \n     dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be \n     prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries \n     armor piercing ammunition, or who, in furtherance of any such \n     crime, possesses armor piercing ammunition, shall, in \n     addition to the punishment provided for such crime of \n     violence or drug trafficking crime or conviction under this \n     section--\n       ``(A) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less \n     than 15 years;\n       ``(B) if death results from the use of such ammunition--\n       ``(i) if the killing is murder (as defined in section \n     1111), be punished by death or sentenced to a term of \n     imprisonment for any term of years or for life; and\n       ``(ii) if the killing is manslaughter (as defined in \n     section 1112), be punished as provided in section 1112.''.\n       (c) Study and Report.--\n       (1) Study.--The Attorney General shall conduct a study to \n     determine whether a uniform standard for the uniform testing \n     of projectiles against Body Armor is feasible.\n       (2) Issues to be studied.--The study conducted under \n     paragraph (1) shall include--\n       (A) variations in performance that are related to the \n     length of the barrel of the handgun or centerfire rifle from \n     which the projectile is fired; and\n       (B) the amount of powder used to propel the projectile.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a \n     report containing the results of the study conducted under \n     this subsection to--\n       (A) the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \n     Committee of the Senate; and\n       (B) the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \n     Committee of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy has a copy of this \nstraightforward amendment that strengthens the current armor-piercing \nbullet law. It does a couple of things.\n  It says the Attorney General shall commission a study to determine \nwhether a uniform standard for the uniform testing of projectiles \nagainst body armor is feasible and what impact it would have on \nsporting and hunting endeavors. It includes within the issues to be \nstudied variations in performance that are related to the length of the \nbarrel of the handgun or the\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\ncenterfired rifle from which the projectile is fired and the amount of \npowder used to propel the projectile. The Attorney General shall \ndeliver such report to the chairman and the ranking member of the House \nand Senate Judiciary Committee within 2 years of the date of the \nenactment of this legislation.\n  This became the core of the debate between the Senator from \nMassachusetts and myself. What does ``performance-based standards'' \nmean, and how do they impact legitimate sporting and hunting \nammunition?\n  Also, insert as new, 18 USC, 924:\n\n       (5) Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is \n     otherwise provided under this subsection, or by any other \n     provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to \n     any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a \n     crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for \n     an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or \n     dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be \n     prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries \n     armor piercing ammunition, or who, in furtherance of any such \n     crime, possesses armor piercing ammunition, shall, in \n     addition to the punishment provided for such crime of \n     violence or drug trafficking crime or conviction [under title \n     18 USC 924]--\n       ``(A) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less \n     than 15 years;\n       ``(B) if death results from the use of such ammunition--\n       ``(i) if the killing is murder (as defined in section \n     1111), be punished by death or sentenced to a term of \n     imprisonment for any term of years or for life; and\n       ``(ii) if the killing is manslaughter (as defined in \n     section 1112), be punished as provided in section 1112.''\n\n  What are we doing? We are adding real teeth to current law. We are \nsaying to the criminal element and the drug trafficking element in our \ncountry, if you use armor-piercing ammunition in your firearm and it \nmaims or kills a law enforcement officer, we will put you away for \nlife.\n  That is what we are going to do. We do not tolerate it. We never \nhave. The current law serves effectively, but if there is a sentence, \nthen let's toughen it, let's strengthen it, let's give stronger \npositions to the law enforcement community of this country.\n  That is the crux of the bill. It is straightforward. It is simple. We \nthink it offers what certainly all of us want to see and what the law \nenforcement community of this country needs.\n  I hope the Frist-Craig amendment will be accepted. It is a \nstraightforward amendment. If the Senator would make himself available, \nwe can conclude this debate, set this amendment aside, and move to the \nnext amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is in the \nChamber. In his absence, I offered the Frist-Craig amendment and spoke \nbriefly to it as a true strengthening of current armor-piercing bullet \nlegislation, to suggest very directly to the criminal element and the \ndrug trafficking element in our country: If you use armor-piercing \nbullets and it wounds or takes the life of a law enforcement officer, \nwe will put you away for life. I think that is about as clear and \ndirect as we can become with the already strong prohibition that is in \nplace for armor-piercing bullets that would be used in handguns.\n  With that, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will oppose the amendment because it \ndoes nothing to protect our law enforcement officers from armor-\npiercing bullets. All it does say, as I understand it, is if law \nenforcement officers are killed, under the current law the penalties \nare going to be greater, including even in the death penalty.\n  My amendment says, let's stop the armor-piercing bullets now to save \nlives. Let's be proactive and prevent the loss of lives. The Senator \nfrom Idaho says, well, after they are killed we are going to penalize \nthese people more. My amendment would effectively save lives because we \nwould effectively prohibit the kind of armor-piercing bullets from \nbeing sold or available to those who want to do our law enforcement \npersonnel harm.\n  So it just misses the point, the idea that we are going to do \nsomething after that police officer is killed. That will not do \nanything about these numbers I mention. We have just seen 20 officers \nkilled over the last 10 years, and 17 of them by armor-piercing \nbullets. That is what they were killed by; and that is what my \namendment is focused on. The Senator's amendment will do nothing about \npreventing that kind of activity. I appreciate his efforts in trying to \ndo something, but this fails the mark.\n  I withhold my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, his legislation goes at long guns, rifles, and their \nammunition. What I did not say, with him coming back into the Chamber, \nis we do direct the Attorney General to look at, over a period of time, \n2 years--no later than that--and report to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, on which the Senator serves, a study to see whether what the \nSenator is proposing in his amendment wipes from the shelves of this \ncountry the kind of hunting ammunition we believe it will, and that \ncertainly a good many others do.\n  I am not insensitive to what the Senator is saying, but I am saying, \nlet's get the facts. We do not want to wipe out half the hunting or \ntwo-thirds of the hunting ammunition and the target ammunition in this \ncountry. That is legitimate. It is law abiding. Does it get misused? \nYes. Does some of it have armor-piercing capability, to some extent? \nYes.\n  Certainly this is what our intent is. In the meantime, let's toughen \nthe law. Let's send the message to the criminal element in our country \nthat armor-piercing ammunition is flat off limits or you pay a \nphenomenal price for it.\n  Is it a deterrent? The Senator from Massachusetts would suggest it is \nnot. In most instances, we find good, tough law enforcement, and a \nreality known by those who would commit crimes with this kind of \nammunition in this country, does serve as a deterrent. That is the \nintent of the amendment. We believe it is a good amendment.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time if the Senator \nbelieves he has adequately covered this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No. I just want to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I may, Mr. President, I yield myself time.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that armor-piercing ammunition for rifles \nand assault weapons is virtually unregulated in the United States of \nAmerica. A Federal license is not required to sell such ammunition \nunless firearms are sold as well. Anyone over the age of 18 may \npurchase this ammunition without a background check, and there is no \nFederal minimum age for possession. Purchases may be made over the \ncounter, by mail order, by fax, or by Internet, and there is no Federal \nrequirement that dealers retain sale records.\n  It is this current lawlessness that jeopardizes the safety of police \nofficers. It is this failure of the existing law that has led to 20 \nfatal shootings of police officers, and will lead to many more unless \nCongress acts, not studies--acts, not studies.\n  The facts are well established. The FBI statistics do not lie. We do \nnot need another study. We do not need another report. All we need to \ndo is adopt the underlying legislation that gives the Attorney General \nthe authority and the power to ensure the kind of armor-piercing \nbullets that are being used, that pierce the armor and kill our law \nenforcement officials, will be prohibited from use today.\n  As I outlined in my amendment: ``a projectile for a centerfire rifle, \ndesigned or marketed as having armor-piercing capability, that the \nAttorney General determines . . .''--not the Senator from Idaho or the \nSenator from Massachusetts--``to be more likely to penetrate body armor \nthan standard ammunition of the same caliber.''\n  We either have a problem or we do not. I believe we do. Certainly the \nfamilies of those brave officers who died believe we do--their families \nand those police departments. We have an opportunity to do this on next \nTuesday. I\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\nhope the Craig amendment will be defeated and that the amendment I \noffered will be accepted.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of time if the Senator is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I too am prepared to \nyield back the remainder of our time.\n  Let me conclude my comments by saying, it is not the role of the \nAttorney General of the United States to determine what can or cannot \nbe used in this country as forms of ammunition. It is our job, if we \nare going to do it. And we should not do it. The marketplace has done \nit. The Senator has shaped legislation that has controlled types of it, \nand that has been supported.\n  I do not think we need to get as arbitrary as some Attorneys General \ncan be and have been in the past as it relates to what their vision is \nversus what we believe ought to be illegal or legal in this country.\n  Our job is to make it the law. That is what we are about here at this \nmoment. But it is important that we establish parameters and \nunderstandings clearly to determine the kinds of tests that are \nperformance based in what they do to what is now currently legal \nammunition in this country.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time, and ask that the \nFrist-Craig amendment be set aside to be considered on Tuesday next.\n  I believe the next item under our unanimous consent is to move to \nSenator Cantwell for her amendment for an unemployment insurance \nextension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Massachusetts yield back \nhis time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The amendment will \nbe set aside.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2617\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant Journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2617.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, how much time is allowed for debate on \nthe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour, evenly divided.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. President. If I can be notified when I \nhave used 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, while we are talking about gun liability, I think a \nmore important question for this body to be debating is the liability \nwe are leaving the American workers with when, in fact, this body \nrefuses to pass unemployment benefit extensions at a time when our \neconomy is not recovering at the speed it takes to create new jobs.\n  As our own newspaper in Washington State, the Seattle Post \nIntelligencer, said this past week:\n\n       Everything is not fine in the job market.\n\n  That is what many Americans are saying. That is what many people \nacross the country are starting to debate when they talk about the \nissue of outsourcing. Everything is not fine in the job market.\n  The President and his economic advisers issued a report, the Economic \nReport from the President of the United States, as to the growth we \nwere supposed to expect in our economy in 2004. If my colleagues have a \ncopy of that report and turn to page 98, they will see that the \nPresident and his economic advisers, when talking about growth in real \nGDP over the long term, predict that jobs for this year are going to \ngrow by 2.6 million. That was great economic news to a lot of Americans \nwho have been sitting around since December without Federal \nunemployment benefits, sending out resume after resume, only to find \nthat they are competing with hundreds of other more qualified Americans \nfor a very few jobs.\n  What became more frustrating to those unemployed Americans who have \nlost their jobs through no fault of their own, many as a result of 9/11 \nand the impact of terrorist activities on our economy, such as in \naviation, aerospace, and a general downturn, many of those Americans \nwould rather have the paycheck than the unemployment check. But without \njobs being created, they would like to have some assistance in making \nthe mortgage payment, paying the rent, paying for health care, and \ntaking care of their families.\n  They were stunned when they found out that the President doesn't \nreally stick by the 2.6 million number. Last week, the President and \ntwo Cabinet Secretaries, the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce, \nventured to Washington State and refused to meet with unemployed \nworkers there. We have had, for the better part of the last 2 years, an \nunemployment rate over 7 percent. We are a little bit below that right \nnow, and we are concerned about stimulating the economy and from where \njob growth is going to come. When these two members of the President's \nCabinet came to town and were asked about the President's economic \nforecast--asked whether they stick by the 2.6 million jobs that will be \ncreated, both of those Secretaries said: Those were assumptions based \non economic models and the calculations have a margin of error.\n  The American worker is not a rounding error on a statistician's desk. \nThey are real people who are not getting the economic assistance they \ndeserve.\n  It is no surprise that other newspapers across the country have also \nnoted this. The Atlanta Journal Constitution said:\n\n       But the economic bounce has not yet been strong enough for \n     cautious employers to get beyond squeezing more production \n     from existing workers and taking the crucial step of hiring. \n     This leaves millions of unemployed sinking further into debt \n     and desperation.\n\n  That points to what is going on here. The President is backing away \nfrom his economic numbers. People realize that job growth is not \nhappening. Yet we refuse to pass an extension of unemployment benefits.\n  Why is that so important? It is important to many Americans who would\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\nrather have that paycheck than an unemployment check, and it can \nprovide a real stimulus because for every dollar in unemployment \ninsurance, it generates $2 of economic stimulus into the local economy.\n\n  We continue to see these projections versus reality. The President's \neconomic advisers said in 2002 that we were only going to lose a few \njobs. We ended up actually losing 1.4 million jobs. In 2003, they said \nwe were going to grow the economy, 1.7 million. We ended up losing \nanother almost 500,000 jobs. Now in 2004, they say we are going to grow \n2.6 million jobs in what is left of this year. So far we have only \ngained 112,000 jobs.\n  The economy is moving very slowly. We should not leave people out in \nthe cold. That is exactly what we are doing by not passing Federal \nbenefits on to those unemployed workers when they exhaust their State \nbenefits. In fact, in December, we left out lots of workers: in \nIllinois, about 17,000 people; Texas, about 23,000; North Carolina, \n10,000; Ohio, over 10,000; Pennsylvania, 17,000 people; Georgia, 14,000 \npeople. At the end of December, when the benefit program expired at the \nState level, these people were no longer eligible for benefits at the \nFederal level because we curtailed the Federal program.\n  What that means is that every month more and more people exhaust \ntheir State benefits as no jobs are found and thereby are denied \nFederal benefits. For example, for the first 6 months of this year, \nover 50,000 additional people from Washington State would be eligible, \nbut won't receive help. On a national level, 2 million people would be \neligible to receive Federal benefits.\n  These numbers represent what happened to people in these States in \nDecember of 2003, when the other side of the aisle refused to grant the \nmotion of seeking unanimous consent to pass unemployment benefits for \nAmerican workers.\n  Our colleagues in the House of Representatives who heard the message, \nprobably when they went home over the recess and did their town \nmeetings, listened to people across America and found out that this was \na pretty big issue. People wanted to know, where am I going to find a \njob? Where is my spouse going to find a job? People were relying on \nloans from families just to make mortgage payments.\n  So the House of Representatives came back from recess and actually \npassed unemployment benefit extensions because they got the message.\n  We are still down in our economy. The key question is, How have we as \na nation responded to these economic recessions in the past? How have \nprevious administrations, both Democrat and Republican, responded to \nrecessions? We know that in the early 1990s we had a recession. The \nfirst Bush administration and the Clinton administration became \naggressive about unemployment benefits and had a very expansive program \nthat was in place for a total of 27 months.\n  During that time, we ended up creating 2.9 million new jobs, a very \npositive outcome. In this recession and recovery, which began in 2001, \nwe have lost 2.4 million jobs. The difference between this recession \nand the last is that we have cut off the Federal benefit program. And \nyet, we haven't yet had a net creation of jobs.\n\n  We started to slowly shirk the jobs deficit, with 112,000 jobs in \nJanuary, but we have curtailed the program before we have seen real \nresults. Why would we do that when we have previous experience, from \ntwo different administrations, that shows that continuing the program \nreally does help stimulate the economy?\n  That is what we want to do. That is why I am not surprised that other \npeople around the country such as the Akron Beacon Journal said:\n\n       The recovery has aptly been called jobless. Offer a bridge \n     to a better time, and Congress won't simply aid those \n     struggling to find work. The country as a whole will benefit.\n\n  This is not solely about helping individuals who are unemployed. It \nis a stimulus to the economy. What happens if the 2 million people who \nwill lose Federal benefits over the next 6 months can't make mortgage \npayments and end up defaulting on their home mortgages. How is that \ngood for the U.S. economy? Or say, for example, individuals can't make \nhealth insurance payments and end up costing more in uncompensated \nhealth care? How is that good for America?\n  I was not surprised when I saw in the San Jose Mercury News that the \nother side of the aisle had been accused of being of little interest or \nbeing silent on this issue.\n  Basically, the San Jose Mercury News said:\n\n       Despite a recent uptick in hiring across the country in \n     2004, they could bring more hardship for million of Americans \n     out of work. A callous Congress is sitting behind as their \n     hope for receiving extended unemployment benefits fades.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Chair advises the Senator she \nhas used 10 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for that information. \nI would like to continue until other of my colleagues from different \nregions of the country, which have been hit with high unemployment, \ncome to the Chamber.\n  I wish to focus on reality versus rhetoric. We have been promised 2.6 \nmillion jobs, but instead, we have seen a loss of 2.3 million. The \nrhetoric doesn't stand up. If the President is going to deny his own \neconomic report and say we are not going to create 2.6 million jobs, \nthen give American workers a hand--extend unemployment benefits as a \nlifeline to help stimulate their family incomes and help stimulate our \nnational economy.\n  I ask the President and the other side of the aisle to take a little \nbit of time and go back in history. I know not everybody on the other \nside of the aisle agrees with the policies of a Democratic \nadministration juxtaposed to this administration, but let's look at \nwhat the last Bush administration did when we had a downturn of our \neconomy and how President George H. W. Bush handled the situation.\n  He had a similar problem when he came into office: the 1990s \nrecession. In April of 1992, the President saw that we had tremendous \njob loss in the millions, but the economy had started to pick up again. \nThe first President Bush saw that the economy had picked up 379,000 \njobs. He could have stopped the unemployment benefit program right then \nand there. He could have said: My job is over; the economy is starting \nto grow again; I don't have to do anything else about this issue. But \nthe President did not.\n  The first President Bush extended unemployment benefits for an \nadditional 9 months. He did it for 9 months--and it was a program with \nmore weeks of benefits than the current program. It was 20 weeks \ninstead of the 13 weeks we have for basic unemployment States.\n  The first President Bush said: Yes, there was a little bit of job \ngrowth going on, but the negative impact of the recession means we \nshould not stop Federal unemployment benefits.\n  What has the second President Bush done? He has been faced with a \nsimilar recession. As we saw from the previous chart, we have lost 2.4 \nmillion jobs in the last 2 years and this President sees a little \nuptick in the economic numbers. He sees about 112,000 jobs created in \nJanuary. And what does he say? That's it; that's it; no more Federal \nunemployment benefit program. No unemployment benefits. No weeks, no \nprogram.\n  Basically, we have left the American workers out in the cold as it \nrelates to this opportunity to sustain themselves and sustain our \neconomy in great economically challenging times.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to look at this \nhistory, to look at what the first Bush administration did under \nsimilar circumstances, to look at his results. They were very positive \nfor the U.S. economy and for the U.S. worker. Analyze that juxtaposed \nto the positions we have taken in this body today, primarily because \nthe other side of the aisle, a dozen times now, has refused us the \nright to have a vote on this issue. We are going to have that vote, and \nI hope my colleagues will stand up for the American worker and, most \nimportantly, for the American economy that needs this stimulus.\n  I see some of my colleagues have joined me in the Chamber. I say to \nthe Senator from Maryland, who has been eloquent on these issues, I \ndon't know how much time the Senator is seeking, but I will be happy to \nyield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is the Senator controlling time?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes, I am. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n\n[[Page S1643]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes 9 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am happy to yield the Senator 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \namendment offered by the able Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, of \nwhich I am pleased to be a cosponsor. This amendment will extend the \nunemployment benefits which lapsed at the end of December--they have \nlapsed and are not available--and continue the program for 6 months, \nthrough the end of June.\n  The program lapsed not because the fundamental economic problem which \nled to its creation--the very weak labor market--has been solved. That \nmarket's weakness remains a serious concern.\n  Long-term unemployment--the problem for which this program was \ncreated--is near record levels. There are nearly 1.9 million unemployed \nworkers in America who are long-term unemployed. That is, they have \nbeen unemployed for more than 26 weeks. They constitute almost 23 \npercent of all unemployed workers. This level has been above 20 percent \nfor the past 16 months, the longest stretch of long-term unemployment \nat this level in more than 20 years.\n  It has been 34 months since the recession began. The economy has \nalmost 2 percent fewer jobs than it had 34 months ago. Jobs are not \nbeing created in sufficient number to close this gap. Job creation is \nfar below what is needed to improve the situation for unemployed \nworkers.\n  Some colleagues have argued that we do not need the program because \nwe are no longer losing jobs. However, the job growth that the economy \nis producing is too slow to put back to work those who have lost their \njobs. Of course, the administration predicted after they passed the \n2003 tax cut, that by last month, the economy would have created over 2 \nmillion jobs. It created 300,000 jobs over that period.\n  This amendment's proposal is not excessive by historical standards. \nIn fact, the administration's refusal to act is what constitutes a \nbreak with historical precedent. Again and again in the past, we have \nextended unemployment insurance to provide some assistance to the long-\nterm unemployed.\n  Finally, let me simply make this point: We build up an unemployment \ntrust fund in good times to fund the benefits when we have an economic \ndownturn. There is over $15 billion in the unemployment insurance trust \nfund to pay unemployment insurance benefits. We have millions out there \nneeding this help. This money was collected for that purpose. It should \nbe used for that purpose.\n  I strongly urge support of this amendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for her leadership. I \nwish to make a couple of points. First, there is a staggering amount of \neconomic hurt in virtually every nook and cranny of my State. Our \nunemployment rate is over 7 percent.\n  The Economic Development Administration recently announced that for \nkey projects to create jobs in rural areas, small communities are going \nto have to come up with $22 to get $1 of help for infrastructure, \nsomething that can create good-paying jobs.\n  We are trying to get the transportation bill passed, but with those \nkinds of measures, we desperately need to extend this lifeline \nlegislation to the thousands and thousands of Oregonians and other \nAmericans who are out of work.\n  These are folks who simply have nowhere to turn to pay the bills. \nThey are walking an economic tightrope, balancing fuel costs against \nfood costs and fuel costs against medical costs.\n  Without this extension and without the look-back rule that this \nlegislation would provide, these are folks who are going to fall into \nthe economic abyss. They deserve better.\n  The fact is, the stock market is doing well. We are glad to see it. \nWe are glad to see profits up at so many of our companies. All of these \nare pluses for our country. But the fact is, middle-class folks, and \nparticularly the middle class that is unemployed, are feeling pinched \nlike never before. I am very hopeful my colleagues will support this \nlegislation. It is essential to provide a measure of relief to these \nfolks who are enduring so much economic hurt.\n  I have just gone through a series of community meetings at home, and \nit came up again and again. So I hope, in the name of compassion, but \nalso in the name of helping these middle-class folks get back on their \nfeet as they look for alternatives, as they look for other positions \nthat pay them enough to support their families, that my colleagues \nwould support this important Cantwell amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Cantwell \namendment, and want to put this in a little perspective. We have an \nunemployment benefit insurance program and then we have the temporary \nextension of the benefit program which we have been doing for some time \nnow. In fact, I think the temporary extension has been done two \ndifferent times.\n  I also want to clear up some of the confusion because there is a \npayroll survey which measures the amount of jobs created, and there is \na household survey. We know what statistics can do depending in whose \nhands they are, but let us at least know what the facts are.\n  Payroll survey measures--if someone goes to work for somebody, they \nget a job and go on their payroll, that is the payroll survey. So if a \nperson is employed by somebody, it is counted in the payroll survey.\n  When I was practicing as a veterinarian, I opened my own practice. I \nwas self-employed. That does not go on the payroll survey, but it does \ngo on the household survey. Right now, on eBay--we have all heard of \neBay--there is a fairly solid estimate that there are now over 200,000 \npeople with full-time businesses operating on eBay. These are full-time \njobs and the individuals are doing very well operating on eBay. They \nare buying and selling things on eBay.\n  However, those 200,000 jobs are not counted in the payroll survey. \nThat is the survey the Democrats are commonly referring to all the time \nwhen they are saying there are job losses.\n  To show the difference between the payroll survey and the household \nsurvey with statistics, in January the payroll survey said we had \ncreated about 100,000 jobs. The household survey showed the creation of \nalmost half a million jobs. Now if one believes the other side, they \nare saying to somebody who is self-employed that they do not have a \njob. Well, I am sorry, but when I was a self-employed veterinarian \nworking 100 hours a week, I thought that was work. I thought that was a \njob. Listening to the other side, they are saying it is not a job.\n\n  Having said that, let's look at unemployment rates, which is a \nmeasure of the payroll survey. When the Democrats were in charge of the \nHouse, the Senate, and the White House, all three bodies, they had the \nability to extend this program on their own because they had the votes \nto do that. Let's look at the historical unemployment rates versus \ntoday's unemployment rates to see whether they extended the program; in \nother words, to see when they had the ability to act whether they \nmatched it against what they are saying today.\n  In the early 1990s when the Democrats were in control of the Senate, \nthe House, and the White House, the unemployment rate at the start of \nthe program was 7.0 percent. When we started the program this time, the \nunemployment rate was at 5.7 percent. At the peak of the program in the \n90s, the highest unemployment rate under the Democrats went up to 7.8 \npercent. The peak unemployment rate this time went to 6.3 percent.\n  When the Democrats voted to end the program, to terminate the \nextension of unemployment benefits, the unemployment rate was at 6.4 \npercent.\n  What is that unemployment rate today? It is at 5.6 percent, almost a \nfull percentage point less than when the Democrats controlled the \nSenate, the House, and the White House, and they voted to terminate the \nprogram. Why did they vote to terminate it? Because\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\nthe extension of unemployment benefits is put in during times of high \nunemployment rates.\n  Well, they are saying times have changed. Statistics back then do not \ncompare with statistics now. I do not know why, but that is what they \nare saying.\n  Let's point out what this Senate and the House did last year. We gave \nthe States $8 billion to help fund their own unemployment programs--\nespecially those States that have high unemployment like Oregon. The \nSenator from Oregon was just on the floor speaking. We gave that money \nto the States to handle serious problems with individuals facing long-\nterm unemployment.\n  What have the States done with that money? We gave them that money 2 \nyears ago. In March 2002, we gave $8 million to the States. What have \nthey done with it? Well, there is $4.3 billion the States have not \nused. Are our States not compassionate? Do they not care about people, \nas the other side would have us believe?\n  They have not spent over half of the money we gave from the Federal \nGovernment to the States.\n  So I think we have to look at what is going on today with this \namendment. I believe this is very well intentioned by the other side, \nbut what has happened is our mindset has changed. What used to be \nconsidered full employment is now considered high unemployment. All of \nus back in the early 1990s thought a 5.5 percent unemployment rate \nwould be considered full employment in this economy, because there are \nalways people who are changing jobs so they are temporarily unemployed. \nThere are always people who have difficulty because of training, they \nare getting some new training so it takes them longer to find a job. \nThen sometimes, frankly, in a changing economy, people do have to move \nto find a job. Sometimes it takes a long period of unemployment for \npeople to make that decision. It is a very difficult decision to make.\n  I think we need to be sensitive to people, but we also have to look \nat the reality we are facing. We are facing huge budget deficits today. \nHow many of the people running for President have been talking about \nthe budget problem? On the other side of the aisle, I have heard it \ntalked about time and time again.\n  Well, the extension of the unemployment benefits costs almost $1 \nbillion dollars a month. So if we extend it out to the end of this \nyear, we are going to be talking about another $10 billion, or \nsomewhere thereabouts, added to the budget deficit. That money will be \nborrowed from the Social Security trust fund, because when there is \ndeficit spending, that is where it is taken out of. We all know that. \nIt is a paper trust fund anyway, but we all know that is where it will \nbe taken out of.\n  So I think it is important for us to understand, first, what got us \nhere, what the historical implications have been as I have laid them \nout, and then what do we do to get out of this dilemma. What we do to \nget out of it is to make sure we have a strong enough economy so new \njobs will be created.\n  What are all of the economists--and I do not care which philosophy \nthe economists subscribe to, the one thing everybody agrees with is \nthese large budget deficits we are experiencing today and that are \nprojected out into the future are the No. 1 single threat to our \neconomy. So if we want to have a secure future going forward, we must \nwatch and curtail additional Federal spending.\n  The reason we have the deficit today, over half of it, is because of \nthe poor economy. So when businesses and individuals are not making as \nmuch money, they do not pay as much in taxes. Over half of the budget \ndeficit is caused by that. About another 27 or 28 percent of the budget \ndeficit was caused by increased Federal spending. And about 20 percent \nof it were the last two tax cuts that were enacted. But without those \ntax cuts--it is widely accepted now those tax cuts have helped the \neconomy--we would be in even worse shape.\n\n  The number one thing we can do for the economy, as a Federal \nGovernment is to create the atmosphere where those jobs are created. So \nthe number one thing we can do is make sure we keep our fiscal house in \norder by restraining Federal spending.\n  Looking back at the payroll survey, eight months prior to the tax \ncuts we lost 386,000 jobs. Eight months after the tax cuts we produced \n300,000 jobs. That is just the payroll survey statistics. That does not \ncount the household survey, or all of those self-employed people I was \ntalking about earlier. There are literally a couple of million jobs \nthat have been produced since the tax cut, when you count self-employed \npeople.\n  The other side says that doesn't count. Just ask somebody who is \nself-employed whether they think their job counts and should count in \nthe national statistics. I think everybody who is self-employed out \nthere, if you have a mom-and-pop business, if you are a doctor who used \nto work for a hospital and have your own practice, or you are a nurse-\nmidwife and you decided to take the risk and go out on your own, does \nyour job count? A nurse practitioner or a physical therapist, whatever \nthe job is, should that job count? I believe it should. I believe that \nis why there are two different surveys, the household survey and a \npayroll survey. It is important that we have both of them so we can \nlook at the big picture. The economy is changing. We have to have \npolicies that reflect those changes.\n  I yield the floor at this time so we can go back and forth and \ncontinue the debate. I see my friend from Oklahoma. Next time I get \nrecognized, I will yield some time to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 57 seconds; they \nhave 18 minutes 41 seconds.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair let me know when 3\\1/2\\ minutes has \npassed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nbeing our leader on this issue about concern for the unemployed. She \nhas, along with our colleagues, on over 12 different occasions \nchallenged the Senate to try to do the constructive and positive thing, \nin terms of the unemployed in this country.\n  I listened to my friend from Nevada. I wonder what world he is living \nin. It probably is the world of the President of the United States. \nFirst, he gave us the State of the Union and said the economy is \nwonderful and getting better. Then he made a speech on the State of the \neconomy and said everything is just rosy-posy. Then he spoke to the \nNational Governors Association just this last 2 days ago and said \neverything is just fine; everything is doing well.\n  Here I have three of this week's magazines talking about what is \nhappening. ``Jobs Going Abroad.'' What is happening? ``New Jobs \nMigration.'' What is happening? ``Will America still be able to be a \nstrong economy?'' This is what is happening in the world. And we have \nsilence by this body.\n  Look at this chart. Thirteen million children are going hungry every \nday in America, 3 million more Americans are living in poverty than 3 \nyears ago, and 90,000 workers are losing their unemployed compensation \nevery single week. That is the real America.\n  What we know is what has happened to real people in America. These \nare the administration's own figures. This is the Department of Labor. \nIn 2000, the average family earned $44,000; now it is down to $42,000--\na near $1,500 reduction. That is what is happening.\n  We have a real need out there. Everyone who travels the country \nunderstands it, except the Republicans.\n  You have $15 billion in that fund. The Senator from Nevada says we \nhave $4 billion that the States have. He knows as well as I they are \nrestricted from using it because of Federal law. There is $15 billion \nout there. These are hard-working, decent Americans trying to pay a \nmortgage, trying to put food on the table, trying to take care of their \nchildren, and we are here saying, no, no, no; we are not going to give \nthem the help and the assistance, the lifeline. They paid over a \nlifetime of working hard into this country. They paid into this fund. \nThey are entitled to it. What is the reason for not providing this? \nWhat is the reason for not providing it? That is what the amendment\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\nof the Senator from the State of Washington will do. It will give them \na lifeline for the next 13 weeks so they will be able to keep their \nfamilies together, have a sense of dignity, have a sense of pride, have \na sense of optimism in their future and their family's future. We ought \nto be about the business of passing that and I hope we do this \nafternoon.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am going to reclaim 30 seconds, if I \ncan.\n  I will just take the time to read from this letter. I have a score, \nbut this one says it all. It is from Tim O'Neal of Lexington, MA.\n  I strongly urge your immediate action to support and to implement \nsupplemental federal funding of unemployment benefits. I have been \nunemployed for approximately 18 months, though I'm a Vietnam veteran \nwith a baccalaureate in chemistry, a recent JD, and more than 20 years \nof computer industry experience.\n  Here you have in the paper today, number of mass layoffs rose sharply \nin January. More than 2,400 employees across the country reported \nlaying off 50 or more workers in January, the third highest number of \nso-called mass layoffs since the Government began tracking them a \ndecade ago. That is in today's Washington Post. There is the need.\n  Senator Cantwell has the answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington a \nquestion.\n  I mentioned before that we gave the States about $8 billion a couple \nof years ago and that there is still over half of that money \nunexpended.\n  I wanted to know if the Senator from Washington was aware that her \nState was given about $167 million and so far the unexpended available \nbalance to the State of Washington is about $165 million out of $167 \nmillion that was given to your state.\n  I realize you have a higher unemployment rate than the rest of the \ncountry. I am kind of curious why your State has not spent the money we \ngave from the Federal Government?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am happy to answer the Senator's question. I would \nlike to do so on your time, since you have a little more time left than \nI do.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I will yield you 1 minute.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said, the States have that money \nobligated. They are committed to use it. The issue about the Federal \nprogram is that the Federal program is to lay on top of the State \nprogram.\n  The point about $15.4 billion being in the Federal trust fund is that \n$15.4 billion is continually added to by the American employer on \nbehalf of them and the employee and that fund grows. So the amount at \nthe Federal level can be dedicated to help with this Federal extension \nprogram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will take a minute while the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is getting ready to make a couple of other points.\n  At some point we have to have some fiscal discipline around the \nSenate. There are good arguments to make in support of extending \nunemployment benefits. There is always anecdotal evidence, stories of \nhardship cases. You can always find those. If we had a 1-percent \nunemployment rate, you could find people out there who were unemployed, \nand unemployed for a long period of time, no matter how low the \nunemployment rate.\n  The question is, by extending these benefits, do you create more of a \nproblem than you are solving? In other words, we know that about 50 \npercent of the people who are on unemployment will get a job in the \nlast 2 weeks before their benefits run out.\n  We have to have some discipline around here, put our fiscal house in \norder so that in the future we don't harm the economy, so that those \njobs will be there for those people who want employment. For every \nperson who wants to get a job and is willing to work, we need to have a \njob available.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, how is the time being counted under the \nquorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has been charged to the Senator who \nput the quorum call in.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither yields time, the time will be shortened on both sides of \nthe aisle equally.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is 4 minutes 29 seconds; 14 \nminutes 34 on the opposite side.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I will take a minute to report something \nto my colleagues. Hopefully this debate has stimulated some great \nthinking.\n  As I pointed out, we can look at the history of the two different \nBush administrations. The first Bush administration decided after \ncreating 379,000 new jobs that it was going to extend unemployment \nbenefits for 9 months--20 weeks for individuals who had already \nreceived State benefits could get a Federal benefit. This \nadministration, having a similar recession in challenging economic \ntimes, only created 112,000 jobs in January and decided there would be \nno benefit program and no weeks for employees.\n  I am not surprised to see the Washington Post headline ``Number of \nMass Layoffs Rose Sharply in January''--``2,400 employers let go 50 or \nmore people.'' That is the economic news facing the country.\n  This administration and the other side of the aisle are not promising \njobs or promising unemployment benefits. If someone wants to stand up \nand say we are going to have real job creation in 2004 and stand by the \nPresident's numbers, that is one thing. But if you are not promising \neither growth or economic assistance, then we have a serious problem.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, extending unemployment benefits would be \none of the most important and significant action Congress takes this \nyear. The economy and jobs are consistently the top areas of concern \nback home. The people that I speak to are far more interested in \nextending unemployment benefits than extending tax cuts to the wealthy. \nThe House recently acted in strong bipartisan fashion and passed an \namendment to extend unemployment insurance benefits to workers who have \nexhausted their state and federal benefits. Now it is time for the \nSenate to act as well.\n  According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the number \nof individuals exhausting their regular State unemployment benefits and \nnot qualifying for further benefits is higher than at any other time on \nrecord--about 90,000 workers a week. Painful history is being made. \nThis Senate cannot stay silent. In January alone, about 375,000 \nunemployed workers exhausted their regular state benefits and are not \neligible for any Federal unemployment aid. This is on top of the \n395,000 unemployed workers who exhausted their state benefits last \nDecember 2003.\n  Action is needed now. President Bush predicted that in 2003, we would \ncreate 1.7 million new jobs. Instead, the Nation lost 53,000 jobs. On \nMonday, President Bush said he thought the current unemployment numbers \nare ``good.'' Not where I'm from.\n  In earlier slow economic times, previous Congresses have acted. In \nthe 1974-75 recession, Congress provided 29 weeks of Federal \nunemployment benefits. In the 1981-82 recession, Congress provided 26 \nweeks of Federal unemployment benefits. In the 1990-91 recession, \nCongress provided 26 weeks of Federal unemployment benefits. In the \nprogram that expired on December 31, 2003, Congress provided 13 weeks \nof Federal unemployment benefits. That was below previous levels of \nFederal weeks but it was something.\n  The Federal extended benefits program implemented during the last \nrecession was not allowed to end until the economy had produced nearly \nthree\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\nmillion jobs above its pre-recession levels. The current program has \nended when there are 2.4 million fewer jobs than when the recession \nbegan.\n  The recently expired Federal unemployment program was closed to new \nenrollees last December 31, 2003. Workers currently receiving federal \nunemployment benefits will be phased out by the week of March 29, 2004. \nThe recently expired federal unemployment program not only provided an \nadded 13 weeks of Federally funded unemployment benefits for workers \nwho have run out of State benefits--it provided an additional 7 weeks \nin States with the highest unemployment. Renewing this program--and \nhopefully expanding it to more traditional levels--is crucial.\n  The Federal unemployment trust fund has over approximately $15 \nbillion in it--for this exact purpose--to allow unemployed workers who \ncontributed to the fund while working to now use it in their time of \nneed. The trust fund is the workers' money, made up from their \ncontributions. Keeping money in consumers' hands will help sustain the \neconomic recovery, too. Without it, more families will postpone medical \ncare, watch their savings dry up, and lose their homes.\n  The Bush administration has told us that a .1 percent national \nunemployment rate drop is proof positive that his tax cuts and other \neconomic initiatives are beginning to work. However, what President \nBush did not tell the American people that factory employment declined \nfor the 42th consecutive month by eliminating approximately 24,000 \nmanufacturing jobs. Despite last month's growth, America's \nmanufacturing core has shed an average of 53,000 jobs per month for the \nlast 12 months. If a recovery is going on, it is essentially a jobless \nrecovery. A jobless recovery is no recovery at all. The term is an \noxymoron.\n  The Labor Department statistics also reveal that five million \nAmericans work part time jobs because they cannot find full-time jobs. \nSince President Bush took office, about 3 million private sector jobs \nhave been lost and a total of almost 9 million Americans are now \nunemployed. We have also reached record levels of long-term \nunemployment.\n  Manufacturing jobs, which helped to build and sustain America's \nmiddle class, are disappearing. A total of 2.6 million manufacturing \njobs have been lost since January 2001, 11,000 last month alone. \nManufacturing jobs are good jobs that pay high wages, provide good \nhealth benefits and retirement security. We cannot afford to let these \ngood jobs leave our country or be lost.\n  Michigan has been particularly hard hit, losing approximately 225,000 \njobs since January 2001 of which 185,000 were manufacturing jobs. Our \nstates and our nation cannot sustain such losses. On Labor Day \nPresident Bush acknowledged that ``thousands'' of manufacturing jobs \nwere lost in recent years. He was off by about 2.6 million.\n  Let us pass an extension of unemployment benefits now. It is simply \nthe right thing to do. It is the traditional thing to do in times like \nthis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following chart be printed in the \nRecord, illustrating previous Congressional action.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             Cumulative Extension of UI\n                   Year                               Benefits\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1974-1975.................................  29 weeks.\n1981-1982.................................  26 weeks.\n1990-1991.................................  33 weeks (states with high\n                                             unemployment); 26 weeks\n                                             (all other states).\n2002......................................  26 weeks (states with high\n                                             unemployment); 13 weeks\n                                             (all other states).\nProposed legislation......................  20 weeks (states with high\n                                             unemployment); 13 weeks\n                                             (all other states).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell for offering a very \nimportant amendment on unemployment insurance. This amendment is \nabsolutely necessary because this administration has put this country \non the wrong economic path.\n  The economy is not improving, jobs are not being created, and workers \nand their families are suffering. Since this administration took \noffice, America has lost nearly 3 million jobs, including over two and \na half million in manufacturing. More than 9 million Americans are out \nof work. Unless we see an unbelievable turnaround in the next 8\\1/2\\ \nmonths, this administration will be the first since that of Herbert \nHoover to preside over an economy where more jobs are lost than \ncreated.\n  And what is the President's plan for economic recovery and job \ncreation? More tax cuts for the wealthy; eviscerating overtime pay for \nhard-working Americans; shipping service and manufacturing jobs \noverseas; all while raising our deficits to record levels.\n  It is not just the President alone who supports these policies--his \nadministration supports these and other irresponsible policies as well. \nThey have been forthcoming about their priorities and the priorities \nare out of step with working Americans. Therefore, no one should be \nsurprised when instead of receiving a paycheck they receive a pink \nslip. No one should be surprised when they lose their house because the \nadministration refuses to extend unemployment insurance benefits. No \none should be surprised when retirees see their social security \nbenefits slashed. No one should be surprised when companies move \noverseas or rely on workers overseas.\n  Also troubling, just yesterday the Fed Chairman encouraged Congress \nand the Administration to make cuts into future Social Security \npayments in order to bring down the deficit. So now this administration \nis telling men and women who have worked hard their whole lives and are \nrelying on Social Security to help them during their retirement years \nthat they are better off cutting Social Security benefits rather than \neliminate the tax cuts that go to the wealthy.\n  The chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors is \nquoted as saying, ``Outsourcing is just a new way of doing \ninternational trade. More things are tradable than were tradable in the \npast. And that's a good thing.'' American workers are losing their jobs \nand the Administration says it's a ``good thing''. That is an \nextraordinary statement.\n  In fact, not once in the past month has the President mentioned \nextending Federal unemployment benefits. What more must happen for this \nadministration to wake up and begin to take meaningful action?\n  The President talks about tremendous job growth this year. This \nprediction would only be met if job growth averaged more than 450,000 \nnew jobs each month, about four times the level of job growth in \nJanuary according to the Economic Policy Institute.\n  Americans are hurting and instead of taking steps to ensure job \ncreation, this administration continues to call for more tax cuts--tax \ncuts that will favor the most wealthy, but do nothing for the families \nthat are struggling today. These tax cuts will cost an additional $1 \ntrillion dollars over the next 10 years. What is even more alarming \nabout this is that this is coming at the worst possible time--right \nwhen the baby boomers begin to retire.\n  It is dumbfounding to me that just 3 years ago we were looking at the \nbiggest surplus in our Nation's history--an annual surplus of $236 \nbillion. We were actually having interesting discussions about the \neffects of paying down the debt too fast. If only we were debating that \ntoday. Instead, we are facing an unsustainable fiscal path with the \nlargest deficit in history--a deficit of $521 billion this year, a \ndeficit that if not tackled soon, will have dangerous consequences.\n  It has been projected that by 2009, if we continue on this \nirresponsible path, each person's share of the debt will total $35,283. \nThis will lead to a reduction in consumer demand, an increase in \ninterest rates, and it will make it enormously difficult for families \nacross this country to achieve financial security.\n  Today, the Labor Department reported that 350,000 people filed new \nclaims for State unemployment benefits last week. Just yesterday, the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that from late \nDecember, when the Federal unemployment benefits program expired, \nthrough the end of February, 760,000 jobless workers will have \nexhausted their regular unemployment benefits without receiving any \nadditional Federal aid. More than 4,700 jobless workers in Connecticut \nwill exhaust their benefits without qualifying for additional Federal \naid.\n  So that is why I wholeheartedly support extending Federal \nunemployment benefits right now. At the very least, we need to reach \nout to American workers and offer them a lifeline. This ought not be a \npartisan issue. I urge my colleagues to support this important \namendment.\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Cantwell's \namendment to reinstate the temporary emergency unemployment \ncompensation program.\n  The amendment will reinstate the 13-week Federal unemployment \ninsurance program, extend it for 6 months and ensure that ``high \nunemployment'' States continue to be covered.\n  Given all of the pressures that workers face today--outsourcing, a \npolitical environment that is hostile to organized labor, and a lack of \nhigh-paying jobs--there is no more pressing issue facing our nation's \nworkforce. And yet although Senate Democrats have asked more than a \ndozen times to unanimously pass the unemployment extension--each time \nSenate Republicans have said no. It is time that the Senate stop \nputting partisanship ahead of what nearly everyone agrees is smart \npolicy.\n  On February 4, the House of Representatives voted to reinstate \nunemployment benefits by a vote of 227 to 179, with 39 Republicans \ndefying their leadership and voting in favor of the benefits.\n  But until the Senate acts, hundreds of thousands of workers will be \nin the impossible position of trying to feed, clothe, and house their \nfamilies with no work and no benefits.\n  These are people who are persistently trying to re-enter the \nworkforce, and yet must contend with an economy that has less than one \njob opening for every three workers.\n  Today we can change this. This amendment provides crucial temporary \nassistance to those who have been hardest hit by the recent economic \ndownturn, and provides them a chance to support themselves and their \nfamilies while they look for work.\n  Although the amendment would not provide more than 13 weeks of \nadditional benefits to California, since my State's unemployment rate \nis 6.4 percent, not high enough to meet the 6.5 percent unemployment \nrate trigger in the amendment, it provides a meaningful extension for \nCalifornians by allowing unemployed Californians who were previously \nunqualified for unemployment benefits to collect 13 weeks of benefits \nas they look for new work.\n  As of today, 2.3 million Americans have lost their jobs since \nPresident Bush took office in January 2001.\n  In total, nearly 15 million Americans are out of work, including \ndiscouraged and underemployed workers.\n  Historically, job loss during a recession is about 50 percent \ntemporary and 50 percent permanent. Today, nearly 80 percent of the job \nloss is permanent. As a result, many of the unemployed will not return \nto work soon.\n  In his Annual Economic Report, President Bush said that the \noutsourcing of jobs was the inevitable byproduct of an improving \neconomy.\n  The White House says the ``benefits'' of exporting American jobs \n``eventually will outweigh the costs as Americans are able to buy \ncheaper goods and services and new jobs are created in growing sectors \nof the economy.''\n  How are people without jobs supposed to buy all these goods and \nservices? How do you keep a consumer economy going when you export all \nthe jobs?\n  The chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, the \noffice that wrote the report, says the ``government should try to salve \nthe short-term disruption by helping displaced workers obtain the \ntraining they need to enter new fields, such as health care.''\n  As Senator Daschle pointed out, that sounds like a cruel joke. The \nPresident's proposed budget for next year cuts money for Federal job \ntraining programs. And how do they know that the jobs they are training \nfor will not be the next jobs targeted to be shipped overseas? It \ncertainly will not be because the President is fighting to keep them \nhere.\n  It seems to me that the jury is in on the course we must take. I \nthink it is wrong to move to a protectionist stance by raising tariffs \nor promoting a weak U.S. currency. Historically, such strategies have \nled to more problems than they have solved.\n\n  U.S. companies should not be rewarded through our tax code for moving \njobs offshore and then be allowed to bring foreign earned profits back \ninto the U.S. at a tax rate that is a fraction of what they pay on \ntheir U.S. earned profits--just 5 percent, as compared to 38 percent in \nsome cases.\n  You and I pay more than five times that in personal income taxes.\n  We should be encouraging firms to keep jobs here by producing the \nbest trained, best educated workforce in the world.\n  And, we must help those who are displaced by outsourcing by providing \nemergency unemployment insurance.\n  This amendment provides just such a safety net for those who are \ntemporarily displaced by the economic changes that are engulfing us.\n  I ask President Bush to put his weight behind this effort to get \nunemployment benefits extended to those who have been looking for a job \nmore than 13 weeks.\n  If you are the President, you should be cheerleader number one for \nthe American worker. And you should be supporting workers when they \nfind themselves overcome by economic circumstances beyond their \ncontrol.\n  When the national economy was booming 4 years ago, California was \nparticularly blessed. California's economy grew at double-digit rates, \nand California became the fifth-largest economy in the world.\n  Billions of dollars of investment flowed into our State, and \nthousands of talented workers moved to California to take advantage of \nopportunities in Silicon Valley and other growth engines of the New \nEconomy. Now that picture is dramatically different.\n  After dropping to a decade-long low of 4.7 percent in December of \n2000, the unemployment rate in California is back up to 6.4 percent as \nof the end of 2003.\n  During this period of economic hardship, we have a duty to give \npeople the chance to get back onto their feet. This is an obligation \nthat we have met in the past, most recently when faced with an economic \ndownturn during the first Bush Administration. The Senate voted in 1991 \nto extend temporary unemployment insurance on five separate occasions. \nEach time such extensions were approved by overwhelming bipartisan \nmajorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and those Americans \nwho have fallen on hard times.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nOklahoma wish?\n  I yield to the Senator 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague and friend from \nNevada for his statement.\n  It is important that we create an environment to create jobs. We did \nthat last year. We didn't have bipartisan support, with the exception \nof Senator Miller. But we passed a jobs bill last year. We passed a \nbill to help grow the economy. Guess what. It is working.\n  We passed a bill last year that cut the tax on individuals about in \nhalf--15 percent. We passed a bill last year that cut the tax on \ncapital gains from 20 to 15 percent. We passed a bill that reduced \nmarginal rates; that took the rate from 27 percent, for example, and \nmade it 25 percent.\n  As a result of that, the economy is growing. With a rather stagnant \neconomy, the stock market a year ago was less than 8,000; that is, the \nDow Jones. It is over 10,500 today. The Nasdaq is over 50 percent. For \nthe last three quarters, we now have significant economic growth. \nDuring the last two quarters, one quarter was 8 percent and the other \nquarter was 4.4 percent.\n  We have had the most significant rapid expansion of job growth and \neconomic growth in the last several months. In the last 6 months, \naccording to the Wade survey, we have added about 300-some thousand \njobs. If you look at the household survey, it is a couple of million \njobs. The household survey includes self-employed, working at home on \ntheir computers, and so on.\n  Also, I know this amendment says let us continue this Federal \nprogram. We have a State program of 26 weeks. We had a temporary \nFederal program for an additional 13 weeks. Many tried to make that a \npermanent program and many tried to double it. They weren't successful \nin doubling it. Now they are trying to make it permanent.\n  They want to take a 13-week program that traditionally was temporary \nand usually phases out when the unemployment rate drops down. The \nunemployment rate has been dropping down. In\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\n2003, it was 6.3 percent, and it has declined almost every month to 5.6 \npercent. We have had significant improvement in the number of jobs, and \nthe unemployment rate is 5.6 percent.\n\n  But I notice that the proponents of the amendment said: What about \nthe early 1990s? In the early 1990s, we discontinued unemployment \ntemporary assistance when the rate was 6.4 percent. Today, it is 5.6 \npercent--a full percentage point less than it was several years ago \nwhen we had this temporary program.\n  Some people do not like the idea that it is a temporary program. They \nwould like it to be a permanent program.\n  It is not.\n  A couple of other things:\n  The number of unemployed is falling. If you go back to last year, it \ndropped from 9.2 million to 8.3 million--again, a significant \nimprovement by almost a million.\n  The number of Federal extended unemployment benefit claims has fallen \ndramatically as well. It is declining. That is because economic growth \nis going up. Yes. Sometimes there is a lag between economic growth and \nthe number of new jobs created because you have a lot of inefficiency \nin the system.\n  You have a more productive system. People are producing more with \nless, people are more efficient, and people are very productive. The \nproductivity index has been skyrocketing. We have had a very \nproductive, efficient workforce. So that is contributing.\n  I want to make these points. We spent about $30 million in the last \n36 months for this program. Again, some people would like it to \ncontinue forever. When you have a national unemployment rate of 5.6 \npercent--I don't know that we have had the Federal temporary \nunemployment assistance apply at a rate that low. I mention that.\n  I also might mention that almost half the States have less than 5 \npercent unemployment.\n  I used to be in manufacturing. When the unemployment rate was less \nthan 5 percent, it was almost full employment.\n  You are always going to have an unemployment rate. You are always \ngoing to have some people moving from job to job. With a dynamic \neconomy, people basically transfer from job to job. Their job may be \nphased out, but they are going to another job. That is part of high \ntech. That is part of modernizing industry. This is part of keeping up. \nThat is part of the dynamics of the marketplace which maybe a lot of \npeople would like to replace. People change jobs. That is not all that \nunhealthy. Sometimes that next job is a better job. Sometimes that next \njob might have great growth potential.\n  This program is a Federal temporary program, and it shouldn't be made \npermanent. To make it permanent will add $5.4 billion on to the deficit \nthis year. The deficit this year is already over $500 billion, \naccording to OMB. CBO is going to say it is less than that. I happen to \nagree with the Congressional Budget Office. If you have a deficit of \n400-plus or 500-plus billion dollars, let us not add on another 5.4 \nbillion on top of it for this year. Enough is enough.\n  How long are we going to continue the program? Do we continue this \nprogram if the unemployment rate gets below 5 percent? There has to be \na time when we say enough is enough.\n  The current program is in the process of phasing out. When we passed \nthe last bill, we avoided a cliff by December 30. If somebody was in \nthe 13-week program by the end of December, they got the full Federal \n13-week extension. We didn't have somebody automatically losing their \nbenefit after 1 week on the Federal program.\n  We also have a program for high unemployment States. That is a \npermanent Federal Extended Benefits program. Right now, Alaska \nqualifies for extended benefits. Nationally, they already get a 13-week \nFederal on top of the State 26 weeks. So Alaska already has 39 weeks. \nThat is three-fourths of the year.\n\n  We have to determine when is enough. I think we have crossed the \nline. There is a direct relationship--and the Senator from Nevada \nalluded to this--when we discontinue making extra payments, more people \nwill find work. There is more incentive to get out and find that job, \nto make sure you get a job, to make sure you can take care of your \nfamily.\n  Tradition has shown--and we saw this in the 1990s--when this program \nstopped in the 1990s, the unemployment rate declined by another \npercentage point because a lot of people went out and found jobs. In \nother words, the more you pay people not to work, the less inclined \nthey are to work. There is a direct relationship. So we should, at some \npoint, draw this program to a conclusion.\n  We are saying keep the 26 week State program, keep the permanent \nFederal program for high unemployment States, those States that are \nreally suffering through economic decline. But for the rest of the \ncountry, this is not called for. It is not affordable. It will be \nadding to the deficit. It is out of order as far as the budget is \nconcerned.\n  I will make a point of order on this but I withhold the vote until \nall time has expired on both sides. The pending amendment No. 2617 \noffered by the Senator from Washington increases direct spending in \nexcess of the allocation to the Judiciary Committee. Therefore, I raise \na point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of \nthe Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator the point of \norder is not timely. It can be made when all time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will reserve the point and see if additional Senators \nwish to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes five seconds.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I will take a couple of minutes.\n  I asked the Senator from Washington a question a little while ago. Of \nthe $8 billion we gave to the States, each of the States was allocated \na certain amount of money and the State of Washington was allocated \naround $167 million. Up to this point, the State of Washington--this is \nmoney on which the legislature in the State of Washington has to act; \nthey take that money and spend it on unemployment benefits--so far has \nonly used about $3.5 million of the $167 million.\n  Earlier, the Senator from Massachusetts was in the Senate discussing \nwith the Senator from Washington, saying it is difficult to access. \nMassachusetts has used every dollar they were given at that time--every \ndollar. So the Senator from Washington, the sponsor of this amendment, \nher own State has not used the money the Federal Government made \naccessible to them. It seems to me they ought to at least use that \nmoney to help the people in their own State.\n  Also, we had the Workforce Reinvestment Act that passed unanimously \nin the Senate. This act would help about 900,000 people in the United \nStates to be retrained for new jobs. The other side is filibustering \nthe appointment of conferees. We need to complete that bill if we want \nto help those people out of work get retrained so we can get them into \nother jobs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to make sure everyone is aware, when you talk \nabout the State has money it has not utilized, are you referring to $8 \nbillion Congress appropriated as part of the package in 2002?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. There was $8 billion and there is still $4 billion on \nthe table the States have not utilized for the unemployment \ncompensation?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. There is $4.3 billion that has not been used that we gave \nthe States.\n  Mr. NICKLES. My colleague mentioned the Workforce Investment Act that \npassed unanimously through the Senate and for whatever reasons our \ncolleagues on the minority side have not agreed to the appointment of \nconferees. This is a bill that would help train people to get jobs.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. They are filibustering the appointment of conferees.\n  For those people who do not know what that is, we have to appoint \npeople to be able to work out the differences between the House and the \nSenate so we can bring the final bills back to both before we take it \nto the White\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\nHouse. They are filibustering a bill that was passed unanimously.\n  Mr. NICKLES. A further clarification. I find it totally unacceptable \nand I cannot imagine not agreeing to appointing conferees on a bill \nthat will help get people trained to find jobs.\n  Also, I make an editorial comment. There is way too much of that \nhappening. Our colleagues should be advised, this not agreeing to \nappointment of conferees is a travesty on the Senate procedures. Maybe \npeople think it is commonplace. It is not commonplace in the tradition \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The Senator from Oklahoma is correct, it is a rarely used \ntactic from the past that has been used increasingly more. It is \nobstructing the work of the Senate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 3 minutes 7 \nseconds and the other side has 2 minutes 3 seconds.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes to try to explain \nfor my colleagues that while I have a great deal of respect for both my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle as they argue their points, \nobviously, we all hope for a better economy; we all hope things are \ngoing to get better.\n  I have some experience with these issues. I have been in the private \nsector myself and been part of an organization that was about job \ncreation, been part of an industry that has great hope for the future.\n  The question is whether we want to take stimulus out of the economy \nby denying people unemployment benefits.\n  I will not debate the chairman of the Budget Committee about his \nbudget point of order, but I will say most Americans know that they pay \ninto a trust fund, through their employers, and those funds are \navailable at the Federal level in a trust fund for this program. So you \ncan call it what you want as it relates to the Budget Act; these \ndollars are in a trust fund, paid into by employers on behalf of \nemployees, and those funds can only be used for this purpose.\n  We can decide we do not want to use them because we think the economy \nis getting better. That is what the other side seems to say. \nUnfortunately, that is not what the administration is willing to own up \nto. Basically, it will not promise job growth after issuing a report \nsaying there will be 2.6 million jobs. And the other side will not own \nup to the need for job growth or own up to helping unemployed workers.\n  The last Republican administration took the same problem and had a \ndifferent outcome. It stepped up its efforts. Even though unemployment \nwas dropping, even though the rate of unemployment was, month by month \nby month, dropping, and even though employment or new job creation was \nhappening, the first Bush administration said, we believe 9 more months \nof unemployment benefits is needed.\n  I am only asking for 6 months today. I ask my colleagues to take that \ninto consideration when they are thinking about all the economic \nassistance we could be giving. You want to say the tax cut is working. \nGreat. Then ask the President to stick by his economic plan of 2.6 \nmillion jobs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am finding out more about this amendment, and the more \nI find out, the less I like it. The sponsor of the amendment has \nwritten it in a way that her State receives extra benefits that most \nStates do not. So this is not a simple extension. It is a simple \nextension, except a few States will get additional high unemployment \nassistance.\n  I am bewildered. I came to the floor and thought it was a simple \nextension. It is not. It rewrites the definition of high unemployment. \nIt changes the criteria and benefits for the State of Washington, and a \nprobably one or two other States. The State of Washington has money on \nthe table that we have already appropriated that the State legislature \nhas not used, as the Senator from Nevada alluded to.\n  One final note. We discontinued the Federal temporary assistance \nprogram in the early 1990s when the unemployment rate was at 6.4 \npercent. The unemployment rate today is 5.6 percent. It is much lower. \nIt is time to say, let's go back to the program that has permanent \nextended benefits only for high-unemployment States, not for every \nState.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will wrap up my remarks. I have a couple \ncomments.\n  First of all, the economy is improving now, it is not just going to \nimprove in the future. We are in the middle of a recovery. We just had \nthe strongest quarter of GDP growth in 20 years. Jobs are being \nproduced.\n  Payroll versus household--I do not know how many times we have to say \nit, but self-employed people count. They count in the household survey. \nOver 2 million jobs have been produced within the last year. When you \ncount the households and all those self-employed people, those jobs \nshould count in what we are talking about here.\n  If somebody lost their job and then started their own company, that \nshould count as a job. And that is what a lot of people have done. We \nknow incredible success stories of when people have lost their jobs and \nthen started their own companies.\n  Mr. President, it is time to end this continued unemployment benefit \nextension, this billion-dollar-a-month program and encourage people to \ngo to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Nevada that \nall his time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington has 34 seconds.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I think the point is clear; and that is, \nthis side of the aisle believes the American workers, who have lost \ntheir jobs through no fault of their own, should be given assistance \nuntil job creation is on the upswing in America so we can move further \nalong this path and so that stimulus is still in the economy.\n  That has been the result in the past two administrations. The last \nBush administration believed in this, and now, somehow, we want to \nforget that economic success.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment No. 2617 offered by the \nSenator from Washington increases direct spending in excess of the \nallocation to the Judiciary Committee. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nagreement, I now ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set \naside, and we will now move to the issue on voting rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2626\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, shortly the majority leader will send \nan amendment to the desk to provide for a permanent extension of the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965. This was one of the truly landmark pieces of \nlegislation in American history.\n  Last Congress, Senator Dodd and I spearheaded, along with Senator \nBond, what became a 2-year quest to reform the way elections are \nconducted in this country. Senator Dodd was correct in saying the \nelection reform legislation we passed was the most important civil \nrights bill of this century, the 21st century.\n  With the support of 92 Members of this Chamber, we were successful in \nprotecting the rights of all Americans--all Americans--to cast a vote \nand have it counted, but to do so only once. Gone will be the days of \ndogs and dead people registering and voting, and so, too, will be the \ndays of faulty equipment and being turned away at the\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\npolls. Now the majority leader shortly will offer an amendment which \nmakes permanent the most important civil rights bill of the previous \ncentury, the 20th century.\n  If I may, let me recall a personal experience I had during that \nperiod in the 1960s that is indelibly imprinted on my mind. The day was \nAugust 28, 1963. It was the day Martin Luther King Jr. made that ``I \nHave A Dream'' speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The Mall \nwas crowded with folks from here at the Capitol all the way down to the \nLincoln Memorial. And in that crowd I found myself. I was there the day \nof the March on Washington and the day of the ``I Have A Dream'' \nspeech. Unfortunately, I could not hear it because I was so far down \nthe Mall, and there were so many people I did not hear the speech. But \nyou had the sense, if you were in the crowd that day, and sympathetic \nwith the effort to get voting rights, public accommodations, and fair \nhousing, that you were in the presence of one of those seminal moments \nin American history.\n  Of course, we now all reflect on that day, August 28, 1963, with \ngreat reverence, and Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speech is \nremembered as one of the great speeches in American history, delivered \nthat day on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, August 28, 1963. I will \nalways remember that I had an opportunity to be a part of that most \nimportant day.\n  A couple years after that, we passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \nThere were three things that march was about: public accommodation, \npassed in 1964; voting rights, which passed in 1965; and fair housing, \n1968. But voting, of course, is the most important in a democracy.\n  Over the years, the Voting Rights Act has successfully addressed \ntruly egregious problems which existed at that time. Unfortunately, \nthough, the pattern of the Voting Rights Act is to not make it \npermanent and, once again, it is set to expire in 2007.\n  The protections in the Voting Rights Act are, frankly, too important \nto provide on only a temporary basis, and that is the reason the \nmajority leader will be offering shortly his amendment to make the \nVoting Rights Act permanent.\n  The majority leader, in fact, just within the last couple of weeks \norganized a civil rights pilgrimage which was attended by a number of \nour colleagues on both sides of the aisle. My wife Elaine and I went to \npart of this 3-day pilgrimage that began in Alabama and ended in \nNashville, with the dedication of the Civil Rights Room of the \nNashville Public Library, which is replete with photographs of the \nlunch counter sit-ins in Nashville in the 1960s, which led to the \npeaceful integration of Nashville during that period.\n  This was a meaningful experience for all of us who participated, at \nthe majority leader's request, in this pilgrimage. Congressman John \nLewis was along, one of the great heroes of the civil rights movement. \nWe talked about August 28, 1963. He got to speak. He was the youngest \nspeaker on the podium that day. Young John Lewis was there and thrilled \nto have an opportunity to speak, at age 23 or 22, on the same day and \nfrom the same podium as Rev. Martin Luther King.\n  I can think of no better way to memorialize our commitment to a free \nand equal society than the adoption of the Frist amendment. This \namendment makes the preclearance and bilingual requirements permanent, \nproviding a clear message from the Senate that we stand committed to \nnot only the protection of civil rights but also to the preservation of \nthose rights as well.\n  Some may suggest this action is premature. But how can the law of the \nland for 39 years be premature? Further, the language of the amendment \nis abundantly clear: ``the provisions of this section shall not \nexpire.'' Let me repeat, in the amendment it says: ``the provisions of \nthis section shall not expire.''\n  I cannot think of any reason why anyone on either side of the aisle \nwould oppose the protection of the franchise of all Americans. If so, \nwe potentially jeopardize the fundamental tenet of our representative \ndemocracy.\n  In conclusion, I commend the majority leader for this amendment. It \nis an excellent amendment. This is a step we should have taken years \nago. I commend him for offering the amendment today. I hope it will be \nadopted by the Senate on an overwhelming bipartisan basis.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for himself and Mr. \n     McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered 2626.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \n                               permanent)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MAKING THE PROVISIONS OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF \n                   1965 PERMANENT.\n\n       (a) Permanency of Preclearance Requirements.--Section \n     4(a)(8) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. \n     1973b(a)(8)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(8) The provisions of this section shall not expire.''.\n       (b) Permanency of Bilingual Election Requirements.--Section \n     203(b)(1) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973aa-\n     1a(b)(1)) is amended by striking ``Before August 6, 2007, no \n     covered State'' and insert ``No covered State''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is the \namendment my distinguished colleague from Kentucky spoke to a few \nmoments ago. I introduce this on behalf of the Senator from Kentucky \nand myself in response, in part, to the expiration of a portion of the \nVoting Rights Act. I will speak to the details of it shortly.\n  By way of introduction, 2 weeks ago, Congressman John Lewis and I \nparticipated in a trip to sites in Alabama and in Tennessee that \nreflected important times and places in those States as they pertained \nto civil rights and the movement of nonviolence and the struggle for \nvoting rights. We had a wonderful, powerful trip crossing Selma's \nEdmund Pettus Bridge where almost 40 years ago Congressman Lewis had \nled marchers in the name of voting rights for all.\n  The stories were powerful. They endured the beating without striking \nback, and they faced the hatred with the power of compassion and love.\n  Their courage captured a victory that has been to the benefit of \nmillions today, not just for African Americans but for others all over \nthis country. I was deeply moved by their courage and their sacrifice \nat the time, and I am grateful for their service.\n  This year, the 39th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act occurs. That \nact enshrined fair voting practices for all Americans. The act \nreaffirms the 15th amendment to the Constitution and prohibits \nindividuals and governments from sabotaging the ability of African-\nAmerican citizens to vote.\n  Dorothy Cotton, one of the participants with Congressman Lewis and I, \nwho ran the Citizenship Education Project of the Southern Christian \nLeadership Council with Andrew Young, remarked that she remembers when \nvoting registration offices were open only when most African Americans \nwere working during that time of day. Rev. Bernard Lafayette, who was \nalso with us, another great civil rights leader, remembers routine \nharassment at the registration office, such as being required to \ninterpret obscure sections of the U.S. Constitution or--and his words \nare so vivid in my mind--being required to give the number of bubbles \nin a bar of soap.\n  Clearly this was wrong. It was ugly, and it was unconstitutional. \nThat is why the Congress moved to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \nto once and for all protect the right of every American to vote.\n  The Voting Rights Act also includes section 4, and it will be up for \nreauthorization in 2007. President Reagan reauthorized it for 25 years \nin 1982. Section 4 is the section that contains the\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\ntemporary preclearance provision that applies to certain States: \nAlabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, \nVirginia, and parts of Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, and North \nCarolina. These States must submit any voting changes to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice for preclearance and, if the Department of \nJustice concludes that the change weakens the voting strength of \nminority voters, it can refuse to approve the change.\n  Section 4 provides an important measure of assurance that the full \nforce of the U.S. Government stands behind voting rights for all \nAmericans. That is why Senator McConnell and I today are offering an \namendment to permanently reauthorize section 4 of the Voting Rights \nAct. With or without section 4, every American has the right to vote. \nThat will never change. However, Senator McConnell and I want to make \nclear that America will never renege on the hard-fought gains of the \ncivil rights movement. We don't want anyone to fear that their right to \nvote will ever be taken away. Those shameful days are over.\n  Some of the heroes of the civil rights movement have endorsed this \nparticular amendment. Congressman John Lewis supports it.\n  Rev. Bernard Lafayette, who joined Congressman Lewis and I--actually \nBernard Lafayette went with us on our pilgrimage last week, but also he \nand John Lewis were together at that fateful time in 1965 for the march \nin Selma. His words were this amendment would be an ``important \npsychological and political victory for democracy.''\n  It is my fervent hope that one day soon racism and discrimination \nwill be totally a thing of the past. Until that time, it is critical \nthat the Justice Department retain this preclearance authority to \nreview changes to State voting requirements, not only to allay fears \nthat might arise but also to enshrine our progress to date.\n  I do hope all of my colleagues will join me in ensuring the Federal \nGovernment will do all it can to protect the right to vote for all \nAmericans. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \nsupport of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I commend our majority leader for his strong statement and commitment \nof ensuring that the Voting Rights Act, which is of fundamental and key \nimportance in terms of what American democracy is all about, is \nsomething that he wants to see and will extend it and that he is fully \ncommitted to working in every possible way to make that commitment come \ntrue. I also commend my friend and colleague from Kentucky, Senator \nMcConnell, for expressing similar sentiments. But this is not the best \nway to achieve that goal.\n  What is important to come out of this debate is that the Senate, as \nan institution, is firmly committed, as we hear from the majority \nleader and from the leadership from that side, to making sure we \ncontinue the Voting Rights Act. The real question is, How is the best \nway to make sure that is possible?\n  I was here in 1964 when we addressed the public accommodations laws \nand offered the amendment to eliminate the poll tax, and it was \ndefeated. I was here in 1965. I am very familiar with the weeks we \nspent on that bill to actually get the Voting Rights Act.\n  I was on the Judiciary Committee in 1982 and listened to the \nRepublican Attorney General William French Smith--I can remember it \nalmost as if it were yesterday--because the extension of the Voting \nRights Act had been offered by myself and my wonderful friend and a \ngreat Senator, a Republican Senator, Senator Mathias. We had 32 votes. \nThe Reagan administration was opposed to extending the Voting Rights \nAct. That is the history.\n  Until the House of Representatives passed the Voting Rights Act \noverwhelmingly, we were unable to get to 50 votes and get a majority of \nthe Judiciary Committee to vote to pass that out. It was only in the \nfinal hours actually that we were able to accept what was the Dole \namendment.\n  Those who are interested in looking at the history, we were able to \nget up to more than a veto-proof majority, and President Reagan signed \nthe bill.\n  This is not an issue to be lightly dealt with. This right to vote is \na core issue in our country. We enshrined slavery into the \nConstitution. We fought a civil war to free ourselves from the pains of \ndiscrimination. It was Dr. King, quite frankly, who awakened the \nconscience of the Nation and the Nation came together and we saw the \ngreat progress that was made in the early 1960s to move us ahead with \nvoting rights and public accommodations. Then, in 1968, we passed the \nHousing Act which really did not do a great deal in housing until \nactually the 1988 act.\n  This has been a long march, as the Senators have pointed out. We have \nto ask ourselves whether now is the time to take this action.\n  Let me read into the Record the letter I have received from the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights. I read it at this time:\n\n       On behalf of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the \n     Nation's oldest, largest, and most diverse civil and human \n     rights coalition, we write to express our opposition to the \n     amendment being offered by Majority Leader Frist to the \n     protection of the Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, S. 1805, to \n     make the preclearance of the minority language provisions of \n     the Voting Rights Act permanent.\n       The Voting Rights Act is one of the most important civil \n     rights statutes ever enacted by Congress. This law, which \n     enforces the 15th amendment, has been successful in removing \n     direct and indirect barriers to voting for African Americans, \n     Asian Americans, Latino Americans, and Native Americans. And \n     since its passage, the act has survived narrow \n     interpretations by the United States Supreme Court only to be \n     amended by Congress to restore its original strength. \n     Nevertheless, voting disenfranchisement still exists today.\n       As you know, the VRA's preclearance and minority language \n     provisions are scheduled for reauthorization in 2007. We in \n     the civil rights community plan to actively engage in the \n     process, including working to establish a strong legislative \n     record in support of reauthorization.\n\n  I underline, Mr. President, the language that says ``establish a \nstrong legislative record in support of reauthorization.'' That is a \nkey phrase in terms of this letter and for reasons to which I will \nrefer in a moment.\n\n       Nevertheless, we oppose the Frist amendment because it is \n     premature. Critical analysis of issues surrounding \n     preclearance of minority language provisions of the Voting \n     Rights Act have not yet been fully examined and analyzed \n     carefully to reflect the current status of our laws, court \n     decisions, enforcement actions, and society.\n       The Supreme Court has made it clear in recent years that it \n     will require Congress to establish a detailed record through \n     hearings and legislative findings in order to ensure that \n     provisions such as these survive constitutional scrutiny.\n       Therefore, while we plan to strongly support the \n     reauthorization of these important provisions, we urge you to \n     vote no on the Frist amendment.\n\n  The reasons for this urging are the relevant parts of this letter \nwhich have strong justification, given holdings by the Supreme Court on \nother actions that the Congress has taken in trying to expand rights \nand liberties for American citizens, and which have been struck down.\n  Time in and time out and time and again the courts have referred to \nthe legislative record that has been made on the Voting Rights Act. I \nremember it. I was a member of the Judiciary Committee. I remember the \ndays and months of hearings and testimony, an extraordinary record was \nmade, unparalleled in recent history, justifying that act, respected by \nthe Supreme Court. And we are going to say that last night at 11 \no'clock the Senate agreed to take up an amendment with a 1-hour time \nlimitation that is going to extend this, and the possibility of the \nSupreme Court looking back, when it is challenged--as we know it will \nbe challenged--at the legislative history, the background, and they \nwill find we had 1 hour of debate on the floor of the Senate and put at \nrisk the Voting Rights Act.\n  There are some--not the Senator from Tennessee, the majority leader, \nor the Senator from Kentucky, but there are those who want to see this \nundermined. We know that. We have to be guarded against that \npossibility. Voting rights are too important to risk it.\n  Those families, those individuals, those Americans who are concerned \nabout the issue of voting rights and in so many instances have been \ndenied the right to vote and whose families have been denied the right \nto vote and have suffered, and in some instances have friends and \nfamily members who lost their lives in the struggle for civil\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\nrights, say to us, let us do what we believe is necessary to do. Let us \nnot have an abbreviated legislative process.\n  Let us go to what the Supreme Court has recognized as being the way \nto ensure we will have the kind of protection for this most basic and \nfundamental right, and that is do it through the legislative process, \nthrough the hearings, through the testimony, through the evidence that \nwill be collected and debated on the Senate floor. That is effectively \nwhat is being said by the leadership conference.\n  That is why I am instructed, under more careful consideration, that \nCongressman Lewis, having read this and consulted with lawyers and \nconstitutional authorities this afternoon, is opposed to this \namendment.\n  As I say, I am sure the majority leader understands the Supreme Court \ndecisions that say how important it is to require a substantive record \nis made, and we do not have that record on the basis of an hour's \ndebate this afternoon.\n  The recent experience in the courts, in the Supreme Court decision of \nNevada Department of Human Resources v. Gibbs, and City of Burns v. \nFlorida, show the Court will require a substantial legislative record \nwhen reviewing any future challenge to the provisions made permanent by \nthis record. That is the holding of the Supreme Court, that they will \nrequire a substantial legislative record.\n  We do not have a substantial legislative record. That is not a part \nof this debate. As a result, the Senate should take every necessary \nstep to develop that substantial record that will ensure any amendment \nwill withstand the constitutional scrutiny.\n  I want to give assurances to the majority leader and my friend from \nKentucky that we on the Judiciary Committee will work eagerly with the \nleadership on the other side to make sure when we come to grips with \nthis issue, when we deal with the issue on the Senate floor and we have \nthe full kind of debate and discussion, it will have the kind of \nbackground, experience, record, testimony, and extensive, exhaustive \nhistorical context so it will meet any possible challenge before the \nSupreme Court.\n  We do not have that. According to constitutional authority, we are \nrisking not only the provisions we are talking about but the underlying \nlegislation. That is a risk this Senator is not prepared to support. So \nI respect and admire the motives that have inspired our colleagues and \nfriends to offer this amendment, but I have to indicate virtually the \nunanimous recommendation of those who have benefited from the Voting \nRights Act are in strong opposition to this amendment and have \ninstructed me to make their positions clear to the membership of the \nSenate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Might I inquire how much time is remaining on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 16 minutes and the \nSenator from Massachusetts has about 16 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Might I inquire of the Senator from Massachusetts if he \nhas anyone further who wishes to speak in opposition to the Frist \namendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First, I will make a few comments. I have been notified \nI have one other colleague who will be on his way in the next 4 or 5 \nminutes. If not, we will be glad to go on.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor. Does the \nSenator yield the floor?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho yields the floor.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we have to understand, as I think all of us do, that \nobviously the underlying legislation is important. I have spoken on \nthis issue. I take strong exception to what is special interest \nlegislation and singling out a particular industry from liability. That \nis important. The provisions that have been debated earlier this \nafternoon on the concealable weapons are very important as well in \nterms of safety and security. We debated the armor-piercing bullet. \nThat is important in terms of lives and family. When we are talking now \nabout the right to vote and ensuring the right to vote, this reaches \nthe core value of our society and what this Nation is all about.\n  We know the history of our Nation. I mentioned very briefly slavery \nwas enshrined in the Constitution. We fought a civil war in order to \nfree ourselves from it. But it was only in the early 1960s that we \nbegan to make the real progress. The most important of all of those \nkinds of civil rights was the right to vote and the extension of that \nright and the elimination of the poll tax, the literacy tests, all of \nthe other kinds of tests that were put up there. This country has been \nreminded once again about the importance of the right to vote in the \nrecent Presidential elections where we saw this enormous fiasco that \ntook place in the State of Florida, the future of this country \nultimately being decided in the Supreme Court of the United States \nrather than the hands of the American people.\n  So the American people understand the importance. It is almost like a \nsacred right. If we were to talk about sacred rights in terms of what \nthis society and country is about, it is about the right to vote. \nNothing else is possible unless we have the right to vote, guaranteed \nto all of those citizens in our country who are eligible to have that \nright. It is fundamental to everything else this society is about.\n  We know it is being challenged and we know there are many who would \nset it aside. We have seen that in recent times. We have seen the \nthreat to the right to vote. Even after we understand some of the \ndifficulties we had in the last Presidential election, we have seen the \ndifficulty we have had in this body and around the States to make sure \nwe were not going to have that problem again and again. We have not \nsolved the problems we had, but we have to preserve it and protect it \nand we cannot tamper with this very important and significant \nresponsibility we have.\n  As I said before, I eagerly look forward to working with our two \ncolleagues, who have spoken eloquently about their strong commitment, \nin ensuring that we are going to have an extension of the Voting Rights \nAct. I look forward to working with them in the Judiciary Committee. I \nknow our two colleagues are not members of the Judiciary Committee, but \nwe have enormous respect for them and their strong support will make an \nincredible difference in ensuring we will get the extension, we will \nbuild the record, and we will ensure the next time we pass this, we \nwill have the kind of record that will be sustained in this Supreme \nCourt and any future Supreme Court.\n  We do not want to put that at risk now. We do not want that. That is \nnot a wise decision. The people who have suffered too long and been \ndenied that right to vote believe very strongly that to be the case. I \nthink we should observe their very serious concerns, follow those, and \nwork to build the kind of record that will survive any constitutional \nscrutiny and ensure that rather with the existing protections we have, \nwe are going to create even greater ones.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator from Idaho wishes to yield back his time, \nwe can do so.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator. I believe we have one of our \ncolleagues still yet to come so we will wait for him for a short time. \nTime is running on this amendment.\n  How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes 7 seconds. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has 11 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate that. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I just received word on what we are now \ndebating. I make a parliamentary inquiry.\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\nAm I correct that this is a Frist amendment to this bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The majority leader offered \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. The Frist amendment is amending the Voting Rights Act; is \nthat correct? It would make the preclearance and minority language \nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act permanent; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair very much for that.\n  First let me express my gratitude to the majority leader for having a \nstrong interest in this. As someone who for the last several years, \nsince the election of 2000, has spent a great deal of time on the \nconduct of Federal elections, I worked closely with Mitch McConnell and \nKit Bond of Missouri and Congressman Bob Ney of Ohio, who chairs the \nHouse committee and has jurisdiction over Federal elections over in the \nother Chamber, along with a number of other people. There were a lot of \npeople involved in this, but we were able to put together the HAVA Act, \nthe Help America Vote Act. It is in the view of many the first civil \nrights legislation of the 21st century. Some have called it the most \nsignificant legislation affecting the right to vote since the Voting \nRights Act of 1965.\n  Certainly, one of the issues we looked at and discussed rather \nbriefly was the issue of the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act \nwhen it comes to language minorities. But when we were dealing with \nthat bill, we did not vote to make permanent those provisions. And for \ngood reason.\n  This is a very important part of the Voting Rights Act, these \nlanguage minority and preclearance provisions. It is hardly the place, \nI suggest, with all due respect to those who are interested in this, as \na floor amendment to any bill here. We are on a bill addressing the \nissue of guns, and rather suddenly we are asked to permanently change \none of the most profoundly important laws in our nation.\n  Just to cite one example to my colleagues, if we adopt this today--\nthere is a group very much in the news at this very hour. And that is \nthe people of Haiti. Now, there is a substantial population in the \nState of Florida of people who are formerly from Haiti, Haitian \nAmericans. If this language is adopted, some have raised concerns that \nit could have the effect of making it more difficult for Americans of \nHaitian background, who do not speak English as a first language, to \nobtain the voting information and technologies to which they might \notherwise be entitled and which they might require in order to cast a \nballot. The same concern has been raised about Americans of other \nbackgrounds, as well, for whom English is not a first language.\n  I don't think there is a single Member in this Chamber who wants to \nvote today on a provision that could make it more difficult, if not \nimpossible, for thousands if not tens of thousands of citizens, in \neffect, to vote. But we are told by those who deal in this issue every \nday that this amendment could have that effect. If we adopt this \namendment in an hour's debate here, rather than after the kind of \nthoughtful analysis that should go into this, it could actually result \nin discrimination against Americans who clearly are language \nminorities. I am confident that none of us wants to see that happen.\n  This is hardly the time, place, and manner to make such a profound \nchange in law. Frankly, I don't have a prepared speech. I was just \nlistening to this debate in my office, and having worked on this issue, \nI know how much time you take to get this right. To come over and have \nan amendment adopted that could permanently exclude a substantial part \nof our citizenry from the language minority provisions, I don't think \nwe want to be on record on that today.\n  These provisions of the Voting Rights Act, by the way, doesn't expire \nuntil the year 2007. We have 3 years. I think it is always wise to get \nsomething done when you can get it done. But the normal way you proceed \nis to sit down, work these things out, listen to people, and examine \nwhether or not certain groups qualify or should qualify. But I don't \nthink anyone would exclude from the Voting Rights Act potentially \ncountless people who have come to this country for reasons with which \nwe are all unfortunately too familiar, and who clearly qualify as \nlanguage minorities.\n  I, for one, cannot vote for this. I wouldn't want to be on record \nsupporting this. I would like to work with the majority leader and \nothers who would like to figure out how to get this done. I will do it \nthis year.\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has stated as much \nthemselves in a letter they sent to the majority leader. It was dated \ntoday, to give you some idea of how fast this is moving. They say in \ntheir concluding paragraph:\n\n       While we plan to strongly support the reauthorization of \n     these important provisions, we urge you to vote no on the \n     Frist amendment. The reasons are that this is a complicated \n     process that takes some time to make sure you are including \n     those who deserve to be included and excluding those who may \n     no longer or should not be included under the language \n     minority provisions.\n\n  They believe it is premature. Their critical analysis of the issues \nsurrounding the preclearance and minority language provisions has not \nbeen fully examined and analyzed. I hope no one would suggest \notherwise. A floor amendment is hardly the place.\n  If you hold a vote and exclude multiple language minority groups \nbecause you've made this law permanent after a one-hour debate, I would \nthink you would ask your leadership to pause a minute and analyze \nwhether this is correct. If it is correct, should we amend this \nlanguage? Should we include them? If not, why not? Shouldn't there be a \nmore thoughtful way to proceed on a matter of this import?\n  There is no other right, in my view, that is as important as the \nright to vote. It is a right upon which all other rights depend. It is \nthe central ingredient for our democracy--the right of people to vote.\n  We have understood over the years that there are those who come to \nour shores and become wonderful Americans who have language barriers. \nIf those people are excluded from the process of engaging in electing \nFederal officials and electing the leadership of this country, then we \nare not fulfilling our obligation historically to see to it that this \nbasic, fundamental right is being protected.\n  I am very much interested in seeing us make permanent, if we can, \nthese language minority and preclearance provisions of the Voting \nRights Act. I would like to do it in a way that is far more \ndeliberative than a 1-hour debate on the floor of the Senate dealing \nwith a gun manufacturer bill. This is not the way we ought to be doing \nbusiness on something as fundamental as the right to vote.\n  I prefer not to vote no on this. I would prefer this amendment be \nwithdrawn and then resubmit it under proper circumstances so we can \nhave the opportunity to do the analysis necessary to arrive at right \nconclusions.\n  I am the only one speaking about this at this particular moment.\n  I don't know what the time frame is. Is there a limited time of \ndebate? I make an inquiry of the Chair.\n  Are we going to vote on this matter in a few minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 3 minutes 16 seconds \nremaining. The Senator from Idaho has 12 minutes 52 seconds remaining. \nThe Senate is operating under a unanimous consent agreement according \nto which 1 hour was allowed for debate of this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Do I understand that at the conclusion of roughly 15 or 16 \nminutes we will then vote on amending major provisions of the Voting \nRights Act?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. After voting on the Cantwell amendment, under \nthe previous order, the Senate will vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I urge colleagues to think twice about this. \nIt is the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that we are talking about. We are \ntalking about amending this act permanently and possibly excluding \nmajor ethnic groups in this country permanently. Please. This issue \nrequires more thought than it can be given here. This is not the way to \ngo about changing one of the most important laws ever enacted in our \ngreat country. We should not in effect tell our colleagues that they \nhave 15 minutes to decide on whether or not potentially millions of \nHaitians, Africans, Asians, Hispanics,\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\nand Europeans would be permanently excluded from key protections of the \nVoting Rights Act when we have 3 more years to make that decision.\n  To do this on an amendment to a gun manufacturer bill is stunning to \nme. Why would we take something as critical and important as the Voting \nRights Act and throw it on the table without further consideration and \nthought?\n  I urge my colleagues in the time they have to please talk to the \nmajority leader and see if we can't pull this back by unanimous consent \nand let those of us who spend time on these issues sit and work on \nthis. This is no way to be dealing with millions of people in our \ncountry who deserve the right to vote and to be protected properly \nunder language minority and preclearance provisions.\n  I make that plea to my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think all of us prefer when we deal with \ncertain subjects that all amendments to the underlying subject be \ngermane. That isn't the way the Senate works. Certainly my colleague \nfrom Connecticut knows there are other amendments being discussed today \nthat by no stretch of the imagination are germane.\n  But this is a critical issue. It is timely. It is necessary. We speak \nto it. That is why the majority leader brought it to the floor. It is \ncritical to our country that we continue to show our openness as we \nreach out and become inclusive with all of those who as citizens have \nthe right to participate in the electoral process. That is exactly what \nwe are about.\n  We have one colleague who still wishes to speak. He will be here in \nmoments.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes 57 seconds, and \ncounting.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will put us into a quorum call for a few \nmoments anticipating his arrival.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join in support of this important \namendment for permanent extension of the Voting Rights Act. Voting is \nfundamental in our democracy. It has yielded enormous returns.\n  We know of the historical discrimination against minorities, against \nAfrican Americans.\n  The essence of a democracy is a free electorate. Voting rights are \nvery important. It ought to be on our books on a permanent basis.\n  I think it is so fundamental that it doesn't take long to express the \nunderlying reasons for its importance and the fundamental reason why it \nshould be in existence of the law on a permanent basis.\n  I support this amendment.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 51 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from the \nState of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber in a hurry because \nit has come to my attention that this amendment, which is perhaps in a \ntechnical sense not germane to the main bill in the Senate--but I \nunderstand there is an agreement that it could be considered and would \nnot be out of order--but my concern is this: The Voting Rights Act of \n1965 was an important landmark in the Nation's history. It was passed \nby the Congress in an attempt to make sure that no person, regardless \nof race, regardless of color, was denied their right, their fundamental \nright to vote. This was long overdue, very important, and certainly a \nresult to which we all continue to aspire.\n  Perhaps Members of the Senate who have, like me, not had a chance to \nstudy this amendment in great detail, or perhaps what the ramifications \nof this amendment are, might be interested to know a few facts; that \nis, that the Voting Rights Act does not apply to all the States in the \nNation. In other words, we are being asked to extend the Voting Rights \nAct only as it applies to a handful of primarily Southern States.\n  In 1965, perhaps it made sense to apply the Voting Rights Act to just \na handful of States that historically and, yes, tragically, had a \nhistory of denying minorities their rights to be American citizens and \nenjoy the franchise unimpeded by those who would deny them that right. \nBut this is not 1965. This is the year 2004.\n  If, indeed, this presumption, in essence, that says in order to \nchange the way in which you conduct your elections, before you \nredistrict your State and electoral districts, you must seek permission \nfrom the Department of Justice, if indeed, that is still good policy \nfor the States that are covered by the Voting Rights Act, I submit it \nis good policy for the Nation as a whole. I doubt in all seriousness \nthat many Members of this body understand what they are being asked to \ndo, which is to extend this act only to a handful of States.\n  As I say, if it is good policy, I believe it should be extended to \nthe entire Nation. Obviously, we have come a long way in this country \nsince 1965. Some may argue that some States should have a presumption \nof guilt while others should have a presumption of innocence. But, \nindeed, I believe there ought to be a uniform policy that applies to \nthe entire Nation when we are talking about something as important as \nvoting rights and when we are talking about something as important as \nprotecting the voting rights of all Americans, including minorities who \nhave, in fact, suffered discrimination in the past.\n  I raise the question for my colleagues, those who are listening, to \nask whether we truly understand what the implications are of this \namendment and how it would affect the entire country, and how in \npractice, if I understand the amendment correctly, it would only apply \nto a handful of States. There is an agreement under which second-degree \namendments are out of order, or I would offer an amendment to apply to \nthe entire Nation, if that were permitted. But under this arrangement, \nunder this agreement, I can merely ask the question for my colleagues \nto ponder if this policy should apply nationwide and not just to a \nhandful of States, including my State of Texas.\n\n  I yield back any remaining time to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Texas.\n  I inquire as to the time remaining on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 1 minute 42 \nseconds, and the Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute 10 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Idaho is prepared to yield back. The \nSenator from Massachusetts is prepared to do so.\n  Mr. REID. He is not ready yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do not.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada yields back remaining \ntime on his side.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield back the remainder of my time. The unanimous \nconsent we are operating under moves us\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\nto two votes, the Cantwell unemployment extension and the Frist voting \nrights.\n  Have the yeas and nays been called on both of these amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nCantwell amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask for the yeas and nays on the voting rights \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested on the \nFrist second.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2617\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the \nCantwell amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith).

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, while there were 58 votes--a majority \nvoted for this amendment--we will come back to address this again and \nagain because we are going to see job growth is not happening at the \npace people believe. While we have postponed it today, thinking the UI \ntrust fund is not being used as part of our deficit, the UI trust fund \nshould go to these unemployed workers. We will be back to debate this \nissue again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2626 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 2626, which was to be considered next, be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nsuperb statement, and I also thank the Senator from Kentucky for his \ncomments in support of the extension of the Voting Rights Act. He made \nan eloquent statement and sent a message which I know is well received \nacross this country. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I want to \nwork with him and the Senator from Kentucky to try to achieve what he \nwants, and that is the permanent extension of the Voting Rights Act. We \nwill work closely with him to try to get it done in a timely way.\n  I thank him very much for focusing attention on this issue. I am \ngrateful to him for his leadership.\n  Mr. President, on a final point, I draw the attention of the Senate \nto this vote on unemployment compensation. A wide majority, a broad \nmajority of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate voted for extension \nof unemployment benefits. I commend the Senator from Washington for her \nleadership on this issue. I know she believes, as I do, that this is \nnot the end of the fight but just one of the innings of fight. I thank \nher for her leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, briefly, I also thank the majority leader \nand others for agreeing to vitiate the vote on the Voting Rights Act. I \nunderscore the comments made by the senior Senator from Massachusetts \nto work with the majority leader and others interested in getting this \ndone. It can be done rather simply. We do need to build a record on the \nissue. That is exactly the way to go.\n  I commend the majority leader for moving on this. We do not want to \nwait until the year 2007. I thank him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We will move on now, under our unanimous consent request, \nto a Mikulski amendment, a Frist amendment, a Corzine amendment, a \nFrist amendment, and a Bingaman amendment. At this moment, I do not \nthink we are quite ready to move on, so I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the manager of the bill for \nthe majority and spoken to the majority leader. It is their intention, \nand I think it is a good idea, to have Senator Mikulski finish her \namendment. She has 40 minutes. Following that, there would be an \namendment offered by the majority. When we complete the debate on those \ntwo matters, we would vote on those two matters. We would, in fact, \nhave two votes, and they would be stacked. Following that, we would \nagain look at the schedule and see where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2627\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have an amendment concerning the DC \nsniper victims, and I send it to the desk on behalf of myself, Senators \nSarbanes, Lautenberg, Corzine, and Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Corzine, and Mrs. Clinton, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2627.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To exempt lawsuits involving a shooting victim of John Allen \n   Muhammad or Lee Boyd Malvo from the definition of qualified civil \n                           liability action)\n\n       On page 8, line 22, strike ``or''.\n       On page 9, line 2, strike the period and insert ``; or''.\n       On page 9, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(vi) an action involving a shooting victim of John Allen \n     Muhammad or Lee Boyd Malvo.''.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of my Maryland \nconstituents and other neighbors across the Potomac to offer an \namendment on behalf of the sniper victims. My colleagues might remember \nthat over 1 year ago, the citizens of Maryland, Virginia, and the \nDistrict of Columbia were terrorized by snipers. Soccer games were \ncancelled. People were afraid to buy gas\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\nand terrified to go into a Home Depot. What was happening was that 10 \ninnocent people were killed while they were mowing their lawn or \ngetting gas or while a new bride was going shopping at Home Depot to \ngussy up her home, or one was a bus driver getting ready to do his \nduty. These families have experienced tremendous loss, and the Nation \nmourned with them.\n  We so thank our law enforcement agencies for helping us catch the \nsnipers and the judicial system that is working to try them, but now we \nalso need to make sure that we protect the victims and the victims' \nfamilies.\n  I bring to the attention of my colleagues that the legislation \nCongress is considering now could inflict further pain on the families. \nIt could slam the courthouse door on the families of the sniper victims \nand on all Americans who believe they are harmed by negligent actions \nrelated to guns. It gives gun dealers and manufacturers a free pass, \nand it will prevent families and survivors from holding irresponsible \nstores accountable if they are negligent.\n  It actually would prohibit these families from going to court to seek \nredress, for it would actually prohibit them from letting a jury of \ntheir peers decide if a gun store or a manufacturer was negligent.\n  If this legislation passes, one could still go to court over a toy \ngun but not a real gun. I think that is wrong.\n  My amendment is to make sure the sniper victims and their families \nhave a right to go to court. Before I tell my colleagues about those \nfamilies, let me tell my colleagues what my amendment will do. My \namendment protects the legal rights of the families. It allows current \nand future cases by sniper victims and their families to proceed.\n  Currently, one case is pending in Washington State court. It creates \nan exemption to the text of S. 1805 for all cases involving a victim of \nJohn Allen Muhammad or Lee Boyd Malvo. This is a very narrowly drawn \nbill. It does not exempt any other cases. It does not impact on any of \nthe legal standards of the bill, and it does not prevent a court from \ndismissing a case if there is no negligence.\n  What it does is create an exemption only, and I emphasize ``only,'' \nfor cases involving a victim of John Allen Muhammad or Lee Boyd Malvo. \nThis is the Maryland-DC-Virginia sniper case.\n  I in no way want to create any ambiguity in this bill or create a \nloophole in this bill. But this is a very serious matter. I am here in \nbehalf of those families.\n  Conrad Johnson, who was the sniper's last victim, I remember hearing \nthe news when he was shot at a bus stop in Montgomery County. He was \nkilled by the sniper just as he was getting ready to get on his route. \nHe was so beloved in that community that 2,000 people came to his \nfuneral. He drove this route for so many years. They loved him. Thirty \nmembers of his family gathered at the hospital after he was shot. He \nwas always finding ways to take care of his family and his community. \nConrad Johnson was one of the many Marylanders whose families are still \ngrieving because of this reign of terror that gripped their State. Five \nMaryland families lost their loved ones in the sniper's first 24 hours.\n  Today I stand here for the rights of those families, to have their \nday in court: the rights of Jim Martin's family; he was shot when he \nstopped to buy groceries for his church program; James ``Sonny'' \nBuchanan, a landscape architect who was soon to be married; or the \nhusband and the 7-year-old son of Sarah Ramos, who was shot 25 minutes \nlater as she sat on a bench waiting for a ride to go to her babysitting \njob; also for the little boy named Iran Brown, who was shot in the \nchest as he was dropped off to go into middle school. Thanks to a \nguardian angel, it was his aunt, a nurse, who was with him that day \nwhen he was dropped off so she could sweep him up and be with him as he \nlay hemorrhaging in the hospital. Thank God, for the genius of American \nmedicine that little boy is alive.\n  Family after family has endured incredible pain. Also, there are \nother cases that are pending. These families have been through so much \nthey can never recover their tremendous loss. We owe it to them to make \nsure they have their day in court. That is why my amendment is offered \nto protect them, and that is why it is in such plain and simple \nlanguage. It is limited to victims of John Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo. \nI don't need any legal experts to interpret this amendment. No judge \nhas to decide if the case fits one exemption or another. That is \nbecause, under my amendment, any case involving them must proceed.\n  This is very serious. When we look at the matter, there is evidence \nthat indicates the snipers bought something called a Bushmaster from \nthe Bull's Eye Shooter Supply in Tacoma, WA. The Bull's Eye Shooter \nSupply Company had lost the assault rifle used by the sniper victim. In \n3 years, it managed to lose 237 other guns. Imagine a gunshop that not \nonly couldn't find records on this gun, it had lost 237 guns.\n  I am not going to prejudge cases, but I am going to point fingers. \nSomething was terribly, terribly wrong at this place.\n  When we look at this, Bull's Eye could not account for 238 guns. \nBull's Eye's missing gun rate was greater than 99 percent of all \nFederal arms licenses. Eighty percent of all dealers that sell at least \n50 firearms a year can provide records to account for every one of \nthem. Why couldn't that happen there?\n  There is item after item about this case. When you look at Malvo and \nlook at Muhammad, what you find is the snipers obtained a one-shot, \none-kill assault weapon that was from the Bull's Eye Shooter.\n  When we look at their records, we find that Muhammad was under a \ndomestic violence protective order and Malvo was both a juvenile and an \nillegal alien.\n  How did they get their hands on these guns? That is for law \nenforcement to decide. That is how our legal process should follow its \nregular order, to seek redress. But this points out a set of terrible \nsituations that led to the death of these 10 people in our region. This \nis why I am offering this amendment. After the deaths of these \nwonderful people, their families should have redress in court. The boy \nwho was shot in his chest and is still recovering, though at school, \nshould have redress.\n  I am going to be very clear that in this bill we do not create \nambiguity, confusion, or something that would derail this. I urge the \nSenate to adopt my amendment and to allow the cases affecting this \nparticular group of people to be able to proceed without prejudice or \nwithout any unintended consequences of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and reserve such time as I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Does the Senator have other speakers?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator does have other speakers.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Do you wish to proceed with them?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield to the Senator from Illinois, an outspoken \nadvocate on this issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Those of us working in Washington, DC, remember this sniper incident. \nNot only do I work here but my daughter lives here with my son-in-law \nand grandson, and they live in one of the suburbs represented by the \nSenator from Maryland.\n  I can tell you when these two snipers were moving around the area, \nordinary families were living in fear. They had a sniper rifle and they \nwere killing innocent people. Some 13 were killed and 6 were injured. \nHere are the photos of a few of the victims.\n  After this terrible sniper incident, we learned there was a gun \ndealer who could not even account for the gun that was used to kill \nthese innocent people. So the survivors, as well as the victims' \nfamilies, came forward and said they wanted to hold that gun dealer \naccountable in court for irresponsible and reckless conduct in selling \nfirearms, in allowing them to get into the hands of these snipers. That \nis reasonable for the family to do. It is something I support.\n  But make no mistake, this bill, S. 1805, slams the courthouse door on \nthese victims and their families. The Senator from Maryland, Ms. \nMikulski, is standing here, pleading with those who bring the bill \nforward to keep in mind the sniper victims and their families and give \nthem a chance to have their day in court. If the court decides\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\nthey don't have a right to recovery, so be it. But should we pass a law \nto say these families do not even have a chance to go after the \nreckless misconduct of these gun dealers that resulted in the deaths of \ntheir loved ones? That is what this bill is all about. The Senator from \nMaryland has dramatized it in terms that everyone who works in this \nCapitol will understand.\n  There was a time when you couldn't go home from work, from this \nbuilding, for fear of being shot in the street. It happened over and \nover and over again. Why in the world would the Senate pass a bill to \ninsulate this reckless gun dealer from his civil liability for selling \nthese guns?\n  I thank the Senator for her leadership.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, Senator Mikulski is here, doing something \nthat is, unfortunately, necessary because the underlying legislation \nwould cause currently pending suits on behalf of the families and the \nestates of these victims of the snipers to be thrown out of court. That \nis not only unfortunate but it is unconscionable.\n  There are arguments that this legislation is crafted so these suits \ngo forward. But that is not the case at all. The two salient facts in \nthe sniper shootings with respect to this legislation are, first, the \nsniper, Malvo, claims he shoplifted the gun. The storeowner claims that \nhe was unaware of these weapons being missing until he was contacted \nafter the shooting by the ATF.\n  As a result, none of the appropriate exemptions from the preemption \nto sue would be applicable in this particular situation.\n  There are two particular exemptions that are often pointed to. One \ntalks about the negligent entrustment, which is a theory of law, and \nnegligence per se. None would apply because it requires the defendant \nto have knowledge of a violation of the statute or knowledge that \nsomething untoward would happen. Under the facts as we know them, the \ndefendant alleges he was unaware of the missing weapons.\n  In addition, the other exemption would be if there was a violation of \nFederal and State statute and that violation was the proximate cause, \nalmost direct or substantial cause of the harm caused to the plaintiff.\n  That, too, can be substantiated. We have a situation where this \nstatute not only does not cover this situation and would require these \ncases be thrown out of court, but it raises the extraordinary question \nabout what other cases there might be in the future that would cry out \nfor justice, to bring a suit and demand some type of compensation \nbecause of negligence caused by a gun dealer or manufacturer or trade \nassociation. They, too, would fall. That would be as compelling as \nthese cases of the Washington area sniper victims.\n  I commend Senator Mikulski for standing up for these families. They \nare good people. This is a cutout of these cases from law and allowing \nthem to go forward. But it just begs the question of how many other \nworthy cases will be frustrated by this legislation, if we pass it. I, \nof course, urge that we do not pass the legislation. But I certainly \nurge the amendment proposed by Senator Mikulski be agreed to.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 20 minutes, and the \nSenator from Maryland has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will use some of my time at this moment.\n  At the outset, let me say Senator Mikulski and I are best of friends. \nWe appreciate our friendship, and we work closely on a variety of \npieces of legislation. There is nothing I would do nor is there \nanything S. 1805 will do to damage the argument and passion and concern \nSenator Mikulski has put before us today with her amendment. If you \nbelieve in the underlying bill, S. 1805, there is a problem, and the \nproblem is Senator Mikulski carves out a very big exception and guts \nthe bill in the underlying principle. Let me talk about that principle.\n  I ask the Senator to go with me to page 7 of the bill and to look at \nsection 4 of the bill. Let us talk about that in relation to the \nphenomenal tragedy that hit this city and the families she is \ndiscussing.\n  Not only did her friends and neighbors hunker down in fear, but so \ndid we as John Lee Malvo and John Allen Muhammad terrorized the \nneighborhoods in Maryland and Virginia.\n  Here is the problem. What are the facts? The Senator said I am not \ngoing to try the case on the floor, but I am going to point fingers. I \nam not going to try the case on the floor, but I am going to point \nfingers.\n  We probably have reasonable cause to point fingers at Bull's Eye in \nTacoma, WA. Something went wrong up there. There are over 300 guns \nmissing. Lee Malvo himself said, I stole the Bushmaster I used in the \nsniper incidents in Virginia and in Maryland. ``I stole the gun.'' He \nsaid so. It is on the record. Already he sets up an interesting \nscenario.\n\n  As a result of that, the BATF pulled the license of the gun dealer \nand recommended felony charges be brought by the Justice Department. \nThis case is maturing at this moment.\n  What does our bill do? It tries to very narrowly create an \nenvironment and an exception.\n  Let us go to that bill and to page 7. Let me read starting on page 6 \nof the bill because I think it is important. Many Senators have ignored \nthis in the rhetoric of the day. They shouldn't ignore it.\n\n       In general, the term ``qualified civil liability action'' \n     means a civil action brought by any person against a \n     manufacturer or seller of a qualified product or a trade \n     association for damages resulting from the criminal or \n     unlawful misuse of a qualified product by a person or a third \n     party but shall not include--\n\n  In other words, the exceptions under which the Malvo and Muhammad \ncase can be tried in which those parties the Senator is talking about \ncontain compensation are the following.\n\n       No. 1, an action brought against the transactor convicted \n     under section 924 of title 18 United States Code or a \n     comparable or identical State felony law by a party directly \n     harmed by the conduct for which the transferee is convicted.\n\n  Parties harmed. In other words, did the transferee, the gun dealer, \nmalfunction? Did he break the law? There is a strong appearance that he \nmight have.\n\n       No. 2, an action brought against a seller for negligent \n     entrustment or negligent per se.\n       No. 3, an action in which a manufacturer or a seller of a \n     qualified product knowingly and willingly violated State and \n     Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of a \n     product and the violation was a proximate cause for the harm \n     and for which the relief is sought.\n       No. 4, an action for breach of contract or warranty in \n     connection with--\n\n  And then we go on to deal with basically product liability.\n  My point is quite simple. I believe we are protecting those families. \nI would not write the kind of law that is being suggested would be \nwritten. What I am concerned about are lawsuits in which we are trying \nto hold accountable the innocent party--in this case potentially a \nmanufacturer of a product--unless there is criminal intent, or unless \nthey have broken the law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I can't yield. My time is limited. I am sorry. The Senator \nhas had time. Let me continue.\n  That is the sense of the argument we are dealing with here. Negligent \nentrustment:\n\n       In subparagraph (a)(2), the term ``negligent entrustment'' \n     means the supplying of a qualified product by a supplier for \n     use by another person when the supplier knows or should \n     know--\n\n  That is very important.\n\n     --the person to whom the product is supplied is likely to and \n     does use the product in a manner involving unreasonable risk \n     of physical injury to the person or to others.\n\n  What are we trying to do here?\n  Again, I have said time and time again over the last 24 hours it is a \nvery narrow exception, but to entrust us to a century of tort law that \nsays innocent parties are not guilty nor should they be swept into \nlawsuits if they have met certain standards of the law--in this case, \nlicensed gun dealers and manufacturers.\n\n  Did the folks up at Bull's Eye in Tacoma meet those standards? We \ndon't know. But I will tell you the BATF pulled their Federal firearms \nlicense. There is an investigation underway. If they lost that many \nfirearms and they didn't notice it and they didn't report\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nit, I am not an attorney, but I have to assume they have a big \nviolation on their hands. If Malvo walks in and pulls a Bushmaster from \noff the rack and walks out with it and that is not detected, they have \na problem on their hands. I believe they have a problem on their hands, \nand they are not exempt.\n  The argument is--and some have used it--they do not even make it to \nthe courthouse. That is not a valid statement.\n  This is a basis from which you argue before the court and a \nknowledgeable, and I hope trusting, judge will take these evaluations \nin hand and make the determination that this is not a frivolous or a \njunk lawsuit; that there is basis, and the reason there is basis is \nbecause there has been a clear violation of Federal law.\n  If there has not been a violation of Federal law, even though many of \nus can certainly have great concern about the families involved, do we \ncontinue to suggest that we go out and harass through the courts legal, \nlaw-abiding citizens and producers of a legal product in this country \nsimply because it fits the passion of the day or the politics of the \nmoment? I think not. I don't think the Senator from Maryland wants to \ndo that. It is clear if you carve out this exception, you gut the bill \nbecause you are saying no, no. We are saying we are giving you all of \nthese exceptions very clearly in the law. I read them to you. They are \nin the law. It is section 4. That is what we are dealing with. It is a \nvery important part of it.\n\n  We think it is the right thing to do at this time. I believe a \nmajority of my colleagues in the Senate agree with that. The reason \nthey agree is for the very reason we have been very specific and clear \nto adhere to Federal law but to make sure we are not just going to the \ncourt for the purpose of expanding the sweep that one might like to \ntake because they do not like guns or they do not like the current law \nor they want to control them in different ways.\n  The Federal law is there. It is clear. It is present. The \ninvestigation is underway. We cannot try that case here. But I do agree \nwith the Senator from Maryland, we cannot try to, but we can point \nfingers.\n  Our bill, S. 1805, sets up a very clear case in which these lawsuits \ncan be effectively argued and a decision made whether there was a \nrupturing of Federal law or whether we do have law-abiding \npractitioners in the business of the manufacturing and sale of firearms \nin this country. That has to be and it must remain the basis of the \nargument and the basis of this law. The amendment the Senator offers \ngoes directly in the opposite, to carve out special exceptions within \nthe law now and into the future.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have two legal opinions, one from \nLloyd Cutler, a very distinguished American lawyer who has served as \nWhite House counsel to a President, who says that S. 1805 contains \nlanguage that would require the dismissal of the Johnson case. I have \nanother legal opinion from Boise, Schiller & Flexner who essentially \nsay the exceptions would only preserve civil claims brought under other \nkinds of law. Other than that, what they are saying is this would \npreempt their ability to bring this case.\n  The opinions clearly state that section 4 on page 7 articulated by my \nesteemed colleague does not hold water. It does not protect the victims \nof Malvo and Muhammad because it is in such plain English limited to \nthose cases by the name of the perpetrator and predator. This does not \ncreate a loophole.\n  Talk about loophole, talk about the gun shield loophole, talk about \nall the other loopholes in the gun bills. My amendment does not create \na loophole.\n  The legal opinions show there is ambiguity in S. 1805 and that \nsection 4 could preempt the ability of these families to bring this \ncase.\n  The distinguished Senator from Idaho has his opinion. I have my two \nlegal opinions that show that there is confusion and honest \ndisagreement about the bill. That is why the Mikulski amendment is \nnecessary, to clear up the ambiguity on the matter of these cases \ncommitted by Malvo and Muhammad.\n  His point and my legal opinions prove the necessity of the amendment, \nto clear up the confusion, end the ambiguity, protect these victims and \nthe families and their right to pursue.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois, a distinguished lawyer himself, \nto further amplify this argument.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  I say to the Senator from Idaho who stood up here and said he did not \nbelieve the survivors of the DC sniper shooting had a right to go to \ncourt and therefore he was going to oppose the Senator's amendment, I \nguess that is clearly his point of view, but he said just the opposite. \nHe said he reads this law to allow the victims and their families of \nthe DC sniper to go court against the dealer.\n  If that is his opinion, then he ought to accept the amendment from \nthe Senator from Maryland because that is all she is asking for.\n  If you do not believe the victims of the DC sniper should have a day \nin court against the dealer to determine whether or not he is guilty of \nwrongdoing, then just say it. But if you believe that these sniper \nvictims and their families should have a day in court, for goodness' \nsake, accept the amendment of the Senator from Maryland. If you do not, \nit really tells the story of your bill.\n  If your bill is going to stop the families and victims of the DC \nsnipers from holding a gun dealer guilty for irresponsible, reckless \nmisconduct, frankly, that is another good reason for us to defeat the \nbill. Let us stand behind the innocent victims of the DC snipers.\n  Talk about people who hate guns. I do not hate guns but I hate \nsnipers who shoot children and innocent people on the street and I hate \nthe people who sell them guns irresponsibly. I think they ought to be \nheld accountable. That is all the Senator from Maryland is asking.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Continuing my argument, there is ambiguity and there is \nhonest disagreement. I know the Senator from Idaho might bring us a CRS \nopinion saying the cases might survive. My colleague from Rhode Island \nhas an earlier CRS opinion that says the opposite. The point is, there \nis ambiguity both in the law and in opinions about the law.\n  My amendment is a simple, straightforward way to clear up the \nambiguity and let these cases move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators are reminded to address each \nother in the third person.\n  The Senator from Idaho has 10 minutes 27 seconds remained.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Parliamentary inquiry: Did I do something wrong?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois referred to the \nSenator from Idaho in the first person.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I beg your pardon.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: I referred to the Senator from Idaho on the \nfloor; is that improper?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator several times during his talk used \nthe pronoun ``you.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I apologize for using the pronoun ``you.'' I will never \ndo it again.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the time remaining on \nboth sides of the Mikulski amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 20 seconds for the Senator from \nIdaho and 14 seconds for the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CRAIG. With 14 seconds remaining for the Senator from Maryland to \nargue, this is her amendment, and under the unanimous consent I will \nthen offer the Frist-Craig amendment. As we know, then they will be \nstood up to be voted on, Frist-Craig first, Mikulski second.\n  If the Senator would like to make any concluding remarks about her \namendment, I would certainly welcome that. She then controls 20 minutes \nof the 40 that would be on my amendment and the debate could go on.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Excuse me, Senator. The Frist-Craig amendment is on \nwhat topic, sir?\n  Mr. CRAIG. On your topic.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What is the Frist-Craig amendment?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have not offered it yet.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. You want to conclude debate on this amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Then we set yours aside for the Frist-Craig debate on the \nsame subject matter and then stand these up for votes.\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. With that, I assume all time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2628\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask that the Mikulski amendment be set aside for the \npurpose of introduction of an amendment on behalf of Majority Leader \nFrist and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for Mr. Frist, for \n     himself and Mr. Craig, proposes an amendment numbered 2628.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To exempt any lawsuit involving a shooting victim of John \nAllen Muhammad or John Lee Malvo from the definition of qualified civil \n           liability action that meets certain requirements)\n\n       On page 8, line 22, strike ``or''.\n       On page 9, line 2, strike the period at the end and insert \n     ``; or ''.\n       On page 9, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (vi) an action involving a shooting victim of John Allen \n     Muhammad or John Lee Malvo that meets 1 of the requirements \n     under clauses (i) through (v).\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but I \nam told we have not had the opportunity to see the text of these \namendments. If we are going to work in good faith, it is very important \nthat on all of these alternative amendments the text be provided if \nthey are available and certainly before they are offered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the minority leader will yield, it is my fault. I \napologize. We will place ourselves in a quorum until they have copies. \nIt is brief and to the point and easy to understand for everyone.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I apologize once again to the Senator from \nMaryland that the stand-beside amendment I offer in conjunction with \nhers was not delivered to her. We have a stand-beside Frist-Craig \namendment to the Corzine amendment, which may follow immediately. We \nare copying that now to make sure Senator Corzine and the other side \nhas a copy of it.\n  My amendment, as you can see, is really very simple, but it is also \nextremely important. It is simple in this respect: 55 cosponsors of S. \n1805 have cosponsored S. 1805 because of its narrowness, of its \ncleanliness in the fact that we do not clutter up a lot of laws and we \ncreate one very limited but very important exemption, and that is junk \nlawsuits filed by a third party cannot reach through and suggest that \nsomeone who produces a legal product can be held liable for that \nproduct unless they have broken the law or a person selling that \nproduct is not held liable for that product unless they have broken the \nlaw.\n  My amendment says, in essence, if an action involving a shooting \nvictim of John Allen Muhammad or John Lee Malvo meets any of the \nexceptions of S. 1805, the action will not be barred by this bill.\n  Again, what are those exceptions? Well, I have read them earlier. Let \nme repeat them. They are very clearly outlined in section 4 of the \nbill, and what we say is:\n\n       The term ``qualified civil liability action'' means a civil \n     action brought by any person against a manufacturer or seller \n     of a qualified product, or a trade association, for damages \n     resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified \n     product by the person or a third party.\n\n  In other words, if that third party is a guy who breaks the law, but \nthe seller and the manufacturer are not, then the judge looks at that \nand makes that determination and says no.\n  But here in the case in Maryland and in Virginia, if it is found \nthat:\n\n     an action brought against a transferor convicted under \n     section 924(h) of title 18, United States Code, or a \n     comparable or identical State felony law, by a party directly \n     harmed by the conduct of which the transferee is so \n     convicted--\n\n  ``Transferee,'' in this case, in my opinion, at least, is Bull's Eye. \nThey are the ones responsible for that firearm. They are the ones that \nwould have sold it legally. In this case it was stolen from their shop. \nIt appears to have gone unreported.\n  Secondly:\n\n     an action brought against a seller for negligent entrustment \n     or negligence per se. . . .\n\n  So we have not swept that away nor will we sweep that away. In fact, \nI believe we strengthen it, and so does the Congressional Research \nService. While there may be a difference of opinion on that, I think \nwhat is significant is that Senator Daschle and I agree. We teamed up \ntogether to strengthen this and to clarify it. Quoting the \nCongressional Research Service, our amendment:\n\n     would strike ``knowingly and willfully'' in the preceding \n     sentence, potentially increasing the likelihood that this \n     exception to the general immunity afforded under the bill \n     would be applicable in any given case.\n\n  In this case, it probably strengthens the position we are dealing \nwith here, as the Senator from Maryland and I visit about it.\n  The third exception that clearly could be applicable, and that my \namendment says if found is applicable, in the Muhammad and Malvo case:\n\n     an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified \n     product violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the \n     sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a \n     proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought.\n\n  In other words, relief for these families who were the victims of \nJohn Muhammad and John Lee Malvo.\n  I believe it is a clear, clean amendment. I don't think it is \nambiguous at all. But it does argue one premise in the law that always \nmust be argued, and that is, did Bull's Eye break the law? Well, we are \ninvestigating that now. Did the manufacturer of the Bushmaster in any \nway violate the law? That is probably getting investigated, too, \nalthough even the Brady Center doesn't impugn in any way that the \nmanufacturer was involved in this. Those are the facts.\n  In other words, what I am suggesting by this amendment, what I \nbelieve is still clear in 1805, is that we are not exempting the \nvictims of the sniper shootings of DC and the Virginia and Maryland \narea. It is not our intent to do so. It is our intent to allow them to \ngo to court. It is our intent to allow them to argue this before a \njudge. It is our intent to allow a judge to make a decision based on \nthese exceptions and now the clearly respelled out exceptions in the \nFrist-Craig amendment as to whether, based on this law, there can be \ncompensation to these families from, in this instance, a dealer and a \nmanufacturer. That is the essence of it.\n  I don't believe the courthouse door is locked. All attorneys are \nentitled to their own opinions. Everybody reads the law a bit \ndifferently. So is my opinion stronger than your opinion? I know what \nmy intent is. I know what Senator Daschle's intent is. I know our \nintent is not to lock the courthouse door. We believe we don't. And it \nhas been thoroughly checked by numerous lawyers. We think our amendment \nis sound.\n  I am going to ask the Senate not to gut the underlying 1805 but to \nvote for the Frist-Craig amendment which will not only strengthen the \namendment, strengthen the position but, I believe, fulfill the concern \nand the arguments of the Senator from Maryland.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho points to every \nexception because he can't point to one exception that will clearly \nestablish the right of these plaintiffs to go forward to make their \ncase. The way this legislation is structured, first, the qualified \ncivil liability action may not be brought in any Federal or State \ncourt. You are thrown out of court unless you can get yourself back in \nby an exemption. In these cases, you are dismissed. You are already in \ncourt but you are out the door. The intent is very clear. It is to stop \nindividuals from suing dealers, manufacturers, and trade associations.\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\n  What about these exemptions? The first exemption deals with the \ntransferor or convicted. There have been no charges in Bull's Eye, no \nconviction. What happens? The case is already dismissed. Is there \nlanguage the Senator from Idaho will apply reinstating the case \nautomatically?\n  The second is a possibility that is negligent entrustment or \nnegligence per se. All of these require knowledge on the part of the \ndefendant. The facts of Bull's Eye clearly suggest there is no evidence \nor none so far proven that the owner knew the gun was shoplifted and, \nin fact, he alleges he was not aware of any missing weapons until he \nwas confronted by the ATF after the crime. This does not apply.\n  Finally, there is the violation of a Federal or State statute. The \nSenator from Idaho often talks about, well, if there is a violation of \nFederal and State statute, that, of course, allows a person to go \nforward with this case.\n  But there are two parts of this test. State or Federal statute \nviolated, and that violation causes proximately, substantially the \ninjury. In effect, what would have to be shown for any type of \nliability to adhere to the Bull's Eye case under this arrangement is \nthat he was aware of the missing weapons more than 48 hours before he \nwas confronted by the ATF, and he consciously disregarded his \nobligation to report not just a missing weapon but the particular \nweapon that was taken by Malvo. None of these exceptions apply to \nBull's Eye or, if they apply, it is a very tortured reach to make the \napplication.\n  Then this amendment simply says: Well, if you fall under the statute, \nyou get to use the statute. This is a circular, is a kind way to \ndescribe what this is. You could substitute anybody's name in the \nUnited States. It doesn't have to be John Allen Muhammad or John Lee \nMalvo. It could be the victim of any criminal today walking around the \nstreets of America with a handgun. Because if you are injured by that \nindividual with a handgun and you fall into these categories, you get \nto go to court.\n  But this is an easy amendment because very few people, if any, will \nqualify under these criteria. That is the whole point of this carefully \nworded, excruciatingly arcane approach to shutting people out of court. \nThat is what this is about.\n  Essentially you can't have it both ways. You can't stand up here and \nclaim you are protecting the industry from frivolous suits but every \nsuit we bring up is a possible worthy and meritorious suit. Well, of \ncourse, that will get into court. Of course, it is one of the \nexceptions. You don't get it both ways.\n  You get it one way in this bill. Innocent people injured by the \nnegligence of dealers, of manufacturers lose. And they win.\n  We are not just giving out Federal firearms licenses, if this \nlegislation passes. We are giving a license to be negligent and \nreckless--grossly negligent and grossly reckless. That is what a \nFederal firearms license means, if this legislation passes.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator for yielding the time to me. I \nassociate myself with the amendment that was initially introduced by my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. I rise to raise questions \nabout that which is currently now being offered by the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  There is no doubt about the appropriateness of the amendment, as it \nwas presented by the Senator from Maryland, because it was her \nconstituents, seven of them, who were shot by the sniper, six of whom \ndied.\n  For over a month in the fall of 2001, John Muhammad and John Lee \nMalvo terrorized the Washington metropolitan area through a series of \nvicious sniper attacks on innocent men, women, and children. In the \narea, Americans were afraid to walk outside, afraid to pump gas \noutside, school activities were moved to enclosed areas. Everyone was a \ntarget.\n  As it turned out, there was ample reason to be frightened. From the \ntrunk of Muhammad's car, the snipers used a Bushmaster assault weapon \nto shoot 13 people in Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia. Ten of \nthe 13 died. We have heard the names of those such as Linda Franklin, \n47-year-old FBI analyst, standing with her husband in the Home Depot \nparking lot in Virginia. She was killed. Another was Pascal Charlot, a \n72-year-old retired carpenter standing on a street corner, shot and \nkilled. Another victim was Iran Brown, a 13-year-old boy who had just \nbeen dropped off at school.\n  My fellow Senators now prepare to tell mothers and victims throughout \nthe United States that they don't have a right to file a civil lawsuit \nagainst individuals and businesses that helped cause this tragic event.\n  We had a debate on the floor yesterday. There was a question, a \nsemantic question, about whether or not the Bull's Eye store was really \nclosed. One of my staff people called the number and they said: Yes, we \nare open until 7 o'clock. Do you want anything--this is my edition: if \nyou want anything shipped out, we will get you guns.\n  So we argued about whether or not they were really closed or who had \nthe license or what. Those are extraneous things having no significance \nin the debate.\n  We see the same thing replicated here. If you meet certain \nconditions, you are still able to bring suit. But if one of the several \nconditions is present, then you can't bring suit.\n  Why don't we tell it like it is? And that is, by whatever stretch of \nthe imagination you want to bring, these people, the victims of the \nsniper attacks, are unable to bring a suit. There is no doubt about it. \nWe can discuss language all you want, but it is the intent.\n  Throw another obstacle in the way for these victims to get some \njustice, some sense of what it is that took place that was wrong and \nhow we can help prevent it in the future.\n  To hear these discussions immersed in language changes--I suppose if \nyou study it closely enough, you will find punctuation changes. Bull's \nEye claimed they didn't have any record of sale. They cannot explain \nhow the snipers obtained the assault weapon. I have not heard any \ncondemnation of their poor practices; that 237 weapons were lost. What \na shame. If any normal store lost items that cost this much, they would \nbe in a state of panic. Apparently, these guys did not care that much, \nbut we still want to prevent those who have been victimized by their \npoor behavior from getting compensation that is justly theirs under \nnormal circumstances.\n  Why we have to take away people's rights is something, frankly, I do \nnot understand. I hope the public at large begins to raise questions: \nWhat is this? Do you mean if I am injured in an automobile accident and \nthe automobile manufacturer has been negligent, that they did not \nprotect the gas tank properly, so it exploded when it was hit in the \nback, I shouldn't be able to get compensation for that small error? It \nmay have burned you alive. Or if there was such a casual structure of \nbehavior with a pharmaceutical company, and they put the wrong tablets \nin a bottle, or if someone there, in a moment of madness, put the wrong \ntablets in a bottle and a person becomes ill or dies, they shouldn't be \nable to bring an action? This strikes me as something that the \ncitizenry, who is expecting us to take care of them, is unable to \ncomprehend.\n  This debate goes on and there is always another trick, another \nmaneuver to try and interrupt the flow of what we would consider normal \njustice. I hope we will defeat the amendment because it adds nothing to \nthe compromise that we have to arrive at to get the kind of voting \npattern--the record that says, yes, we made sure the people who suffer \nthese terrible damages have a right to compensation or to a review by \nthe court to decide that issue.\n  I hope we will defeat the Frist-Craig amendment and get on to the \nMikulski amendment, which approaches the problem directly. These people \nhave been severely injured by the actions of the snipers who got the \ngun illegally, inappropriately, improperly--call it what you will.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 22 seconds.\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the amount of time I \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will use a limited amount of that time. \nIf the Senator from Maryland wishes to close out the debate, I will \nmake my closing statement, and we can move to a vote quickly.\n  Let me address what the Senator from New Jersey said a moment ago and \ndirect his attention to subsection (v) of section 4. He talked about a \ncar not functioning properly and somebody being injured. That is called \nproduct liability. It says:\n\n       (v) an action for physical injuries or property damage \n     resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of \n     the product, when used as intended. . . .\n\n  Please read the bill when you make those kinds of statements because \nif the Senator had, that would have been, in my opinion, improper. We \nare not talking product liability.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is the question being referred to me directly?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No, I am only responding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator knows I am only responding to a comment he \nmade. I am simply suggesting that for the next few moments he might \nwish to read that subsection. Here we are not dealing with product \nliability. It appeared the Bushmaster tragically operated very well. \nWhat is at hand is, Are the people at Bull's Eye involved in \nwrongdoing? That is the question at hand. And should we go after them?\n  We are carving that out in a way so that the victims can go after \nthem if they are found guilty of a Federal violation. Let me read what \nCRS suggests the Daschle-Craig amendment does:\n\n       In the case at hand--\n\n  They are referring to the DC snipers--\n\n       it has been asserted that the firearm--\n\n  And we can only say ``asserted'' at this moment because it is under \ninvestigation--\n\n     it has been asserted that the firearm used in the D.C.-area \n     sniper shootings ``disappeared'' from Bull's Eye's place of \n     business ``[o]n or about August or September of 2002,'' and \n     was not reported as missing until November 5, 2002. Pursuant \n     to 18 U.S.C. 923(g)(6) a licensee--\n\n  That is Bull's Eye--\n\n     is required to report the theft or loss of a firearm within \n     48 hours after the theft or loss is discovered. Thus, in the \n     event that it is established that Bull's Eye was aware that \n     the firearm was missing from its inventory more than 48 hours \n     prior to November 5, 2002, the amendment would appear to lend \n     further support to the application of the exception to \n     immunity under 4(5). . . .\n\n  My point is quite simple: If the evidence is there--and I believe the \nSenator from New Jersey yesterday referenced the presence of Lee Malvo \non a video. I was unaware of that. If that is true, that is apparently \nmore evidence. But once again, here we are with a jumble of facts that \nwe really do not know because we were not the investigators; we were \nnot on the scene. We are taking this from newspaper reports.\n\n  What I am saying is if the Bull's Eye shop is in violation of the \nlaw, then the Frist-Craig amendment or the underlying S. 1805 clearly \ndoes protect all of these victims so they have their day in court. The \ncourthouse door is not shut, would not be shut, will not be shut by S. \n1805 or the amendment at hand.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, before giving all the remaining time to \nSenator Mikulski, I would like to make one point. In the CRS report to \nwhich the Senator referred, essentially he failed to note a footnote \nthat says essentially that it does not appear that any evidence has \nbeen produced of actual violations of these provisions by Bull's Eye in \nthe case at hand.\n  If you assume they violated the law, then, of course, the exemption \napplies. The facts we know now suggest they knew nothing about the \ndisappearance of the weapons, and this legislation will bar the \nindividuals from court.\n  I add one simple point. Even if we are slightly in doubt debating \nthis issue, we should support Senator Mikulski's amendment which puts \nthem in court.\n  I yield the remaining time to Senator Mikulski.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment does nothing. It keeps \nthe status quo of the bill, S. 1805. It restates what the bill says. It \nsays that the sniper cases have to fit in to one of the exceptions that \nare described in section 4, paragraph 5. That is what it already says.\n  The legal experts that I have consulted and have consulted with the \nBrady organization believe that the cases do not fit. I understand \nthat, under the amendment of the Senator from Idaho, the sniper cases \nwill likely be dismissed. I am going to talk about the legal experts, \nbut again the mere fact that we are having such intense debate shows \nthe ambiguity and confusion, which is why the Mikulski amendment is \nneeded.\n  Now I will go to the opinion of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, a \ndistinguished law firm. What they tell us is, according to the terms of \nS. 1805, it would foreclose and require the immediate dismissal of any \nState or Federal qualified civil liability action which the statute \ndefines to include a civil action brought by any person against the \nmanufacturer or seller for damages resulting from the criminal or \nunlawful use. They are saying it is going to be dismissed.\n  They then say when one goes to all of the prohibitions, they believe \nthat because of the way it is drafted, particularly the items in the \nexception, that it expressly disclaims any intention to create causes \nof actions or remedies. The above-described exceptions would only \npreserve civil claims brought under otherwise applicable State or \nFederal law. Other than that, the proposed legislation would preempt as \na matter of Federal law the State or Federal lawsuits against \nirresponsible sellers, manufacturers, or so on.\n  What they are saying is this would require an immediate dismissal of \nthe sniper victims' claims. We cannot do this. According to the legal \nexperts, close examination of the exceptions enumerated in section 4 of \nthe proposed immunity, which they are trying to shoehorn in--they are \ntrying to shoehorn Malvo in; they are trying to shoehorn Muhammad in to \nthese exceptions. These exceptions reveal that none would appear to \npreserve the claims brought by the victims of the sniper attacks and \ntheir families against the parties responsible for permitting the \nsnipers to obtain these murder weapons.\n  In fact, they go on to say:\n\n       In fact, the passage of S. 1805 would likely compel the \n     judge in the sniper case immediately to dismiss those claims.\n\n  They refer then to section (5)(A) and there are paragraphs. That \nproposed legislation would prove those provisions contain only the \nexceptions that even conceivably apply to the snipers' case.\n  I could go on. This is a 13-page legal opinion. It is not appropriate \nfor me to read the whole opinion, but the statutory violation exception \nembodied in paragraph (5)(A) will not save the snipers victims' claims.\n  The plain language of section (5)(A)(iii) would appear to dictate the \nsame result in the sniper case.\n\n       Despite the above-discussed evidence of the Bull's Eye \n     numerous failings as a gun dealer, there is no reason to \n     believe that the plaintiffs in the sniper case will be \n     allowed to show that Bull's Eye violated any State or Federal \n     statute. . . .Indeed, after his arrest, Malvo admitted that \n     he shoplifted the weapon from Bull's Eye in the summer of \n     2002. Although the plaintiffs claim that Bull's Eye's lax \n     security practices permitted Malvo to acquire the weapon, \n     . . .\n\n  Again, we are not trying the case here but, yes, he stole the gun. \nThere are 237 guns missing from that same gunshop. Something was pretty \nsloppy there. Somebody was pretty negligent there. Something was \nterribly wrong that 238 people could steal guns, including a juvenile \nillegal alien who was obviously walking around a gunshop if he \nshoplifted it.\n  What we are talking about is the statutory violation exception \nembodied in (5)(A) would totally blow the snipers victims' claims.\n  Again, it is being tried in the courts, and I want it to be tried in \nthe courts. Maybe the kid did not shoplift it, but somehow or another \nin that gunshop in Tacoma, WA, with 238 guns missing, something went \nterribly wrong. They should have their day in court to at least raise \nwhether there was these issues of negligence.\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\n  I really do believe the Frist-Craig amendment would gut their ability \nto move ahead. It is trying to shoehorn into these exceptions and yet \nat the same time these very exceptions would prohibit them from \nbringing their claim. I really ask on behalf of these families to be \nable to do this.\n  Also, in another section, the negligent entrustment/negligence per se \nexceptions embodied in paragraph (5)(A)(iii) will not save them. As an \ninitial matter, these exceptions are limited to a seller, and it goes \non and on. What it says in a nutshell is that it would preclude them \nfrom moving forward.\n  For the information of my colleagues, this legal opinion letter was \nprinted in yesterday's Record.\n  I also acknowledge that the Senator from Idaho has a different view \nthan this legal opinion but that is the point of the amendment. I have \na legal opinion. He has his expertise and the CRS opinion.\n  I think it is the opinion of the American people, that when someone \nbrings a whole community to a paralyzing halt, when people have been \nghoulishly and grimly shot down in a deliberate, predatory, and cruel \nmanner that in this country one ought to at least be able to go to \ncourt to seek some redress. All I am doing is preserving their right to \ndo so.\n  When we say we want to stand up for America, I am standing not only \nfor these victims but I am standing up to keep the courthouse door open \nto them, and that is really what the rule of law should mean in the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to ask the Senator from Maryland a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 25 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask the Senator from Maryland, is there anything \nthat is in the Craig amendment that changes the ability of these \nvictims to sue?\n  There are conditions, are there not, that he places in there that \nmake them jump through another hoop in order to be able to sue?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes, it gives a whole set of other obstacles.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. They may have not met these conditions but they still \nhave had the damage and the tragedy that befell them?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes, and they have also filed suits. What we are \nconcerned with is this bill will preempt those suits. They will be \nthrown out. They will be dismissed and the families will face yet \nanother injustice at the hands of the Congress.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have 8 minutes remaining. I will try not \nto use it and will yield it back so we can get to the votes on these \ntwo amendments.\n  The Senator from Maryland talked about an American principle, and I \nagree with her. There is an American principle that says everyone \nshould have their day in court, and she is right. There is a second \nAmerican principle that says that law-abiding citizens who do law-\nabiding things should not be dragged into court for frivolous purposes \nor junk lawsuits. That is the other American principle. It is as old as \ntort law itself. The responsibility is tied to the individual, unless \nthe individual under law is found totally negligent.\n  She and I have agreed the case cannot be tried here because we simply \ndo not know the facts. We know a little bit about it. We know bits and \npieces about it but we have not seen the BATF's report. We have not \nseen the kind of investigation that has gone on. I agree with the \nSenator; everyone should have their day in court. I do not know how \nsome are saying that S. 1805 does not even allow them to get to court.\n  It allows them to argue before a judge the basis of the law, and the \njudge will make the determination. I suggest that that is called ``in \ncourt'' and that is exactly what my amendment does. That is what S. \n1805 does. It is very clear.\n  The Senator might be suggesting that this is just one small group. \nNo, no, this is not one small group. This happens to be a tragically \nlarge group, by all of our estimation in Virginia and Maryland, but \nonce this is decided how will this precedent be used by others?\n  She talks about gutting the opportunity. I suggest her amendment guts \nS. 1805. Proponents of the amendment claim that it provides an \nexception for a small group, but any carve-out that is made part of \nthis legislation would have the Government turned on its own principles \nof equity and justice insofar as the amendment would designate a \nparticular group of people, though sympathetic--and all of us agree to \nthat--different in the eyes of the law than others and justice so far \nas it would be required to hold remote other responsibilities for the \nindependent actions of two men.\n  That is the essence of the two amendments. They are very clear before \nus. It is time we vote on these issues. The Senator from New Jersey is \nnow in the Chamber with his amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the remainder of my time. I ask for the yeas and \nnays on the two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to asking for the yeas and \nnays on both amendments at once?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding that, under the agreement, the \nFrist-Craig amendment would go first and the Mikulski amendment would \nfollow.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 2628\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2628. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The senior Journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell) and the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID.

There are now 2 minutes of debate on the \nMikulski amendment, evenly divided, to\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\nbe followed by a vote. And the yeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my amendment, I believe, is far superior \nto the amendment the Senate just adopted. It is a simple, \nstraightforward amendment. It exempts from the bill all cases related \nto those committed by the despicable predators John Malvo and John \nMuhammad. This is a very specific, very limited exemption. I urge the \nSenators to consider it.\n  If we really want to honor the victims of the sniper cases, please \ngive them the opportunity to pursue their cases in court. We have a \nsubstantial legal opinion from an eminent scholar such as Lloyd Cutler, \nwho says if this bill passes, and passes with Frist-Craig, the victims' \ncases will be thrown out of court absolutely or, at the very least, be \nleft in great ambiguity.\n  Please, let us do justice to the victims and at least give them the \nopportunity to seek justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, you have just voted \nfor the Frist-Craig amendment. If you now vote for the Mikulski \namendment, you have totally reversed your vote. The Mikulski amendment \nguts the underlying bill, S. 1805, carves out a substantial exception. \nIf you are supportive of S. 1805, then you vote no.\n  But do we protect the right of the victims for their day in court? We \nabsolutely do. There are four major exceptions in which we say, if \nthese parties are found guilty, if there was a negligent gun dealer, if \nthere was a negligent manufacturer--and that is a fact and it is \nproven--then their day in court is there, as it should be.\n  But we do not allow frivolous third-party lawsuits. That is the \nunderlying premise of the bill. Again, if you voted for Frist-Craig, I \nwould ask you to vote against Mikulski.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Mikulski \namendment. The yeas and nays have previously been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The next order of business is an amendment by \nthe Senator from New Jersey with 30 minutes of debate equally divided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2629\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Kennedy, Senator Clinton, and Senator Boxer, \nI send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine], for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton, and Mrs. \n     Boxer proposes an amendment numbered 2629.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the rights of law enforcement officers who are \n victimized by crime to secure compensation from those who participate \n                      in the arming of criminals)\n\n       On page 11, after line 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, nothing in \n     this Act shall be construed as limiting the right of an \n     officer or employee of any Federal, State, or local law \n     enforcement agency to recover damages authorized under \n     Federal or State law.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the underlying \nlegislation before the Senate which waives liability for gun dealers \nand manufacturers. In my view, this legislation strips away the legal \nrights of victims of gun violence and shields wrongdoers from \naccountability. It provides special exemptions for the narrowest of \nspecial interests, and it would make our country less safe.\n  The bill uses a variety of complicated legal concepts, narrowly drawn \nexemptions, to shield irresponsible gun dealers and manufacturers from \naccountability. When we get beyond the legalese and Washington speak, \nthe bottom line is the bill will limit the legal rights of gun violence \nvictims.\n  I think that is wrong. In my view, no victim of gun violence should \nbe denied their day in court. Each should be allowed an opportunity--a \nchance--to make their case. That is why I believe this whole bill is a \nmistake.\n  That said, I am a realist. I recognize the majority of my colleagues, \nbased on the cosponsorship, disagree. On Tuesday, this legislation will \nlikely be approved. That is why my amendment is so important and needs \nto be dealt with.\n  My hope is we can at least reach an agreement that even if we are \ngoing to strip away the rights for most Americans, we will not take \naway the rights from the men and women who serve as our Nation's law \nenforcement officers, the protectors of the peace, the people who serve \non our streets, in our neighborhoods, our first responders.\n  I know all my colleagues appreciate the tremendous service and risk \nour law enforcement on our streets provides to our communities, so I \nhope they will share my interest in protecting their rights.\n  The importance of protecting the rights of our police officers was \nbrought home to me and, I am sure, Senator Lautenberg through a case of \ntwo police officers in the State of New Jersey: New Jersey Police \nDetective David Lemongello and Officer Ken McGuire.\n\n  In 2001, they were seriously injured when a career criminal shot them \nwhile they were working undercover. This criminal was prohibited from \npurchasing a firearm but he obtained his gun illegally from a \ntrafficker. As it turns out, the trafficker also was prohibited from \nbuying weapons and had used a so-called straw purchaser to make \nmultiple gun purchases from a store in West Virginia.\n  The cash sale for thousands of dollars was so obviously suspicious \nthat the dealer apparently felt guilty. On the very same day, but after \nhe took the money and after the guns walked out the door, the dealer \ncalled into the ATF and identified him. But that was\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\nafter the guns were gone. Unfortunately, at the time of the sale the \ndealer apparently thought it was more important to make a profit than \nto protect the lives of innocent victims.\n  Sure enough, Officers Lemongello and McGuire paid a severe price for \nthat pawnshop's negligence. They suffered a serious injury and came \nvery close to losing their lives. Their families suffered from their \nloss and both of them lost their careers and are no longer able to \nserve as policemen.\n  I will read a direct statement from one of these officers, Ken \nMcGuire, because I think it expresses better than I can just how \noutrageous it would be for the Senate to strip them of their rights. \nThis is some of what Officer McGuire said:\n\n       During a stake-out, Detective Lemongello and I were shot by \n     a felon. I ended up getting into a gunfight with the criminal \n     in a snowy backyard. That has changed my life forever. I was \n     shot through the right femur, and it blew apart my femur and \n     also caused extensive damage to my leg. I was also shot \n     through my stomach, and it hit the mesenteric artery. I lost \n     17 units of blood that night. . . . Because of the injuries I \n     suffered from that shooting, I will never be a police officer \n     again.\n\n  That is the same for Officer Lemongello.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I've heard some people say, ``Well, criminals can just get \n     guns,'' as if there is nothing anybody can do to stop them \n     from getting guns. Well, guns don't fall from the sky, or \n     grow from trees, this one didn't either. The man who shot us \n     got the gun because of an irresponsible gun dealer in West \n     Virginia . . . who sold 12 handguns to a straw purchaser who \n     gave them to a gun trafficker. What legitimate reason would \n     two people have to buy 12 handguns? . . . Why wouldn't the \n     gun dealer even ask the purchaser: Why would you need 12 \n     guns? Why? Did I mention the purchasers paid for all of this \n     in cash? If there is any doubt of the destination of these \n     guns, which was northern New Jersey, months earlier I \n     arrested a suspect with the same gun make and model from the \n     same shipment in town.\n\n  Officer McGuire continues:\n\n       We have filed a lawsuit in West Virginia to hold the \n     irresponsible dealer accountable. The dealer argued in court \n     that it had no responsibility to use reasonable care in its \n     business, but a judge in West Virginia disagreed. She ruled \n     that we have a legitimate case under West Virginia law, and \n     that a jury should decide whether this dealer acted \n     reasonably.\n       That's all I want today: my day in court, to exercise my \n     right as an American to present my case before a jury of my \n     peers and let them decide, under the law, whether these gun \n     sellers were reasonable or whether they contributed to my \n     shooting.\n\n  Officer McGuire says:\n\n       If this bill is passed, Congress will be changing the laws \n     for gun sellers, overruling the West Virginia judge, and \n     taking away our rights. That is shameful.\n\n  I think it is, too.\n\n       I call on all Senators to do everything in their power to \n     prevent this bill from becoming law.\n\n  That was the message from Officer McGuire, but it could have just as \neasily come from the countless other law enforcement officers who have \nbeen injured or killed by guns trafficked by irresponsible gun dealers \nand manufacturers.\n  I was talking to Senator Durbin about a situation in Chicago. There \nis case after case. How can any of us look into the eyes of any of \nthese officers, such as Officer McGuire, and tell them we are going to \ntake away their rights? How can we tell David Lemongello he risked his \nlife on behalf of our community, and he almost lost it because of an \nirresponsible gun dealer, he will be suffering from the attack for the \nrest of his life but if he wants to go to court, if he wants justice, \nour answer to him is no?\n  Remember, the question before the Senate is not whether these two \npolice officers, or any police officer, has a good case. It is simply \nwhether they have a right to make their case. It is whether they have a \nright to try to convince a jury that a gun dealer acted irresponsibly \nand whether they deserve compensation as a result.\n  I do not call this a frivolous lawsuit. I consider this a right for a \nlaw enforcement officer to have a right to make their case in court \nbefore a jury. This bill would deny them that day in court. Not only \nwould it strip these two heroes of their legal rights, it would do so \nretroactively.\n  I know we are going to hear about narrowly defined exceptions that \nwill not allow for it. I do not think law enforcement officers should \nbe limited in their ability to make their case before a jury. As far as \nI am concerned, it is an affront to these officers and an insult to \nevery police officer who puts his or her life on the line for the \ncommunity, and it sends precisely the wrong message when we are \nsupposed to be enhancing homeland security and reinforcing the risks \nthat people are taking to protect our families and our communities \nacross this country.\n  My amendment is very simple. In fact, I will read it word for word:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, nothing in \n     this Act shall be construed as limiting the right of an \n     officer or an employee of any Federal, State or local law \n     enforcement agency to recover damages authorized under \n     Federal or State law.\n\n  I suspect we will hear about amendments that draw these narrow lines \nof exception. Why is it that a law enforcement officer cannot go into a \ncourt and get redress if they have been wronged in the illegal sale or \nthe negligent sale of firearms to criminals? I do not get it.\n  That is the entire amendment. That is what we are working on. In \nessence, this amendment stands for the proposition that we should not \nstrip police officers of their rights. It says that members of law \nenforcement who are victims of gun violence should have their day in \ncourt--no new rights, nothing guaranteed, just their day in court.\n  The advocates of this legislation argue that it is necessary to \nprevent frivolous litigation. I think they are wrong. But does this \nSenate really believe that law enforcement officers are flooding the \ncourts with frivolous lawsuits? Is that what our law enforcement \nofficers are doing? Do we really believe that men and women who devote \ntheir lives to enforcing our laws are trivializing the judicial \nprocess, that Congress needs to take away their rights because they \nare? I do not believe that and I do not believe anybody in this body \ndoes.\n\n  There is no evidence of it, and even to suggest it seems out of place \ngiven the trust that we give to these men and women in our local \ncommunities.\n  Our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line for us every \nday. The least they should be able to expect from us is that we would \nnot strip away their rights when they suffer from gun violence, and \nthat is what I think we are doing. I hope my colleagues will stand with \nme and the men and women of law enforcement and support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CORZINE. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 5 minutes 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I yield to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and good friend \nfrom New Jersey with whom I have worked very closely on many issues. \nThere is not anything that we have done that binds us more closely than \nthis action because we are witnessing it firsthand. We talked to the \ntwo officers who were mentioned in Senator Corzine's commentary.\n  To me, this whole situation is surreal. The fact is, when there is a \nphoto opportunity with a cop who is in uniform, we can see him chased \nby six Senators to get a picture taken with him. When there are \ntownhall meetings, Senators will talk about how brave those cops are \nand that what they do is they put their lives on the line each and \nevery day, and many of their families may be thinking that just maybe \nthey may not see daddy coming back from work.\n  And here, the hard cold hearts are saying, well, listen, put your \nback on the line, put yourself on the line, but do not expect that we \nare going to help you collect any damages. You can be the breadwinner \nin the family, the only working person in the family. When that person \nis shot and killed, the incomes rarely continue for a significant \nperiod of time with enough income to take care of a family.\n\n  What do you tell a family which has a couple of children and a spouse \ndependent on the wages of that police officer? You tell them, Well, \nlook, just remember one thing. It is like being a pilot in the \nmilitary. You could go out\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\nand lose your life. The difference is the military takes some care of \nyou. There are insurance programs, other programs. Many of these small \npolice departments don't have the kind of resources to provide on their \nown for the well-being of those families.\n  This is an outrage that is being perpetrated on these law enforcement \npeople. It is an outrage. I hope the public understands what we are \ndoing here. We want the people to work in those dangerous jobs, but we \ndon't want to let them on their own go to the courts. That is the \nprocess in this country of ours. We will not let them go to court to \nsee if there are any damages. They never repair the damage to the mind. \nThey never repair the damage to the heart. You can't repair the damage \nto the soul. But we at least ought to be able to say: Listen, if you \ncan bring a suit that shows either the manufacturer or the distributor \nor the retailer, like the shop in Oregon, was negligent in their \nhandling of the weapon--no safeguards on these weapons--we ought to be \nable to say to them, if anything happens to you, you can go to court \nand you can seek damages.\n  But there is a group here who says no, we want to take away your \nright to sue. Do you know why? Because the NRA doesn't like it--putting \nit straight up. The NRA doesn't want that to happen. The NRA writes the \nlegislation, for goodness sake. They don't want it to be available. \nThey don't want these people to have the same rights everybody else \nhas. If you are killed in an airplane crash or a car crash or \notherwise, you have a right to go to court.\n  I have heard the story about product liability. We are not going \nthrough that again. We don't worry about product liability. We worry \nabout negligence and recklessness and you are blocked from bringing \nsuit. It is outrageous.\n  In the year 2003, 148 law enforcement officers across the nation were \nkilled in the line of duty; 52 of those fallen officers were shot to \ndeath. I would like it if the managers of the bill who so desperately \nwant this to pass would go to those families and say: You know what, we \nare sorry. Gosh, Joe was a good guy. We heard about him. He was a Boy \nScout leader, all of those things. But that is the nature of the job. \nSo you lost him. Go find another way, Madam Smith, to see if you can \nsupport your kids. See if you can get a job. You may have to leave the \nkids at home because you don't have enough money to take care of them \nand buy other things.\n  Every law enforcement officer fatality is a national tragedy. The \nonly place it doesn't ring true is here. They don't want you to have \nthe same rights ordinary citizens have when they are injured. It is \nincredible to me.\n  We go through semantic schemes here about: No, it doesn't really mean \nthat. But it does block their right to collect damages if they are \ninjured.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the Senator from New \nJersey has expired. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

That's why the Major Cities \n     Chiefs Association and other law enforcement groups have \n     joined Chief Bratton to forcefully oppose this dangerous \n     bill.\n\n     A cop's worst nightmare: Bull's Eye and the D.C. area snipers\n\n       Just 1% of gun dealers supply 57% of the guns used in \n     crimes. Consider, for example, Bull's Eye Shooter Supply of \n     Tacoma, Washington. Bull's Eye ``lost'' the assault rifle \n     used by the D.C. area snipers to murder 12 people. In three \n     years it managed to ``lose 237 other guns, as well. In all it \n     supplied guns traced to at least 52 crimes. If the Senate \n     caves and this bill passes, dealers like Bull's Eye will get \n     off scot-free and the NRA will win a victory for its \n     extremist agenda.\n\n     Stand with America's Police: Go to our website: STOPtheNRA.com\n\n       Polls show that 2 out of 3 Americans want irresponsible gun \n     merchants such as the dealer that armed the D.C. area snipers \n     held accountable. But we must make our voices heard--or the \n     NRA's money and lobbying will prevail. Go to \n     www.STOPtheNRA.com and sign our petition so we can send your \n     name to the senators who support this outrageous bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief and yield back the \nremainder of my time. Of course, our amendment will be set aside. I \nwill offer a Frist-Craig amendment. I hope we can limit the time on \nthat. All are encouraging we vote sooner rather than later.\n  I must say, one of the strengths of the underlying bill, S. 1805, is \nit adopted the same rules for all plaintiffs, no matter how sympathetic \nor how unsympathetic; no matter how notorious or how mundane the \ncircumstances of their victimization. It creates the kind of legal \nstandards in this country we believe all people should stand under.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is a man who creates law. The picture \nbeside him is of a man who enforces law. We have obvious and open \nrespect for both, and we should in this country, because we are a \ncountry of laws. That gentleman you talked about so eloquently who is \npictured beside you is a man who puts on the uniform every day and goes \nin harm's way. There is no doubt about it. There is not a Senator on \nthis floor who doesn't respect men and women in uniform, whether they \nbe civil police in this country or are men and women in the armed \nservices.\n  At the same time, that man enforces law. His life oftentimes is put \nin much more jeopardy by plea-bargaining the criminal back onto the \nstreet day after day in urban America, and they have to go out and \nrearrest them and rearrest them again. Tragically enough, those \ncriminals go out and steal guns. Sometimes they buy them. And sometimes \nthey lie when they buy them. But most of them are stopped by background \nchecks today. That officer has to face them again.\n  We understand that principle. That is the history of America. That is \nthe history of law enforcement. The great tragedy today in law is \ncriminal law, in my opinion, that we keep kicking them back to the \nstreets instead of doing the time for the crime and causing that \ngentleman to have to go out and face them once again because they are a \nrepeat, repeat, repeat offender.\n  What S. 1805 attempts to establish is plaintiffs' rights should be \ndependent on settled principles of law, not emotion and not sympathy. \nIf a lawsuit has enough merit under traditional tort standards to be \nallowed by the bill, we believe that cause of action should be \navailable to all plaintiffs, regardless of their occupation or their \nemployer or whether particularly an attacker had harmed them. In other \nwords, we are not suggesting there be carve-outs and special \nexemptions.\n  But clearly, and I can argue and the Senator has already said, I \nwould come back to those five very key exceptions we have placed in S. \n1805. I am not going to repeat those. I have repeated them several \ntimes tonight. They are in the bill. They are in the bill a majority of \nthe Senators here support, Democrat and Republican. Why do they? \nBecause they bring stability to the law. They create clear standards. \nThey don't say that a law-abiding citizen producing a lawful product is \nsomehow liable if someone takes it and misuses it; that the person who \nmisuses it is the person who ought to be liable. That person ought to \nbe the criminal, if so found guilty. That is a premise of the law and \nit is an important premise of the law.\n  I hope my colleagues tonight will oppose the Corzine amendment. It \nguts the underlying bill. I doubt the Senator from New Jersey planned \nto vote for S. 1805. I can't view this as a friendly amendment. I don't \nthink it is intended to be. I think it is intended to tear down the \nfundamental structure built under S. 1805, to establish solid \nprinciples, clear understandings, not to allow junk lawsuits to move \nthrough, but to allow that gentleman pictured beside you his day in \ncourt. Because the courthouse door is not locked. The opportunity to \nargue before the judge still remains so that suit can be filed, so that \ncase can move on if the principles of the law are met and the standards \nmeet the test.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time and ask the Corzine \namendment be laid aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2630\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I send to the desk the Frist amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for Mr. Frist for \n     himself and Mr. Craig, proposes an amendment numbered 2630.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the rights of law enforcement officers who are \n victimized by crime to secure compensation from those who participate \n                      in the arming of criminals)\n\n       On page 9, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       (E) Law enforcement exception.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to limit the right of an officer or employee of \n     any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency to \n     recover damages authorized under Federal or State law in a \n     civil action that meets 1 of the requirements under clauses \n     (i) through (v) of subparagraph (A).\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be brief. I think our colleagues wish that of us \ntonight. This amendment is not unlike the amendment the Senate accepted \na few moments ago in relation to the Mikulski amendment. Let me read \nit. It is every bit as simple and straightforward as the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Jersey:\n\n       Law enforcement exception--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to limit the right of an officer or employee of any \n     Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency to recover \n     damages authorized under Federal or State law in a civil \n     action that meets 1 of the requirements under clause (i) \n     through (v) of subparagraph (A).\n\n  Of course, I have read that subparagraph and all of those exceptions \nto you time and time again over the last several days.\n  We believe it is clear-cut. We believe that creates the stability \nwithin the law. It sets in motion something very important; that is, \nthe old principle of tort law--that it is the individual who is guilty \nfor their actions and they should not be trying to reach through layers \nupon layers of acts to find somebody who produced a quality product and \nsay you are guilty because you produced it and, therefore, you ought\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\nto pay because somebody misused and damaged or took someone's life. We \nhave never done that as a country, and we shouldn't. We have found \nnegligence, and we should where it exists, where there has been \nwillingness, where there has been a violation of law that is found. \nPeople ought to pay the price if they don't play by the rules.\n  In the gun community, I know how important this right is in America, \nand with this right goes phenomenal responsibility.\n  This Senate, time and time again, down through the decades has \nestablished very specifically those responsibilities because we view \nthis as an extremely valuable right.\n  I say to the Senator from New Jersey that I am not going to keep that \npoliceman out of the courthouse. I and Americans respect him and his \nprofession too much to say you cannot go after redress, but you must \nfind that the laws that you enforce are the same laws that you respect \nand must live by.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, who controls time in opposition to the \nCraig amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority manager controls the time. That \nwould be the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island, and I thank the \nPresiding Officer.\n  The Senator from Idaho says when he wrote this bill, he did it \nwithout emotion and without sympathy. Clearly, if he is going to oppose \nthis amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey, then he is doing \nit without sympathy for the 54 law enforcement officers who are killed \neach year in the line of duty with guns. That is what the Senator said.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course I will not because you would not yield when you \nhad the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Fine. I will take my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will say this to the Senator from Idaho: It is hard for \nme to imagine, to believe that you believe that a lawsuit brought by \nthat police officer or his family for being shot in the line of duty is \na junk lawsuit as you have characterized these over and over again. The \nSenator from Idaho should join me in the city of Chicago where I have \nvisited officers of that police force shot in the line of duty who are \nquadriplegic for the rest of their lives because a gang banger shot \nthem in the line of duty. And you tell that officer and his family--the \nSenator from Idaho should tell that officer and his family--that if \nthey are going to seek redress from a gun dealer who sold those guns to \nthe gang bangers, that that lawsuit for that officer and his family is \na junk lawsuit--a junk lawsuit. Please.\n  How in the world can we in the Senate stand here and pronounce our \nadmiration and respect for the men and women in uniform who protect us \nevery single day, and then when they are stricken in the line of duty, \nwhen they are shot defending us, tell them when they want to go against \nthe gun dealers who put these junk guns on the street, these Saturday \nnight specials through straw purchasers and gun traffickers, that that \nlawsuit brought by that officer and his family is a junk lawsuit that \nyou want to stop with this legislation?\n  That troubles me. It troubles me because, frankly, I think we \nunderstand if we are going to ask anyone in our community to risk their \nlives every single day for us by wearing that badge and that uniform, \nwe owe them something more than words. We should be standing by them \nwhen they, frankly, give their lives and risk their lives for us every \nsingle day.\n  The choice we have with the Corzine amendment is a clear choice: \nStand by the police or stand by the gun dealers. The Senator from Idaho \nsays we need to stand by the gun dealers; that this is a jobs bill. We \nneed to stand by the gun manufacturers; this is a jobs bill. What about \nthe men and women in uniform and our law enforcement agencies across \nAmerica? What about their jobs? Are they worth standing by or standing \nby their families?\n  I say to those who are going to oppose the Corzine amendment that if \nyou have a problem in your neighborhood and there is crime in the \nneighborhood, don't call 9-1-1. No, dial up your local gun dealer \nbecause if you dial 9-1-1, you are going to get one of these policemen \nwho just might get hurt and file a junk lawsuit. You had better dial up \nthat gun dealer. Call the gun dealer and ask him to please come out and \nprotect your family.\n  I cannot imagine that we are going to allow this to occur. The Frist-\nCraig amendment is meaningless when it says whatever the bill said \noriginally it applies to law enforcement officials. It doesn't do a \nthing for them.\n  The Corzine amendment does. It says we are going to stand behind the \npolice. If he is shot in the line of duty, we will stand by him and his \nfamily to go after the wrongdoer and the gun dealer who is selling \nthose guns to the gang bangers and street killers, the cop killers on \nthe street.\n  If you want to vote for the Frist-Craig amendment in this underlying \nbill, frankly, we are turning our back on those men and women who are \nrisking their lives every single day for us.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for this amendment. We should be \noffering this amendment not only for law enforcement officials but for \nfirefighters, medical responders, and every single person in America \nwho puts their life on the line for us every single day and risk death \nby firearms because this underlying bill is saying to them, if you are \nhurt and you sue, you are filing a junk lawsuit.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I ask how much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 12 minutes 28 \nseconds. The Senator from Rhode Island has 9 minutes 49 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Sessions.\n  I am not going to respond to the Senator from Illinois only to say \nthat he impugned my heart. He suggested I was a person without \nsympathy. I have never done that to him. I believe he is a person of \ngoodwill who comes here to represent the citizens of the State of \nIllinois.\n  When I talk about sympathy, I talk about the impartiality of law. He \nis an attorney and I am not. He knows that the law is impartial and it \nis clear.\n  So I must tell you that I grit my teeth a little bit when he suggests \nthat this Senator has no passion or concern for the loss of life. That \nis a step too far.\n  Let me yield 5 minutes to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was a prosecutor for a number of \nyears. Some of my best friends are police officers. I try to meet with \nthem when I am in my State. I met with 11 or 12 of them in Cherokee on \nthe Georgia line last week. They are not telling me that if they are \nshot or one of their fellow officers are shot they want to sue the gun \nmanufacturers. None of them have ever suggested that to me. They \nbelieve that criminals with guns ought to be prosecuted aggressively \nand go to jail for it when they catch them. They ought to be punished. \nAnd if they shoot and kill a police officer, they want to see them go \nto jail or be executed. A lot of people who are opposing this \nlegislation oppose the death penalty for those who kill police \nofficers.\n  The point of this is very simple. In American law, from our ancient \ntraditions, wrongdoers are the people who ought to be sued. If a \nterrorist comes in here and shoots a policeman, a cold-blooded criminal \nshoots any American citizen, you should sue the person who shot you. \nThat is what we are all about. That is what the law has been about.\n  Now we are in a situation in which the law has been politicized and \nused to carry out an agenda. To say that a gun dealer or a gun \nmanufacturer that has complied with all the extensive regulations for \nthe sale of firearms, has done everything right, that somehow they \nshould be the ones to be sued if a criminal in an intervening action \nobtains a weapon from another person perhaps and commits a crime with \nit and shoots someone, that is not what\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\nAmerican law is about. It is an abuse of the liability system in \nAmerica. It is consistent with current law and our traditions. It is \nwhy, to date, none of these lawsuits against gun manufacturers has been \nsuccessful and why few are successful against gun dealers.\n\n  However, if a gun manufacturer or if a gun dealer, in particular, \nsells a weapon contrary to the complex and detailed regulations the \nFederal Government, State, and cities required, that person can be not \nonly sued for damages, that person can be prosecuted.\n  When I was a Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted criminals who used \nguns; I prosecuted gun dealers who sold guns illegally. They have to \nget an ID from the purchaser. They make him sign an affidavit that he \nis not a felon. They do a gun check. They have to be a resident of the \nState, as I recall. They cannot be a drug addict. If they know there is \nan impropriety and sell the gun anyway, they can be responsible and be \nsued for it and should be--and should be prosecuted, for that matter.\n  What we need to focus on in America today is that the Constitution of \nthis country allows the American people to keep and bear arms. Those \nwho do not agree, get over it. That is where the American people are. \nThat is what the Constitution says. That is what the rules are. If you \nwant to offer legislation to put further controls on the right of an \nindividual in America to keep and bear arms, put it out here and let's \ndebate it and see if it has enough votes to win.\n  This idea of mayors, attorneys general, district attorneys, and \ngovernmental officials filing lawsuits against gun manufacturers who \ncomplied with the law, to try to make them responsible in an end run \neffort to carry out an antigun agenda in some of our big, liberal \ncities in America--they do not understand where most Americans are \nabout hunting and guns--is improper. It is not the way we ought to go \nabout this business.\n  The Senator from Idaho is correct; this liability question is one we \nneed to deal with. There is a concerted effort in America to utilize \nthe legal system in some of our liberal courts to try to knock down the \nright to manufacture and sell guns. It is protected by Federal law. It \nis controlled by Federal law. It is mandated by Federal law. People who \ncomply with the law should not be sued. If they do not comply, they \nshould be sued and prosecuted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me make two or three quick points and \nthen yield to Senator Lautenberg and then to Senator Corzine.\n  First, a neutral assessment of this legislation suggests strongly \nthat it is not just frivolous lawsuits that are going to be barred by \nthis legislation; there are going to be many meritorious lawsuits. We \nalready know about these suits. We know about Officer McGuire; we know \nabout the victims of the Washington snipers. Those individuals will be \nbarred from courts. Those are not frivolous suits.\n  Again, there has been discussion about junk cases. I believe there \nwill be a lot of junk guns on the streets because essentially what this \nlegislation does is this. When a Federal firearms dealer gets his \nlicense, he also gets a license to be negligent. He can follow the \nrules but he can be negligent. There is no Federal legislation or State \nlegislation, in many cases, that requires the storage at a facility of \nweapons, so you can leave them lying around. That is what they \napparently did at Bull's Eye.\n\n  That is negligence, and that negligence harmed several individuals. \nAnd this particular law, if adopted, will prevent people from \nexercising their rights for compensation based upon that activity.\n  All this discussion leads to the inescapable belief on my part that \nthe proponents want it both ways. They stand here and decry the attack \non the industry, the gun industry besieged by lawsuits, and then turn \nand say: Of course, Officer Lemongello will get to court and Officer \nMcGuire will get to court and the sniper victims will get to court. \nThey cannot have it both ways.\n  The law is not impartial. The law is what we make it. We are making a \nlaw today that favors, in an unprecedented fashion, the gun industry, \ngun dealers, and the National Rifle Association. That is our making. It \nis not some cosmic event taking place and suddenly we have the law. We \nare telling them, be negligent, be irresponsible, be reckless, do not \nworry about it, we have taken care of you.\n  What do we say to the victims of the crimes? Tough luck. You were in \nthe wrong place, officer. You were in the wrong place, Conrad Johnson, \nstarting your bus up early in the morning. Your family will never get a \nnickel from the companies or individuals who were negligent.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. REED. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask to have the Presiding Officer \ncall attention to the fact when I have 30 seconds remaining.\n  We listen to the same rhetoric, decry the risk that our law \nenforcement people take when they go out to work and how we really \nrespect them--except that we do not want to give them the same \nenvironment that every ordinary citizen in this country has.\n  We hear about the fact that if you get the criminals off the streets \nand they do not come out again, and then they go back again, what does \nit have to do with whether or not we block the suit from law \nenforcement personnel who have been injured, who have families who want \nredress for them having been killed at work? It has nothing to do with \nit.\n  That is the whole thing. It is an obfuscation of what this bill is \nabout. This bill does not change a bit with this amendment. It just \nreinforces what the bill says, and that is, take away people's rights \nto sue, people's rights for redress. Whether it is an errant gun \nmanufacturer, a dealer, a distributor, an errant airline, or an errant \ncar manufacturer, people should have the right to sue.\n  There have been opinions thrown around that, unfortunately, do not \nmatch that of a distinguished attorney such as David Boies who says \nthis bill will cause a dismissal of the suit of Lemongello and McGuire \nimmediately. The proposed immunity legislation would require the \nimmediate dismissal of these claims.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record what the office \nof David Boies, one of the most prominent criminal attorneys in the \ncountry, has confirmed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Lemongello v. Will Company, No. Civ.A. 02-C-2952, 2003 WL \n     21488208 (W. Va. Cir. Ct. Mar. 19, 2003). New Jersey Police \n     Detective David Lemongello and Officer Kenneth McGuire were \n     seriously injured in January 2001 when they were shot by a \n     career criminal while performing undercover police work. Even \n     though the shooter was a person prohibited by law from \n     purchasing a firearm, he obtained his weapon, a nine \n     millimeter semi-automatic Ruger handgun, illegally from a gun \n     trafficker. The trafficker, in turn, was also prohibited from \n     buying weapons due to a prior felony, so he used an \n     accomplice (a so-called ``straw purchaser'') to make multiple \n     gun purchases from defendant Will Jewelry & Loan, in West \n     Virginia. In their lawsuit against Will Jewelry & Loan and \n     others, the officers allege that the gun dealer acted \n     negligently in selling the straw purchaser twelve guns \n     (including the Ruger used in the shooting of the two \n     officers) that had been selected in person by the gun \n     trafficker and paid for in a single cash transaction. The \n     circumstances of that sale were so suspect that the defendant \n     dealer reported it to the AFT--but only after the purchase \n     price had been collected and the guns had left the store. The \n     officers' suit further charges gun manufacturer Sturm Ruger & \n     Company with negligently failing to monitor and train its \n     distributors and dealers and negligently failing to prevent \n     them from engaging in straw and multiple firearm sales. \n     Although a West Virginia trial court has held that the \n     plaintiffs have stated valid negligence and public nuisance \n     claims under state law, the proposed immunity legislation \n     would require the immediate dismissal of those claims. \n     Notwithstanding the plaintiffs' claims that the defendants \n     failed to exercise reasonable care in their sales of \n     firearms, neither the dealer nor the manufacturer violated \n     any statutory prohibition in selling the guns. Nor could the \n     plaintiffs contend that their case falls within the \n     ``negligent entrustment'' exception to the proposed immunity \n     legislation because the gun dealer supplied the firearm to a \n     straw purchaser--not to someone whom the seller knew or \n     should have known was likely to, and did, use the\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\n     product in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical \n     injury to the person or others.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Many police officers and police chiefs wrote in their \nopposition to this bill, law enforcement personnel from various police \ndepartments around the country, including Chief William Musser of \nMeridian, OH, Police Department. He writes that he is opposed to this. \nWe have officers from other States as well, including Chief Cory Lynn \nfrom Ketchum, ID, Police Department, in opposition to this legislation.\n  This letter was printed in the Record of yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Mr. Corzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, the issue before the Senate is pretty \nclear. This is a simple principle: Will we protect law enforcement \nofficers such as Officer Lemongello from losing their rights under this \nbill or won't we?\n  The fact is, the narrow drawing of these exemptions is going to take \ncases like I identified in my opening remarks--such as buying guns in \nWest Virginia from a negligent dealer, who admitted, themselves, on the \nsame day they had a problem; and it went into the courts--and we are \ngoing to take away their rights to sue. This will not fit under those \nlegal constraints.\n  The amendment is clear and straightforward. It says that nothing in \nthis legislation will limit the legal rights of law enforcement \npersonnel. All my amendment does is open that up. There are no \nconditions. There are no caveats. It is clear. It is simple. My \namendment does not add any new rights. It just guarantees that officers \nwill not lose any.\n  I am emotional about these individuals who put their lives on the \nline all the time. I accept that others feel the same way. But we \nshould not be taking away the rights of these individuals to get into a \ncourt and not only pursue the person who perpetrated the crime, but if \nsomeone has facilitated that crime, because they have been negligent, \nthat ought to be also someone who is subject to the law.\n  I think we are doing just the opposite. The Frist-Craig amendment is \ncompletely meaningless in this context because it is exactly the same \nlanguage that is already in the bill. It is transparent and does not \nchange a thing.\n  This officer will not be able to get into a court of law. This \nofficer will lose his right to sue. That is not right. It is not right \nfor the other 52 American police officers who lost their lives in 2002 \nor 2003, and the many, many who have been injured.\n  I don't understand why we don't want to give them the rights they \ndeserve under our Constitution. This is not about whether you have a \nright to bear arms. This is not about the second amendment. This is \nabout having the right, when there is negligence and criminal behavior, \nto go into a court of law and protect yourself.\n  We are doing it for law enforcement--for law enforcement--not just \ngenerally. These are not frivolous suits. These are people who know the \nlaw. They are not bringing up frivolous suits, and I do not think I am \nhearing that. So if we are not going to have frivolous lawsuits, which \nis the argument we are trying to make, we need this legislation.\n  Why are we taking away the right to sue from law enforcement across \nthis country? I ask my colleagues to stand with me. I think we are \nundermining the safety and the security and the principles and the \nrights of law enforcement. I think the Senate ought to be standing with \nlaw enforcement to make sure they are protected. If we vote no against \nmy amendment, we are doing the opposite. I hope we will stand strong \nand stand firmly with law enforcement because that is what we need to \ndo if we say we appreciate what they are doing for our families and our \ncommunities.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand the opposition has yielded \nback all their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be as brief as possible. The hour is late.\n  I know the Senator from New Jersey speaks with a good heart, and I \nappreciate that. I think we all do. He mentioned two important words \njust in the last of his closing debate. He mentioned the word \n``criminal,'' criminal action, the right to sue, and he mentioned \n``negligence'' and the right to sue. Then he said: We block that \npoliceman from the courthouse door.\n  I must ask him to return to page 7 of the bill, exception one and \nexception two:\n\n       an action brought against a transferor convicted under \n     section 924(h) of title 18, United States Code, or a \n     comparable or identical State felony law, by a party directly \n     harmed by the conduct of which the transferee is so \n     convicted. . . .\n\n  He is talking about criminal action. That action is deemed as a \ncriminal act in the law.\n  How about negligence? Well, it is the next one down.\n  It is No. 2:\n\n       an action brought against a seller for negligent \n     entrustment or negligence per se. . . .\n\n  Let me tell you what the FOP says. I think we all know what the FOP \nis. That is the Fraternal Order of Police, some 311,000 strong. They \noppose the Corzine amendment. We have just visited with them. They \ncalled us and they said: Why? Because they do not believe it \naccomplishes what they would like accomplished, and they like the \nunderlying law.\n  I think it is fundamentally important that we try to build clean \nprinciples within the law. I would have to agree with the Senator from \nNew Jersey that policeman is not going to file or have his attorneys \nfile a junk lawsuit. The Senator is absolutely right. But 31 apparently \nhave been filed, some are under appeals, and 21 of them have been \nthrown out of court by judges who said: Go away, because that is what \nthis lawsuit is.\n  Now, oftentimes the municipality and/or the individuals and/or the \ncounty will file it in the name of a fallen officer. I can understand \nthe emotion. I think we all feel it. But the judge said the law is the \nlaw and there was no basis, and he threw them out. Yet it cost the \nindustry--the law-abiding industry--hundreds of millions of dollars. It \nis beginning to weaken many of our legitimate, legal gun manufacturers, \nthat oftentimes build the firearm that officer carries on his side to \nprotect himself and his fellow officers in the commission of their \nresponsibilities.\n  We should not be doing that as a country. But clearly we must insist \nthat the law be clear, unambiguous, and that the officer have his day \nin court if he is harmed by a criminal or by someone who has acted in a \ncriminal way, someone who has violated the law, someone, through \nnegligence, has somehow caused a firearm to get into the hands of a \ncriminal.\n  Then the case is brought, and S. 1805 does not block that.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays on the Frist-Craig amendment and the Corzine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking the yeas and nays on \nboth amendments with one show of hands?\n  Mr. CRAIG. If there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The yeas \nand nays are requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 2630. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), and the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Ms. Murkowski) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 34, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 21 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Corzine\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Campbell\n     Domenici\n     Edwards\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Murkowski\n  The amendment (No. 2630) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2629\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next order of business is consideration of \nthe Corzine amendment. There are 2 minutes equally divided to be \nfollowed by a vote. The yeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. In fact, I \nwill read it:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, nothing in \n     this Act shall be construed as limiting the right of an \n     officer or employee of any Federal, State or local law \n     enforcement agency to recover damages authorized under \n     Federal or State law.\n\n  This is a police officer who was shot, injured, and is no longer able \nto work in New Jersey. Fifty-two were killed in 2002 by guns in the \nhands of criminals, sold negligently--people should have the ability to \ngo to court and get redress. These are not junk lawsuits, not frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  Law enforcement officers ought to have the ability to protect their \nrights in court. They should have their day in court. That is what this \namendment does, and the narrow definitions that are allowed for in the \nunderlying bill will keep Officers McGuire and Lemongello out of court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to vote against the \nCorzine amendment. I ask it on behalf of the Fraternal Order of Police, \nsome 311,000 strong, who oppose this amendment, who oppose a special \ncarve-out in a law that is meant to treat all fairly and equitably. \nThis amendment would gut the underlying bill, S. 1805, and I ask my \ncolleagues to oppose it and vote against it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2629. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have worked a long day and through what \nthis time last night was appearing to be a very complicated unanimous \nconsent. But I think it flowed well today. All of our colleagues worked \nhard, and we have been able to meet all but one vote we had on that \nunanimous consent.\n  It is my understanding that it is possible Senator Bingaman will \noffer his amendment in the morning.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend will yield, on our side, \nSenator Dayton will be here in the morning to offer his amendment. \nFollowing that, Senator Levin will offer an amendment. Senator Bingaman \nwishes to offer his amendment on Monday.\n  I also say to my friend that Senator Reed has told me he will come \ntomorrow or Monday to start laying the groundwork for his amendment and \nthe amendment with Senator Feinstein. The votes on those amendments \nwill occur Tuesday morning. When they get the floor, they can talk \nabout their amendments either tomorrow or Monday.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \ncooperation in working with us to facilitate this bill today, to move \nit in a timely way and get the votes necessary throughout the day. He \nhas worked hard, along with all of us, to get that accomplished. We \nhave had several votes.\n  Let me also thank, midway through this, my staff and certainly the \nstaff of the Judiciary Committee and others who worked to make sure we \nhad the information in a timely way to move forward.\n  It is my understanding this is the last vote of the day.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of this most important \nlegislation. In fact, I am a cosponsor of this bill, which is sponsored \nby Senators Craig and Baucus.\n  This legislation protects firearm and ammunition manufacturers from \nlawsuits related to deliberate and illegal misuse of their products. \nEven more important, it protects the rights of Americans who choose to \nlegally purchase and use their products.\n  As a gun owner since I was a young boy, I strongly support the \nconstitutional right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms. \nThis constitutional right of responsible individuals should not be \ncompromised or jeopardized by a small handful who use firearms to \ncommit crimes.\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\n  In my native State of Nevada, many people own firearms and the vast \nmajority of them use their guns responsibly and safely. It is their \nright to do so, guaranteed in the United States Constitution. It is not \nsome privilege granted at the whim of Congress or any other part of \ngovernment. So I will work on a bipartisan basis to protect and \nsafeguard that right.\n  I will work to pass this bill, and I think we have the votes to pass \nit.\n  Toward the end of last year, we tried to consider this bill in the \nUnited States Senate. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time left in \nthe first session of this Congress to consider this bill in a fair \nmanner.\n  Now the time has come to pass this bill.\n  We will now debate and vote on the amendments that Senators want to \noffer to this bill, and then we will pass it. And when we do, we will \nbe standing up for the Constitution and the rights of every American \ncitizen.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nstatement from the Office of Compliance be entered into the Record \ntoday pursuant to section 303(b) of the Congressional Accountability \nAct of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1384(b)).\n\n\n                          office of compliance\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: Second Notice \n     of Proposed Amendments to the Procedural Rules.\n       Introductory statement:\n       On September 4, 2003, a Notice of Proposed Amendments to \n     the Procedural Rules of the Office of Compliance was \n     published in the Congressional Record at S11110, and H7944. \n     As specified by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (``Act'') at Section 303(b) (2 U.S.C.1384(b)), a 30 day \n     period for comments from interested parties ensued. In \n     response, the Office received a number of comments regarding \n     the proposed amendments.\n       At the request of a commenter, for good reason shown, the \n     Board of Directors extended the 30 day comment period until \n     October 20, 2003. The extension of the comment period was \n     published in the Congressional Record on October 2, 2003 at \n     H9209 and S12361.\n       On October 15, 2003, an announcement that the Board of \n     Directors intended to hold a hearing on December 2, 2003 \n     regarding the proposed procedural rule amendments was \n     published in the Congressional Record at H9475 and S12599. On \n     November 21, 2003, a Notice of the cancellation of the \n     December 2, 2003 hearing was published in the Congressional \n     Record at S15394 and H12304.\n       The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance has \n     determined to issue this Second Notice of Proposed Amendment \n     to the Procedural Rules, which includes changes to the \n     initial proposed amendments, together with a brief discussion \n     of each proposed amendment. As set forth in greater detail \n     herein below, interested parties are being afforded another \n     opportunity to comment on these proposed amendments.\n       The complete existing Procedural Rules of the Office of \n     Compliance may be found on the Office's web site: \n     www.compliance.gov.\n       How to submit comments:\n       Comments regarding the proposed amendments to the Rules of \n     Procedure of the Office of Compliance set forth in this \n     NOTICE are invited for a period of thirty (30) days following \n     the date of the appearance of this NOTICE in the \n     Congressional Record. In addition to being posted on the \n     Office of Compliance's section 508 compliant web site \n     (www.compliance.gov), this NOTICE is also available in the \n     following alternative formats: Large Print, Braille. Requests \n     for this NOTICE in an alternative format should be made to: \n     Bill Thompson, Executive Director, or Alma Candelaria, Deputy \n     Executive Director, Office of Compliance, at 202-724-9250 \n     (voice) or 202-426-1912 (TDD).\n       Submission of comments must be made in writing to the \n     Executive Director, Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, \n     S.E., Room LA-200, Washington, D.C. 20540-1999. It is \n     requested, but not required, that an electronic version of \n     any comments be provided on an accompanying computer disk. \n     Comments may also be submitted by facsimile to the Executive \n     Director at 202-426-1913 (a non-toll-free number.) Those \n     wishing to receive confirmation of the receipt of their \n     comments are requested to provide a self-addressed, stamped \n     post card with their submission.\n       Copies of submitted comments will be available for review \n     on the Office's web site at www.compliance.gov, and at the \n     Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, \n     D.C. 20540-1999, on Monday through Friday (non-Federal \n     holidays) between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.\n       Supplementary Information: The Congressional Accountability \n     Act of 1995 (CAA), PL 104-1, was enacted into law on January \n     23, 1995. The CAA applies the rights and protections of 11 \n     federal labor and employment statutes to covered employees \n     and employing offices within the Legislative Branch of \n     Government. Section 301 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381) \n     establishes the Office of Compliance as an independent office \n     within that Branch. Section 303 (2 U.S.C. 1383) directs that \n     the Executive Director, as the Chief Operating Officer of the \n     agency, adopt rules of procedure governing the Office of \n     Compliance, subject to approval by the Board of Directors of \n     the Office of Compliance. The rules of procedure generally \n     establish the process by which alleged violations of the laws \n     made applicable to the Legislative Branch under the CAA will \n     be considered and resolved. The rules include procedures for \n     counseling, mediation, and election between filing an \n     administrative complaint with the Office of Compliance or \n     filing a civil action in U.S. District Court. The rules also \n     include the procedures for processing Occupational Safety and \n     Health investigations and enforcement, as well as the process \n     for the conduct of administrative hearings held as the result \n     of the filing of an administrative complaint under all of the \n     statutes applied by the Act, and for appeals of a decision by \n     a hearing officer to the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance, and for the filing of an appeal of a decision by \n     the Board of Directors to the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Federal Circuit. The rules also contain other matters \n     of general applicability to the dispute resolution process \n     and to the operation of the Office of Compliance.\n       These proposed amendments to the Rules of Procedure are the \n     result of the experience of the Office in processing disputes \n     under the CAA during the period since the original adoption \n     of these rules in 1995.\n       How to read the proposed amendments:\n       The text of the proposed amendments shows [deletions within \n     brackets], and added text in italic. Textual additions which \n     have been made for the first time in this second notice of \n     the proposed amendments are shown as italicized bold.

Documents may be filed in person or \n     by mail, including express, overnight and other expedited \n     delivery. When specifically authorized by the Executive \n     Director, or by the Board of Directors in the case of an \n     appeal to the Board, any document may also be filed by \n     electronic transmittal in a designated format. Requests for \n     counseling under section 2.03, requests for mediation under \n     section 2.04 and complaints under section 5.01 of these rules \n     may also be filed by facsimile (FAX) transmission. . . . .\n       Discussion: The electronic filing option is in addition to \n     existing filing procedures, and represents the decision of \n     this agency to begin to explore the process of migration \n     toward electronic filing. In response to comments, the Board \n     has added Board of Directors authorization authority to \n     ensure that the Executive Director cannot unilaterally assume \n     Board authority regarding a matter pending before the Board. \n     Because of limits in available technology, it will remain \n     necessary to designate a particular format for electronic \n     transmittal. Requiring a designated format does not impose an \n     undue burden, since electronic filing is not required. \n     Stipulating a web address and system for confirmation of \n     receipt of electronic transmittal is not appropriate for a \n     formal rule, since all documents will not necessarily be \n     filed at the same address, and not all filing requires proof \n     of receipt. Not including such information also better \n     safeguards the security of document filing.\n       (d) Service or filing of documents by certified mail, \n     return receipt requested. Whenever these rules permit or \n     require service or filing of documents by certified mail, \n     return receipt requested, such documents may also be served \n     or filed by express mail or other forms of expedited delivery \n     in which proof of [[delivery to]] date of receipt by the \n     addressee is provided.\n       Discussion: Section 1.03(a)(2)(i) permits ``other expedited \n     delivery'' of documents being filed for which proof of \n     delivery is not required. However, there is no similar \n     provision with regard to certified mail, return receipt \n     requested. Such a service method is specifically required in \n     Sections 2.03(l), 2.04(i), and 5.01(e). Particularly in view \n     of the lengthened time required to process mail through the \n     U.S. Postal Service since 9-11, the Board has determined that \n     additional flexibility in the use of other mail delivery \n     services is also needed as an alternative to certified mail, \n     return receipt requested.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     1.05 Designation of Representative.\n\n       AMENDMENT DELETED (a) An employee, other charging \n     individual or party, a witness, a labor organization, an \n     employing office, an entity alleged to be responsible for \n     correcting a violation wishing to be represented by another \n     individual must file with the Office a written notice of \n     designation of representative. The representative may be, but \n     is not required to be, an attorney. [[During the period of \n     counseling and mediation, upon the request of a party, if the \n     Executive Director concludes that a representative of an \n     employee, of a charging party, of a labor organization, of an \n     employing office, or of an entity alleged to be responsible \n     for correcting a violation has a conflict of interest, the \n     Executive Director may, after giving the representative an \n     opportunity to respond, disqualify the representative. In \n     that event, the period for counseling or mediation may be \n     extended by the Executive Director for a reasonable time to \n     afford the party an opportunity to obtain another \n     representative.]]\n       Discussion: Upon further consideration, the Board has \n     deleted this proposed amendment. The Board does not agree \n     with the assertion by a commenter that the current version of \n     this rule is in excess of the authority of this Board under \n     the Act.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     2.03 Counseling.\n\n       (a) Initiating a Proceeding; Formal Request for Counseling. \n     In order to initiate a proceeding under these rules, an \n     employee shall [formally] file a written request for \n     counseling [from] with the Office regarding an alleged \n     violation of the Act, as referred to in section 2.01(a) \n     above. All [formal] requests for counseling shall be \n     confidential, unless the employee agrees to waive his or her \n     right to confidentiality under section 2.03(e)(2), below.\n       Discussion: The purpose of this amendment is to delete the \n     undefined term ``formal'', and require simply that the \n     request be made in written form. Several commenters suggested \n     that institution of a requirement that the counseling request \n     be in writing would constitute a ``waiver'' of the statutory \n     requirement of absolute confidentiality in counseling \n     mandated by section 416(a) of the Act. Requiring a written \n     counseling request does not constitute or suggest a \n     ``waiver'' of confidentiality in any way. Such a waiver may \n     only occur when ``the Office and a covered employee . . . \n     agree to notify the employing office of the allegations.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. 1416(a). The process for such a waiver is set out in \n     the existing Procedural Rules at section 2.03(e)(2), which \n     requires a written waiver form. A written request for \n     counseling is an entirely different document.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (c) When, How, and Where to Request Counseling. A [formal] \n     request for counseling must be in writing, and [: (1)] shall \n     be [made] filed with the Office of Compliance at Room LA-200, \n     110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999; \n     [[telephone 202-724-9250;]] FAX 202-426-1913; TDD 202-426-\n     1912, not later than 180 days after the alleged violation of \n     the Act.[; (2) may be made to the Office in person, by \n     telephone, or by written request; (3) shall be directed to: \n     Office of Compliance, Adams Building, Room LA-200, 110 Second \n     Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999; telephone 202-724-\n     9250; FAX 202-426-1913; TDD 202-426-1912.]\n       Discussion: This amendment conforms to the requirement that \n     a written request for counseling must be filed with the \n     Office.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (l) Conclusion of the Counseling Period and Notice. The \n     Executive Director shall notify the employee in writing of \n     the end of the counseling period, by certified mail, return \n     receipt requested, or by personal delivery evidenced by a \n     written receipt. The Executive Director, as part of the \n     notification of the end of the counseling period, shall \n     inform the employee of the right and obligation, should the \n     employee choose to pursue his or her claim, to file with the \n     Office a request for mediation within 15 days after receipt \n     by the employee of the notice of the end of the counseling \n     period.\n       Discussion: This amendment reflects the provision of \n     flexibility to the Office in providing notice. In response to \n     comments, we have added the requirement for appropriate \n     documentation in the case of personal delivery. A suggestion \n     that a copy of the end of counseling notice be served on \n     ``opposing counsel'' would cause a violation of the \n     confidentiality requirement for counseling required by \n     section 416(a) of the Act, and would contradict the non-\n     adversarial nature of counseling.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (m) Employees of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol \n     and the Capitol Police.\n       (1) Where an employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol or of the Capitol Police requests counseling under \n     the Act and\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\n     these rules, the Executive Director may recommend that the \n     employee use the grievance procedures of the Architect of the \n     Capitol or the Capitol Police. The term `grievance \n     procedures' refers to internal procedures of the Architect of \n     the Capitol and the Capitol Police that can provide a \n     resolution of the matter(s) about which counseling was \n     requested. Pursuant to section 401 of the Act and by \n     agreement with the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol \n     Police Board, when the Executive Director makes such a \n     recommendation, the following procedures shall apply:\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (ii) After having contacted the Office and having utilized \n     the grievance procedures of the Architect of the Capitol or \n     of the Capitol Police Board, the employee may notify the \n     Office that he or she wishes to return to the procedures \n     under these rules: (A) within [10] 60 days after the \n     expiration of the period recommended by the Executive \n     Director, if the matter has not [[been resolved]] resulted in \n     a final decision; or (B) within 20 days after service of a \n     final decision resulting from the grievance procedures of the \n     Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police Board.\n       (iii) The period during which the matter is pending in the \n     internal grievance procedure shall not count against the time \n     available for counseling or mediation under the Act. If the \n     grievance is resolved to the employee's satisfaction, the \n     employee shall so notify the Office within 20 days after the \n     employee has received service of the final decision resulting \n     from the grievance procedure. [[or i]] If no request to \n     return to the procedures under these rules is received within \n     [[the applicable time period]] 60 days after the expiration \n     of the period recommended by the Executive Director, the \n     Office will [[consider the case to be closed in its official \n     files]] issue a Notice of End of Counseling, as specified in \n     section 2.04(i) of these Rules.\n       Discussion: The amendment reflects the Board's conclusion \n     that controversies referred to agency grievance procedures \n     may be close to disposition at or near the end of the \n     stipulated referral period. In such circumstances, the \n     requirement for a return by the employee to the Office's \n     procedures within 10 days can actually have the effect of \n     disrupting the completion of the grievance process. \n     Therefore, the Board proposes an extension of that time frame \n     to 60 days. The time during which a controversy has been \n     referred to an agency grievance proceeding assumes that there \n     will have been joinder of issues between the employee and the \n     employing office. Certainly, there can be no doubt that the \n     employing office has been placed on notice of the existence \n     of the controversy. The amended proposal ensures that the \n     employee will not be penalized by reason of an employing \n     office's failure to process a grievance in a timely manner by \n     stipulating that the Office will issue an end of counseling \n     Notice to the parties 60 days after the end of the referral \n     period. A commenter's suggestion that the referral time frame \n     unlawfully extends counseling beyond the 30 day maximum \n     period ignores section 401 of the Act, which specifically \n     stipulates that all time during which a matter is referred to \n     the grievance procedures of the Architect of the Capitol or \n     the Capitol Police ``shall not count against the time \n     available for counseling or mediation.'' Issuing a Notice of \n     End of Counseling is preferable to administrative closure of \n     a case, since the closure may penalize an employee who is \n     still waiting for the employing office to issue a final \n     decision.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     2.04 Mediation.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (e) Duration and Extension.\n       (1) The mediation period shall be 30 days beginning on the \n     date the request for mediation is received, unless the Office \n     grants an extension.\n       (2) The Office may extend the mediation period upon the \n     joint written request of the parties or of the appointed \n     mediator on behalf of the parties to the attention of the \n     Executive Director. The request [may be oral or] shall be \n     written and [shall be noted and] filed with the Office no \n     later than the last day of the mediation period. The request \n     shall set forth the joint nature of the request and the \n     reasons therefor, and specify when the parties expect to \n     conclude their discussions. Request for additional extensions \n     may be made in the same manner. Approval of any extensions \n     shall be within the sole discretion of the Office.\n       Discussion: The amendment assures that an adequate record \n     of such a request be made. In response to comments, the Board \n     has added language allowing the assigned mediator to submit \n     the request on behalf of the parties.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (i) Conclusion of the Mediation Period and Notice. If, at \n     the end of the mediation period, the parties have not \n     resolved the matter that forms the basis of the request for \n     mediation, the Office shall provide the employee, and the \n     employing office, and their representatives, with written \n     notice that the mediation period has concluded. The written \n     notice to the employee will be sent by certified mail, return \n     receipt requested, or will be [hand] personally delivered, \n     evidenced by a written receipt, and it will also notify the \n     employee of his or her right to elect to file a complaint \n     with the Office in accordance with section 5.01 of these \n     rules or to file a civil action pursuant to section 408 of \n     the Act and section 2.06 of these rules.\n       Discussion: The purpose of this amendment is to reflect the \n     provision of the flexibility of personal delivery. In \n     response to comments, the Board has also formalized the \n     requirement that proof of delivery be evidenced by a written \n     receipt.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     2.06 Filing of Civil Action.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (c) Communication Regarding Civil Actions Filed with \n     District Court.

In \n     this regard, see also proposed rule 9.06. In response to \n     comments, the Board has replaced the proposed requirement \n     that a copy of the complaint be provided, with a notice of \n     filing of a civil action. The Office also intends to include \n     notice of this requirement in its Notice of End of Mediation.\n       AMENDMENT DELETED: [[(2) No party to any civil action \n     referenced in paragraph (1) shall request information from \n     the Office regarding the proceedings which took place \n     pursuant to sections 402 or 403 related to said civil action, \n     unless said party notifies the other party(ies) to the civil \n     action of the request to the Office.

The Board has amended the \n     proposal to clarify further the categories of OSH reports \n     resulting from inspection requests. The Board has extended \n     the time periods within which the dispute resolution \n     procedure takes place. The Board has also added a requirement \n     that any General Counsel declination must be provided in \n     writing to the employing office.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 5.03 Dismissal, Summary Judgment, and Withdrawal of \n       Complaints.\n\n                               . . . . .\n\n       (d) Summary Judgment.

In response to a comment, the Board has included \n     the requirement that the parties be given the opportunity to \n     address the issue.

In response to comments, the Board has \n     required written delegation of authority, and has limited \n     that delegation to submissions after a petition for review \n     has been filed. The Board has also prohibited such a \n     delegation in any case in which the Executive Director has \n     issued a determination on the merits in the underlying \n     proceeding.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 9.01 Filing, Service and Size Limitations of Motions, \n       Briefs, Responses and other Documents.\n\n       (a) Filing with the Office; Number.

The term ``matter'' \n     was included by the Board on further consideration, because \n     some of the procedures referenced in the labor-management \n     relations Rules are addressed to the Board in the first \n     instance. Submission by electronic version is in addition to \n     the existing methods for filing submissions. This addition \n     reflects the decision of this agency to begin exploring the \n     process of migration toward electronic filing. Because of \n     limits in available technology, it remains necessary to \n     designate a particular format for electronic disk \n     transmittal. In response to comments, the Board has amended \n     the proposal to allow for a ``request'' rather than a \n     requirement. The availability of submissions on disk, \n     particularly of lengthy documents, can save the Office time \n     and expense in handling such documents.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 9.03 Attorney's fees and costs.\n\n       (a) Request.

The parties may agree \n     formally to settle all or part of a disputed matter in \n     accordance with section 414 of the Act. In that event, the \n     agreement shall be in writing and submitted to the Executive \n     Director for review and approval. If the Executive Director \n     does not approve the settlement, such disapproval shall be in \n     writing, shall set forth the grounds therefor, and shall \n     render the settlement ineffective.\n       (c) Requirements for a Formal Settlement Agreement. A \n     formal settlement agreement requires the signature of all \n     parties on the agreement document before the agreement can be \n     submitted to the Executive Director. A formal settlement \n     agreement cannot be rescinded after the signatures of all \n     parties have been affixed to the agreement, unless by written \n     revocation of the agreement voluntarily signed by all \n     parties, or as otherwise [[required]] permitted by law.\n       (d) Violation of a Formal Settlement Agreement. If a party \n     should allege that a formal settlement agreement has been \n     violated, the issue shall be determined by reference to the \n     formal dispute resolution procedures of the agreement. If the \n     particular formal settlement agreement does not have a \n     stipulated method for dispute resolution of an alleged \n     violation of the agreement, the following dispute resolution \n     procedure shall be deemed to be a part of each formal \n     settlement agreement approved by the Executive Director \n     pursuant to section 414 of the Act: Any complaint regarding a \n     violation of a formal settlement agreement may be filed with \n     the Executive Director no later than 60 days after the party \n     to the agreement becomes aware of the alleged violation. Such \n     complaints may be referred by the Executive Director to a \n     Hearing Officer for a final and binding decision. The \n     procedures for hearing and determining such complaints shall \n     be governed by subparts F, G, and H of these rules. \n       Discussion: The Board disagrees with comments that assert \n     the Office has no statutory authority to settle disputes \n     regarding the alleged violation of settlement agreements. \n     Under section 414 of the Act, the Executive Director is \n     clearly given plenary authority to approve all settlement \n     agreements under the Act entered into at any stage of the \n     administrative or judicial process. No settlement agreement \n     can ``become effective'' unless and until such approval has \n     been given. The Office is concerned that many settlement \n     agreements do not include provisions for disposition of \n     controversies regarding alleged violations of the agreement. \n     Rather than consider initiating a practice of withholding \n     approval of settlement agreements which do not include \n     provisions setting forth dispute resolution procedures, the \n     Office is providing all parties, by notice and rule, the \n     option to include their own dispute resolution provisions, or \n     default to the dispute resolution procedure stipulated in \n     this proposed Rule when they enter into a settlement \n     agreement. The word ``permitted'' was inserted in place of \n     ``required'' as a clarification, since in this context a \n     rescission of an approved agreement would rarely, if ever, be \n     required by operation of law.\n       [[Sec. 9.06 Destruction of Closed Files. Closed case files \n     regarding counseling, mediation, hearing, and/or appeal to \n     the Board of Directors may be destroyed during the calendar \n     year in which the fifth anniversary of the closure date \n     occurs, or during the calendar year in which the fifth \n     anniversary of the conclusion of all adversarial\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\n     proceedings in relation thereto occurs, whichever period ends \n     later.]]\n       Discussion: The Executive Director and the Board of \n     Directors have been made aware that the Office of Compliance \n     appears to be an agency covered by the requirements of the \n     Federal Records Act (found at Title 44 of the U.S. Code). The \n     Records Act requires that an agency consult with the \n     Archivist of the United States regarding any record \n     destruction program. Therefore, the Executive Director and \n     the Board are withdrawing this proposal at this time, and \n     will issue a new Notice regarding this subject matter after \n     the requirements of the Federal Records Act have been \n     satisfied.\n         9.0[7]6 Payments [[of]] required pursuant to Decisions, \n     Awards, or Settlements under section 415(a) of the Act. \n     Whenever a decision or award pursuant to sections 405(g), \n     406(e), 407, or 408 of the Act, or an approved settlement \n     pursuant to section 414 of the Act, require the payment of \n     funds pursuant to section 415(a) of the Act, the decision, \n     award, or settlement shall be submitted to the Executive \n     Director to be processed by the Office for requisition from \n     the account of the Office of Compliance in the Department of \n     the Treasury, and payment.\n       Discussion: This proposed rule reflects the existing \n     procedure for processing payments under section 415(a) of the \n     Act. Since section 415 does not authorize automatic stays of \n     judgments or awards pending appeal, parties are advised to \n     seek such a stay from the appropriate forum. Adding an \n     automatic stay of payment until all appeals have been \n     exhausted would require an amendment of the Act.\n\n     Sec. 9.0[6]7 Revocation, Amendment or Waiver of Rules.\n\n. . . . .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/26/senate-section/article/S1675-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1675-S1676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE SECURITY: PROTECTING AMERICA'S FOOD FROM FARM TO FORK\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \nurgent need to prepare America against an attack on our agriculture. \nThe Nation's agriculture industry is crucial to our prosperity. Yet it \ndoes not receive the protection it needs. Our food supply system is \nvulnerable to accidental or intentional contamination that would damage \nour economy, and, most importantly, could cost lives.\n  There is no need to question whether animal-borne diseases can \nactually threaten the United States. Look to last December's mad cow \ndisease outbreak: only one cow was found to be infected, and yet the \nU.S. beef industry was thrown into a tailspin from which it still has \nnot recovered. As a result: American cattle prices fell by 20 percent; \nsome predict beef exports will fall by 90 percent from 2003 to 2004; \nand more than 40 foreign countries have instituted bans on American \nbeef, most of which will not be lifted in the near future. This fallout \nresulted from the infection of only two cows.\n  In the beginning of February, a version of the avian influenza, a \ndisease sweeping through Southeast Asian poultry that has killed at \nleast 22 people to date, was discovered on two Delaware chicken farms. \nIt also surfaced in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and a far more \ncontagious strain was later reported in Texas. While the two strains \nfound in these States carry no know risk to humans, this discovery \nillustrates how easily an animal-borne disease can break out in the \nUnited States. Only four farms and one live chicken market have tested \npositive for the disease. Yet this discovery resulted in the slaughter \nof over 92,000 chickens in the U.S. to date and a ban on American \npoultry exports in a number of Asian countries and the European Union.\n  We should learn two things from these recent outbreaks: No. 1, the \ncost to the agriculture community for even a small outbreak is high, \nand, No. 2, we must be prepared for the unexpected.\n  While the emergence of mad cow and the avian flu in American \nagriculture has been detrimental, it has not come close to causing the \namount of damage a larger outbreak could create.\n  Imagine if either of these diseases spread across the Nation instead \nof being contained to just a few farms.\n  Or worse, imagine if the strain of the avian flu that is currently \nclaiming human lives in Asia was found in the United States.\n  In these scenarios, the outbreak would have been far more difficult \nto contain and much more costly to our Nation.\n  A 1994 Department of Agriculture study said that if a foreign animal \ndisease became entrenched in the United States, it would cost the \nagriculture industry at least $5.4 billion. A 2002 report by the \nNational Defense University predicted that this figure would be three \nto fives times greater today. On a smaller scale, an outbreak that only \npenetrated 10 farms could have as much as a $2 billion economic impact.\n  Earlier this month, the President released Homeland Security \nPresidential Directive 9, HSPD-9, aimed at addressing many of these \nconcerns. HSPD-9 is a great first step. It signals the administration \nis aware of the vulnerability in our agriculture sector and considers \nthis to be a homeland security priority.\n  Under HSPD-9, the President directed the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to ensure the execution of a number of much needed security \nmeasures, including the following: Develop surveillance and monitoring \nsystems for animal and plant disease and the food supply that provide \nearly detection of poisonous agents; develop nationwide laboratory \nnetworks for food, veterinary, and plant health that ensures \ncommunication and coordination between related facilities; and develop \na National Veterinary Stockpile that contains enough vaccine and \nantiviral products to respond to the most damaging animal diseases.\n\n  But the President's initiative does not go far enough because it \nfails to address a number of serious shortcomings with the current \ngovernmental response to agriculture security, such as: Lack of \ncommunication between Federal agencies; insufficient coordination with, \nand funding for, State and local officials; inadequate international \ncollaboration; and the impeding nature of some State and local laws to \neffective response plans.\n  To address these many concerns, I introduced two bills, S. 427, the \nAgriculture Security Assistance Act, and S. 430, the Agriculture \nSecurity Preparedness Act, to increase the coordination in confronting \nthe threat to America's agriculture industry and provide the needed \nresources. My legislation provides for more targeted State and local \nfunding and a better-coordinated Federal system.\n  The Agriculture Security Assistance Act would assist States and \ncommunities in responding to threats to the agriculture industry by \nauthorizing funds for: Animal health professionals to participate in \ncommunity emergency planning activities to assist farmers in \nstrengthening their defenses against a terrorist threat; a biosecurity \ngrant program for farmers and ranchers to provide needed funding to \nbetter secure their properties; and the use of sophisticated remote \nsensing and computer modeling approaches to agricultural diseases.\n  The Agriculture Security Preparedness Act would enable better \ninteragency coordination within the Federal Government by: Establishing \nsenior level liaisons in the Departments of Homeland Security, DHS, and \nHealth and Human Services to coordinate with the Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, and all other relevant agencies on agricultural \ndisease emergency management and response; requiring DHS and USDA to \nwork with the Department of Transportation to address the risks \nassociated with transporting animals, plants, and people between and \naround farms; requiring the Attorney General to conduct a review of \nrelevant Federal, State, and local laws to determine if they facilitate \nor impede agricultural security; and directing the State Department to \nenter into mutual assistance agreements with foreign governments to \nfacilitate the share of resources and knowledge of foreign animal \ndiseases.\n  Over 30 Federal agencies have jurisdiction over some part of the \nresponse process in the event of a breach of agricultural security. In \na report on the United State's preparedness for responding to animal-\nborne diseases issued in August 2003, Trust for America's Health, a \nnonprofit, nonpartisan organization founded to raise the profile of \npublic health issues, stated that, ``The U.S. is left with a myriad of \nbureaucratic jurisdictions that respond to various aspects of the \ndiseases, with little coordination and no clear plan for communicating \nwith the public about the health threats posed by animal-borne \ndiseases.'' Protecting America's agriculture and its citizens requires \nFederal agencies to know who is responsible for what portion of the \nprevention and response to an attack on our agriculture.\n  State and local officials, and the communities they serve, are the \nfront\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\nlines of defense for American agriculture. Without adequate resources, \nboth in terms of funding and advice, these defenses will fail. While \nthe presidential directive mandates the creation of a coordinated \nresponse plan that would include Federal, State, and local partners, it \nfalls short of supplying the State and local officials with the \nnecessary funding and guidance to better protect their jurisdiction. \nSurprisingly, the administration proposes huge cuts in fiscal year 2005 \nto homeland security grants for the States.\n  We have witnessed the impact a small, unintentional outbreak of mad \ncow disease had on our country. We cannot wait for a far more damaging \nand widespread attack on our agriculture system. While I commend the \nPresident's initiative in this area, further action is needed. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this overdue legislation to protect America's \nbreadbasket.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/26/senate-section/article/S1676-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GAO HUMAN CAPITAL REFORM ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today before the Senate to \nrecognize a great American and one of the finest patriots this Nation, \nand my home State of Alabama, has ever produced. We are truly saddened \nby the loss of Retired U.S. Navy Admiral Thomas Moorer, former Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff from July 1970 to June 1974 and former \nChief of Naval Operations from 1967 to 1970.\n  Admiral Moorer's distinguished service in our great Navy spanned 41 \nremarkable years during which he dutifully stood the watch against our \nadversaries. He was our 7th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nthe 18th Chief of Naval Operations. These accomplishments were \nconsistent with his outstanding service record that had placed Admiral \nMoorer on our front lines throughout his career. Admiral Moorer was \nserving in Pearl Harbor with Patrol Squadron Twenty-Two on December 7, \n1941. He witnessed that ``day of infamy'' and answered with bravery as \nhe was one of the first pilots to get his aircraft airborne after the \nJapanese attack.\n  Never shying from battle, he was wounded in aerial combat when his \naircraft was shot down near the Australian coastline. Indeed, \nindicative of the ferocity of the combat, the rescue ship that \nrecovered him was sunk by enemy action the same day as his rescue. \nStill, he would not quit and went on to receive the Distinguished \nFlying Cross for valor. He flew through hostile areas with full \nknowledge of overpowering enemy aircraft superiority flying badly \nneeded supplies into the besieged island of Timor and flying \nevacuations of the wounded. He also stood watch during the Korean \nconflict, during the Cuban Missile crisis, during our engagement in \nVietnam and during our outreach to China.\n  Admiral Moorer distinguished himself in many positions including \ncommand of our Seventh Fleet, arriving at full Admiral in June 1964 \nwhen appointed to Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet. He was the \nfirst naval officer to command both the Pacific and Atlantic Fleets. \nAdmiral Moorer stood his watch as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the highest position any military officer can achieve, under \nPresident Nixon as the Nation extracted itself from our conflict in \nVietnam. Writing in White House Years, Dr. Henry Kissinger remarked \nthat Admiral Moorer `` had spent the 1960s in command positions which, \nwhile not without their frustrations, did not produce the physical and \npsychological exhaustion of high-level Washington. A canny bureaucratic \ninfighter, Moorer made no pretense of academic subtlety. If anything, \nhe exaggerated the attitude of an innocent country boy caught up in a \njungle of sharpies. What his views lacked in elegance they made up in \nexplicitness. By the time he took office, Vietnam had become a \nrearguard action. He conducted its heartbreaking phaseout with dignity. \nNo President could have had a more stalwart military advisor.''\n  He did not waiver. Admiral Moorer strongly disagreed with the Panama \nCanal giveaway. In fact, he testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee several years ago on this subject. The public had again \nbecome concerned about this issue as a Chinese company had won the \ncontract to operate both ends of the canal. Admiral Moorer noted the \ndanger this posed to the movement of our fleet.\n  As a young Alabamian, I followed Admiral Moorer's career. He was from \nthe small rural community of Mt. Willing. Mt. Willing was on the road \nto Montgomery from my home in the rural community of Hybart near \nCamden. I would frequently go through Camden up Highway 21 through Mt. \nWilling on my way to Huntingdon College in Montgomery where I was a \nstudent. I would pass Moorer's grocery operated by a relative, and have \nthe chance to think of the extraordinary accomplishments of this \nremarkable Admiral from the heart of Alabama. He carried those values \nwith him as can be seen from Dr. Kissinger's comments and those who \nknew him. Mt. Willing is an old\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\ncommunity. Its post office was established not long after Alabama \nbecame a State in 1819.\n  Admiral Moorer actually attended a one-room schoolhouse. Later, his \nfamily moved to Montgomery which is where he graduated from high \nschool. He was the Valedictorian of his class, graduating at the age of \n15. Two years later he entered the Naval Academy. During this period \nhis family moved to Eufaula, AL, which is where he met his wonderful \nlife partner, Carrie Foy. Mrs. Moorer, a most delightful person in her \nown right, was tremendously supportive of Admiral Moorer's career and \nhis beliefs, and remains proud of his exceptional service, as well she \nshould.\n  It is appropriate that we reflect today on the sacrifices made by \nthis veteran Sailor and great military leader. I am proud of him for \nserving our great country through challenging times. And I join all of \nthe citizens of Alabama in prayer for one of our own, this country boy \nfrom Mt. Willing, Alabama who turned top Admiral. His story is one that \nall Americans can be proud of. We wish him and his family Godspeed and \nfair winds and following seas as he leaves us for his final watch.\n  He came from rural America. He was learned of the greatness of \nAmerica. He was not bombarded by the ``blame America first-crowd.'' \nBecause of his recognized ability, he was selected for the Naval \nAcademy. Because of his record of accomplishment he rose to the highest \nposition a uniformed military officer can achieve--Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. He delivered for his beloved homeland there just \nas he did in all his previous positions. These values, taught best in \nour small towns, sustain us in difficult times. Admiral Moorer, like \nall the other wonderful Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines, fully \nunderstood that when he put on that uniform, he was prepared to give \nhis life for his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/26/senate-section/article/S1677-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ABSTENSION FROM VOTE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina.

Mr. President, today I rise to commend one of the \nmany unsung heroes of our Senate family, Alma Kristoffersen, who will \nretire tomorrow after 20 years of service as a transcriber and \nreporting technician for the Congressional Record.\n  I worked in the private sector for more than 30 years before I first \ncame to the Senate. One of the things that struck me about this \ninstitution as I came to know it is the dedication, skill, and \nprofessionalism shown by the people who work in all capacities here. \nSenators and committees have their own staff, and we rely on them, to \nbe sure. But we also rely on the hundreds of staffers who make up what \nI call the ``infrastructure'' of the Senate. For the most part, they go \nabout their business unnoticed and certainly underappreciated. We have \nto remind ourselves now and then that this place would screech to a \nhalt without their tireless devotion to their jobs and to our Nation.\n  Alma is a fine example of that tradition. She has many talents, \nincluding a strong knowledge of grammar, spelling, and vocabulary; a \nquick wit; and dry sense of humor. But her most enduring asset is her \nabsolute commitment to teamwork. She is always willing to volunteer for \nextra duties.\n  Alma was born in Liverpool, England, and moved to the United States \nin 1968. She became a citizen in the early 1990s, qualifying for a high \nsecurity clearance to work on classified material. She and her husband \nTom have a son, Alex, who lives in Brooklyn, NY. Alma plans to enjoy \nall her various hobbies in retirement, including gardening, tennis, \ntravel, and actually being able to attend her book club on week nights.\n  I know that I speak on behalf of the entire Senate when I say how \nmuch I appreciate Alma's service to this institution and to the Nation. \nAlma's colleagues and friends here in the Senate, particularly in the \nOffice of Official Reporters of Debates, will miss her, but we wish her \na long and happy retirement, which she has certainly earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/26/senate-section/article/S1677-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               MARATHON COUNTY RESOLUTION RELATING TO BSE\n\n Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, today I commemorate the \nsesquicentennial of Green Bay, WI, one of the most famous cities in \nAmerica, and one of Wisconsin's most beloved places.\n  Green Bay is Wisconsin's oldest European settlement dating back to \nthe explorations of Jean Nicolet in 1634. Early fur traders and \nexplorers used Green Bay and the Fox River as an important access point \nfrom the Great Lakes to the Western lands of the New World. Early \nFrench settlers called the bay, ``La Baie Verte,'' because of its green \nwaters. In the second half of the 19th century, European immigrants \nflocked to Green Bay for the good farming soil and ample business \nopportunities. The paper industry became a vital part of the Green Bay \neconomy and remains the leading employer in the city today. Green Bay \nbecame a city when it was incorporated by the Wisconsin Legislature on \nFebruary 27, 1854. Today, Green Bay stands with a population of over \n100,000 people as Wisconsin's third-largest city.\n  Today visitors can get a taste of Green Bay's long history at the \nHeritage Hill State Historic Park which offers a rare opportunity to \nvisit one of Wisconsin's oldest wood homes, the Tank Cottage. Green Bay \nis also home to the National Railroad Museum, home of the world's \nlargest steam locomotive and General Dwight D. Eisenhower's WWII \ncommand train.\n  Green Bay is known to many as Titletown USA as it is home to the \nworld-famous Green Bay Packers, the real ``America's Team.'' In 1919, \nCurly Lambeau, who worked for a packing plant, organized the original \nPackers football team. The team's popularity led to the packing plant \nbacking Lambeau in obtaining a franchise in the new professional \nfootball league. Early financial problems were overcome by making the \nteam publically owned, an honor that I am proud to say I am now a part \nof. The rest, as they say, is history.

He passed away on Tuesday at \nage 74 in his home in Bardstown, and will be greatly missed by his \nsurviving family and the Jim Beam Brands Company.\n  In 1950, Mr. Noe entered the family business, the bourbon that is the \nnamesake of his grandfather, Jim Beam. He directed the production and \naging of bourbon at Jim Beam and was named master distiller in 1965. \nWhile he oversaw production of Jim Beam Bourbon, production increased \nand innovations were made that revitalized the bourbon industry \nforever.\n  His friends considered him ``larger than life,'' and ``one of the \ncrown jewels of American distilling.'' Jim Beam Brands honored him upon \nhis retirement in 1992 by placing his photo on the bottle labels \nalongside the family distillers who preceded him. Kentuckians are proud \nof our bourbon, and we are proud of Mr. Noe's contributions to the \nindustry. He will be greatly missed, and our hearts go out to his \nfamily during this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/26/senate-section/article/S1678-5", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/26/senate-section/article/S1678-6", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and three withdrawals which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/26/senate-section/article/S1678-7", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1678-S1679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT RELATIVE TO EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND \n  INVOCATION OF EMERGENCY AUTHORITY RELATING TO THE REGULATION OF THE \n ANCHORAGE AND MOVEMENT OF VESSELS INTO CUBAN TERRITORIAL WATERS--PM 64\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 1 of title I of Public Law 65-24, ch. 30, 50 \nU.S.C. 191, and sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act, \n50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., I hereby report that I have exercised my \nstatutory authority to continue the national emergency declared in \nProclamation 6867 of March 1, 1996, in response to the Cuban \ngovernment's destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian \naircraft in international airspace north of Cuba.

I have also authorized these rules and regulations in an \neffort to deny resources to the repressive Cuban government that may be \nused by that government to support terrorist activities and carry out \nexcessive use of force against innocent victims, including U.S. \ncitizens and other persons residing in the United States, and threaten \na disturbance of international relations.

A bill to regulate the unauthorized installation of computer \nsoftware, to require clear disclosure to computer users of certain \ncomputer software features that may pose a threat to user privacy, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my good friend Senator Burns and I have \npioneered a number of legislative efforts aimed at protecting ordinary \ncomputer users from the tricks and schemes of those who would abuse the \nopen and interconnected nature of the Internet. From online privacy to \nspam, we have sought to establish some basic, commonsense rules to \naddress sleazy, intrusive, and anti-consumer practices that have arisen \nin the new world of the Internet. In each case, our goal has not been \nto stifle or restrict legitimate and innovative modes of e-commerce, \nbut rather to promote them by reining in unfair and annoying behavior \nthat undermines consumer confidence and use of the Internet.\n  Today, we continue on that path by introducing the ``SPY BLOCK'' Act, \ntogether with our colleague Senator Boxer.\n  This legislation will put the brakes on the growing problem of \nsoftware being installed secretly on people's computers, for purposes \nthey might object to if given the chance. Sometimes, the problem is a \n``drive-by download,'' where the consumer's mere visit to a website or \ndecision to click on an advertisement secretly triggers the downloading \nof software onto the consumer's machine. Or, it can be a ``double \nwhammy download,'' where the consumer's voluntary download of one \nsoftware program also triggers the inadvertent download of a second \nsoftware program which, although it may serve a very different purpose, \nhas been bundled together with the first one.\n  Once installed, the unwanted software operates in the background, \nperforming functions that ordinary computer users cannot detect. As a \nresult, the computer user may never even know the software is there, \nlet alone what it is doing. And to add insult to injury, software that \nspreads in this fashion often is designed to be nearly impossible to \nuninstall.\n  What might such software do, once it is installed? The legislation we \nare introducing today identifies several possible functions that pose \nconcerns. First, some software, often referred to as ``spyware,'' \ncollects information about the computer user and transmits that \ninformation over the Internet to the spyware's author. Second, software \nsometimes referred to as ``adware'' causes pop-up ads to appear on the \nuser's computer, perhaps based on the user's apparent interests or on \nthe websites he or she visits. Third, some software essentially hijacks \nthe computer's processing and communications capability to forward \nspam, viruses, or other messages, all without the user's knowledge. \nFinally, some software changes user settings--for example, overriding \nthe user's intended choice of homepage.\n  If a computer user truly understands what the software is going to do \nand knowingly consents to it, that's fine. The issue really comes down \nto user knowledge and control. Too often, software like this allows a \nthird party to wrest control of some of the computer's functions and \ncommandeer\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\nthem for the third party's own purposes. The software is essentially a \nparasite--it attaches itself without consent to the host computer and \ntaps into the host's resources, making use of them for its own selfish \npurposes. Our bill would make such unauthorized practices clearly \nunlawful.\n  How common is all this? There is little hard data, but one report \nlast year estimated that 20 million people have downloaded software \nthat serves them targeted advertising. I have to suspect that many of \nthese downloads did not involve informed consent. It has also been \nwidely reported that many of the most popular peer-to-peer file sharing \nsoftware programs come packaged with other software that is not clearly \ndisclosed to the user. So the number of affected users is likely very \nhigh.\n  The bill we are introducing today would, for the first time, \nestablish a clear legal principle that you cannot cause software to be \ninstalled on somebody else's computer without that person's knowledge \nand consent. This general notice and consent requirement could be \nsatisfied by something as simple as an on-screen dialogue box telling \nthe user that clicking ``ok'' will trigger the download of, say, a \nparticular game program. In addition, the bill says that software must \nbe capable of being uninstalled without resorting to extraordinary and \nhighly technical procedures.\n  Beyond these general requirements, the legislation calls for certain \ntypes of software features--those performing the four functions I \ndiscussed a moment ago--to be specifically and separately brought to \nthe user's attention prior to installation. For example, if a software \nprogram has a spyware feature designed to collect and transmit \ninformation about the user, the user would need to be provided with \nsufficient notice based on criteria set forth in the bill. That notice \nwould need to explain the types of information that would be collected \nand the purposes for which the information would be used. Following \nthis notice, the user would have the option of granting or withholding \nconsent. In the absence of such notice and consent, it would be \nunlawful to download the software onto the user's computer, or \nsubsequently to use the software to gather information about that user.\n  The bill contains some exceptions, for example, for pre-installed \nsoftware and software features that are necessary to make basic \nfeatures like e-mail or Internet browsing function properly. \nEnforcement under the bill would be by the Federal Trade Commission and \nstate Attorneys General.\n  I recognize that the bill we introduce today may benefit from further \nattention and input on the particular wording of the definitions, on \nthe types of software or software features that should be listed in the \nexceptions, and so forth. Senator Burns, Senator Boxer, and I are open \nto further discussion about fine tuning the scope of the bill, so that \nwe don't create a regime that ends up being impractical or imposing \nundue burdens on legitimate and useful software. This is the starting \npoint, not the end point.\n  It is important, however, to get this process moving. I believe it's \ntime to send a clear message that unauthorized and privacy-compromising \nspyware, adware, and other software are unlawful and punishable. I urge \nmy colleagues to join Senators Burns, Boxer, and myself in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise in support of a measure that I \nintroduce today, with the support of my colleague, Senator Wyden. We \nworked closely on the CAN SPAM bill together, and after four years of \neffort finally saw its successful passage last year. I am pleased to \nwork with Senator Wyden again on another critical issue which is \npotentially of even greater concern than junk email given its invasive \nnature--that of spyware. I also appreciate the support of another of my \ncolleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Boxer. Together, \nwe have crafted legislation aimed at ending the insidious operation of \nspyware, the SPYBLOCK Act of 2004. By introducing this legislation \ntoday, we take the first step in giving consumers the control to stop \nthis deceitful practice.\n  Spyware refers to software that is downloaded onto users' computers \nwithout their knowledge or consent. This sneaky software is then often \nused to track the movements of consumers online or even to steal \npasswords. The porous gaps spyware creates in a computer's security may \nbe difficult to close. For example, one popular peer-to-peer file \nsharing network routinely installs spyware to track users' information \nand retrieves targeted banner ads and popups. As noted by a recent \narticle in PC Magazine these file-sharing networks may be free, but at \nthe cost of privacy, not money. Of the 60 million users, few know they \nare being watched. Of those who do discover spyware, uninstalling it \nmay prove more difficult than other software programs. Some spyware \nincludes tricklers, which reinstall the files as you delete them. Users \nmay think they are getting rid of the problem, but the reality of the \nsituation is far different.\n  The creators of spyware have engineered the technology so that once \nit is installed on a computer, it is difficult and sometimes impossible \nto remove and in some cases requires the entire hard drive to be erased \nto get rid of this poisonous product. Such drastic measures must be \ntaken, because often spyware tells the installer what websites a user \nvisits, steals passwords or other sensitive documents on a personal \ncomputer, and also redirects Internet traffic through certain web \nsites.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects about the spyware problem is that \nso few consumers are even aware of it. Bearing this factor in mind, the \nSPYBLOCK bill relies on a commonsense approach which prohibits the \ninstallation of software on consumers' computers without notice, \nconsent and reasonable ``uninstall'' procedures.\n  The notice and consent approach which SPYBLOCK takes would end the \npractice of so-called ``drive-by downloads'' which some bad actors use \nto secretly download programs onto users' computers without their \nknowledge. Under SPYBLOCK, software providers must give consumers clear \nand conspicuous notice that a software program will be downloaded to \ntheir computers and requires user consent. This simple provision could \nbe fulfilled by clicking ``yes'' on a dialog box, for example.\n  SPYBLOCK also requires notice and consent for other types of \nsoftware. In the case of ``Adware,'' providers are required to tell \nconsumers what types of ads will pop up on users' screens and with what \nfrequency. Consent is required for software that modifies user settings \nor uses ``distributed computing'' methods to utilize the processing \npower of individual computers to create larger networks. Finally, \nsoftware providers must allow for their programs to be easily \n``uninstalled'' by users after they are downloaded. As with the CAN-\nSPAM law, enforcement authority would be given to the Federal Trade \nCommission. States attorneys general could take action against the \npurveyors of spyware.\n  Clearly, it is time to call the bad actors to account. It is \nimpossible to understand how any of the individuals or companies using \nspyware believe tracking Internet usage, stealing passwords, and \nhijacking the processors of someone else's computer, all without their \nknowledge, is justifiable.\n  Working closely with my colleagues Senator Wyden and Senator Boxer, I \nam confident we can make major progress on this critical legislation, \nbefore spyware infects a critical mass of computers and renders them \nuseless. Just trying to keep up with the latest anti-spyware software \nposes a tremendous cost to businesses, let alone individuals who have \nto spend their time online worried about the next spyware infestation. \nAgain, I would like to thank Senators Wyden and Boxer for their hard \nwork on this vital issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit racial profiling; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, three years ago tomorrow, in his first \naddress to a joint session of Congress, President Bush declared that \nracial profiling is wrong and pledged to end it in America. He then \ndirected his Attorney General to implement this policy.\n  It is now three years later, and the American people are still \nwaiting for the President to follow through on his pledge to end racial \nprofiling.\n  So, today I join with Representative John Conyers, the distinguished \nranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, in re-introducing the \nEnd Racial Profiling Act. We first introduced this bill in 2001, \nshortly after the President made his pledge and the Attorney General \nasserted that he would work with us on our legislation.\n  The End Racial Profiling Act would do exactly what the President \npromised to do: it would ban racial profiling once and for all and \nrequire Federal, State, and local law enforcement to take steps to end \nand prevent racial profiling.\n  I am very pleased that several of my distinguished colleagues have \njoined me on this bill Senators Corzine, Clinton, Lautenberg, Kennedy, \nSchumer, Durbin, Kerry, Boxer, Reid, Dodd, Cantwell, Mikulski, and \nEdwards.\n  Racial profiling is the practice by which some law enforcement agents \nroutinely stop African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Arab \nAmericans and others simply because of their race, ethnicity, or \nnational origin. Reports in States from New Jersey to Florida, and \nMaryland to Texas all show that African Americans, Hispanics, and \nmembers of other minority groups are being stopped by some police far \nin excess of their share of the population and the rate at which they \nengage in criminal conduct.\n  I might add that the urgency for legislation banning racial profiling \nis compounded by concerns post-September 11 that racial profiling--not \ngood police work and following up on legitimate leads--is being used \nagainst Arab and Muslim Americans, or Americans perceived to be Arab or \nMuslim.\n  The September 11 attacks were horrific and I share the determination \nof many Americans that finding those responsible and preventing future \nattacks should be this Nation's top priority. This is a challenge that \nour country can and must meet. But we need improved intelligence and \nlaw enforcement, not racial, ethnic or religious stereotypes, to \nprotect our Nation from crime and future terrorist attacks.\n  In fact, I believe that the End Racial Profiling Act is a pro-law \nenforcement bill. It will help to restore the trust and confidence of \nthe communities our law enforcement have pledged to serve and protect. \nThat confidence is crucial to our success in stopping crime, and in \nstopping terrorism. The End Racial Profiling Act is good for law \nenforcement and good for America.\n  I'm very pleased that many state and local law enforcement officials \nstand with the sponsors of this bill in condemning racial profiling. \nMany law enforcement officials across the country agree that racial \nprofiling is wrong and should not take place in America. In fact, many \nState and local law enforcement officials have begun to take steps to \naddress the problem, or even the perception of a problem. For example, \nin my own State of Wisconsin, law enforcement officials have taken \nsteps to train police officers, improve academy training, establish \nmodel policies prohibiting racial profiling, and improve relations with \nour State's diverse communities. I applaud the efforts of Wisconsin law \nenforcement.\n  But the Federal Government has a vital role in protecting civil \nrights and acting as a model for State and local law enforcement. Last \nJune, the Justice Department issued a policy guidance to Federal law \nenforcement agencies banning racial profiling. But while this guidance \nis a useful first step, it does not achieve the President's stated goal \nof ending racial profiling in America. It does not carry the force of \nlaw and does not apply to State and local law enforcement. Federal \nlegislation is still very much needed.\n  Our bill, the End Racial Profiling Act, would ban racial profiling \nand allow the Justice Department or individuals the ability to enforce \nthis prohibition by filing a suit for injunctive relief. The bill would \nalso require Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to \nadopt policies prohibiting racial profiling; to implement effective \ncomplaint procedures; to implement disciplinary procedures for officers \nwho engage in the practice; and to collect data on stops. In addition, \nit requires the Attorney General to report to Congress to allow \nCongress and the American people to monitor whether the steps outlined \nin the bill to prevent and end racial profiling have been effective.\n  Like the bill we introduced last Congress, the bill also authorizes \nthe Attorney General to provide incentive grants to help law \nenforcement comply with the ban on racial profiling, including funds to \nconduct training of police officers or purchase in-car video cameras.\n  Finally, we have revised the bill to conform with the definition of \nracial profiling in the Justice Department's guidance and to reflect \nconcerns about racial profiling based on religion in a post-September \n11 America.\n  Let me emphasize that local, State, and Federal law enforcement \nagents play a vital role in protecting the public from crime and \nprotecting the Nation from terrorism. The vast majority of law \nenforcement agents nationwide discharge their duties professionally and \nwithout bias and we are all indebted to them for their courage and \ndedication. This bill should not be misinterpreted as a criticism of \nthose who put their lives on the line for the rest of us every day. \nRather, it is a statement that the use of race, ethnicity, religion, or \nnational origin in deciding which persons should be subject to traffic \nstops, stops and frisks, questioning, searches, and seizures is wrong \nand ineffective, except where there is specific information linking \npersons of a particular race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin \nto a crime.\n  Now, perhaps more than ever before, our Nation cannot afford to waste \nprecious law enforcement resources or alienate Americans by tolerating \ndiscriminatory practices. It is past time for Congress and the \nPresident to enact comprehensive federal legislation that will end \nracial profiling once and for all.\n  I urge the President to make good on his pledge to end racial \nprofiling, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the End \nRacial Profiling Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Federal, State, and local law enforcement agents play a \n     vital role in protecting the public from crime and protecting \n     the Nation from terrorism. The vast majority of law \n     enforcement agents nationwide discharge their duties \n     professionally and without bias.\n       (2) The use by police officers of race, ethnicity, \n     religion, or national origin in deciding which persons should \n     be subject to traffic stops, stops and frisks, questioning, \n     searches, and seizures is improper.\n       (3) In his address to a Joint Session of Congress on \n     February 27, 2001, President George W. Bush declared that \n     ``racial profiling is wrong and we will end it in America.'' \n     He directed the Attorney General to implement this policy.\n       (4) In June 2003, the Department of Justice issued a Policy \n     Guidance regarding racial profiling by Federal law \n     enforcement agencies which stated: ``Racial profiling in law \n     enforcement is not merely wrong, but also ineffective. Race-\n     based assumptions in law enforcement perpetuate negative \n     racial stereotypes that are harmful to our rich and diverse \n     democracy, and materially impair our efforts to maintain a \n     fair and just society.''\n       (5) The Department of Justice Guidance is a useful first \n     step, but does not achieve the President's stated goal of \n     ending racial profiling in America: it does not apply to \n     State and local law enforcement agencies, does not contain a \n     meaningful enforcement mechanism, does not require data \n     collection, and contains an overbroad exception for \n     immigration and national security matters.\n       (6) Current efforts by State and local governments to \n     eradicate racial profiling and redress the harms it causes, \n     while also laudable, have been limited in scope and \n     insufficient to address this national problem. Therefore, \n     Federal legislation is needed.\n       (7) Statistical evidence from across the country \n     demonstrates that racial profiling is a real and measurable \n     phenomenon.\n       (8) As of November 15, 2000, the Department of Justice had \n     14 publicly noticed, ongoing, pattern or practice \n     investigations involving allegations of racial profiling, and \n     had filed 5 pattern and practice lawsuits involving \n     allegations of racial profiling, with 4 of those cases \n     resolved through consent decrees.\n       (9) A large majority of individuals subjected to stops and \n     other enforcement activities based on race, ethnicity, \n     religion, or national origin are found to be law abiding and \n     therefore racial profiling is not an effective means to \n     uncover criminal activity.\n       (10) A 2001 Department of Justice report on citizen-police \n     contacts in 1999 found that, although African-Americans and \n     Hispanics were more likely to be stopped and searched, they \n     were less likely to be in possession of contraband. On \n     average, searches and seizures of African-American drivers \n     yielded evidence only 8 percent of the time, searches and \n     seizures of Hispanic drivers yielded evidence only 10 percent \n     of the time, and searches and seizures of white drivers \n     yielded evidence 17 percent of the time.\n       (11) A 2000 General Accounting Office report on the \n     activities of the United States Customs Service during fiscal \n     year 1998 found that--\n       (A) black women who were United States citizens were 9 \n     times more likely than white women who were United States \n     citizens to be x-rayed after being frisked or patted down;\n       (B) black women who were United States citizens were less \n     than half as likely as white women who were United States \n     citizens to be found carrying contraband; and\n       (C) in general, the patterns used to select passengers for \n     more intrusive searches resulted in women and minorities \n     being selected at rates that were not consistent with the \n     rates of finding contraband.\n       (12) In some jurisdictions, local law enforcement practices \n     such as ticket and arrest quotas, and similar management \n     practices, may have the unintended effect of encouraging law \n     enforcement agents to engage in racial profiling.\n       (13) Racial profiling harms individuals subjected to it \n     because they experience fear, anxiety, humiliation, anger, \n     resentment, and cynicism when they are unjustifiably treated \n     as criminal suspects. By discouraging individuals from \n     traveling freely, racial profiling impairs both interstate \n     and intrastate commerce.\n       (14) Racial profiling damages law enforcement and the \n     criminal justice system as a whole by undermining public \n     confidence and trust in the police, the courts, and the \n     criminal law.\n       (15) In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks, many Arabs, Muslims, Central and South Asians, and \n     Sikhs, as well as other immigrants and Americans of foreign \n     descent, were treated with generalized suspicion and \n     subjected to searches and seizures based upon religion and \n     national origin, without trustworthy information linking \n     specific individuals to criminal conduct. Such profiling has \n     failed to produce tangible benefits, yet has created a fear \n     and mistrust of law enforcement agencies in these \n     communities.\n       (16) Racial profiling violates the equal protection clause \n     of the Constitution. Using race, ethnicity, religion, or \n     national origin as a proxy for criminal suspicion violates \n     the constitutional requirement that police and other \n     government officials accord to all citizens the equal \n     protection of the law. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan \n     Housing Development Corporation, 429 U.S. 252 (1977).\n       (17) Racial profiling is not adequately addressed through \n     suppression motions in criminal cases for two reasons. First, \n     the Supreme Court held, in Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. \n     806 (1996), that the racially discriminatory motive of a \n     police officer in making an otherwise valid traffic stop does \n     not warrant the suppression of evidence. Second, since most \n     stops do not result in the discovery of contraband, there is \n     no criminal prosecution and no evidence to suppress.\n       (18) A comprehensive national solution is needed to address \n     racial profiling at the Federal, State, and local levels. \n     Federal support is needed to combat racial profiling through \n     specialized training of law enforcement agents, improved \n     management systems, and the acquisition of technology such as \n     in-car video cameras.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to enforce the constitutional right to equal protection \n     of the laws, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment and section 5 of \n     the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;\n       (2) to enforce the constitutional right to protection \n     against unreasonable searches and seizures, pursuant to the \n     Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;\n       (3) to enforce the constitutional right to interstate \n     travel, pursuant to section 2 of article IV of the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       (4) to regulate interstate commerce, pursuant to clause 3 \n     of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n\n                TITLE I--PROHIBITION OF RACIAL PROFILING\n\n     SEC. 101.

ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Remedy.--The United States, or an individual injured by \n     racial profiling, may enforce this title in a civil action \n     for declaratory or injunctive relief, filed either in a State \n     court of general jurisdiction or in a district court of the \n     United States.\n       (b) Parties.--In any action brought pursuant to this title, \n     relief may be obtained against--\n       (1) any governmental unit that employed any law enforcement \n     agent who engaged in racial profiling;\n       (2) any agent of such unit who engaged in racial profiling; \n     and\n       (3) any person with supervisory authority over such agent.\n       (c) Nature of Proof.--Proof that the routine or spontaneous \n     investigatory activities of law enforcement agents in a \n     jurisdiction have had a disparate impact on racial, ethnic, \n     or religious minorities shall constitute prima facie evidence \n     of a violation of this title.\n       (d) Attorney's Fees.--In any action or proceeding to \n     enforce this title against any governmental unit, the court \n     may allow a prevailing plaintiff, other than the United \n     States, reasonable attorney's fees as part of the costs, and \n     may include expert fees as part of the attorney's fee.\n\n    TITLE II--PROGRAMS TO ELIMINATE RACIAL PROFILING BY FEDERAL LAW \n                          ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\n     SEC. 201.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joining my \ncolleague Senator Russell Feingold and 12 others in reintroducing the \nEnd Racial Profiling Act.\n  I first want to recognize Senator Russ Feingold who has been a \ntremendous leader on this issue--during the last two sessions he held \nthe first Senate hearings on racial profiling and he and his staff have \nworked tirelessly to elevate the importance of this issue as a matter \nof civil rights. I also want to commend Representative John Conyers, \nwho is introducing companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives today. This is just on example of his indefatigable \nwork to address inequities in our society. I also want to thank \nReverend Reginald Jackson, Executive Director of the New Jersey Black \nMinisters' Council. He and the entire council have worked tirelessly \nfor years to address the issue of racial profiling in New Jersey and \nhave provided immeasurable assistance in crafting this legislation.\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\n  The practice of racial profiling is the antithesis of America's \nbelief in fairness and equal protection under the law.\n  Stopping people on our highways, our streets, and at our borders \nbecause of the color of their skin tears at the very fabric of American \nsociety.\n  We are a Nation of laws and everyone should receive equal protection \nunder the law. Our Constitution tolerates nothing less. We should \ndemand nothing less.\n  There is no equal protection--there is no equal justice--if law \nenforcement agencies engage in policies and practices that are premised \non a theory that the way to stop crime is to go after black and brown \npeople on the hunch that they are more likely to be criminals.\n  Let me add, that not only is racial profiling wrong, it is simply not \nan effective law enforcement tool. There is no evidence that stopping \npeople of color adds up to catching bad guys.\n  In fact, there is statistical evidence which points out that singling \nout black motorist or Hispanic motorists for stops and searches doesn't \nlead to a higher percentage of arrests. Minority motorists are simply \nno more likely to be breaking the law than white motorists.\n  But unfortunately racial profiling persists.\n  In 2001, minority motorists accounted for 73 percent of those \nsearched on the New Jersey turnpike. But even the State Attorney \nGeneral admitted that State troopers were twice--I repeat twice--as \nlikely to find drugs or other illegal items when searching vehicles \ndriven by whites.\n\n  Or take the example of the March 2000 Government Accounting Office \nreport on the U.S. Customs Service.\n  The report found that black, Asian, and Hispanic women were four to \nnine times more likely than white women to be subjected to X rays after \nbeing frisked or patted down.\n  But on the basis of the X ray results, black women were less than \nhalf as likely as white women to be found carrying contraband.\n  This is law enforcement by hunch. No warrants. No probable cause.\n  And what is the hunch based on?\n  Race--plain and simple.\n  No where was this more evident, than in my own home State six years \nago.\n  Four young men on the New Jersey Turnpike in a minivan--on their way \nto North Carolina, hoping to go to school on basketball scholarships.\n  Two State troopers pulled them off the road, the frightened driver \nlost control of the van, two dozens shots rang out. Three of the four \nkids were shot.\n  I spoke to these kids a while ago. One of the them told me he was \nasleep when the van was pulled over.\n  He told me, ``What woke me up was a bullet.''\n  Stories like this should wake us all up.\n  The practice of racial profiling broadly undermines the confidence of \nthe American people in the institutions that we depend on to protect \nand defend us. Different rules for different people do not work.\n  Now--We know that many law enforcement agencies, including some from \nmy home State, have acknowledged the danger of the practice and have \ntaken steps to combat it. Indeed, I am proud to report that New Jersey \nhas banned racial profiling. I commend them for their efforts.\n  That said, it is clear that this is a national problem that requires \na national response applicable to all.\n  That is why Senator Feingold and I and many others introduced the End \nRacial Profiling Act in 2001 to end this practice. The legislation \nprovided a clear, enforceable ban on racial profiling and established a \n``carrot and stick'' approach to encourage law enforcement to take \nsteps to end the practice.\n  The legislation helped bring much-needed attention to this critical \nissue and was positively received by the civil rights community and \nmany in law enforcement. Soon after introduction, Senator Feingold held \nvery informative hearings on the bill, at which I testified. We heard \nfrom several law enforcement leaders, including Oakland Police Chief \nRonald Davis and Raymond Kelly, former Commissioner of the U.S. Customs \nService and the New York City Police Department, on the pernicious \nimpact of racial profiling on the trust between law enforcement and \ncommunities that is essential for successful police work. They \ntestified that racial profiling is contrary to effective law \nenforcement and indeed takes energy and focus away from finding real \ncriminals.\n  Then, in June 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice issued guidelines \nto prohibit racial profiling by federal law enforcement agencies, \nfollowing up on President Bush's statement in his February 27, 2001, \naddress to a Joint Session of Congress, that racial profiling is \n``wrong and we will end it in America.''\n  In this guidance, the Department stated:\n\n       Racial profiling in law enforcement is not merely wrong, \n     but also ineffective. Race-based assumptions in law \n     enforcement perpetuate negative racial stereotypes that are \n     harmful to our rich and diverse democracy, and materially \n     impair our efforts to maintain a fair and just society.\n\n  These guidelines, as well as current efforts by State and local \ngovernments, to eradicate racial profiling and redress the harms it \ncauses, while laudable, have been limited in scope and insufficient to \naddress this national problem. Quite simply, federal legislation is \nstill very much needed.\n  In most respects the legislation we are now introducing today is very \nsimilar to the bill that we introduced in 2001.\n  It clearly defines racial profiling and bans it.\n  No routine stops based solely on race, religion, national origin or \nethnicity. Religion is a new addition to the category of protected \nclasses, in acknowledgment of some of the new law enforcement tactics \ndeveloped after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. For example, \nin the wake of the attacks, Arab-American, Muslim-American, South \nAsian-American and Sikh-American communities were made the target of \ngeneralized suspicion and subjected to searches and seizures based upon \ntheir religion and national origin, which has created a fear and \nmistrust of law enforcement agencies and failed to produce tangible \ninvestigative benefit.\n  We will also require the collection of statistics to accurately \nmeasure whether progress is being made. By collecting this data, we \nwill get a fair picture of law enforcement at work. And we will provide \nlaw enforcement with the information they need to detect problems early \non.\n  It is not our intention to micromanage law enforcement. Our bill does \nnot tell law enforcement agencies what data should be collected. \nInstead, we direct the Attorney General to develop the standards for \ndata collection, and he presumably would work with law enforcement in \ndeveloping those standards. Our legislation also specifically directs \nthe Attorney General to also establish standards for setting benchmarks \nagainst which the collected data should be measured--so that no data is \ntaken out of context, as some in law enforcement rightly fear.\n  If the numbers reveal a portrait of continued racial profiling, then \nthe Justice Department or independent third parties can seek relief in \nFederal court ordering that remedies be put into effect to end racial \nprofiling.\n  Our bill would also put in place procedures to receive and \ninvestigate complaints alleging racial profiling.\n  It will require procedures to discipline law enforcement officers \nengaging in racial profiling.\n  Finally, we will encourage a climate of cultural change in law \nenforcement with a carrot and a stick.\n  First, the carrot: We recognize that law enforcement shouldn't be \nexpected to do this alone. So we are saying that if you do the job \nright--fairly and equitably--you can be eligible to receive a best \npractices development grant--to help pay for programs dealing with \nadvanced training.\n  To help pay for the computer technology that is necessary to collect \nthe data and statistics we have demanded.\n  We'll help pay for video cameras and recorders for your patrol cars.\n  We'll help pay for establishing or improving systems for handling \ncomplaints alleging ethnic or racial profiling.\n  We'll help to establish management systems to ensure that supervisors \nare held accountable for the conduct of subordinates.\n  But if you don't do the job right, there is the stick. If State and \nlocal\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\nlaw enforcement agencies refuse to implement procedures to end and \nprevent profiling, they will be subject to a loss of Federal law \nenforcement funds.\n  Let me be clear, this bill is not about blaming law enforcement, and \nit is not designed to prevent law enforcement from doing its job. In \nfact, we believe that it will help our officers maintain the public \ntrust they need to do their jobs.\n  If race is a part of a description of a specific suspect involved in \nan investigation, this law does not prevent that information from being \ndistributed. But stopping people on a random or race-based hunch will \nbe outlawed. Race has been a never-ending battle in this country. It \nbegan with our constitution, when the founding fathers argued over the \nrights of slaves. And then we fought a war over race. We fought a war \nthat ripped our country apart.\n  Our country emerged whole, but discrimination continued for decades--\ndiscrimination sanctioned in part, unfortunately, by our own Supreme \nCourt.\n  But our country's history has always been about change, about growth, \nabout recognizing those things that weaken us from within.\n  A generation ago, we began to fight another war--a war founded in \npeaceful principles, but a war that killed our heroes, burned our \ncities, and shook us once again to the very core.\n  But we advanced, with important civil rights initiatives like the \nVoting Rights Act. Like the public accommodations law. We demanded and \ngained laws to fight discrimination in employment, in housing, in \neducation. Today, it is time for us to take another step. Racial \nprofiling has bred humiliation, anger, resentment and cynicism \nthroughout this country. It has weakened respect for the law--by \neveryone, not just those offended.\n  Simply put--it is wrong and we must end it. Today we pledge to do \njust that--to define it, to ban it, and to enforce that ban.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Domenici, and \n        Mr. Smith):\n  S. 2134. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture and the \nSecretary of the Interior to enter into an agreement or contract with \nIndian tribes meeting certain criteria to carry out projects to protect \nIndian forest land; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bipartisan \nbill today that gives Native American tribes a chance to protect their \nreservation lands from catastrophic fire. I want to thank my \ncosponsors, Chairman Pete Domenici of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and Chairman Ben Nighthorse Campbell of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Like other Americans, many Native American tribes are concerned about \nthe risk of catastrophic forest fires spreading from nearby Federal \nlands onto their own lands. Last summer, at least 18 reservations were \ninvaded by fire from adjacent Federal public forest lands.\n  This bill attempts to give the tribes a chance to defend themselves \nand their ancestral lands by involving them in brush-clearing projects \non Federal lands near their reservations.\n  This is not just a theoretical problem, as tribes from my State know \nall too well.\n  Last fall's devastating wildfires in southern California caused \ndisproportionate suffering for Native Americans: Over 30,000 acres \nburned on 11 tribal reservations. Most tragically, 10 lives were lost \non or near reservations.\n  I am determined to give the tribes of my State and from around the \ncountry the opportunity to prevent this tragedy from recurring: The \nbill sets up a process for the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land \nManagement to enter into contracts with the tribes for fuel reduction \npurposes. If a tribe requests a brush-clearing project on federal lands \nnear its reservation, the agencies are encouraged to respond within \nspecific timeframes and suggest remedies for any agency concerns with \nthe tribe's proposal. There remains free and open competition for \ntimber contracts on Federal land. However, in determining the \nrecipients of the contracts, the agencies are encouraged to consider \nsuch factors as tribal treaty rights or cultural and historical \naffiliation to the land involved.\n  Nearly 100 Native American tribes support this legislation, including \nmost, if not all, the tribes in the State of California.\n  So I am pleased to introduce this bill today, and I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 2135. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the provision of items and services provided to Medicare \nbeneficiaries residing in rural areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to again join my colleague, \nSenator Cantwell, in introducing the MediFair Act of 2004. My bill will \nrestore fairness to the Medicare program and provide equity for health \ncare providers participating in Medicare. Most importantly, it will \nopen doors of care to more seniors and the disabled in my State.\n  Today, unfair Medicare reimbursement rates are causing doctors to \nlimit their care for Medicare beneficiaries. Throughout my State, \nseniors and the disabled are having a hard time finding a doctor who \nwill accept new Medicare patients.\n  Unfortunately, the recently-passed Medicare Prescription Drug, \nImprovement and Modernization Act of 2003 further compromises health \ncare in Washington State because it reduces Washington State's per \nbeneficiary payments from 42nd to 45th nationwide. This reduction \nplaces health care providers in my State at an economic disadvantage \nand further limits access to health care in Washington State.\n  My bill will reduce the regional inequities that have resulted in \nvastly different levels of care and access to care by ensuring that \nevery State receives at least the national average of per-patient \nspending. This measure will encourage more doctors to accept Medicare \npatients and will also guarantee that seniors are not penalized when \nthey choose to retire in the State of Washington.\n  In addition to ensuring that no State receives less than the national \naverage, my legislation will encourage healthy outcomes and efficient \nuse of Medicare payments. The current Medicare system punishes health \ncare providers who practice efficient healthcare and healthy outcomes. \nPhysicians and hospitals in my State are proud of the pioneering role \nthey have played in providing high quality, cost effective medicine. \nUnfortunately, they have been rewarded for their exceptional service by \nbeing paid a fraction of their actual costs.\n  On the other hand, States that are inefficient and that over-utilize \nthe system are rewarded with higher states of reimbursement. As we \ngrapple with an ever-increasing budget deficit. We need to make sure \nthat every dollar spent on Medicare is used as effectively as possible. \nI ask each and every one of my colleagues to join me in restoring \nfairness to the Medicare program and increasing access to health care \nfor Medicare beneficiaries by supporting the MediFair Act.\n  I want to acknowledge the lead sponsor of the MediFair bill in the \nHouse, Representative Adam Smith, as well as the other cosponsors, \nRepresentative Baird, Representative Dicks, Representative Inslee, \nRepresentative Larsen, and Representative McDermott.\n  I have been working on addressing the issue of inequitable Medicare \nreimbursement policies for a number of years, and I am pleased that we \nhave made inroads in addressing this issue. I especially appreciate the \nefforts by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to reward \nhealthy outcomes, and I look forward to working with HHS in the future \nto meet these goals.\n  Medicare should reward States like Washington that have a proven \ntradition of efficient and effective health care. Passing the MediFair \nAct will go a long way to improving health care access for seniors in \nStates like Washington and ensuring that Federal health care dollars \nproduce the best results possible for our patients.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS:\n  S. 2136.

A bill to provide coverage under the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program for individuals employed at \natomic weapons employer facilities during periods of residual \ncontamination; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an important piece \nof legislation to assist our atomic weapons workers. The legislation \naddresses a major flaw in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program by expanding eligibility for benefits.\n  Under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program \nAct (EEOICPA), workers are eligible for a payment of $150,000 and \nmedical coverage for expenses associated with the treatment of diseases \ncontracted due to exposure to radiation at atomic weapons plants. \nHowever, under EEOICPA, workers who became sick from working in \ncontaminated atomic weapons plants after weapons production ceased are \nnot eligible for benefits.\n  In 2003, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health \nreleased a Congressionally-mandated report, entitled `` Report on \nResidual Radioactive and Beryllium Contamination in Atomic Weapons \nEmployer and Beryllium Vendor Facilities.'' The report concluded that \n``significant'' residual radioactive contamination existed in many of \nthese plants for years and decades after weapons production ceased, \nposing a risk of radiation-related cancers or disease to unknowing \nworkers.\n  In fact, the report found that: 97, 44 percent, of covered facilities \nhave potential for significant residual radioactive contamination \noutside of the periods in which atomic weapons-related production \noccurred; 88, 40 percent, of such facilities have little potential for \nsignificant residual radioactive contamination outside of the periods \nin which atomic weapons-related production occurred; and 34, 16 \npercent, of such facilities have insufficient information to make a \ndetermination.\n  In my State of New York, 16 of 31 covered facilities were found to \nhave the potential for significant contamination, 10 had little \npotential for significant contamination, and 5 of the 31 had \ninsufficient information.\n  In other words, more than half of the New York Atomic Weapons \nEmployer Facilities in New York were contaminated after weapons \nproduction ceased. As a result, workers were exposed to radiation, and \ndeserve to be eligible for benefits under EEOICPA.\n  That is why I am introducing the Residual Radioactive Contamination \nCompensation Act (RRCCA) today. The bill would extend eligibility for \nbenefits under EEOICPA to workers who were employed at facilities where \nNIOSH has found potential for significant radioactive contamination.\n  In addition to expanding eligibility to workers employed at \nfacilities where NIOSH has found potential for significant radioactive \ncontamination, the Residual Radioactive Contamination Compensation Act \nwould require NIOSH to update the list of such facilities annually. \nThis addresses the fact that there was insufficient information for \nNIOSH to characterize a number of sites in its 2003 report.\n  I would also like to take the opportunity to draw attention to \nanother important issue--the special cohort rule. Under EEOICPA, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services was to establish procedures so \nthat workers can petition the government to be included in a ``special \ncohort''--meaning that they would be eligible for the program--if their \nradiation doses are difficult to estimate but it is likely that they \nhave radiation-caused illnesses. Despite this important mandate, the \nletter notes that ``. . . nearly 39 months after EEOICPA was signed \ninto law, the promise of ``timely, uniform and adequate compensation'' \nhas not been met.\n  As a result, I sent a letter to Secretary Thompson, along with \nSenator Voinovich and 16 of my other Senate colleagues--Senators \nHarkin, Kennedy, Schumer, Murray, DeWine, Alexander, Craig, Bond, and \nTalent, Reid, Grassley, Hollings, Cantwell, Domenici, Campbell, and \nBingaman. The letter requested that the Secretary immediately put out \nthe special cohort rule. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  More than two weeks after the letter was sent, I have still not \nreceived a response. This is unacceptable. The Administration seems to \nhave no sense of urgency in addressing this issue. But each day that \npasses only delays long overdue justice for the Cold War heroes who \nworked in our weapons facilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Residual Radioactive \nContamination Compensation Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 11, 2004.\n     Hon. Tommy G. Thompson,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 200 \n         Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: On October 30, 2000, the Energy \n     Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act \n     (EEOICPA) was signed into law (PL 106-386) as part of the FY \n     01 Defense Authorization Act. Enactment of EEOICPA was \n     recognition by Congress and the President that the federal \n     government needed to act quickly to remedy long-standing \n     injustices against atomic weapons program workers. The \n     findings of the Act make the need for the Program abundantly \n     clear, and include the acknowledgment that:\n       ``Since the inspection of the nuclear weapons program and \n     for several decades afterwards, a large number of nuclear \n     weapons workers at sites of the Department of Energy and at \n     sites of vendors who supplied the Cold War effort were put at \n     risk without their knowledge and consent for reasons that, \n     documents reveal, were driven by fears of adverse publicity, \n     liability, and employee demands for hazardous duty pay.''\n       The Act further states that:\n       ``the purpose of the compensation program is to provide for \n     timely, uniform, and adequate compensation of covered \n     employees and, where applicable, survivors of such employees, \n     suffering from illnesses incurred by such employees in the \n     performance of duty for the Department of Energy and certain \n     of its contractors and subcontractors.''\n       Yet nearly 39 months after EEOICPA was signed into law, the \n     promise of ``timely, uniform and adequate compensation'' has \n     not been met. We are very concerned about the delay in \n     finalizing the ``special exposure cohort'' petition \n     procedures by the Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS) pursuant to 42 USC 7384(q).\n       In this regard, EEOICPA specifically provides:\n       ``. . . members of a class of employees at a Department of \n     Energy facility, or at an atomic weapons employer facility, \n     may be treated as members of the Special Exposure Cohort for \n     purposes of the compensation program if the President, upon \n     recommendation of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker \n     Health, determines that--\n       (1) it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy \n     the radiation dose that the class received; and\n\n[[Page S1694]]\n\n       (2) there is reasonable likelihood that such radiation dose \n     may have endangered the health of members of the class.''\n       The law further states that, ``the President shall consider \n     such petitions pursuant to procedures established by the \n     President.''\n       Procedures for Designating Classes of Employees as Members \n     of the Special Exposure Cohort were first proposed through a \n     rulemaking, and then subsequently withdrawn in 2002 after \n     uniform criticism. Revised rules were proposed in March of \n     2003, but to date they have not been finalized. Workers have \n     and continue to be blocked from filing petitions to become \n     members of the Special Exposure Cohort because HHS has failed \n     to meet its statutory responsibility to issue these \n     regulations.\n       Further delay is denying long-overdue justice for those who \n     were intended to be covered by the special exposure cohort \n     provisions of the Act. After over three years, HHS has had \n     ample time to study this matter, and further delay is simply \n     inexcusable.\n       Therefore, we urge you to finalize the special exposure \n     cohort rules and publish them in the Federal Register \n     immediately. Our atomic weapons program workers, who are true \n     Cold War heroes, helped protect our nation and deserve \n     nothing less. We thank you for your prompt attention to this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Members of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Residual Radioactive \n     Contamination Compensation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Beginning in the early 1940s, the Department of Energy \n     and its predecessors, the Atomic Energy Commission and the \n     Manhattan Engineering District, relied upon hundreds of \n     private-sector factories and laboratories to develop, test, \n     and produce atomic weapons for use by the military, and these \n     facilities became contaminated with radioactive materials \n     during the process of producing material used for atomic \n     weapons production.\n       (2) The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n     Program Act of 2000 (in this section referred to as EEOICPA) \n     provides health care and lump-sum benefits for radiation-\n     related cancers and other illnesses to certain covered \n     workers made sick while they toiled in the nation's nuclear \n     weapons factories, including vendor facilities. EEOICPA \n     defines these private-sector vendor facilities as atomic \n     weapons employer facilities, and employees working in such \n     facilities while their employers were under contract to \n     process nuclear weapons materials are defined as atomic \n     weapons employees.\n       (3) Many of the atomic weapons employer facilities were not \n     properly decontaminated after processing radioactive \n     materials such as thorium, uranium, and radium and retained \n     significant levels of contamination. Workers who were hired \n     and employed in such atomic weapons employer facilities after \n     the date that contracts were ended for production were \n     potentially exposed to significant amounts of radiation. \n     Congress was not aware of the presence of residual \n     radioactive contamination in these facilities when it enacted \n     EEOICPA, thus inadvertently denying coverage under the law to \n     those who were unwittingly exposed to radiation left over \n     from nuclear weapons activities.\n       (4) In December 2001, the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107) was enacted, \n     which required in section 3151(b) that the National Institute \n     for Occupational Safety and Health study and issue a final \n     report to Congress by December 2002 describing which of the \n     atomic weapons employer facilities had significant residual \n     radioactive contamination remaining in them after processing \n     materials for use in atomic weapons and during what time \n     periods such radioactive contamination remained.\n       (5) In October 2003, the Institute issued a report, titled \n     Report on Residual Radioactive and Beryllium Contamination in \n     Atomic Weapons Employer and Beryllium Vendor Facilities. The \n     report found that, out of 219 atomic weapons employer \n     facilities--\n       (A) 97 (44 percent) of such facilities have potential for \n     significant residual radioactive contamination outside of the \n     periods in which atomic weapons-related production occurred;\n        (B) 88 (40 percent) of such facilities have little \n     potential for significant residual radioactive contamination \n     outside of the periods in which atomic weapons-related \n     production occurred; and\n       (C) 34 (16 percent) of such facilities have insufficient \n     information to make a determination.\n       (6) Congress is now aware that workers were employed in a \n     substantial number of atomic weapons employer facilities \n     years after the Manhattan Project ended. These workers were \n     potentially harmed by legacy residual radioactive \n     contamination that permeated the walls, the floors, and the \n     air of their worksites well after the Atomic Energy \n     Commission and the Department of Energy terminated contracts \n     for production activities. This exposure to residual \n     radioactive contamination took place without the knowledge or \n     consent of these workers.\n       (7) Congress therefore declares that, based on the \n     scientific assessment by the Institute, those workers hired \n     and employed in such facilities during the period after Cold \n     War production stopped but during which the Institute found \n     there was significant residual radioactive contamination \n     should be defined as atomic weapons employees under EEOICPA, \n     should be eligible to apply for compensation under subtitle B \n     of EEOICPA, and should have their claims evaluated on the \n     same basis as those atomic weapons employees who were \n     employed during the period when processing of radioactive \n     materials was underway as part of the atomic weapons program.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to expand the boundary of the Mount Rainier National \nPark; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce--along with my \ncolleague Senator Murray--the Expanding and Making Mount Rainier \nNational Park More Accessible Act.\n  This bill authorizes a boundary expansion of Mount Rainier National \nPark to allow the National Park Service to acquire 800 acres of land \nfrom private landowners, on a willing seller basis. These lands are \nlocated near the Carbon River and, if acquired, they would be included \nin Mount Rainier National Park, one of America's greatest national \nparks.\n  If enacted, the proposed expansion will improve access for visitors, \nallow for a new campsite to be built, and save taxpayers money that \nwill no longer be needed to repair a frequently washed out road.\n  While this legislation will make Mount Rainier National Park safer \nand\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\nmore accessible for families and outdoor enthusiasts, it is important \nto note that this expansion will also promote the local economy. \nOutdoor recreation is more than an activity in the Northwest, it is \nalso a key part of our economy. By improving access to the park, my \nbill will make it easier for visitors to enjoy the park and to purchase \ngoods and services in nearby communities.\n  This expansion will ensure continued access to the park because the \nnorthwest entrance road is continually washed out by seasonal \nfluctuations of the glacier-fed Carbon River. The river, which now \nflows at a higher elevation than the roadbed, has blocked visitors from \naccessing the National Park Service's Ipsut Creek campground and nearby \nhiking trails inside the park. The repairs to this road have proven \nboth costly and short-lived and have strained the National Park \nService's already limited maintenance budget. In the long run, the \nexpansion will save taxpayers money because the road will not have to \nbe maintained to current standards. If this bill is enacted, the \nNational Park Service plans to provide a shuttle service to take \nvisitors to the Carbon Glacier trailhead. That way, visitors will still \nbe able to hike to the Carbon Glacier during day trips.\n  If this bill is enacted, local conservation groups and the National \nPark Service will work to reach agreements with landowners in the \nproposed expansion area. I am pleased that the current landowners \nactively participated in the process and enthusiastically support this \nlegislation. In fact, they are eager to sell their land to the National \nPark Service so that these lands will be permanently protected for the \nenjoyment of future generations.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate as well as \nother members of the Washington state congressional delegation to \nensure swift passage of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/26/senate-section/article/S1695-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 93--AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF \n     THE CAPITOL BY THE JOINT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL \n                               CEREMONIES\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that the chairman \nand ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee will \nshortly ask unanimous consent to correct certain errors in the \nenrollment of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act, S. 1072. As the managers know, this \nunanimous consent agreement does not address two issues that are very \nimportant to me, and I would like to engage the managers of the highway \nbill in a colloquy on these matters.\n  First, the consent agreement does not cover my amendment to address \nan emergency road situation in the Devils Lake Basin of ND. During \nconsideration of the highway bill, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee agreed to include a modified \nversion of my amendment in a managers' amendment. The modified \namendment would allow the State of North Dakota to use certain funds \nwithin its annual highway allocation to repair and reconstruct roads \ncurrently serving as dams and to receive reimbursement from the \nEmergency Relief program for that work. Unfortunately, this language \nwas inadvertently left out of the managers' amendment.\n  The amendment that was agreed to by the chairman and ranking member \nis not my preferred solution. I believe the sole responsibility for \nthis emergency situation belongs to the Federal Highway Administration. \nOver the years, the Federal Highway Administration allowed these roads \nto be raised without first stabilizing them as dams. We now have a \nsituation where 8 miles of roads are serving as dams and holding back \nwater, yet the roads were not constructed as dams. It these roads were \nto fail, the Emergency Relief program would be activated to rebuild \nthem. I believe the State of North Dakota should not have to divert its \nlimited highway dollars to address this emergency situation created by \nthe Federal Government and will continue to pursue a solution that does \nnot require my state to take sole responsibility for this situation. \nBut I want to stress that I greatly appreciate the help of both the \nchairman and ranking member in devising a compromise and agreeing to \naccept the modified amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand the Senator's position. Unfortunately, we do \nnot agree on his preferred solution which is why compromise language \nwas developed and the amendment was modified. I will agree with the \nSenator that the modified amendment was indeed cleared by both the \nmajority and minority sides of the committee. However, as the Senator \nnotes, this modified amendment was inadvertently left out of the \nmanager's package that was approved by the Senate. I commit to fixing \nthis error at the earliest possible opportunity and will work in \nconference to protect the Senate position on this issue.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I fully agree with the chairman. The Senator's \namendment should have been included in the managers' amendment, and I \nwill work with you and the chairman to resolve this matter as the \nprocess moves forward.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I greatly appreciate the help and cooperation of the \nSenator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Vermont on this very \nimportant issue and their willingness to accept my amendment. Let me \nnow turn to the second issue, that of making sure this legislation is \nfully paid for within the six year period for which programs are \nauthorized in the highway bill.\n  During Finance Committee consideration of the tax title of the \nSAFETEA bill, I was joined by the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Nickles, in insisting that the bill should be properly paid for \nover 6 years with no gimmicks. We filed an amendment to accomplish \nthis, but I agreed to withhold from offering it in return for a \ncommitment from the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee to work with me to find appropriate offsets before the \nSAFETEA bill was voted off the Senate floor.\n  During floor consideration of the SAFETEA bill, I filed an amendment \nthat would have fulfilled the commitment made to committee members \nduring the Finance markup. Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus worked \nwith me to include my amendment in a managers' amendment. \nUnfortunately, because some items in my amendment were nongermane, only \na portion of the amendment was ultimately accepted as part of the \nmanagers' amendment before the Senate voted on final passage of the \nSAFETEA bill.\n  It would be my preference to address that issue in the unanimous \nconsent agreement that will be offered shortly, but I understand that \nis not possible at this time. However, it is my understanding that \nthere will be another opportunity to fulfill the commitment to fully \noffset spending in the Senate's highway bill before it is sent to the \nHouse for consideration. As the bill now stands, approximately $7.6 \nbillion of spending over the next 6 years in the SAFETEA bill is not \noffset. I believe it is critical that this commitment be honored and \nthat the remaining $7.6 billion in outlays be offset within the next 6 \nyears. I am eager to continue working with the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of both the Finance and Environment and Public Works Committees \nto address my concerns.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I support the amendments offered by my colleagues from \nNorth Dakota and Oklahoma. I was disappointed that, despite our best \nefforts, we were unable to clear the full text of the Conrad-Nickles \namendment. But for an objection that was unrelated to the purpose of \nthe Conrad-Nickles amendment, the highway bill would contain the full \nagreement between Senators Baucus, Nickles, Conrad, and me. I want to \nassure them that I fully intend to make good on the promise made in the \ncommittee markup. As the legislative process moves forward, I pledge \nthat I will continue working to address their concerns.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I concur with the statement of the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, and I, too, pledge to continue working to address \nthe concerns of my colleagues from Oklahoma and North Dakota.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree with my colleagues that we ought to fully offset \nthe spending that will occur over the next 6 years as a result of the \nauthorizations in the SAFETEA bill. I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues to see that this goal is achieved.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank Senator Conrad and Senator Nickles for their \ncontinued efforts on this issue. I, too, want to lend my commitment and \nsupport to fully paying for the SAFETEA bill before the Senate \ncompletes action on the legislation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the managers for those commitments. With those \nassurances, I will not object to the unanimous consent request to make \ntechnical corrections in the Senate-passed bill.\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\n                  THE FERRY BOAT DISCRETIONARY PROGRAM\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that there \nwas an error in processing my amendment to increase funding for, and \nmake other improvements to, the Federal Highway Administration Ferry \nBoat Discretionary Program.\n  My amendment was included in the SAFETEA authorization bill, and I \nwant to confirm with my colleagues the correct funding level for the \nrecord so there is no confusion.\n  Prior to my amendment being sent to the desk, I had reached agreement \nwith all the majority and minority managers of the bill to increase \nfunding for the ferry program to the level of $120 million per year in \nthe SAFETEA authorization bill.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that, in the processing of the final \namendments to the bill, the amendment making this change was not the \namendment that was sent to the desk and enrolled by the bill clerk.\n  To clarify the record, I would like to ask my colleague, Chairman \nInhofe, what is his understanding of the level that is agreed upon for \nthe ferry program in the SAFETEA authorization bill?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I say to Senator Murray, the agreed upon level for \ninclusion in the SAFETEA bill for the Ferry Boat Discretionary Program \nis $120 million per year of which $60 million is provided in contract \nauthority and $60 million is authorized for appropriation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I also ask Senators Bond, Jeffords and Reid, whether \nthat is their understanding?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, we agree that this is the amount we consider to be \nincluded in the SAFETEA authorization bill for the ferry boat \ndiscretionary program.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senior Senator from Washington State is correct. It \nwas our understanding that the bill envisions $120 million per year for \nthat program.\n  Mr. REID. I say to Senator Murray, I am in agreement that a \ncommitment was made to include $120 million per year for the ferry boat \ndiscretionary program.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in the \nengrossment of the bill S. 1072, the Secretary of the Senate be \nauthorized to strike pages 43 through 83, and pages 105 and 106 of \namendment No. 2616. I further ask that the bill be printed as passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of S. 1072 is as follows:\n\n                                S. 1072\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There are approximately 1,500,000 interstate household \n     moves every year. While the vast majority of these interstate \n     moves are completed successfully, consumer complaints have \n     been increasing since the Interstate Commerce Commission was \n     abolished in 1996 and oversight of the household goods \n     industry was transferred to the Department of Transportation.\n       (2) While the overwhelming majority of household goods \n     carriers are honest and operate within the law, there appears \n     to be a growing criminal element that is exploiting a \n     perceived void in Federal and State enforcement efforts. The \n     growing criminal element tends to prey upon consumers.\n       (3) The movement of an individual's household goods is \n     unique and differs from the movement of a commercial \n     shipment. A consumer may utilize a moving company once or \n     twice in the consumer's lifetime and entrust virtually all of \n     the consumer's worldly goods to a mover.\n       (4) Federal resources are inadequate to properly police or \n     deter, on a nationwide basis, those movers who willfully \n     violate Federal regulations governing the household goods \n     industry and knowingly prey on consumers who are in a \n     vulnerable position. It is appropriate that a Federal-State \n     partnership be created to enhance enforcement against \n     fraudulent moving companies.\n\n     SEC. 4303. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title, the terms ``carrier'', ``household goods'', \n     ``motor carrier'', ``Secretary'', and ``transportation'' have \n     the meaning given such terms in section 13102 of title 49, \n     United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4304.

I further ask consent that following the \nprayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of \nproceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be \nreserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume \nconsideration of S. 1805, the gun liability bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that tomorrow the \nmajority will allow a period of morning business that will come \nsometime during the day. I would ask that the consent be, on the \nDemocratic side, that Senator Conrad be recognized for 45 minutes, \nSenator Harkin for 30 minutes, Senator Byrd for 30 minutes; and, of \ncourse, if the majority wants whatever time, in whatever order they \nwish, they would be interspersed with these speakers, meaning there \nwould be a Republican, a Democrat, as we do all the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/26/senate-section/article/S1848-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
