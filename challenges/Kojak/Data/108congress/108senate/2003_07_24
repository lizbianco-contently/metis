Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nfor the transaction of morning business for 30 minutes. Following that \ntime, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2555, the Department \nof Homeland Security appropriations bill. We disposed of a number of \namendments during yesterday's session, and I understand there are a few \nissues remaining. I reiterate that I hope we can expedite consideration \nof these amendments and proceed to final passage of this bill at an \nearly hour today. We would then like to proceed to two additional \nappropriations bills this week.\n  In addition, we have the Chile and Singapore free trade agreements \nthat we would like to consider this week if possible. Those bills are \nconsidered under fast-track procedures and have limited debate. I hope \nwe will not use the time allotted under the statute and we can complete \nthose two bills prior to finishing our business this week.\n  We will be devoting the entirety of next week to the pending Energy \nbill. We will have a full week's consideration, with debate and votes \nthroughout the week. I have had the opportunity to talk with the \nmanagers of that bill, and they have been working very hard to have \nthis bill addressed on the floor in an orderly, systematic way so that \nwe can work toward completion of that bill beginning Monday.\n  I do expect lengthy sessions next week as we try to complete our work \non that bill, which has been pending since May 6.\n  I also remind Senators that at 3:40 p.m. today we will observe a \nmoment of silence to honor the memory of our two fallen Capitol Police \nofficers, Officers Chestnut and Gibson. Members are encouraged to be in \nthe Chamber for that moment of silence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9827-6", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHILD TAX CREDIT CHECKS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

In fact, \nin Tennessee over 525,000 taxpayers will receive these child tax credit \nchecks.\n  This tax relief is much deserved, and I am pleased that we are able \nto begin delivery of those checks. In this body, we passed the Jobs and \nGrowth Tax Act, which is the third largest tax relief package in \nhistory, increasing that child tax credit from $600 to $1,000. We will \ncontinue to work on a whole range of issues that will strengthen our \neconomy over time.\n  Next week, we will be addressing energy reform, and we will continue \nworking on such issues in the coming weeks and months as medical \nliability reform and a host of other legislative issues that we believe \nstrongly will create jobs, will grow the economy, and will help \nAmerican families meet their bottom line.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9827-7", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the announcements regarding \nthe schedule of the distinguished majority leader. I simply say that I \nthink the debate on homeland security this week has been a good one. I \ncredit the chairman, as well as our ranking member, Senator Byrd, for \nthe vigorous debate we have had on a number of issues relating to \nhomeland security. We still have a number of amendments left to be \nresolved today, and I expect it will take a good part of the day before \nwe are able to finish.\n  I can also appreciate the majority leader's desire to get as much \nwork done prior to the August recess as possible, and his desire to \nmove to other appropriations bills is understandable. However, I must \nsay--and I have said privately and publicly--that his decision to wait \nuntil next week to begin and then finish the Energy bill leaves open \nthe possibility that we will not finish, unless he is prepared to stay \nlonger than next Friday. We have 382 amendments. That is about 77 \namendments a day. I know some of those amendments will melt away, as \noftentimes happens. But we have not seen the electricity title.\n  I am told there are other portions of the bill that are being revised \nas we speak. Senators cannot even offer amendments to those portions of \nthe bill because they have not seen the draft. So it presents some \nlogistical as well as really substantive questions and problems that, \nunfortunately, complicate the schedule even more and the majority \nleader's understandable desire to finish.\n  So I just warn my colleagues that, as much as I would like to see an \nEnergy bill passed, we have a lot of concerns and some misgivings about \nthe current bill. We hope we can address the renewable portfolio \nstandard, the conservation issues, and a whole array of issues that \nhave yet to be resolved. We have not been able to do that. So we are \nrolling the dice, in a way, and gambling, in a sense, that we can \nsomehow accommodate all of these questions, all of this debate, and \nthese very serious issues in a matter of a couple of days. I do not \nknow how one does that. Obviously, it is certainly the majority \nleader's right to make these decisions so long as we all are aware of \nthe challenges it presents and the complications to completion it would \nanticipate.\n\n  I again warn my colleagues and certainly in a most sincere way \nexpress a desire to complete the work, but we have to have time to do \nthat. We do not have, in my view, adequate time with that schedule to \ncomplete the work on the Energy bill, as much as we would like to do \nthat.\n\n\n                            Child Tax Credit\n\n  I also note the majority leader talked to another issue we have been \ndiscussing on and off for a long time. I believe it is 48 days since we \nmade the effort initially to reinstate the tax credit that was \neliminated when the tax bill was signed into law for those whose \nincomes fall below $26,000. There are 12 million children--200,000 \nchildren of military families--who were intentionally left out of the \nlegislation the majority leader referenced a moment ago. That has \ntroubled us.\n  We have attempted on several occasions to reinstate that tax credit \nfor those millions of families left out. We had a motion to proceed a \ncouple of weeks ago, and we have indicated that we will continue to ask \nunanimous consent to ensure we have an opportunity, once more, to send \nas clear a message about the unfairness, the inequity, the \nextraordinary insult this represents to those families who are even, I \nwould argue, more deserving of a tax credit than families with higher \nincomes.\n  So far our efforts have been unsuccessful because of the opposition \nexpressed by our colleagues on the other side. But we will continue \nevery day to find a way to see if this matter can be resolved prior to \nthe time we leave for the August recess.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  I again renew the request. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1434; that \nthe bill be read a third time and passed; and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table. This is the Lincoln-Snowe child tax \ncredit bill for those working Americans who will not get checks this \nweek and which we have attempted to address now for several weeks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill be objecting, let me say to my good friend, the Democratic leader, \nthat discussions continue between the two chairmen of Ways and Means in \nthe House and Finance in the Senate. We are still optimistic that we \nwill be able to move forward on something related to this matter in the \nnear future. But in the meantime, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the optimistic forecast of \nthe distinguished assistant Republican leader. I will say, we have \nheard this now for some 48 days. The House leaves tomorrow, and they \nwill have left without addressing this issue. So as checks are received \nfor millions of families whose incomes exceed $26,000, all of those 12 \nmillion kids whose incomes are below $26,000 are going to be left \nempty-handed, in part because of objections, in part because of \nintransigence on the other side, in part simply because, by design, \nthey were left out when this bill was written several months ago.\n  It is unfortunate but, as I say, we will continue to draw this matter \nto the attention of our colleagues, continue to find a way to resolve \nthis so that some measure of equity can be provided, especially with \nregard to families who need it the most.\n  Mr. President, I know there are some Democratic Senators wishing to \ncome to the Chamber soon to offer amendments. I understand we have \nmorning business until 10 o'clock. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if there is no one wishing to speak, I \nwish to make a short comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I know the order is for time on the other side. I ask to \nuse about 5 or 7 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9828-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9828-S9829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           LEWIS & CLARK AND THE REVEALING OF AMERICA EXHIBIT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the time of year when Senators \nhave visitors from home. I know many come to my office and ask me \npersonally, What should I see in Washington now?\n  Last evening, I visited the opening of the Lewis and Clark exhibit, \n``Lewis & Clark and the Revealing of America.'' It is at the Library of \nCongress from July 24 to November 29.\n  I have asked that a copy of the booklet that is being given out at \nthis exhibit be placed on every Senator's desk. I do hope that will \nhappen. I congratulate the Congressional Caucus on the Bicentennial of \nLewis and Clark: Senators Conrad Burns, Larry Craig, Byron Dorgan, and \nRepresentatives Doug Bereuter and Earl Pomeroy.\n  As one goes into the exhibit in the Library of Congress, the first \nthing one will see is the 1507 Waldseemuller world map. This is the \nfirst map that used the word ``America'' in the history of the world. \nBeyond that, there are a series of maps that lead up to the information \nthat President Jefferson had when he dispatched Lewis and Clark to make \ntheir historic journey.\n  The interesting point about this is that for years, the maps of our \npart of the world were really kept classified by the Spanish, and it \ntook a German geographer, Alexander von Humboldt, when he visited \nMexico City and got access to the archives of Mexico to disclose to the \nworld the maps that had been prepared prior to that time.\n  Copies of each of those maps is on exhibit at the Library of \nCongress. It takes us through the total exploration of Lewis and Clark \nbut subsequent explorations of the American West, the Louisiana \nPurchase, and the total history of our country west of the Mississippi. \nIt is told through maps and through artifacts that have been gathered \nnot only to tell us the geography of our area, but really the dress of \nAmericans at that time, the plants--a total description of the West as \nit was known then.\n  What is interesting is that the German geographer who had visited \nMexico City actually visited with President\n\n[[Page S9829]]\n\nJefferson prior to the time Lewis and Clark set off, as I said. The \ninformation he brought to the public, to the world at that time is just \nstaggering.\n  I have seen a lot of exhibits at the Library of Congress in my day, \nand I have the honor to be the chairman of the Joint Congressional \nCommittee on the Library. I believe this is an exhibition that should \nbe called to the attention of every one of our visitors as they come \ninto our offices.\n  I call to the attention of the Senate also that there is a film \nprogram that is going to go on starting Friday, July 25. There will be \na series of films shown at the James Madison Building, which is part of \nthe Library of Congress. These films are free and open to the public \nbut require advance notice and reservations to get in. The seating is \nlimited.\n\n  They are amazing historic films. It starts off with a 1955 Paramount \nfilm which is entitled ``The Far Horizons'' and continues through until \nNovember 21. The schedules are shown in the booklet. This is the kind \nof information I think Senators would be extremely wise to point out to \ntheir visitors. All they have to do to make reservations is call the \nnumber that is shown in this booklet, and they can have reservations \nfor one of the finest historic films that one could think of. Each \nTuesday, Thursday, and Friday, between now and November 21, there will \nbe films shown to the public.\n  I do congratulate the Library of Congress, Dr. Billington and his \nstaff, for putting together this enormous exhibition of the history of \nour American West. I do hope everyone has an opportunity to take the \ntime to see it. It is not something one can just go in and make a 5-\nminute visit and look at a map. If they go through that door, they are \ngoing to be trapped for at least 30 to 45 minutes, or hours. It is one \nof the most staggering exhibits I have seen.\n  At one point, through our electronic means, they have the ability to \nshow the actual outline of our Nation and put it up against the maps \nthat were prepared back in the days before any digital concepts, before \nany real capability for surveying. It is amazing how close they came to \npreparing maps that were accurate, and this started off 500 years ago.\n  This is 500 years of history of the American West, and people can see \nit in a half hour or 2 hours. I do hope Senators will take the occasion \nto look at the booklet I have asked the Library of Congress to provide \nus. Copies of this chart are available to every Senator to put in their \noffice so they can tell their visitors about this amazing exhibition.\n  In closing, I thank the Senate for the time, and particularly my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle for letting me use some of their \ntime, to speak about this exhibit. This is the work product of not only \nthe Library of Congress, but they give credit to the Bicentennial \nCongressional Caucus, which is cochaired by my good friend from \nMontana. He will find an enormous number of photographs and history of \nhis great State where I had the privilege of going to college for a \nshort period of time. I want him to know this is a memory trip for me \nto go through this exhibition. I do thank him for his work, and I thank \nthe other Senators for their courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I put a footnote on this. I recommend the \nLewis and Clark exhibit. It is wonderful history. Of course, the \nLouisiana Purchase is of great interest to all of us in the West. I \nrecommend a book I am about two-thirds of the way through. It is called \n``The Wilderness So Immense.'' It is the history of how we purchased \nall that land from France when Jefferson was ambassador to France. It \ngoes back to 1785 and 1786, and also the politics involved with Spain. \nIt involves the navigation of the Mississippi River, the control of New \nOrleans and, of course, Spain's influence in the great American \nsouthwest that led to the Louisiana Purchase. I recommend that book. It \nis written by Jon Kukla, and it gives a great insight on what happened.\n  I thank the Senator for mentioning this great 200th anniversary of \nthe Louisiana Purchase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning we have been through a series \nof briefings with regard to Iraq. It amazes me, as we hear some of the \nrhetoric that is coming out of this town and, of course, across the \nwaves, and I wish to bring to the attention of those who missed it, it \nwas a very good briefing put on by Ambassador Bremer of what is \nhappening in Iraq after the armed conflict is over, but which continues \ntoday on a guerrilla basis, and report to the American people that all \nthe press we get is sort of on the negative side, but there are some \nvery positive signs.\n  I hasten back to the start of our country. The path to democracy is a \nvery rocky path. Sometimes it is very slow and sometimes it is very \ndangerous, but there are things being done now, and the best \nambassadors I have found on the ground in Iraq are our uniformed \ntroops.\n  If one can imagine a people who have been under the tyranny of Saddam \nHussein for the last 25 years being told how evil this great army could \nbe, that they would either cut out their tongues or they would kill \nthem, and then have one of our soldiers or marines in combat gear and \nhelmet, dirty, sandy, and grimy, walk up to a young Iraqi person with a \nsmile and offer a hand of friendship in the form of water or some food, \nbut mostly the hand of friendship, they are making great strides in \nwinning the hearts of the Iraqi people and helping them to establish a \nfree and open government for their own freedom and prosperity.\n\n  Right now, we are not hearing these kinds of figures: 85 percent of \nthe cities and towns in Iraq now have elected councils in place and \nworking. There was a strategy after the conflict was over, but No. 1 \nwas security. We cannot do a thing in Iraq, and neither can the Iraqi \npeople do for themselves, until it is secure so they will feel safe.\n  The building of central services, electrical power, water, sewer, all \nof these amenities that make life easy for us, are not in place. Saddam \nHussein never paid a lot of attention to that. He rationed electrical \npower, water, all the services we take for granted in America. He \nlimited them in order to suppress, and he got to pick and choose who \nwere afforded those kinds of amenities or those central services we \nfind so necessary in our own towns, villages, counties, and States.\n  We are making progress. We are now reconfiguring our military \npresence there. We are also doing something about the economy. How does \none move state-owned enterprises into the private sector to provide \nsome economic thrust for job and economic opportunity for the Iraqi \npeople? That framework is in place, and it is being carried out.\n  How do we train a militia or a police force for the Iraqi people, \nheaded by Iraqi people, and an armed forces for Iraq who answer not to \na military tyrant but to a civilian government patterned somewhat like \nour own? That, too, is being put in place, and they are being trained \nby our forces.\n  We have around 30 to 40 coalition forces from different countries \nrepresented in Iraq right now. There are 12 top contributors, of which \nthe U.S., the U.K., Spain, Norway, and others are all participating in \nthis endeavor.\n  I advise the American people to look at the positive side of \nestablishing a civil and free government in Iraq. We are building a new \nirrigation system and repairing old systems because the infrastructure \nhas dwindled away. It has almost been destroyed--not by war but by use \nand wear. These folks need to be able to feed themselves.\n  We have agriculturists in the field, nongovernmental organizations in \nthe field working in health care and agriculture and services vital to \nthe Iraqi people to put this country back together and make it a \ndemocracy that will be the shining example of the Middle East.\n  We cannot lose our resolve. The Founders of this country did not lose\n\n[[Page S9830]]\n\ntheir resolve. They committed to an idea of freedom and self-\ngovernment. Our path to democracy was not easy either. We have had 200 \nyears of democracy. They have had less than 200 days to establish what \nthey have dreamed of--freedom and the dignity of the individual. That \nis what this is all about. If they do not lose their resolve, we cannot \nlose our resolve.\n  Our President has provided that leadership under heavy criticism. He \nhas established a goal and idea that will change the Middle East and \nhow they do business in the Middle East.\n  Peace and freedom can be accomplished. The American people have made \na commitment to do that goal. Now we have to maintain our resolve to \nthe completion of that mission.\n  I thank our military forces this morning. They are men and women of \ngreat courage who know what the mission is and know how to complete the \nmission. Congratulations to our leadership, our leadership in \nWashington, President Bush and his staff. They have provided the \nresolve it takes to complete the mission.\n  There are many positive things. When the President said: We will hunt \ndown these killers and deal with them--he meant it. The credibility \naround the world continues to be high with our leader. When he says it, \nhe means it, he does it. It has bolstered Americans and shows what it \nis like to be the champion of freedom and human dignity around the \nworld.\n  Is it costly? Yes, it is costly. Was it costly back in 1776 and the \nfollowing years until 1800? Yes, it was costly. But we survived. We \nnever lost our resolve. We cannot lose it now.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for allowing me this little time. \nThere are a lot of facts and figures we could throw out, but the \nmessage today is stand fast. If we believe in the fire of freedom, it \nis our responsibility to maintain that resolve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nthat wonderful speech. He did remind us once again the stakes we have \nin the war on terrorism. What is happening in Iraq is a high-stakes \ngame. We are committed. America is not going to walk away. We are not \ngoing to start a job that we do not finish. The job is to bring peace \nand stability to the people of Iraq and to the entire Middle East. I \nthank the Senator from Montana for coming forward with that message.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). There are 4 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I will continue on the same subject \nas the Senator from Montana and talk about what we are doing in Iraq. \nThe meetings we had with Ambassador Bremer brought much more clarity to \nthe progress being made in Iraq. Everyone is stunned and saddened by \nthe loss of life of our soldiers that we see, unfortunately, on a daily \nbasis. This gets worse every day because we are sick about losing these \nsoldiers.\n  Part of the reason we have not been able to capture these people who \nare doing these horrible acts to our soldiers--one and two and three at \na time--is because Iraqi people do not yet believe we are there to stay \nuntil they have a democracy in place. There is widespread belief in \nIraq that Saddam Hussein is coming back. When we were able to capture \nthe sons of Saddam Hussein, and they are now dead, that sent a message \nto the people of Iraq that we are going to capture Saddam Hussein. We \nare not going to stop until we know he is captured or dead. Two of his \nsons are dead, the two who would have been heirs to his incredibly \ncruel regime. They are dead. They are gone.\n  I applaud the President for saying he is going to show the dead \nbodies so the people of Iraq will be assured. In our culture, that \nwould be horrifying. We would never show dead bodies in a newspaper in \nour country, particularly identified dead bodies. However, we have a \ndifferent problem in Iraq. We have a problem that the people do not \nbelieve these people are really dead. Therefore, they fear coming \nforward and giving information about the people who are killing our \nsoldiers. They fear coming forward and embracing Americans in many \nparts of Iraq. If that, in their culture, is what is necessary to show \nthat these two sadistic tyrants are dead, that they can no longer cut \noff arms and legs, put children in shackles in jail, abuse children, \nabuse women, that they can no longer do these horrific acts, if that is \nthe way we must show the Iraqis that these people are gone, I applaud \nthe President for saying we will do it. I hope the President does.\n  We must get the trust of the Iraqi people. I do not think we are \ngoing to have that trust until they know that Saddam Hussein is dead, \nthey know the sons are dead, and they know we are going to keep our \ncommitment; that we are going to try to make life better for the Iraqi \npeople and put their own people in charge of their own fate. That is \nwhat they are looking for. We must show them we are not going to give \nup because times are tough. Times are tough over there right now.\n  For people I talk to on the streets, it is incomprehensible they do \nnot appreciate what we have done. We have to understand what they have \nlived through for the last 25 years in that country. They are used to \nbeing abused for no reason. If they look the wrong way, they may be \nshot at close range. That is what they have lived with. We cannot even \nimagine that in our country. We must try to win their trust in this \nslow and methodical way.\n  Madam President, our administration is making great progress. We are \nshowing we will have the resolve to see this through.\n  If we can bring a quality of life and of freedom to the people of \nIraq, then we do hope this will also stabilize the rest of the Middle \nEast so we can bring a peace between the Palestinians and Israel, the \ntwo can live side by side in peace, and have at least the ability to \nlive in peace if not trade together and work together.\n  That will also send a signal to the people of Iran that they can have \nfreedom once again. It will send a signal to the people of Syria and \nthroughout the Middle East that they, too, do not have to live under \ndictatorial regimes that allow them no freedom and do not have good \neducation systems. We want the people of the Middle East to know what \nfreedom is, to know what having an education is, so people can have \njobs and have an economy and be able to live a life that has a quality \nof life.\n  We are bringing quality of life to Iraq through this administration. \nWe are bringing health care services. Madam President, 90 percent of \nthe people in the north have basic health care, 80 percent in the \nsouth, 75 percent in Baghdad. We are putting $210 million now into \npharmaceuticals and basic health care services. This is an important \nquality-of-life issue for these people, and one of the first that we \nhave addressed.\n  We have brought in 1.2 million tons of food since we ceased the \nhostilities in Iraq on March 30. We now have the ability to purchase \nlocal harvests in Iraq, so food will be available from the Iraqi people \nand for the Iraqi people.\n  I am very pleased with the progress. Is it enough? No. Is it going to \ntake more time? Yes. Is it going to take patience? Absolutely. But \nAmerica is not going to walk away when times get tough. We are going to \nsee this through, and the world will be better when we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9830-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1362\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. DORGAN] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1362.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require a report on access by State and local law \n  enforcement agencies to the Tipoff database on potential terrorists)\n\n       Insert after section 615 the following:\n       Sec.  . Not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney \n     General, shall report to the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives on the \n     feasibility of providing access to State and local law \n     enforcement agencies to the database of the Department of \n     State on potential terrorists known as the ``Tipoff'' \n     database, including the process by which classified \n     information shall be secured from unauthorized disclosure.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, today we will hear the results of the \n9/11 Commission, which will describe, after some study and hearings and \nconsideration, what we knew prior to 9/11, prior to the devastating \nattack that occurred against this country that resulted in the murder \nof thousands of innocent Americans.\n  There have been past suggestions that some of our law enforcement \nagencies and others had information indicating a possible attack, and \nthat the information didn't get evaluated or moved up the chain of \ncommand.\n  There are all sorts of discussions about what went wrong: What did we \nknow? What could we have done with the information we had in our \npossession that might have foiled these attacks?\n  It is useful to evaluate all that. I hope this report, which I have \nnot yet read, will advance our knowledge of this situation.\n  Information sharing is essential in the war on terrorism and in \nsecuring our country. But there is an alarming lack of information \nsharing when it comes to our state and local law enforcement officials. \nAnd that is the subject of my amendment here today.\n  On October 25 of last year, a task force headed by former Senators \nWarren Rudman and Gary Hart released a report titled ``America Still \nUnprepared, America Still In Danger.'' The bipartisan task force, \nsponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, included former \nSecretaries of State Warren Christopher, George Shultz, retired Admiral \nWilliam Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and \nothers.\n  What they found was that one year after the September 11 attacks, \nAmerica remained dangerously unprepared for another terrorist attack. \nAnd at the top of the list of their concerns was this:\n\n       650,000 local and State Police officials continue to \n     operate in a virtual intelligence vacuum, without access to \n     the terrorist watch lists provided by the U.S. Department of \n     State to immigration and consular officials.\n\n  That was the top concern raised by the report. What do they mean by \nthat? They mean we do have a list of people who are known and suspected \nterrorists and individuals who associate with those known or suspected \nterrorists, and we use that list at the State Department to try to keep \nthose people from coming into our country. It is made available to \nconsulates across the world, to immigration officials across the world. \nIt is a list meant to protect our country by preventing those who are \nknown terrorist or those who associate with terrorists or suspected \nterrorists from entering our country.\n\n  The problem is this. This list is not shared with the 650,000 law \nenforcement officials in our country. We need 650,000 eyes and ears of \nlocal law enforcement officials able to access that list to see whether \nthe car they pulled over on the interstate highway is filled with four \nterrorists.\n  Let me give an example: 36 hours before the September 11 attacks, one \nof the hijackers, the man who was at the controls of flight 93 that \ncrashed in Pennsylvania--one of the hijackers named Ziad Jarrah was a \n26-year-old Lebanese national. He was driving 90 miles an hour on \nInterstate 95, in Maryland. He was pulled over by the Maryland State \nPolice. He was driving a car rented in his own name.\n  This fellow shared a Hamburg apartment with Mohamed Atta. He was, we \nthink, at the controls of flight 93 that crashed in Pennsylvania and 36 \nhours before that attack he was pulled over for speeding on a Maryland \nhighway.\n  It turns out, for a number of reasons, his name was not on the watch \nlist. But had it been, and one would have expected it to be, that \nMaryland State trooper would not have been able to know that. If this \nafternoon, south of Drayton, ND, there is a highway patrol officer \npulling over a car with three individuals in it, and if those \nindividuals are known terrorists who have somehow come across the \nborder from Canada, that highway patrol officer will not be able to \naccess the terrorist watch list. So that highway patrol officer will be \nin the dark. He or she will stop that vehicle, will evaluate the \noccupants, search for information about their identity, but will not be \nable to access the watch list.\n  The officer can access the NCIC data list, and determine whether the \nperson he has stopped has a criminal record, but the officer cannot \naccess the list that includes the names of the terrorists. That makes \nno sense to me and it didn't make any sense to the commission headed by \nSenator Rudman and Senator Hart. They said, as long ago as last \nOctober, this needed to be fixed and it needed to be fixed now so that \n650,000 additional pairs of eyes and ears belonging to law enforcement \nofficials, city police officers, highway patrol, and others are \navailable to help us look for terrorists who may be in this country.\n  Let me read in more detail excerpts from this Hart-Rudman report.\n  With just 56 field offices around the nation the burden of \nidentifying and intercepting terrorists in our midst is a task well \nbeyond the scope of the FBI. This burden could and should be shared by \n650,000 local, county and State law enforcement officers. But clearly \nthey cannot lend a hand in a counterterrorism information void. When it \ncomes to combating terrorism, the police officers on the beat are \neffectively operating deaf, dumb and blind. The terrorist watch lists \nprovided by the Department of State to immigration and consular \nofficials are still out of bounds for State and local police. In the \ninterim period as information sharing issues get worked out, known \nterrorists will be free to move about to plan and execute their \nattacks.\n  That is from the report issued last October, and nothing has been \ndone about it.\n  The Senate passed, at my urging, a provision in the supplemental \nappropriations bill that effectively says to all the agencies to work \nto get this done. That provision was dropped in conference.\n  I will now offer the same piece of legislation and hope it will be \nattached to this appropriations bill. I hope it will be part of the \nbill that is signed into law. I hope we don't have to continue to prod \nexecutive agencies to do what they know we ought to do.\n  If, God forbid, there is another attack in this country by \nterrorists, if that attack is perpetrated by someone who is picked up \nby a highway patrol officer or a city police officer on a highway or a \nstreet, and that person's name was on the watch list, and it was in the \nbowels of the State Department available to all of the consular affairs \noffices in the world but not available to that law enforcement officer \nand, therefore, they let that known terrorist go because they did not \nknow this was a terrorist, and that terrorist then commits an act of \nterror and murders thousands of Americans, then shame on this \nGovernment for not doing what all of us in this Chamber\n\n[[Page S9832]]\n\nknow needs to be done--not tomorrow, not next week, not next year, \nright now, right this minute.\n  The report by the task force headed by Senators Hart and Rudman was \ntitled ``America Still Unprepared, America Still in Danger.'' Their top \nrecommendation of last October has still not been completed by the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  In my judgment, the American people ought to ask the question, Why on \nEarth is there foot dragging going on in making this watch list \navailable to law enforcement all across this country in order to better \nprepare and better secure and better protect this country? It should \nnot take a year for this database to be shared.\n  Today, I resubmit this amendment and say we should not waste one \nadditional day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, we reviewed the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota. The operative language of the amendment is \nas follows:\n\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security . . . shall report to \n     the Committee on Appropriations . . . on the feasibility of \n     providing access to State and local law enforcement agencies \n     to the database of the Department of State on potential \n     terrorists . . . including the process by which classified \n     information shall be secured from unauthorized disclosure.\n\n  We discussed the amendment with the distinguished Senator and are \nprepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask for its immediate consideration \nand ask for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1362) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1353\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Ms. \n     Stabenow, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1353.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To fund urgent priorities for our Nation's firefighters, law \n    enforcement personnel, and emergency medical personnel, and all \n Americans by reducing the 2003 tax breaks for individuals with annual \n                    income in excess of $1,000,000)\n\n       On page 56, line 2, strike ``$172,736,000'' and insert \n     ``$690,944,000''.\n       On page 58, line 6, strike ``$2,888,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$11,552,000,000''.\n       On page 60, line 1, strike ``$750,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,000,000,000''.\n       On page 60, line 15, strike ``$826,801,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,307,204,000''.\n       On page 65, line 9, strike ``$165,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$660,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, and my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman.\n  The purpose of the amendment is very simply to take the report that \nhas been discussed here, which was prepared over the last number of \ndays by the Council on Foreign Relations, and identify and lay out in \nsignificant detail the priorities and the urgency in dealing with \nemergency responders. It is entitled ``Emergency Responders Drastically \nUnderfunded, Dangerously Unprepared.'' It is the report of an \nindependent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations \nand chaired by Warren Rudman and Richard Clarke, senior adviser, and \nJamie Metzl, project director.\n  The purpose of the amendment reads:\n\n       To fund urgent priorities for our Nation's firefighters, \n     law enforcement personnel, and emergency medical personnel, \n     and all Americans by reducing the 2003 tax breaks for \n     individuals with annual incomes in excess of $1 million.\n\n  That is the purpose.\n  Just so my colleagues understand, the language of the purpose does \nnot mandate anything. The amendment would be subject to a point of \norder which I am confident my colleague from Mississippi would make, \nand there would be no vote on the amendment. I am setting out in the \npurpose what I would like to see occur.\n  Other than that, of course, the language of the amendment does \nspecify some additional add-ons to meet the concerns raised by this \ntask force on emergency responders.\n  Over the last day or so, we have had a series of amendments that have \nbeen offered to try to increase the funding in a number of areas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              U.S. SENATE ROLLCALL VOTES 108TH CONGRESS 1ST SESSION (2003)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Vote No.                    Date                      Issue                  Question                 Result                  Description\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n00298...................

Madam President, there were amendments to make available \nadditional dollars to increase the number of border personnel offered \nby our colleagues; amendments to appropriate funds for the Office of \nthe Under Secretary of Information Analysis; amendments to increase the \namount of appropriations for fire fighter assistance grants--Senator \nMikulski and I offered that amendment--amendments to increase funds for \nresearch and to provide funds to increase maritime security; and, funds \nto increase emergency management performance grants. Senator Boxer \noffered an amendment to require a classified report to Congress on the \nsecurity costs incurred by State and local governments, and so forth.\n  A number of amendments have been suggested. With very few exceptions, \nthese amendments have been rejected on points of order. They were in \nviolation of the Budget Act because they would break the caps.\n  I have great respect for those members who serve on the \nAppropriations Committee. It is not an easy job. But I think what we \nare faced with here is a problem that is far more significant than caps \non these budget requirements under the appropriations bills.\n  You need go no further than to read the report prepared by the \nCouncil on\n\n[[Page S9833]]\n\nForeign Relations that came out recently. It was begun in March and has \nbeen around here for the last several weeks. All Members, I presume, \nhave received copies of it.\n  I want to read various passages of this to try to at least persuade \nmy colleagues about the sense of urgency we ought to have in light of a \nsurvey and study done by those who are knowledgeable on the subject \nmatter of international terrorism and very knowledgeable about what \nneeds to be done to make this Nation more prepared.\n  Let me read the conclusion of this report. This was prepared by our \nformer colleague, Senator Rudman, along with a very distinguished task \nforce whose names I will share with the Members in a moment.\n\n       The terrible events of September 11 have shown the American \n     people how vulnerable they are because attacks on that scale \n     had never been carried out on U.S. soil. The United States \n     and the American people were caught underprotected and \n     unaware of the magnitude of the threat facing them.\n       In the wake of September 11, ignorance of the nature of the \n     threat or of what the United States must do to prepare for \n     future attacks can no longer explain America's continuing \n     failure to allocate sufficient resources in preparing local \n     emergency responders. It would be a terrible tragedy indeed \n     if it took another catastrophic attack to drive that point \n     home.\n\n  I do not think anything can be more clear than this language.\n  Listen further, if you will.\n  Listen further, if you will, in the foreword of this report by Les \nGelb, who was the President of the Council on Foreign Relations. I will \nquote from his foreword. Les Gelb says:\n\n       As I sit to write this foreword, it is likely that a \n     terrorist group somewhere in the world is developing plans to \n     attack the United States and/or American interests abroad \n     using chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or \n     catastrophic conventional means. At the same time, diplomats, \n     legislators, military and intelligence officers, police, \n     fire, and emergency medical personnel, and others in the \n     United States and across the globe are working feverishly to \n     prevent and prepare for such attacks. These two groups of \n     people are ultimately in a race with one another. This is a \n     race we cannot afford to lose.\n       In October 2002, the Council on Foreign Relations-sponsored \n     Independent Task Force on Homeland Security issued the report \n     ``America--Still Unprepared, Still in Danger.'' The Task \n     Force, co-chaired by Senators Warren Rudman and Gary Hart, \n     came to the general conclusion that ``America remains \n     dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a \n     catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil.'' The report \n     further warned that ``America's own ill-prepared response \n     could hurt its people to a much greater extent than any \n     single attack by a terrorist. . . . But the risk of self-\n     inflicted harm to America's liberties and way of life is \n     greatest during and immediately following a national \n     trauma.''\n\n  Les Gelb goes on to say:\n\n       Although progress continues to be made to the newly formed \n     Department of Homeland Security and other federal, state, and \n     local institutions, America remains dangerously unprepared \n     for another catastrophic terrorist attack.\n       In March 2003, the Council on Foreign Relations established \n     an Independent Task Force on Emergency Responders to follow \n     up on the specific recommendations of the Task Force on \n     Homeland Security and to examine the status of preparedness \n     and the adequacy of funding for emergency responders in the \n     United States. The Task Force on Emergency Responders \n     subsequently established an Emergency Responders Action \n     Group, consisting of representatives of emergency responder \n     professional associations, jurisdictional associations \n     representing state and local officials, and congressional and \n     budgetary experts, to provide expertise and advice to the \n     Task Force. The Task Force performed its analysis in \n     partnership with the Concord Coalition and the Center for \n     Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, two of the Nation's \n     leading budget analysis organizations. This represents the \n     first realistic effort to develop a budget range of the costs \n     necessary to protect the homeland [of the United States].\n       The preliminary analysis conducted by the Task Force \n     suggests that the United States may be spending only one-\n     third of what is required to adequately provide for America's \n     emergency responders.\n       Of its most important recommendations, I would like to \n     highlight the following--\n\n  Again, I am quoting Les Gelb--\n\n       Congress should require that the Department of Homeland \n     Security work with state and local agencies and officials and \n     emergency responder professional associations to establish \n     clearly defined standards and guidelines for emergency \n     preparedness.\n       Congress should work to establish a system for distributing \n     funds based less on politics and more on threat. To do this, \n     the federal government should consider such factors as \n     population, population density, vulnerability assessment, and \n     presence of critical infrastructure within each state. State \n     governments should be required to use the same criteria for \n     distributing funds within each state.\n\n  It goes on with these various recommendations. I will come back to \nthose in a minute.\n  Let me also say, this is not an amendment where I just came up with a \nnumber. The number in the amendment I am offering is from the \nrecommendation of this report. It is a large number. I have never \noffered, in all my years here, an amendment of this size. This \namendment is nearly $15 billion in 1 year. That is in addition to the \nroughly $5 billion that is in this bill. This amendment is a little \nless than $15 billion. But those are the numbers recommended by this \nreport. It is not a number I came up with or Senator Stabenow came up \nwith or my staff came up with.\n  This is the recommendation of serious people who spent time looking \nat this problem, who have given us their best judgment of what we need \nto be doing, and saying we are coming woefully short of what needs to \nbe done to keep this Nation prepared.\n  Let me share with you who these people are because it was not just \nsome nameless or faceless group of individuals who prepared this \nreport.\n  Charles Boyd is currently Chief Executive Officer and President of \nBusiness Executives for National Security.

And here we are debating what needs to be \ndone in homeland security. With great respect to those who are charged \nwith living within the caps that are provided, they are saying to us, \nin this report--and I will quote from it--you need to do a lot more. \nAmerica is vulnerable. America is in danger. What more serious group \ncould we listen to?\n  Can you imagine if this group came to us--or a similar group--and \nsaid that our military was underfunded, that we didn't have the \nresources to deal with the threats in Iraq and North Korea and \nelsewhere around the globe? How long would we wait before responding to \nthat recommendation?\n  Yet here we are with a similar group of people--former Chairmen of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, Directors of the CIA and the FBI, major \nfigures in our society--recommending that we do more to protect our \ncountry, and we are not doing it.\n  I am stunned by it. I know we have caps in these budgets. But we just \npassed, in the last 28 months--if you collectively add them up--almost \n$3 trillion in tax cuts. And a sizable piece of those tax cuts have \ngone to some of the most affluent Americans. This Congress, if it \nwanted to, could find resources by paring back--not by blowing through \nthe caps, but by paring back--on some of the tax cuts we have given to \nthe most affluent Americans.\n  I represent a lot of affluent Americans in the State of Connecticut. \nI do not think I could find one of them who would not be willing to \nstand here and tell you: Roll back my tax cut if it means we can \nprovide the resources to make America secure.\n  I do not know of a single wealthy citizen who believes that their tax \ncut is more important than keeping America secure.\n  What an indictment it will be. And we are told--in this report that \nyou heard from Les Gelb--it is not a matter of if this happens but when \nit happens. When it happens, are we going to be prepared? Have we done \nthe things necessary to keep our country strong?\n\n  Here we are getting a clear message from those people who spent the \ntime looking at this saying we ought to do more. I apologize for \noffering an amendment of $15 billion, but that is what it takes. We \nhave offered amendments for $15 million, $60 million, and $100 million \nhere and there for firefighters, reports, and studies and to put more \nguards on the border. I said: Why not have an amendment that \nencompasses what this report recommends? That is what Senator Stabenow \nand I said. Let's put it on the line. Instead of nickel and diming \nthis, let's say whether or not we in this body think the \nrecommendations of these distinguished Americans deserve our support \nand in the waning days before we take a month off in August to go out \nand have a nice vacation for ourselves, whether or not we have the \nintestinal fortitude to step up and do what needs to be done to put \nthis country on a more sound and secure footing.\n  That is the vote I will be asking our colleagues to make shortly on \nthis issue. There will be a point of order and a motion to waive, and \nwe can get confused. Let there be no doubt about what the vote is. The \nvote is not a point of order. The vote is whether or not we are going \nto have the resources to do what needs to be done, according to this \nreport.\n  Let me share some of its conclusions. I see my colleague from \nMichigan. I want to give her the opportunity to be heard as well. But I \nwant my colleagues to understand what we are going to be rejecting, \nhaving seen what has happened over the last several days. We will \nreject this, I presume. I would love to be proven wrong, but I suspect \nI will not. Just so the record is clear, I will ask unanimous consent \nthat this report be printed in the Record. I will exclude the \nappendices and other materials. So every American who may not get a \ncopy of this report, it can be pulled up on their Web site and they can \nread the report. I am not making it up. If you are interested in \nknowing what is in this report, you can read about it in tomorrow's \nCongressional Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the body of the report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Report Prepared by the council on Foreign Relations--Conclusions and \n                            Recommendations\n\n\n        1. Define and Provide for Minimum Essential Capabilities\n\n       The Task Force found that there is no systematic national \n     standard that defines the essential minimum capabilities for \n     emergency responders that every jurisdiction of a given \n     population size should possess or be able to access. Because \n     of this, there are currently no comprehensive, systematic, \n     and consolidated principles or measures against which the \n     degree and quality of preparedness can be tracked nationwide. \n     Current efforts to develop such standards are inconsistent \n     and dispersed among various government agencies and \n     nongovernmental organizations. Additionally, existing \n     standards for minimum capabilities for emergency responders \n     are a patchwork with many missing pieces that lacks \n     systematic integration, are insufficient to address many \n     major challenges--including that of catastrophic terrorism \n     involving WMD--and are not harmonized across the many types \n     of emergency responders. While existing standards provide a \n     useful starting point, they do not constitute ``national \n     standards for emergency response training and preparedness,'' \n     as called for in the National Strategy for Homeland Security. \n     (A selection from this document is included in Appendix B.) \n     At the end of five years of federal funding, therefore, some \n     metropolitan areas may still lack fundamental emergency \n     responder capabilities.\n       Congress should require DHS and HHS to work with other \n     federal agencies, state and local emergency responder \n     agencies and officials, and standard-setting bodies from the \n     emergency responder community to establish clearly defined \n     standards and guidelines for federal, state, and local \n     government emergency preparedness and response in such areas \n     as training, interoperable communication systems, and \n     response equipment. These standards must be sufficiently \n     flexible to allow local officials to set priorities based on \n     their needs, provided that they reach nationally determined \n     preparedness levels within a fixed time period. These \n     capabilities must be measurable and subject to federal audit.\n       Congress should require that the FY05 budget request for \n     DHS be accompanied by a minimum essential emergency responder \n     capability standard of WMD- and terrorism-related disaster \n     equipment and training per 100,000 persons in a metropolitan \n     region, and by separate standards for rural areas. Each \n     recipient state and metropolitan area should then be required \n     to submit a plan detailing how it intends to achieve that \n     standard, to incorporate it into all appropriate training \n     programs, and to regularly test its effectiveness.\n       National performance standards could be implemented through \n     an incentive grant system making federal funding conditional \n     and available to those localities that adopt federally \n     approved standards of preparedness.\n\n\n                  2. develop requirements methodology\n\n       National capability standards for levels of preparedness \n     must drive an emergency preparedness requirements process. \n     This process must evolve into one similar to that currently \n     used by the U.S. military. Threats must be identified, \n     capabilities for addressing threats determined, and \n     requirements generated for establishing or otherwise gaining \n     access to necessary capabilities. The Task Force found that \n     the administration and Congress were funding emergency \n     preparedness without any agreement on methodology to \n     determine how much is enough or what the requirements are. It \n     is therefore extremely difficult, if not impossible, to \n     measure how well prepared the United States is.\n       Congress should include in the FY04 appropriations for DHS \n     and HHS a provision calling on each agency to accompany the \n     FY05 budget request with a detailed methodology for \n     determining the national requirements for emergency responder \n     capability and assistance.\n       Congress should require that DHS and HHS submit a \n     coordinated plan for meeting national preparedness standards \n     by the end of FY07.\n       Congress should require DHS and HHS to report annually on \n     the status of emergency preparedness across the United \n     States. This report should indicate the levels of federal, \n     state, and local expenditures for emergency \n     preparedness, evaluate how effectively that funding is \n     being used, and assess the status of preparedness in each \n     state based on national preparedness standards.\n\n[[Page S9835]]\n\n                   3. accept necessary burden-sharing\n\n       The Task Force found that there were no accepted national \n     guidelines for determining the nature of burden-sharing \n     between the federal government and state and local \n     jurisdictions. Although state and local jurisdictions should \n     maintain primary responsibility for funding normal levels of \n     public health and safety readiness, the Task Force found that \n     the federal government should be responsible for providing \n     the funds necessary to cover the incremental costs of \n     achieving essential standards in responding to the additional \n     national security threat posed by terrorism. In some \n     outstanding cases, federal funds may be required to enhance \n     state and local emergency responder infrastructure that has \n     been starved of resources if the deterioration of \n     capabilities is such that it poses a threat to national \n     security and state and local resources are not reasonably \n     sufficient for addressing this shortfall.\n\n\n                4. guarantee sustained multiyear funding\n\n       The Task Force found that many state and local governments \n     are unwilling or unable to accept federal funding for \n     programs that will generate long-term costs in the absence of \n     guarantees that the federal government will make funds \n     available for sustaining such programs. Stable and long-term \n     funding is critical for encouraging state and local \n     governments to develop the necessary emergency response \n     capabilities and, most critically, to sustain them over time.\n       Congress should accompany all authorizations for emergency \n     responder assistance grants in FY04 and thereafter with \n     budget authority for sustaining those grants through the \n     following two fiscal years.\n\n\n                     5. refocus funding priorities\n\n       The Task Force found existing systems for determining the \n     distribution of appropriated funds to states to be badly in \n     need of reform. The federal government currently determines \n     levels for emergency preparedness funding to states \n     primarily on a formula that guarantees minimum funding \n     levels to all states and then determines additional \n     funding based on each state's population. All citizens of \n     the United States deserve a base level of protection \n     regardless of where they live. Nevertheless, the state and \n     population-drive approach has led to highly uneven funding \n     outcomes. Wyoming, for example, receives $10.00 per capita \n     from DHS for emergency preparedness while New York State \n     receives only $1.40 per capita. While this approach may \n     have political appeal, it unnecessarily diverts funding \n     from areas of highest priority. In addition, decision by \n     state officials regarding the allocation of funds in their \n     states have not sufficiently taken into account the \n     multitude of necessary factors.\n       Congress should establish a system for allocating scarce \n     resources based less on dividing the spoils and more on \n     addressing idenfitied threats and vulnerabilities. To do \n     this, the federal government should consider such factors as \n     population, population density, vulnerability assessment, and \n     presence of critical infrastructure within each state. State \n     governments should be required to use the same criteria for \n     distributing funds within each state.\n       Congress should also require each state receiving federal \n     emergency preparedness funds to provide an analysis based on \n     the same criteria to justify the distribution of funds in \n     that state.\n\n\n                 6. rationalize congressional oversight\n\n       The Task Force found that the proliferation of committees \n     and subcommittees in Congress makes it hard to devise a \n     coherent homeland security policy and a focused homeland \n     defense system. Congress needs to have a lead committee, or \n     an effective joint committee, to shape overall policy. \n     Otherwise the system is likely to be fragmented and plagued \n     with pork.\n       The U.S. House of Representatives should transform the \n     House Select Committee on Homeland Security into a standing \n     committee and give it a formal, leading role in the \n     authorization of all emergency responder expenditures in \n     order to streamline the federal budgetary process.\n       The U.S. Senate should consolidate emergency preparedness \n     and response oversight into the Senate Government Affairs \n     Committee.\n\n\n                  7. accelerate delivery of assistance\n\n       The Task Force found that many metropolitan areas and \n     states had actually received and spent only a small portion \n     of the funds for emergency responders that have been \n     appropriated by Congress since September 11. The current \n     inflexible structure of homeland security funding, along with \n     shifting federal requirements and increased amounts of \n     paperwork, places unnecessary burdens on state and local \n     governments as they attempt to provide badly needed funds to \n     emergency responders. While a balance should be maintained \n     between the need for the rapid allocation of emergency \n     preparedness funds and the maintenance of appropriate \n     oversight to ensure that such funds are well spent, the \n     current danger is too great to allow for business as usual. \n     According to the National Emergency Managers Association, \n     ``appropriation cycles have been erratic causing extreme \n     burdens on state and local governments to continue \n     preparedness activities when there is no federal funding, and \n     then forcing them to thoughtfully and strategically apply \n     several years of federal funds and millions of dollars at one \n     time.'' (NEMA, State Spending and Homeland Security Funds,'' \n     April 2, 2003) As a first step toward addressing this \n     problem, Congress instructed the DHS Office of Domestic \n     Preparedness in the FY03 consolidated appropriations measure \n     (P.L. 108-7) to distribute grant funds to states within 60 \n     days of the enactment of the bill and required states to \n     distribute at least 80 percent of those funds to localities \n     within 45 days of receipt.\n       Congress should ensure that all future appropriations bills \n     funding emergency response include strict distribution \n     timeframes as exemplified by the FY03 consolidated \n     appropriations measure.\n       Congress should require states to submit data regarding the \n     speed of distribution of the federal funds for emergency \n     responders appropriated to states.\n       Congress should grant DHS the authority to allow states \n     greater flexibility in using past homeland security funding. \n     As a first step in this direction, Congress should authorize \n     greater flexibility in the federal guidelines laid out in the \n     FY03 Omnibus Appropriations Bill for the percentages of funds \n     that can be used for various emergency response activities \n     (e.g., 70 percent for equipment, 18 percent for exercises, 7 \n     percent for planning, 5 percent for training) to make it \n     possible for states to better allocate resources according to \n     their most urgent needs. This authority should be granted on \n     a case by case basis by means of a waiver from the Secretary \n     of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n                       8. fix funding mechanisms\n\n       Many states have been mandated to develop more than five \n     separate homeland security plans. While the information \n     requested by each homeland security plan is similar, states \n     and communities are often required to reinvent the wheel from \n     one emergency plan to the next.\n       DHS should move the Office of Domestic Preparedness from \n     the Bureau of Border and Transportation Security to the \n     Office of State and Local Government Coordination in order to \n     consolidate oversight of grants to emergency responders \n     within the Office of the Secretary.\n       States should develop a prioritized list of requirements in \n     order to ensure that federal funding is allocated to achieve \n     the best return on investments.\n       Congress should require DHS to work with other federal \n     agencies to streamline homeland security grant programs in a \n     way that reduces unnecessary duplication and establishes \n     coordinated ``one-stop shopping'' for state and local \n     authorities seeking grant funds. Efforts to streamline the \n     grants process should not, however, be used as a \n     justification for eliminating existing block grant programs \n     that support day-to-day operations of emergency responder \n     entities. In many cases, such grants must be expanded.\n       Congress should create an interagency committee to \n     eliminate duplication in homeland security grants \n     requirements and simplify the application process for federal \n     grants.\n\n\n                     9. disseminate best practices\n\n       Although emergency responders have consistently identified \n     as a high priority the need to systematically share best \n     practices and lessons learned, the Task Force found \n     insufficient national coordination of efforts to \n     systematically capture and disseminate best practices for \n     emergency responders. While various federal agencies, \n     professional associations, and educational institutions have \n     begun initiatives to develop and promulgate best practices \n     and lessons learned, these disparate efforts generally are \n     narrow and unsystematic and have not sufficiently reached \n     potential beneficiaries. Such information-sharing could be \n     one of the most effective ways to extract the greatest amount \n     of preparedness from a finite resource pool. Once centralized \n     and catalogued, such data will allow all emergency responders \n     to learn from past experiences and improve the quality of \n     their efforts, thereby assuring taxpayers the maximum return \n     on their investment in homeland security. Access to this \n     resource will provide the analytical foundation for future \n     decisions regarding priorities, planning, training, and \n     equipment.\n       Congress should establish within DHS a National Institute \n     for Best Practices in Emergency Preparedness to work with \n     state and local governments, emergency preparedness \n     professional associations, and other partners to establish \n     and promote a universal best practices/lessons learned \n     knowledge base. The National Institute should establish a \n     website for emergency preparedness information and should \n     coordinate closely with HHS to ensure that best practices for \n     responding to biological attack are sufficiently incorporated \n     into the knowledge base.\n\n\n                 10. enhance coordination and planning\n\n       The Task Force found that although effective coordination \n     and planning are among the most important elements of \n     preparedness, jurisdictions across the country are \n     neither sufficiently coordinating emergency response \n     disciplines within their jurisdictions nor adequately \n     reaching across jurisdictional lines to coordinate their \n     efforts with neighboring communities. Although Title VI of \n     the Stafford Act (P.L. 106-390) authorizes the Director of \n     FEMA to coordinate federal and state emergency \n     preparedness plans, this authority has not been applied \n     sufficiently to ensure adequate levels of coordination and \n     planning between and among federal, state, and local \n     jurisdictions. In addition, state and local emergency \n     management agencies lack the resources to develop and \n     maintain critical emergency management capabilities. More \n     also needs to be\n\n[[Page S9836]]\n\n     done to encourage and facilitate mutual aid and other \n     cross-jurisdictional agreements that pool resources, \n     minimize costs, and enhance national preparedness.\n       DHS should require that all states and territories submit \n     statewide mutual assistance plans, including cross-border \n     plans for all cities and counties adjoining state or \n     territorial borders. Reference to such plans should be \n     required in all homeland security grant applications for \n     federal funding. Wherever possible, grants should be \n     structured to reward the pooling of assets across \n     jurisdictional lines.\n       DHS should develop a comprehensive national program for \n     exercises that coordinates exercise activities involving \n     federal agencies, state and local governments, and \n     representatives from appropriate private sector entities \n     including hospitals, the media, telecommunications providers, \n     and others. These exercises should prepare emergency \n     responders for all types of hazards, with a specific focus on \n     WMD detection and response. When necessary, funds should be \n     provided to ensure that exercises do not interfere with the \n     day-to-day activities of emergency responders.\n       Congress should work with DHS to expand the capacity of \n     existing training facilities involved in the National \n     Domestic Preparedness Consortium and to identify any new \n     training facilities for emergency responders that may be \n     required.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me read some of the executive summary. I am quoting \ndirectly.\n\n       The tragic events of September 11, 2001 brought home to the \n     American people the magnitude of the danger posed by \n     terrorism on U.S. soil. Now in the aftermath of the September \n     11th attacks, the United States must assume--\n\n  Remember who I told you wrote this report now--\n\n     that terrorists will strike again, possibly using chemical, \n     biological, radiological, or even nuclear materials. The \n     unthinkable has become the thinkable. But although in some \n     respects the American public is now better prepared to \n     address aspects of the terrorist threat than it was two years \n     ago, the United States remains dangerously ill-prepared to \n     handle a catastrophic attack on American soil.\n       On average fire departments across the country have only \n     enough radios to equip half the firefighters on a shift and \n     breathing apparatus for only one-third of our firefighters. \n     Only 10 percent of the departments in the United States have \n     the personnel and equipment to respond to a building \n     collapse. Police departments and cities across the country do \n     not have protective gear to safely secure a site following an \n     attack with weapons of mass destruction. Public health labs \n     in most states lack basic equipment and expertise to \n     adequately respond to a chemical, biological attack, and 75 \n     percent of state laboratories report being overwhelmed by \n     testing requests. Most cities do not have necessary equipment \n     to determine what kind of hazardous materials emergency \n     responders may be facing.\n       If the nation does not take immediate steps to better \n     identify and address the urgent needs of emergency \n     responders, the next terrorist incident could have an even \n     more devastating impact than the September 11th attacks. \n     According to data provided to the Task Force by emergency \n     responder professional associations and leading emergency \n     response officials from around the country, America will fall \n     approximately $98.4 billion short of meeting critical \n     emergency responder needs over the next five years if current \n     funding levels are maintained.\n\n  That is my amendment. I can only put up a 1-year appropriation. We \nhave roughly 5 in the bill before us. I put up an additional 15. That \nis 20. That gets you close to 98, if we did it each year over the next \n5 years. The amendment is not made up out of whole cloth. It comes from \nthe recommendations of this task force I have cited.\n\n       Currently the Federal budget to fund emergency responders \n     is about $28 billion over five years.\n\n  It goes on, and I will not bore my colleagues. They can read it for \nthemselves. It goes through what States may or may not be spending. The \nfact is, we know almost every State is facing huge deficits. The \ndeficit of the State of California is $38 billion alone. My State is \nabout $1.5 billion. In Michigan, it is around $4 billion. So you have \nroughly $100 billion in deficits. We read the other day that colleges \nand universities are going to raise tuition to make up for the \nshortfalls. The idea that States will allocate more money in light of \ntheir own fiscal difficulties is unrealistic. Candidly, the report \nsays, over the next number of years, we cannot rely on States to fill \nin the gap. They are not going to be able to do it.\n  By the way, I want to repeat a point. I think it was tremendously \nworthwhile that Pete Peterson, the leader of the Concord Coalition and \nalso the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, two of the \nNation's leading budget analyst organizations, worked on these numbers. \nThey say in the report that they are not claiming perfection, and there \nis a need to do a far better assessment of overall needs. But they also \nquickly say: You can't wait until you get all the assessments and \nperfection. You have to be on a dual track. I am almost quoting the \nreport here, that you need to do a better assessment, but \nsimultaneously we have to get the resources out to support the efforts \nbeing made to make us more secure.\n\n  We have had very strong organizations looking at what needs to be \ndone. The additional funds that we are talking about in this amendment \nand some we have already voted on would allow for additional resources \nto support homeland security.\n  We would extend the emergency 911 system nationally to foster \neffective emergency data, to significantly enhance urban search and \nrescue capabilities of major cities and the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency in cases where buildings or large structures collapse \nand trap individuals; to foster interoperable communications systems \nfor emergency responders across the country. This is a major area. I do \nnot know of a single colleague that has not heard from their police and \nfire departments about the inability to communicate with each other.\n  On the interoperability of the telecommunications systems, there is a \nreal gap across the country and a tremendous demand. Some have \nestimated the cost to be $400 or $500 million--and that may be low--to \nget the ability of our first responders to be able to talk to one \nanother. That is a major item.\n  Again, citing from the report, to enhance public health preparedness \nby strengthening laboratories' disease tracking communications by \ntraining public health officials; to strengthen emergency operations \ncenters for local police, public safety coordination; to provide \nprotective gear and weapons of mass destruction remediation equipment \nto firefighters; to support an extensive series of national exercises \nthat would allow responders to continually learn and improve on \neffective response techniques; to enhance emergency agricultural and \nveterinarian capabilities for effective response to national food \nsupply attacks; to develop surge capacity in the Nation's hospitals and \nto help them better prepare for weapons of mass destruction attacks; to \nenhance capacity for emergency medical technicians, paramedics, and \nothers to respond to mass casualty events.\n  This is just a list of the things they are talking about that they \nthink are necessary.\n  They point out the importance of coordinating. I will not read all of \nthat. I will put it in the record so Members who want to read the \nreport for themselves can get a better feel for what is necessary.\n  I mentioned already some of the tremendous shortcomings that occur. \nAgain I quote from the report:\n\n       It is impossible to overestimate the need to prepare for \n     this threat. One way of understanding America's urgent need \n     to prepare is to ask the question: If we knew that there was \n     going to be a terrorist attack sometime in the next 5 years, \n     but did not know what type of attack it would be, who would \n     carry it out, or where in the United States it would occur, \n     what actions would we now take and how would we allocate our \n     human and financial resources to prepare?\n       The American people must assume this is the situation this \n     Nation currently faces.\n\n  So we can anticipate an attack in the next 5 years. We don't know \nwhere or when, but it is going to come. What better warning could you \nhave? What is history going to say about us? You had a report. You were \ntold by highly competent individuals what a shortcoming you face.\n  This is only $15 billion. We are spending $5 billion every month in \nIraq and Afghanistan--$1 billion a week in Iraq and $1 billion a month \nin Afghanistan. That is $15 billion in 3 months to try to deal with the \nthreats there. I am asking for $15 billion for a whole year to make us \nmore secure.\n  I certainly understand the reasons why we have to do what we do in \nIraq and Afghanistan. I am not suggesting that is a bad idea. Don't \nmisunderstand me. But if it is good enough to keep us secure by doing \nthat there, and there is a report telling us we are not doing enough at \nhome, can't we at least do what we do in those two countries on a 3-\nmonth basis in this country for a year to make us more secure?\n\n[[Page S9837]]\n\n  Frankly, I don't understand why we are debating this. I would have \nthought we would have been told this is what we have to do, based on \nthe best analysis of what needs to be done here. If we knew we were \ngoing to face a terrorist attack and we didn't know what type it would \nbe, who would carry it out, where it would occur, what actions would we \ntake now? I suspect that I would be overwhelmed by people who would \nwant to be here to support an amendment to add these numbers.\n  As I said, we have not defined the national standards of \npreparedness. This report points it out--the essential capabilities of \nevery jurisdiction, considering size, who would have immediate access \nto it, and so forth. This report clearly says you cannot wait for those \nreports to be done. I will quote again from the report. I think there \nis stunning language here:\n\n       The United States must rapidly develop a sophisticated \n     requirement methodology to determine the country's most \n     critical needs and allow for the setting of priorities and \n     readiness training and procurement. The United States does \n     not, however, have the luxury of waiting until an \n     overreaching process is created to fund urgently needed \n     enhancements to current capabilities. In the nearly 2 years \n     since the September 11 attacks, Congress has dangerously \n     delayed the appropriation of funds for emergency responders, \n     Federal agencies have been slow getting funds to State and \n     local jurisdictions, and States have hampered the efficient \n     dissemination of much needed Federal funds to the local \n     level. The overall effectiveness of Federal funding has been \n     further diluted by a lack of process to determine the most \n     critical needs of the emergency responder community in order \n     to achieve the greatest return on investment. A dual-track \n     approach is therefore required while developing a reliable \n     systematic requirements methodology, and streamlining the \n     appropriations process must be a priority. The United States \n     must make its most educated guess based on incomplete \n     information about what emergency funds are needed \n     immediately.\n\n  So it says that Congress has dangerously delayed the appropriations \nprocess. This is not a report prepared by a group of Democrats. I don't \nthink George Shultz and the others in this group--you can go back to \nadvisers who would associate themselves with some partisan report but \nthis is hardly partisan. It is a cold analysis of where we are and what \nkind of trouble we are in. It is about what kind of trouble we are in. \nEither we understand this and respond to it, or we will suffer the \nconsequences of a historical judgment that will indict us for not \nhaving done what needed to be done in these days.\n\n  I will have more to say about this. I know some of my colleagues want \nto be heard as well. I don't fault my good friend from Mississippi, who \nhas the unenviable task of chairing a subcommittee that has to grapple \nwith these issues. I don't fault him in this. He is faced with the \nbudget constraints we have adopted. I thank him for his commitment to \nthese issues.\n  As I say, with a great deal of reluctance I have offered this \namendment. It is a large amount--$15 billion--but I thought that \ninstead of trying to go through 25 different amendments of little \npieces here and there, we would lay out on the table this report and \nits recommendations and suggest how we might do it.\n  It is painful, obviously, to roll back something you have already \nadopted. But imagine what they would say about us historically--that we \ndidn't want to roll back a tax cut--not all of it but just for those in \nthe most affluent group of our citizens, and ask them to take a little \nless for a while in order to let us fund homeland security. Can you \nimagine what history may say 50 or 100 years from now, after we have \ngone through a series of events, that Congress had a report that warned \notherwise in 2003 but they just could not find a way to do it, and we \ndidn't fund it properly, so our people faced a great threat?\n  I don't understand how we would allow ourselves the vulnerability of \nthat kind of historical judgment. So that is why I have put language in \nhere to suggest how this could be done. Yes, $3 trillion is a lot of \nmoney. It is a thousand billion dollars. One thousand billion dollars \nis a trillion dollars. A thousand million dollars is a billion dollars.\n  I am asking for $15 billion out of a thousand billion, or the three \nthousand billion, in order to try to get this right. You cannot \nconvince me ever that there is not enough room in that tax cut, those \namounts, to find something here to make homeland security better for \nthe people of our Nation. They deserve nothing less. They will be \nhorrified to find out, if events occur, that we didn't do what we \nshould have and could have done.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut has offered an amendment to add exactly, according to my \naddition, $14.408 billion to the total spending provided in this bill \nthat funds the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The statements that he makes regarding the Council on Foreign \nRelations report are certainly to be considered seriously by the \nSenate. They have done good work. Former Senators Warren Rudman and \nGary Hart have worked hard to bring the attention of the whole country \nto the needs we have in this area.\n  I think one thing overlooked is that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's budget does not represent the total amount of spending being \nundertaken by the Federal Government, nor State and local governments, \nto do the things necessary to improve our capability not only to \nrespond to natural and manmade attacks, or terrorist acts, but to \nprepare for them as well, and to improve our intelligence capability \nand what we are doing to find out what the terrorists are up to, who \nthey are, and how they could pose threats to American citizens and our \nhomeland.\n  Much of the spending is done in other Departments that is not \nincluded in this amount. So to focus on this budget for this Department \nand say there is not enough money here to do what we need--of course \nthere is not. There is no money in here for the CIA or the FBI. There \nis no money in here for doing things such as bioterrorism research on \nhow we can protect ourselves against bioterrorism threats. That is \nbeing done by the Department of Health and Human Services, through the \nCenters for Disease Control. They are funded in other bills.\n  This budget, and the budget request submitted by the President for \nhomeland security, represents only 58 percent of the total Federal \neffort. So there is much more being done than is reflected in the \nbudget of this Department and this appropriations bill which, \nincidentally, adds a billion dollars over the President's budget \nrequest for these activities. Much of that money is going to the first \nresponders' effort this year and will next year.\n  We cannot measure what we have done in the last 2 years and project \nit as to what we will do in the future. We cannot do it all in 1 year. \nWe are making progress, and more progress needs to be made.\n  It is not just a Federal program either, it is a national program. It \ninvolves all governments, all agencies, and the American people \nthemselves. We are all more aware and more alert to the dangers and \nwhat we can do personally to help improve the security of our homeland. \nSo the adding of $14.408 billion to this bill, with no corresponding \noffset, will violate the Budget Act because we are only allocated a \ncertain amount of spending. When we go above that, then the bill \nbecomes subject to a point of order that any Senator can make and the \nwhole bill falls.\n  So with a great deal of respect for my friend from Connecticut, I \nmake a point of order under section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget \nAct that the amendment provides spending in excess of the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for purposes \nof the pending bill and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Michigan desire to \nspeak?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent to speak concerning the motion \nto waive the Budget Act on the Dodd-Stabenow amendment before \nproceeding with the vote.\n\n[[Page S9838]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. A motion to waive is a debatable motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to debate that motion and support \nSenator Dodd in his motion. I am very proud to be joining with him in \nthe Dodd-Stabenow amendment concerning fully providing the resources \nfor our first responders in our communities all across America. I \nappreciate the constraints our chairman is working under, but I cannot \nimagine a more important issue for all of us today than this particular \namendment.\n  This is not a partisan amendment. The terrorists who come do not \ndecide who is a Republican or who is a Democrat, where one lives, their \nage or ethnic background. This is an issue for all of us as Americans, \ncertainly for the people who work in this building who were directly in \nthe line of attack on September 11, certainly for all of those across \nthe country who understand that this is a new world since September 11, \n2001.\n  When it comes to protecting our country from terrorists, we should do \nwhatever it takes, period, to make sure we are safe. We cannot live by \nartificial limits, by bureaucratic budget procedures. Just as Congress \nhas come together, working with the President, and said whatever our \nmilitary needs, whatever it takes to prepare our men and women to be \nsuccessful overseas, to support our military, to support our Department \nof Defense, we will do, period, to make sure our people are safe abroad \nas well as at home. We should do no less.\n\n  I join with Senator Dodd in saying this should not even be an issue \nthat we are debating once we have seen this report--the emergency \nresponders are drastically underfunded and dangerously unprepared--a \nreport that does not just deal with one department; they look across \nthe range of issues that relate to our folks on the front lines being \nable to respond, and they have a report about which every single \nAmerican should be concerned. We should take this as a blueprint and \nimmediately respond to it.\n  How do we determine what is the right amount to spend to protect our \ncountry? I cannot think of a more objective or credible group than the \none which put this together. We should listen to the experts, and in \nthis case a bipartisan commission of experts, charged with this task, \nwho determined we need to spend an additional $98.4 billion over 5 \nyears on top of what we are doing today. This is a shocking difference \nbetween what the American people need, what we need, and what we are \nproviding as a Congress representing those American people.\n  This conclusion was reached by an impressive bipartisan commission. \nAs the Senator from Connecticut has already indicated, it is led by \nformer Republican Senator Warren Rudman, former White House \ncybersecurity chief Richard Clarke, and just to mention a few of those \nwho have put these recommendations together for us and for the American \npeople, a highly respected list of Americans, including the former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM William Crowe, former Reagan \nSecretary of State George Shultz, and former FBI Director William \nWebster.\n  When coming up with its conclusions, this distinguished panel \nconsulted with organizations such as the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters. After much deliberation, \nthis panel reached a dramatic conclusion, and the title of its press \nrelease says it all:\n\n       Nearly 2 years after 9/11, the United States is still \n     dangerously unprepared, and underfunded, for a catastrophic \n     terrorist attack, warns New Council Task Force.\n\n  I read from the summary of this report:\n\n       Nearly 2 years after 9/11, the United States is drastically \n     underfunding local emergency responders--\n\n  Police, fire, emergency medical personnel, others--\n\n       and remains dangerously unprepared to handle a catastrophic \n     attack on American soil, particularly one involving chemical, \n     biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-impact \n     conventional weapons. If the Nation does not take immediate \n     steps to better identify and address the urgent needs of \n     emergency responders, the next terrorist incident could be \n     even more devastating than 9/11.\n\n  Further, the summary reads:\n\n       The task force met with emergency responder organizations \n     across the country and asked them what additional programs \n     they truly need--not a wish list--to establish a minimum \n     effective response to a catastrophic terrorist attack. These \n     presently unbudgeted needs total $9.84 billion, according to \n     the emergency responder community and budget experts.\n\n  Finally:\n\n       The . . . Task Force . . . based its analysis on data \n     provided by frontline emergency responders--firefighters, \n     policemen, emergency medical personnel, public health \n     providers and others--whose lives depend upon the adequacy of \n     their preparedness for a potential terrorist attack.\n\n  This report says our local communities need much more than we are \ncurrently providing. This is not a critique from me, as the Senator \nfrom Michigan, it is not a critique by the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, it is not by any politician or any person right now who \nwould gain from some partisan advantage. This is a group of experts on \na bipartisan basis who come together as Americans to say we are not \ndoing enough.\n  This report reaches the same conclusion I have heard from my own \nfirst responders in Michigan. I have spent a great deal of time \ntraveling across Michigan since last fall, and I have done over 11 \ndifferent townhall meetings in Michigan with police departments, large \nand small, fire departments, police chiefs, sheriffs--Republican \nsheriffs, Democratic sheriffs--those at the health department, the \nfolks who run the emergency rooms at the hospitals, all of those \ninvolved, and overwhelmingly they have said: We are working very hard. \nWe cannot do it alone. Please get beyond the ideological debate and \ntalk about what we need to prepare us to be safe.\n  It cannot be done just by asking the local city, township or county \nto provide additional resources alone. This is a national attack on our \ncountry. It needs a partnership from all of us, and they are speaking \nloudly that they need our help. More importantly, we need to make sure \nthey are prepared and they are stepping up to the effort.\n  Unfortunately, they are receiving less from our State governments \nthat are uniformly in a budget crisis. In Michigan, we are seeing about \n26 percent of their general fund budget lost through the economy, \nthrough various decisions made at the State level. They need our help.\n\n  This amendment is much more than dollars. It is really not about the \ndollars. It is about being safe. It is about being prepared. It is \nabout saying, We get it; we understand we have to do whatever it takes \nto be able to say to our own families: We are prepared in case another \nattack comes.\n  I heard from Michigan police and firefighters and emergency \nresponders that the issue of radios is not some theoretical debate. The \nability to communicate between the fire department and the police \ndepartment or the city and the county, to be able to communicate in a \nway to respond most effectively if there is a message or an attack is \nnot happening because of the lack of radios. They do not have the \nstate-of-art radio technology, interoperability, to be able to \ncommunicate with one another. Imagine how difficult it is to coordinate \na response after a terrorist attack if the department has only \nantiquated radio equipment. How basic can you get than being able to \nmake sure people can communicate with each other?\n  This is not rocket science. We are talking about the ability to \ncommunicate, so they can call someone; so when you call 9-1-1 you know \nthe folks on the other end can call the right people and talk to them \nto give you the help you need, to get the response you need in the \ncommunity.\n  The Rudman report concluded, on average, fire departments across the \ncountry only have enough radios to equip half the firefighters. Only 33 \npercent had proper breathing apparatus. So there is a one out of two \nchance that the fire department will be able to communicate and only \none-third of the personnel in the community have breathing apparatus. \nFurthermore, only 10 percent of United States fire departments have the \npersonnel and equipment to respond to a building collapse. The Rudman \nreport also stated that police departments in cities across\n\n[[Page S9839]]\n\nthe country do not have the proper protective gear to safely secure a \nsite following a weapons-of-mass-destruction attack. This type of gear, \nwhich we have as Senators and for staff, costs money to procure. \nTragically, the men and women on the front lines of the war on terror \ndo not have the equipment. They do not have the equipment I have in my \noffice. That does not make sense. That is not fair. It is not right. \nThere is not one American that would think we are doing the job when \nthey look at the facts in this report.\n  The Rudman report said public health labs in most States still lack \nbasic equipment and expertise to properly respond if there is a \nchemical or biological attack. In fact, 75 percent of State labs say \nthey are overwhelmed with current testing loads. It is not that folks \ndo not want to be prepared. It is not that they cannot have the \nexpertise. These are competent people. It is a question of training. It \nis a question of having the right kind of equipment and technology. \nThis is the United States of America. We can do better. We have to do \nbetter.\n  There are many other concerns. I have heard from local safety \nofficials during my 11 town hall meetings. I heard from police chiefs \nwho say they need resources to provide training, not only to have the \ntrainer come in, but when you take an officer off the beat, off their \nregular assignment, for a week or 2 weeks or longer, we have to replace \nthem or pay overtime to their replacement. That costs resources which \nare very difficult to come up with. So training becomes a major \nchallenge for them--both in losing their staff to regular assignments, \nanswering those calls in the neighborhoods, as well as the costs of the \ntraining and the equipment needed relating to the training. This \nbecomes a major issue.\n\n  I believe the U.S. Government needs the flexibility, as well, so we \nare not tying their hands. We are saying these are the resources \navailable, you decide what you need in training and equipment and make \nsure you have enough staff. You make those decisions. This is \nimportant. This is front-line defense. I trust the men and women in the \nState of Michigan and across the country to make the right decisions \nabout what they need to be prepared and to keep us safe.\n  We have a motion challenging this amendment because it costs dollars. \nI reiterate, we spend resources and we make priorities every day based \non what is important, what are our values, what are the most important \nthings that affect Americans, that affect our families, that affect our \ncommunities. I cannot imagine something more important than this issue. \nI cannot imagine saying to families--and God forbid something happens--\nwe were not willing to commit what was needed to keep you safe.\n  As my colleague from Connecticut said, we are spending about $4 \nbillion a month, in other words, $1 billion a week in Iraq, almost $50 \nbillion a year. This amendment costs less than a third of that to keep \nus safe at home. We know the tax cut passed earlier this year is much \nmore than this amendment. The 10-year cost of the tax cut was almost $1 \ntrillion. The total price tag includes $400 billion in tax cuts for \nthose at the very top income bracket, and those with stock dividends \nand capital gains. In the State of Michigan there is not one person \nreceiving another tax cut who is doing very well in the State of \nMichigan who would not say to me: Make sure my family is safe, first. I \nappreciate having another tax cut, but I want to make sure my family is \nsafe. I am willing to wait a little bit. I will delay that because \nthere is a higher value, a higher priority here. That is, making sure \nwe do not lose human life in America on our own soil through another \nattack.\n  We can afford this amendment. All we need to do is slightly scale \nback some of the tax relief--again, to those who do very well in our \ncountry. We want everyone to do well in our country. We want everyone \nto have the opportunity to succeed. But we want to make sure, first, \nthat they and their families are safe.\n  It does not matter how much you make in this country when it comes to \na terrorist attack; we are all the same. We all join in wanting to make \nsure we are safe. God forbid there is another terrorist attack on our \ncountry. I hope and pray there will not be. But we must be fully \nprepared. We cannot be partially prepared. We cannot be half prepared. \nWe need to do whatever it takes to help our firefighters, police \nofficers, and first responders to protect us from terrorism.\n  As we watch the television news, we see a world in turmoil. There is \nviolence against our own soldiers in Iraq. We watch Iran and North \nKorea develop nuclear weapons that could be sold to terrorists. We have \nnot yet found Osama bin Laden. We cringe when we hear about increased \nnuclear tensions between Pakistan and India. And we are now witnessing \nchaos in Liberia. Since September 11, we live in a new world. We can no \nlonger sit back and wait.\n  We must take action now to protect the American people. This \namendment will do that. This amendment is based on those who have \nstudied and have expertise and care deeply as Americans about keeping \nus safe and secure. This is not a political amendment. This is not an \namendment designed in some way to split Democrats and Republicans. This \nis an amendment designed to meet the needs of those who are charged \nwith protecting us.\n  The Homeland Security bill before the Senate provides the Department \nof Homeland Security with $28.5 billion for the next fiscal year. While \nit is a first step, this report makes it clear it is not enough to keep \nus safe. Protecting our country is not something we should simply \nsqueeze into the normal appropriations limits. We are vulnerable. We \nmust act now, not later. Otherwise, I am concerned that we will be \nsorry.\n\n  When my colleagues vote, I urge you to think of all those unmet needs \nin your State, in your community. Think of all the critical \ninfrastructure that is barely protected, and consider what a biological \nattack could do to you and your family and to the people you represent, \nand then join with us in doing what the experts are telling us to do: \nProvide what is needed, whatever it takes to keep us safe.\n  We can do better for the American people. We are America; we can do \nwhat it takes to keep us safe. This amendment puts us in the direction \nof doing that. I urge support for it and support for a motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are hearing a lot about the costs of \nthe war. I am not addressing the need for homeland security per se. But \nI would point out, this bill before us now is over $29 billion for a \nDepartment that did not even exist 6 months ago. During the period of \ntime of the blockade of Iraq following the Persian Gulf war, to carry \nout the mandates of the United Nations we built a new airbase, Prince \nSultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, the largest airbase in the world. We \nbuilt a new airbase in Aviano. We built a new Army base in Kuwait. For \n12 years, we maintained forces to blockade Iraq and to enforce the no-\nfly zones set forth by the agreement with Saddam Hussein after the \nPersian Gulf war.\n  I have asked the staff to get me the figures of how much that cost, \nhow much did it cost to carry out the mandates of the United Nations \nfollowing the Persian Gulf war, primarily because he did not comply \nwith the agreement he made at the termination of that war. I believe it \ngoes into the hundreds of billions of dollars that we spent in 12 \nyears.\n  It is costing us a great deal of money to keep our forces in the \nfield now. Hopefully, that will come to an end soon. But so has the \ncost of the blockade of Iraq. So has the cost of Prince Sultan. So has \nthe cost of maintaining that Army base in Kuwait. Very soon we will be \nable to stand down a considerable portion of the people who are at \nAviano in Italy. Those costs, by the way, were in addition to the costs \nwe spent in Bosnia during the same period, and in Kosovo during the \nsame period.\n  The American taxpayer has been bearing an enormous cost for many \nyears to deal with the deployment of forces overseas. Hopefully, what \nwe have done now will bring to an end, or at least to a very low \nminimum, the cost of maintaining forces in that area.\n\n  I believe we have taken actions that were necessary but I also know \nthat we have done a lot to improve the morale of the Air Force. I \npersonally, along\n\n[[Page S9840]]\n\nwith my good friend from Hawaii, talked with many of the pilots who \nwere flying what we call the CAP, the constant air patrol, over Iraq. \nThey were shot at almost daily by missiles fired by Saddam Hussein. \nThey lived in a period of constant terror, as they flew over those \nareas, that they would be attacked by the ground-to-air missiles. Thank \nGod, they survived them. But it led to a period of time when our \nreenlistment rate in the Air Force reversed itself from about 72 \npercent, down to about 28 percent of our people reenlisted to fly in \nthe Air Force, because of the strain of the constant air patrol over \nIraq.\n  But I do think people ought to keep in perspective, when they say we \ncan afford this, this amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, \nbecause we are spending so much money in Iraq--we have been spending a \nlot of money for a lot of years. The trouble is, we have to come back \nand have some perspective.\n  The amendment before us exceeds the budget by an enormous amount. It \ndoes not offset that, saying let's stop spending money somewhere else \nbecause, in fact, we cannot do that. There is no offset.\n  Under the circumstances, I think we ought to start having some \ndiscipline around here. That is what we are supposed to do because of \nthe Budget Act. The Budget Act was supposed to give us discipline.\n  We are facing now a constant parade of amendments that the authors \nknow is beyond the budget. The authors know we don't have the money. \nThe authors know we found as much money as we possibly can find to \nallocate to homeland security for the fiscal year 2004.\n  I do hope Members will start thinking about the concept of \naffordability. We will soon stop spending that money that we are \nspending for the postwar security in Iraq and we will no longer have to \nmaintain the blockade. We have had part of our Coast Guard over there \nfor years, to try to stop the illegal exports and imports into Iraq. We \nhad about 40 percent of our Air Force over there in those two major \nbases, Prince Sultan and Aviano, to maintain control of the air over \nBosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq.\n  I do think we ought to keep in perspective what we have done, in \nterms of future expenses for our military. I hope we will not have a \njustification that we can spend this money the Senator from Connecticut \nwants to spend because we are spending too much money in Iraq. We are \nspending a lot of money in Iraq but it is not too much money. It is \nmoney well spent because it will terminate the expenses we have had to \nincur over the last 12 years.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my good friend from Alaska leaves, \nand he is my good friend, the point I am making--I supported this. The \nneeded resources there make sense. I am not suggesting in any way that \nthe resources we are spending there somehow ought to be subtracted. I \nwas making the point that, while we were doing the right thing, \nobviously, as part of our security--and no one knows these issues \nbetter than the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee and his \ncolleague, Dan Inouye, when they go into matters of what we need for \nour national security system. I respect them.\n  My point here is, we are being told, as we have been told by others, \nwe need to do more at home if we are going to meet the security needs \nof the American people. Just as we are doing that, we merely pointed \nout, my colleague from Michigan and I, what we are spending on a weekly \nbasis for reconstruction in Iraq and trying to get Afghanistan on its \nfeet. We accept the notion that is going to be critical. Our point \nsimply was, can you imagine someone coming in saying: ``We are not \ndoing enough; we need more to get the job done over there but, I'm \nsorry, we can't afford to do what our men and women in the Armed Forces \nneed; there are budget caps and we just don't have the resources''?\n  That argument wouldn't find five supporters here. The point Senator \nStabenow and I are trying to make is we have men and women in uniform \nhere as well. They are called firefighters, police, emergency medical \npersonnel, hospital attendants and doctors and physicians and \nscientists. They are coming to us, in this report, and saying we have \nsome real problems here at home. We are vulnerable. We are vulnerable.\n  What we are saying is, can we not find the resources? We have \nidentified a source, which this Congress, if it has the will to do it, \ncan come up and meet the challenge.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I wonder if you might respond a little more on how we \nwill be able to find the dollars? Because, as both of us have \nindicated--I know you have indicated in Connecticut; I have indicated \nit in Michigan--there are those who are doing very well, certainly in \nmy State. They have the same concerns as everybody else about being \nsafe and secure. If we ask them to be willing to delay receiving a \nlittle bit more back in their pockets, those who are doing very well, \nin order to be able to put it into keeping their families safe, I think \nthey would be willing to do that.\n  Isn't that what the Senator is suggesting, that we look at our \npriorities and decide what is most important in terms of safety and \nsecurity?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Michigan is absolutely correct. I \nrepresent one of the two most affluent--two or three most affluent \nStates in the United States. Always, each year when they list what is \nthe most affluent State in the country on the per capita, Alaska, \nConnecticut, and New Jersey are always competing No. 1, No. 2, No. 3. \nOf course, we also have some significant poverty in our State. But on a \nper capita basis, Connecticut is one of the most affluent States. I am \nconfident, as I am standing before you, if you ask any of the people in \nmy State who are in the $1 million or more income category--and I have \na lot of them in my State and I know them; they are tremendously \npatriotic, successful individuals--if you ask any one of them whether \nthey would be willing to forgo some of the tax cut we have provided \nthem over the last 2 years in exchange for getting resources to make \nthis country more secure at home, I guarantee every single one of my \naffluent constituents would say: Absolutely. Absolutely.\n  They would be horrified to think that maybe they are being used as an \nexcuse on why we can't do this, why we can't provide the additional \nresources.\n  I know we can't break the budget caps. I am not suggesting, nor is \nthe Senator from Michigan, we do that. What the Senator from Michigan \nsuggests is here is a source of revenue for us. Here is a case where \nsome $3 trillion, in 28 months--what is $3 trillion? Mr. President, $1 \ntrillion is one thousand billion dollars. We are talking about $15 \nbillion instead of three thousand billion, $15 billion of it to go to \nmake America more secure, not because the Senator from Michigan and I \nsat down at some point and concocted a number together. We read, and I \nnow put it in the Record so all America can read it, a report put \ntogether by a distinguished group of Americans, former Chairmen of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, Director of the FBI, the CIA, and formerly \ncolleagues of ours who said, and I quote from the report, and it is \nworth repeating again because it needs to be repeated:\n\n       Congress has dangerously delayed the appropriation of funds \n     for emergency responders.\n\n  Dangerously delayed. Listen to the conclusion of this report. I will \nread it again. My colleague, I know, knows this but let me read it.\n\n       The terrible attacks of September 11 have shown the \n     American public how vulnerable they are. Because attacks on \n     that scale had never happened before, the United States and \n     the American people were caught underprotected, unaware of \n     the magnitude of the threat facing them. In the wake of \n     September 11, ignorance of the nature of the threat or of \n     what the United States must do to prepare for future attacks \n     can no longer explain America's continuing failure to \n     allocate sufficient resources to preparing local emergency \n     responders. It would be a terrible tragedy indeed if it took \n     another catastrophic attack to drive that point home.\n\n  That is the conclusion of George Shultz, of Admiral Crowe, of Les \nGelb, of Director Webster. I read the list of the people who make up \nthis report. These, with all due respect to congressional staffers, are \nNobel laureates, William Webster, high-ranking former\n\n[[Page S9841]]\n\nchiefs of staff of the Army, national security advisers, White House \nemployees over three administrations, Ronald Reagan appointees.\n\n  This isn't a partisan document. It is compiled by serious Americans \nwho know what they are talking about. And they are telling us we are \ndangerously inadequate in understanding what needs to be done to make \nAmerica strong. Many wealthy Americans will be glad to forgo a part of \ntheir tax dollars in order to make us more secure at home. I know many \nof them in Connecticut--and I am confident my colleague from Michigan \nwould say the same thing about her constituents----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is this the Rudman report?\n  Mr. DODD. This is the Warren Rudman report. He chaired it. The senior \nadviser was Richard Clarke, who served for three American President's, \nand Jamie Metzl, along with a task force. I have read all of the names. \nI will put them in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend if he would agree with the statement I am \ngoing to make.\n  I had the pleasure of serving in the Senate with Warren Rudman. I \nwant the Record to reflect that Warren Rudman is not some person who \njust came upon the scene. He is a distinguished American. He is a \ncombat veteran from Korea, a marine, a veteran. He is very proud of \nthat. When he served in the Senate, he did a lot of very distinguished \nthings, not the least of which as chairman and as ranking member of the \nEthics Committee for a long period of time. He went into the private \nsector. He retired from partisan politics and decided not to run for \nreelection.\n  No one I know has ever in my presence criticized the former Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Warren Rudman, for being anything other than a \nstraight shooter. Any concern that people may have had was that \nsometimes he was a little too direct.\n  Will the Senator agree with me that the distinguished American who \nled this panel and affixed his name to it is a person who, for lack of \na better description, is a very patriotic American, who is, by the way, \na card-carrying proud Republican, and who has devoted a great deal of \nhis life to public service and has told us we need to do something to \nprotect the people in the States we represent?\n  Mr. DODD. In response to my colleague from Nevada, I served with \nWarren Rudman, as my friend from Nevada did. In fact, I was the fourth \ncosponsor of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction proposal and budget-\nsaving mechanism when it was first introduced and was the subject of \nsuch heated debate in this body in the early 1980s.\n  I heard my colleague from Nevada yesterday talk about what a tight-\nfisted Senator, Warren Rudman was as a Member of this body as well. He \nwas not someone who was known as a profligate spender. He believed very \nstrongly in budget discipline.\n  By the way, we are low-balling the numbers. We are offering a little \nless than $15 billion. That is based on the assumption that States may \nbe doing more.\n  When you read this report, you will get into some of the details and \nyou will wonder why Senator Stabenow and I didn't offer an amendment \nwith more dollars based on its conclusions.\n  The Senator from Nevada is absolutely correct. Warren Rudman is an \nindividual who does serious work. This is the second report in which he \nhas been involved. He was involved in an earlier one which was prepared \nalong with another former colleague of ours, Senator Gary Hart, and got \nrave reviews by all who examined it. This report follows on as a result \nof that first report to determine where are we now after 2 years.\n  As I have said over and over again, and as my colleague from Michigan \nhas said over and over again, the conclusion of these serious people is \nthat we are way short of what we ought to be doing. They tell us what \nneeds to be done, and they lay out in fact where the shortcomings are.\n  Senator Rudman is once again owed a deep sense of gratitude.\n  It is sort of like the mythical figure Cassandra. For those who love \nmythology as I do, Cassandra was doomed in mythology to always telling \nthe truth and never being believed. Senator Rudman is becoming sort of \nthe Cassandra in this debate, if this goes where I think it is going.\n  The Senator from Michigan and I have no illusions. She is a \nprofessional person who understands politics. She served in her State \nlegislature for many years. We knew when we got up here that we \nprobably weren't going to get 60 votes on this. So I am not fooled by \nwhat I face here with a waiver that we have to apply to a point of \norder. But we want to be on record, and we want our colleagues to be on \nrecord, to say when I was given a choice of where to be on this issue, \nthis is where I came down; this is the side of the ledger on which I \nwant to be recorded.\n  Maybe we will be surprised and 60 of our colleagues will join us in \nvoting for the waiver. But if that is not the case, let the American \npublic then judge where people were when the choices needed to be made.\n  I suspect we need to talk about this in more concrete terms.\n  I was impressed with the remarks of the Senator from Michigan about \nthe comments of the people in Michigan. I believe she held a number of \nhearings or discussions with people in her State about first \nresponders. I wonder if she might share with us once again some of the \nconcerns she heard from her fire and police and emergency medical \npersonnel about whether or not they believe they are better prepared.\n  We have heard from our distinguished panel of people who analyze this \nfrom more of a global perspective. But on the ground, in local \ncommunities--that may not have the benefit of Nobel laureates to \nexamine all the laboratories in the country to look at this from a \ndistance--what are they saying? What are our average police officers \nand firemen saying? What are our emergency medical personnel saying? \nHow well do they think they are prepared?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my colleague again for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  I have had 11 different meetings from Detroit--large urban areas--to \nMacomb County, all the way up to Marquette in the upper peninsula, and \nover to the west side of the State. This report talks about only 50 \npercent of our firefighters having the radio equipment they need.\n  I heard firsthand from the folks on the ground, and I am not sure it \nis even 50 percent. They talked about in some cases the fire department \ncould not talk to the police department in the same city, that the city \ncould not talk to the county.\n  When we call 911, we expect that call is going to lead to a series of \nother communications, that it is going to get the right people to us, \nand that we are going to be able to respond quickly. In the case of a \nbioterrorism attack, the public health department, of course, is very \nconcerned about the inability to communicate with the fire department. \nAnd it is not that they do not have radios; it is that they do not have \ninteroperability. They do not have the same frequency. They do not have \nthe same technology. There is newer and newer technology that allows \nthem to communicate ideally all across the whole State.\n  We hope we will be developing communications equipment that will have \neverybody in the county being able to talk to each other and able to \ntalk around the entire State. But the radios, the communications \nsystems were a major issue in those meetings.\n  The second major issue was training, the ability to have the newest \ntraining, the newest equipment in case of a bioterrorism attack. And \nthen, of course, the whole question of added personnel.\n  I might just add, I believe the sense of urgency occurs here because \nof the lag time it takes when we approve the dollars to do the \ntraining, to get the equipment. I know last year, as a border State, in \nMichigan, this was a major issue for us. In Detroit, we have the \nlargest border crossing of the northern border. We have over $1 billion \nin goods that come across the border every day.\n  And when we put in place--thanks to the support of our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle--additional resources for Border Patrol and \nCustoms, it has taken almost a year to train those folks. We are just \nnow seeing the increased personnel at the border as a result of \ndecisions made a year ago to increase the dollars.\n\n[[Page S9842]]\n\n  Even if we do this now, we are talking about months or a year before \nthe training can actually happen and take effect or that the \ncommunications equipment can be purchased and put together. I think \nthere is even a greater sense of urgency as a result of the fact that \nit takes time once we even make the decision.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for her comments. Maybe there are some \nwho believe that terrorism is no longer a problem, that these \norganizations are no longer viable. I hope there are very few people \nwho would embrace that belief. One needs only to read the papers every \nday to learn that even in Iraq it is not just a question of those \nmembers of the Baath Party who are apparently engaging in the \nassassination of our U.S. men and women in uniform in the military.\n\n  We are now told there are terrorist organizations operating that have \ngotten into Iraq from Yemen and Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. We know of \ncell groups. There is hardly a day that does by that we don't read \nabout another group that has been identified or where contacts have \nbeen made by organizations. This is a real threat and a growing one. \nAgain, the report points it out.\n  This is serious business. We should never again have to go through \nwhat we went through on 9/11 and the wake of 9/11. We cannot guarantee \nthat, but there will be a tremendous indictment, in my view, \nhistorically if we don't act.\n  Just look at some of these numbers that we have received on the \ninadequacy. There are 1 million firefighters who put their lives on the \nline every day. Yet we are told currently two-thirds of all fire \ndepartments operate with inadequate staff--two-thirds of all fire \ndepartments, first responders, with inadequate staff.\n  In fact, as pointed out in testimony before the Committee on Science \nand Technology of the House of Representatives, on October 11, 2001: \nUnderstaffing had caused or contributed to firefighter deaths in \nMemphis TN; Worcester, MA; Iowa; Pittsburgh, PA; Chesapeake, VA; \nStockton, CA; Lexington, KY; Buffalo, NY. There is about a fireman a \nday who loses their life or is seriously injured.\n  Now they are being asked to do that which they never would have \nimagined, such as dealing with chemical materials. Imagine a major \nterrorist attack with how we had our departments. Look what they had to \ndo on 9/11. Departments from Connecticut went into New York. \nDepartments from New Jersey went into New York. Other departments tried \nto backfill to cover our departments that left. It was a nightmare.\n  As the Senator properly points out, they could not even talk to each \nother. They did not have the proper interoperability of the phone \nsystems. I would like say to my colleague that the problem has been \ncorrected 2 years later, but it has not been. The fact is, it is still \nan incredible fact that most of our local people cannot even talk to \neach other, let alone talk across State lines where you have tremendous \ndensities of population.\n  Again, the budget shortfalls at the local and State level are huge. \nPick up your newspaper. Today it is California, $38 billion in deficit. \nI mentioned earlier what the deficit is in Connecticut. I mentioned \nwhat I thought was Michigan's number. My colleague may want to correct \nme, but I believe it is bigger than $4 billion, as she pointed out. I \ndon't know what it is in Nevada or Alaska. But every State is facing \ntremendous pressures to meet these obligations. So the numbers are \nshrinking on the State and local levels.\n  By the way, while I have been critical about not doing more, I \ncommend the Appropriations Committee. They upped the number $1 billion \nfrom what the President wanted. The Commander in Chief, in my view, \nought to be leading on this issue and saying to Congress: I will help \nyou get the money. We are going to provide the resources.\n  With all due respect, we need more help. And if the Commander in \nChief is even low-balling a number from what the committee did, below \nwhat we are told we need by $15 billion a year, where is the leadership \non this issue? I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. The Senator makes such an important point. I was \nthinking, as he was speaking about how we are losing a firefighter a \nday--I believe he said as a result of not being prepared for the \nchallenges they face--we have people now, unfortunately on a daily \nbasis, who are losing their lives in Iraq. We are deeply concerned \nabout our troops.\n  But can you imagine if we said that only half of our military men and \nwomen in Iraq could talk to each other through their radios, that only \nhalf or maybe only 10 percent have the training they need, or that they \ndid not have the equipment they need. Our Commander in Chief, rightly \nso--our President--has stepped forward and said: Whatever they need to \nbe prepared, we will make sure they have it.\n  As the Senator has indicated--and as I have as well--the folks on the \nfront lines at home, in their uniforms, should have no less \nconsideration. Why don't we say, whatever you need--if you are wearing \na firefighting uniform, a police officer's uniform; if you are \nemergency medical personnel--you ought to have whatever you need on the \nfrontline fight because it is a war on terrorism. This should not even \nbe a debate. I think when we compare it, it is startling to think about \nwhat we are saying to the men and women on the front lines at home.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague again raises a very good point. Again, I am \ntold by staff that every one of our men and women in military uniform \nin Iraq and Afghanistan have with them devices that allow them to \ndetermine immediately if they have been affected by chemical or \nbiological weapons. There is a certain amount of equipment or type of \nequipment they can have which will allow them to immediately know. And \nthey should have it.\n  The fact is, we have nothing like that available to our first \nresponders at home who may be asked to respond to those situations.\n  The Senator makes the point so well. Again, our discussion of what \nour military needs to protect our country is not the subject of this \ndebate. The mere point we are trying to raise this issue is that we are \nspending this amount in these places, and if someone were to come in \nand say we need more--and they will, no doubt; I guarantee you, as I \nstand here, there will be a request saying we need more--I suspect \nthere will not be just two or three Senators sitting here arguing about \nwhether or not we are going to get it, and if there are budget points \nof order against an amendment, they will be defeated when they ask for \na waiver. I guarantee you, it will go through here like a hot knife \nthrough butter when it comes.\n  The issue is, we are making a similar case for a similar set of \nchallenges.\n  Because I don't think my colleague was here when I started the \ndebate, let me just read the first lines of this report written by Les \nGelb, who is now stepping down and is being replaced by Richard Haass, \nthe new head of the Council on Foreign Relations. I think my colleague \nfrom Nevada will appreciate this:\n\n       As I sit to write this forward, it is likely that a \n     terrorist group somewhere in the world is developing plans to \n     attack the United States or American interests abroad using \n     chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or catastrophic \n     conventional means. At the same time diplomats, legislators, \n     military intelligence officers, police, fire, and emergency \n     medical personnel, and others in the United States and across \n     the globe, are working feverishly to prevent and prepare for \n     such attacks. These two groups of people are ultimately in a \n     race with one another. This is a race we cannot afford to \n     lose.\n\n  Right now we are losing the race, according to the report of people \nwho tell us we are not meeting the requirements we should have. As we \nstand here, I promise you there are people somewhere planning to attack \nus. I know there are people in our Government working hard to stop it \nat the local, State, and national level. The distinguished group of \npeople who compiled this report, led by a former colleague, says we are \ndangerously, inadequately not funding what needs to be done. We are \nlosing the race.\n  All our amendment suggests is, let's find the means. We can do this. \nThis isn't brain surgery. This is not that hard. If we were faced with \na similar question about whether or not we need more resources to \nprotect our men and women in military uniform, we would do it, and we \nshould do it. We should do no less for those here at home trying to \nprotect us against a terrorist attack.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S9843]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I hesitated because I think the final statements you have \nmade here have so dramatically painted a picture of why we need to do \nsomething, not next Congress but now. I say to my two friends, the \nsponsors of this amendment, I personally very much appreciate the \noffering of this amendment. I appreciate it because we have had some \nother good amendments that have been defeated. But you have taken the \napproach that there are a lot of things that need to be done, that \nrifle shots won't work. We need to take into consideration the full \nimpact of the Rudman report and do something about it.\n  I am convinced, as the Senator has indicated, the amount the Senators \nhave suggested is really too small. But I say to everyone within the \nsound of my voice, let's say the distinguished Americans who wrote that \nreport are 10 percent off and they are asking for 10 percent more than \nis really needed. What harm will be done from that because we have too \nmuch protection? We all know what can happen if we do not have enough \nprotection.\n  I know the people of the State of Nevada are scrambling. On any given \nday in Las Vegas there are 300,000 tourists. People who are \nfirefighters, police officers, medical personnel, when something goes \nwrong, have to take care of those tourists just as they do with someone \nborn there. I was born in the State of Nevada. But they have as much \nresponsibility to take care of the tourists from Connecticut as I do. I \nwant this Record to be spread with my admiration and respect for the \ncourage the Senators have shown in calling this really what it is. We \nneed more money. That is what it takes to make sure this country is \nsafe. Right now, according to some of the finest people in all America, \nwe are not safe.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank our colleague from Nevada for that observation. He \nrepresents a unique State, he and the Presiding Officer. Literally \nmillions of people, not just from the United States but from all over \nthe world, visit Nevada. It is a special set of responsibilities that \npeople of Nevada assume by inviting the world to come. And obviously, \nthis could easily be a target. It is hard to imagine what the next \ntarget could be, but I promise, there are people planning it. They are \nplanning it as we sit here today. Whether it is a nuclear powerplant, \nwhether it is a major office building, whether it is a recreational \nfacility, they are doing it.\n\n  I don't like saying that, but I can't say anything less to my \ncolleagues because that is the conclusion of people who have spent \nhours and days and weeks examining all of this and telling us.\n  I thank my colleague from Michigan. I am grateful to her. She is a \nremarkable Senator. In a short amount of time, she has made a \nsignificant contribution to the public debate. I am very grateful to \nher for joining me in this particular effort. It is a lot of money. I \nhave never offered an amendment of this magnitude.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, who has \nbeen around many years.\n  This is almost $15 billion. I have never offered anything quite like \nthis. But I have never felt as concerned and as worried about a \nsituation as I am about this one.\n  Shortly there will be a vote. We will more than likely not prevail. \nBut there will be a record about those who believed we should do more. \nI hope we get proven wrong. There is no desire that we would like to be \nproven right. But I have a sense of foreboding that by not taking the \nsteps, we are leaving ourselves very vulnerable. The trauma of America \nbeing hit again and being told we should have done more to prepare for \nit and didn't could have an effect far beyond the damage done by the \nattack itself, to know that a Congress was convened and was given \ninformation that told it to do more and do a better job and was given a \nchance to do so and turned it down. That is something I think history \nwill judge us very harshly on if we make that mistake.\n  I hope we don't. I hope the majority of my colleagues who may be \nlistening to this brief debate this morning will break ranks and come \nover and say: We can do better. Let's go back to the drawing board and \ncome up with the resources, provide the support we need for our first \nresponders.\n  I have no further requests for time. I don't know if my colleague \nfrom Michigan wishes to be heard further. I appreciate the generosity \nand kindness of the distinguished Senator from Mississippi who has been \nvery patient listening to us make this case. I am very grateful to him \nand Senator Stevens, as well as Senator Byrd, for taking as much time, \na couple of hours this morning, to express our views on the subject.\n  Again, the Senator from Nevada said it well. I had planned a whole \nseries of smaller amendments on all sorts of pieces of this. The \nSenator from Michigan and I sat down and decided, instead of just \ntrying to do this item by item by item, we would ask our colleagues to \nrespond based on this report and come up with, in the Office of \nHomeland Security, a set of priorities that they may determine \ndifferently than what our amendment agenda might provide.\n  For those reasons we urge the adoption of the amendment. That can be \ndone by supporting the motion to waive the point of order. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong \nsupport for the amendment introduced by Senators Mikulski and Dodd, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor, that would provide an additional $150 million \nfor the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program--FIRE Grants.\n  As a co-chairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I am \nproud to have been a strong supporter of the original legislation that \nestablished and funded the FIRE Grant Program. Since that time, this \nprogram has proven itself, by all accounts, a tremendous success.\n  Just this past May, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Leadership \nDevelopment Academy released a comprehensive evaluation of the program, \nnoting that it was ``highly effective in improving the readiness and \nthe capabilities of firefighters across the country.'' Moreover, the \nstudy found that 97 percent of those receiving grants reported that the \nassistance had a positive impact on their abilities to handle fire \nemergencies, and, of those receiving equipment through the FIRE Grant \nprogram, 99 percent of departments indicated that the acquisitions made \nwith the funding had dramatically improved the safety of their \nfirefighters.\n  The need for this additional funding is abundantly clear. In December \nof this past year, FEMA and the National Fire Protection Association \njointly released the Congressionally-authorized ``Needs Assessment of \nthe U.S. Fire Service.'' The results of this report were startling. \nAmong its findings, the report noted that an estimated 57,000 \nfirefighters lack protective clothing, half of all fire engines are at \nleast fifteen years old, and approximately one-third of firefighters \nare not equipped with essential self-contained breathing apparatus.\n  Furthermore, during this year's FIRE Grant application process, \nrecord numbers of fire houses around the country have requested \nassistance. By the April 11 application deadline, the Department of \nHomeland Security reports having received approximately 19,950 FIRE \nGrant applications, for a total request of over $2 billion in Federal \nfunding. Unfortunately, with an appropriation of only $745 million, the \nDepartment expects to fund well under half of these requests. The \namount contained in the Homeland Security Appropriations measure \ncurrently before the Senate barely exceeds this amount, at a level of \n$750 million.\n  The Mikulski-Dodd amendment would merely fund the FIRE Act at its \nfully-authorized level of $900 million. In light of the demonstrated \nneed and inadequacy of current funding levels, I would prefer a larger \namount. However, the Senate authorized $900 million for this program in \nthe Fiscal 2002 Defense Authorization Act, and I believe we must at \nleast meet this modest commitment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by my colleague Senator Dodd to add $15 billion in \nfunding for our first responders and first preventers. I commend my \nfriend for his strong leadership, and I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n\n[[Page S9844]]\n\n  One of the Federal Government's primary responsibilities under the \nConstitution is to provide for a common defense. Today, in the face of \nthe terrorist threat, that means more than building a mighty, well-\nequipped and well-trained Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast \nGuard. It means strengthening the shared security of our 50 States and \ntheir cities and towns, as well as our territories. Today, the \nreadiness of our firefighters and police officers and public health \nprofessionals is every bit as important to our national security as the \nreadiness of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen.\n  Homeland security is expensive. It can't be accomplished on the \ncheap. And because the war against terrorism is a national fight, a \nsubstantial portion of the responsibility falls to the Federal \nGovernment. It takes serious money to make the necessary changes to our \nservices and infrastructure. To employ, train and equip top-flight \nfirst responders. To buy biometric security systems, hire more border \npersonnel, install information sharing networks and develop biological \nand chemical testing and treatment capabilities. Securing the Nation's \nports, as well as chemical and nuclear plants must become a top \npriority. In transportation, we must move beyond aviation and also \nsecure mass transit, rails, air cargo, pipelines, tunnels, and bridges. \nThese tough jobs and countless others can't be accomplished with \nwishful thinking or a magic wand. And they cannot be accomplished by \nplacing an unfair share of the burden on State and local governments \nwho are already facing the worst fiscal crises in decades. Ever since \nbefore we established the Department of Homeland Security, many of us \nwere asking this administration to provide adequate resources, to \nprovide them quickly and to target them more effectively. But \nunfortunately, that hasn't happened.\n  Across the country, states and localities are being spread thinner \nthan ever at the moment they can least afford it. Homeland security and \nhealthcare costs are rising. Deficits are rising. But the economy \nisn't. Only our firefighters can protect against chemical weapons or \nrescue families trapped in buildings. But in some cities and States \naround the country today, our first preventers and responders are \nactually being laid off because of budget cutbacks. That is like \nreducing your troop force in a time of conventional warfare. It is \ncrazy and it must stop and only more money from Washington can make it \nstop. Yet this administration's indifference is undermining the men and \nwomen who are our first line of defense in the war against terrorism.\n  The American people expect and believe that we are doing our utmost \nto ensure that sufficient funds are provided, but in too many \ncommunities, the reality is unlikely to meet the expectation. The \nadministration has failed to make sure that the necessary funds go to \nthose who need it most: the local firefighters, police officers, \nemergency technicians, and public health workers who protect and serve \nus every day.\n  In February, I proposed spending an additional $16 billion on \nhomeland security above the President's fiscal year 2004 budget--$7.5 \nbillion of which was for first responders. In June, I offered an \namendment at the Governmental Affairs Committee markup to add $10 \nbillion to Senator Collins' legislation authorizing grant programs for \nour first responders, but my amendment was defeated on a party-line \nvote.\n  During the markup, it was suggested that we should not authorize that \namount of funding without an independent assessment of what the real \nneeds are. Well, now that rationale, which I believe failed to consider \nthe testimony, public statements, and other assessments which already \nexisted, no longer can be made. That is because on June 29th a report \nby an independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign \nRelations--composed of distinguished former government officials, \nincluding a director of the CIA and the FBI, our colleague Senator \nRudman, a White House terrorism adviser and a former chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff--corroborated the conclusions I and others \nreached months ago. The report, entitled, ``Drastically Underfunded, \nDangerously Unprepared,'' determined that ``the United States has not \nreached a sufficient national level of emergency preparedness and \nremains dangerously unprepared to handle a catastrophic attack on \nAmerican soil. . . . If the nation does not take immediate steps to \nbetter identify and address the urgent needs of emergency responders, \nthe next terrorist incident could have an even more devastating impact \nthan the 9/11 attacks.'' Indeed, the task force report found that the \nU.S. is on track to fall nearly $100 billion short of meeting critical \nemergency responder needs over the next 5 years. This estimate does not \neven include some known needs--such as detection or protection gear for \npolice--because the task force could not obtain reliable estimates for \nthose areas. The administration's response to the warning from this \nrespected commission? It brushed off the report's spending \nrecommendation as ``grossly inflated.''\n  The task force report listed a number of urgent needs left unmet due \nto lack of funding. They point out that funds are urgently needed, \namong other things, to: provide interoperable communications equipment \nfor all emergency responder groups across the country so that those on \nthe front lines can communicate with one another while on the scene of \nan attack; enhance urban search and rescue capabilities of major \ncities; extend the emergency 911 system nationally; provide protective \ngear and weapons of mass destruction remediation equipment to first \nresponders; and increase public health preparedness and develop surge \ncapacity on the Nation's hospitals.\n  The report's findings are sobering. For example, the report noted: \n``On average, fire departments across the country only have enough \nradios to equip half the firefighters on a shift, and breathing \napparatus for only one third. Only 10 percent of fire departments in \nthe United States have the personnel and equipment to respond to a \nbuilding collapse.'' The report found cities without the means to \ndetermine whether terrorists had struck with dangerous chemicals or \npathogens, and public health labs incapable of responding to a chemical \nor biological attack.\n  Earlier today, yet another report was issued--this one by the \nProgressive Policy Institute--which noted that the Bush administration \nhas failed to adequately address critical homeland security needs, \nincluding: improving intelligence gathering and analysis; improving \nsecurity at the state and local level; controlling our national \nborders; protecting against bio terror attacks; and protecting critical \nfacilities. The report graded the administration's overall efforts to \nprotect the homeland as ``D.'' It acknowledged that some progress has \nbeen made in a few areas, but added ``we find that the Bush \nadministration has not brought the same energy and attention to \nhomeland security that it has brought to overseas military efforts. The \nadministration has failed to adequately fund a number of essential \nhomeland security functions. In the absence of presenting a compelling \nvision of the changes necessary to protect the homeland, the Bush \nadministration has failed to push back on the government bureaucracies \nthat have resisted meaningful change. In short the President has failed \nto make homeland security his top priority.''\n\n  The PPI report and the Independent Task Force of the Council on \nForeign Relations Report follow a series of assessments that have \nraised serious questions about the extent and effectiveness of the \nadministration's homeland security efforts. The administration must \nstop ignoring the evidence that, with respect to homeland security, \nalmost 2 years after the September 11, 2001 attacks, we remain \n``drastically underfunded, dangerously unprepared.''\n  These reports have simply confirmed what we the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and others in Congress have been told for many months: The \nreality is that left without sufficient resources, State and local \ngovernments and first responder organizations are struggling--and \nfailing--to keep up with their day-to-day critical services to their \ncommunities as their homeland security obligations take an increasing \ntoll. At a hearing of the Governmental Affairs Committee this spring, \none police chief told us that he had to eliminate or cut back community \npolice, drug enforcement, traffic\n\n[[Page S9845]]\n\nenforcement and programs in schools in order to station most of his \nforce at the airport.\n  Even as they are forced to abandon more and more of their traditional \nwork to serve as the front line in the war on terrorism here at home, \nthese first responder groups are unable to work effectively because \nthey are lacking sufficient funds. Ed Plaugher, Fire Chief of \nArlington, VA told the Governmental Affairs Committee that the stress \nof protecting the homeland without adequate resources is affecting the \nmorale of first responders. Captain Chauncey Bowers of the Prince \nGeorges County, MD Fire Department testified before the Governmental \nAffairs Committee on behalf of the International Association of \nFirefighters and told us that we need a national commitment to homeland \nsecurity preparedness; he urged us to work to ensure that every fire \ndepartment in America has the resources to protect our citizens.\n  First responders need equipment such as personal protective clothing, \nrespirators, and devices for detection of chemical, biological and \nradiological hazards. They need training in using such equipment, and \ntraining in how in general to respond in an attack. Nevertheless, local \nfire and police officials at our hearings told us at the Governmental \nAffairs Committee hearings they do not have the resources to pay for \ntraining or equipment that they need to prepare for a possible attack. \nIndeed, most emergency workers still do not have the training or the \nequipment they require. The December 2002 needs assessment of the U.S. \nFire Service conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(FEMA) in conjunction with the National Fire Protection Association \nfound that about one-third of firefighters per shift are not equipped \nwith self-contained breathing apparatus, and nearly half of all fire \ndepartments have no map coordinate system. And with respect to \ntraining, another study by FEMA found that 27 percent of fire \ndepartment personnel involved in providing emergency medical services \nlacked any formal training even in those duties, and incredibly, 73 \npercent of fire departments failed to meet regulations for hazardous \nmaterials response training.\n  The administration's own budget documents estimate that only about \n80,000 first responders were trained and equipped in 2002 with funding \nat the Federal level of $750 million. Unless this administration \nprovides significantly more funding, it will take us decades to train \nour first responders to cope with weapons of mass destruction. We do \nnot have that kind of time.\n  Even if we could supply training and equipment to all of our first \nresponders, there are simply not enough of them. A survey by the \nProgressive Policy Institute of 44 of the largest police departments \nfound that 27 of them--nearly two-thirds--are experiencing personnel \nshortfalls as a result of inadequate budgets and problems attracting \nnew recruits. According to the report, the city of Chicago, as a result \nof increased overtime costs, has delayed hiring new officers and thus \nhas seen its ranks decline between 2000 and 2002. Detroit's experience \nhas been similar, with a 50 percent increase in overtime costs while \nits ranks thinned by 5.3 percent between 2000 and 2002.\n  This report is shocking and sad at a time when we should be enhancing \nour first line of defense. It highlights the need to provide adequate \nfunding to hire additional police officers and firefighters. Yet the \nBush administration has steadfastly opposed the efforts of the sponsor \nof this amendment to support the SAFER Act, which would authorize over \n$1 billion per year for 7 years to hire 10,0000 additional firefighters \nper year. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that legislation and the \namendment to the DOD bill which would partially fund those \nfirefighters; and I was proud that the homeland security bill which I \nauthored last Congress included funding to hire firefighters, but that \nprovision was defeated by Republicans on the Senate floor.\n  The PPI survey also makes clear the need for adequate funding for \novertime related to training. Indeed, according to the Conference of \nMayors, cities across America spent $70 million per week when the \nhomeland security alert was raised to orange--much of it for overtime \nexpenses.\n  Finally, even if local police and fire departments had sufficient \npersonnel, they lack the ability to communicate effectively in a time \nof emergency. In most areas of the U.S., the police, firefighters and \nemergency technicians in the same jurisdiction have no way to \ncommunicate in the field because their equipment is not compatible. \nLack of interoperability in communications systems has been cited as a \ncause of the deaths of 343 firefighters in New York City on September \n11, 2001, because police could not reach them prior to the collapse of \nthe World Trade Center towers.\n  Achieving this goal, however, will be expensive, and the \nadministration's funding commitment is wholly insufficient. The Public \nSafety Wireless Network, a joint Treasury and Justice Department policy \ngroup, estimates it could cost up to $18 billion. According to the \nNational Task Force on Interoperability, at the State level, replacing \nbasic radio systems for a single public safety agency can cost between \n$100 million and $300 million. Meanwhile, Secretary Ridge testified \nbefore the Governmental Affairs Committee on May 1, 2003 that $40 \nmillion had been appropriated to run ``some demonstrations projects \nwith regard to interoperable communications.'' This is an inadequate \nresponse to a long-standing and expensive problem, and will leave our \nfirst line of defense without the basic equipment they need.\n  Our police officers, firefighters, emergency management officials, \nand public health officials--those we call first responders and first \npreventers in the fight against terrorism--are struggling to protect us \nfrom unprecedented dangers. Those funds must come from Washington \nbecause this is a national fight, and budgets are tight and getting \ntighter in state and local governments across our Nation. \nUnfortunately, most of my pleas and those of my colleagues--along with \nthose of independent, bipartisan experts and State and local \ngovernments--have fallen on deaf ears within this administration.\n  Senator Dodd has chosen the exact opposite route, and the route we \nurgently need to pursue. His amendment embraces the recommendations of \nthe expert task force of the Council of Foreign Relations. I strongly \nurge support of the amendment offered by my colleague Senator \nDodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have submitted to the manager of the bill \na list of amendments that we have remaining on the bill. This has been \ncleared with Senator Byrd. At any time the majority is ready to enter \nan agreement that there would be only a certain number of amendments in \norder, we are certainly ready to do that.\n  We have one Senator who can't offer an amendment because there is a \nSenator on the other side who is unavailable to do that right now. So \nwe have people ready to offer other amendments. If the Senator from \nMississippi has completed debate on the last amendment, we are ready to \ngo on another amendment within a short period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we appreciate the assistance of the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada. We have tried to find out the number \nof amendments that may remain to be offered to the bill so we can get \nsome idea of what we are looking at in terms of the time we have for \nconsideration. We hope to complete action on this bill later today. I \nam confident we can do that.\n  We still have a number of amendments that have to be offered and \ndealt with. We hope Senators who do have amendments will come to the \nfloor and offer them.\n  In just a couple of minutes, we are going to ask unanimous consent \nthat the list of amendments we know about be the only amendments in \norder to the bill. We have several amendments on that list. Just \nglancing at the list, it looks like about 12 in number at this point. \nWe hope Senators won't call and say they ``may'' have an amendment. If \nthey do have one, they have a right to offer it. We will respect the \nright of any Senator to offer an amendment to the bill.\n  We have considered most of the amendments about which we have heard. \nI am going to ask that Senators\n\n[[Page S9846]]\n\nwho have an amendment let us know about it so we can clear the list on \nboth sides and limit the number of amendments that remain to be offered \nto the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have three amendments. But I do not want \nto vote on my amendments in a stack. For my amendments, I want to have \nthem voted on each after the debate on that particular amendment. I \nthink that is the better way. I think whatever debate we can have on an \namendment--I will say my amendment, and I have three--is fresh in the \nminds of those Senators who have been listening, or those who will \nlisten, who are able to listen in their offices. I don't like stacked \nvotes, as far as any amendments I have are concerned. Stacked votes may \nbe for the convenience of Members, but, in my judgment, we are not here \nnecessarily for the convenience of Members. We are here in this forum \nto debate and to act upon amendments that are in the interests of the \nNation, as we see them.\n  So for the information of the distinguished manager, I do have three \namendments, but I want to call them up whenever I can have votes on \nthem following the debate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Mississippi yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the two sponsors of this amendment and \nthey feel exactly as Senator Byrd does. They have spent all morning \ndebating their amendment, and they are not going to allow us to go to \nanother amendment until we vote on theirs. I suggest we vote on their \namendment. Otherwise, we are not going to go forward on this bill. We \nasked them to come to the floor early this morning. They have been \nhere. The debate has taken more than 2 hours. I think it has been one \nof the finest debates we have had in some time. I join with them, and I \nwill object to proceeding to another amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I say further, if I may, what I have said is \nno reflection on the distinguished manager of the bill. He has been an \nexcellent chairman of this new subcommittee and this is the first time \nwe have appropriated on a full bill for this new Department.\n  The Senator from Mississippi could not have performed better. He has \nbeen very fair with the members of his subcommittee. He has always been \nvery fair with me. What I have said is not to be taken as any \nreflection or criticism of him whatever. His work is trying to get this \nbill passed.\n  As the co-manager, I am interested in moving it along, too. But \nspeaking from a personal viewpoint--and I don't call up many amendments \nof my own--I want to state to the Senator and to all Senators, while \nthey are thinking of stacking votes, I have three amendments that I \ndon't want in a stack. I want to vote on them when we have completed \nour debate. I don't want any 2-minute summation between other \nrollcalls. I think we have fallen into a kind of slipshod way of acting \nin the Senate. This is no fault of the Senator from Mississippi. I am \nvoicing my sentiments with respect to my own amendments. I don't think \nit is a very good way to legislate, to line up six or eight votes. \nSometimes we fall into a vote-arama, where we have a good many \namendments called up, debated, set aside, and voted on later in a \nstack, when those Senators who perhaps listened during the debate have \ngone on to other things and have lost their recollection of what was \nsaid in the debate.\n\n  I think we ought to vote on amendments when we complete the debate. \nPerhaps that is not always practicable. I can understand that, having \nbeen a majority leader and having been a minority leader. I understand \nthe practicalities of these things. But the ideal way to proceed is as \nI have suggested--with debate on an amendment and then a vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I must say that I agree, as a general \nrule, with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the Senator \nfrom Nevada about the way the Senate should transact its business. I \nagree completely.\n  There are situations, such as on the Budget Act, when we are limited \nin the amount of time we have for the consideration of a measure and \nnecessarily we end up with one of these vote-aramas, as the Senator \npoints out.\n  I think, as a general rule, as we consider a bill, after the debate \non the amendment is complete, or whatever the issue is, such as a \nmotion to waive a point of order, we should vote on it. I agree.\n  For that reason, I advise Senators that we are about to have a vote \non the motion to waive by Senator Dodd on the point of order that was \npreviously made to the Dodd amendment. The yeas and nays have been \nordered on the motion to waive.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. If you have clearance on your side, I think it is \nappropriate to propound the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, before we vote, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the following amendments be the only amendments in order to the \nbill, H.R. 2555:\n  Senator Byrd, three amendments; Senator Levin, two amendments; \nSenator Feingold, two amendments; Senator Rockefeller; Senator Reed; \nSenator Schumer, three amendments; Senator Hutchison, two amendments; \nSenator Daschle, two amendments; Senator Sarbanes has an amendment; \nSenator Landrieu, two amendments; Senator Feinstein has an amendment; \nSenator Bayh, two amendments; Senator Collins has an amendment; Senator \nFrist, two amendments; Senator Specter has an amendment; Senator Talent \nhas an amendment; Senator McCain has an amendment; and Senator Warner \nhas an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator to modify that to allow any possible \nmanagers' amendments cleared by both managers.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree to that addition to my unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Is there \nobjection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senators sincerely for \nassisting us in the identification of the outstanding amendments.\n  Mr. President, the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nmotion to waive.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \nmotion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I have conferred with the two managers of \nthe bill. They have agreed that Senator Feinstein will offer the next \namendment. If the two leaders agree, then that amendment would be set \naside and Senator Byrd would offer the next amendment. We will have two \nvotes around 2 o'clock, give or take a little bit. I think all will \nwork out well in that regard. Senator Feinstein is outside the \ncorridor, and she will bring her amendment in within a matter of a few \nminutes. Until she arrives, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, first, I give my thanks to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia for allowing me to offer this \namendment at this time, and also to the distinguished Senator from \nNevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1365\n\n       (Purpose: To prevent and respond to terrorism and crime at \n     or through ports)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. FEINSTEIN], for herself \n     and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 1365.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment \naimed at preventing and punishing a terrorist act at one or another of \nour Nation's 361 seaports. This amendment is a stripped-down version of \nS. 746, the legislation I introduced with Senators Kyl, Chambliss, and \nSchumer.\n  The provisions of this amendment have a de minimis cost.\n  The Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee of Judiciary, both under \nSenator Kyl's leadership and also under my leadership, held some of the \ninitial hearings on port security. Of course, we found very early on \nwhat others have found; that is, our ports are really not equipped to, \nA, handle the challenge of terrorism, and, B, to do so in a way to \nprotect the American people.\n  This legislation builds on amendments made to our laws in the past \nyear but goes further than those changes to ensure the security of our \nseaports.\n  We have found that many of our criminal laws have major loopholes in \nthem and really do not take into consideration crimes that take place \naboard ships.\n  I have shown this amendment to the staff of Senator Hollings. We have \nshown it to Senator McCain. Yesterday, I went through it with Senators \nGrassley and Baucus of the Finance Committee, and none of them \nindicated any objection or problem.\n  Specifically, this amendment would make it a crime for terrorists to \nattack a port, or a cruise ship, or to deploy a weapon of mass \ndestruction at or through a seaport.\n  It would make it a crime to put devices in U.S. waters that can \ndestroy a ship, or cargo, or interfere with safe navigation or maritime \ncommerce.\n  It would update our Federal criminal piracy and privateering laws and \nincrease penalties.\n  It would make it a crime to use a dangerous weapon or explosive to \ntry to kill someone on board a passenger vessel.\n  It would make it a crime to fail to heave to--that is, to slow or \nstop a vessel--at the direction of a Coast Guard or other authorized \nFederal law enforcement official seeking to board that vessel, or to \ninterfere with boarding by such an officer.\n  It would make it a crime to destroy an aid to maritime navigation, \nsuch as a buoy or a shoal breakwater light maintained by the Coast \nGuard if this would endanger the safe navigation of the vessel.\n  It would make it a crime for a terrorist or a criminal to try to \nattack U.S. citizens or U.S. marine life by putting poison in the \nwaters offshore.\n  It would require the Attorney General to issue regulations making it \neasier to determine the extent of crime and terrorism at a seaport, and \nimprove communication between different law enforcement agencies \ninvolved at ports.\n  In addition, this amendment would help improve physical security at \nseaports by ensuring greater coordination.\n  In particular, and most importantly, it would designate the captain \nof the port as the primary authority for seaport security at each port. \nThis would enable all parties involved in business at a port to \nunderstand who has final say on all security matters.\n  The amendment would help ensure that we devote our limited cargo \ninspection resources in the most efficient and effective manner. For \nexample, it would impose deep monetary sanctions for failure to comply \nwith information filing requirements, including filing incorrect \ninformation. The current penalty is only a few thousand dollars.\n  The Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports \nfound that about half of the information on ship manifests is \ninaccurate. Let me repeat that--half of the information on ship \nmanifests is inaccurate. This means that many manifests are sloppily \ndone. We cannot afford that.\n  Finally, the amendment would require Customs to come up with a plan \nto expand its container security initiative and make better use of its \nscarce inspection resources. This would help push U.S. authority beyond \nour Nation's borders and improve our ability to monitor and inspect \ncargo and containers before they arrive near American shores.\n  If a weapon of mass destruction arrives at a U.S. seaport, it is too \nlate.\n  Let me provide a couple of examples of why we need to pass this \nlegislation, and do it fast. Our whole bill is in the Commerce \nCommittee, and Senator McCain has agreed--I think in September--to \nschedule a hearing on the remainder of the bill.\n  But, for purposes of this amendment, what we have done is strip out \nthose sections of our larger bill where we believe, first of all, there \nis not much cost and, second of all, where we believe that it is \nimportant to get started.\n  Today, if a person blows up an airplane, he commits a crime. However, \nif he blows up an oil tanker, he does not commit a crime--unless he is \ndoing it to injure someone with a commercial interest in the vessel.\n  In addition, if a person distributes explosives to a non-U.S. \nnational, he commits a crime. But if the same person sows mines in the \nSan Francisco Harbor, he does not commit a crime.\n  The amendment we offer today will close these loopholes, ensuring \nthat our criminal laws are updated to deal with the current terrorist \nthreat.\n  Currently, our seaports are the gaping hole in our Nation's defense \nagainst terrorism. According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation \nStatistics, 13 million containers--those are 20-foot equivalent units--\ncame into U.S. ports in 2002. However, the Government inspected only \nabout 2 or 3 percent of these containers. The rest were simply waived \nthrough. In addition, in almost every case, these inspections occurred \nafter the containers arrived in the United States.\n\n[[Page S9848]]\n\n  The problem is a single container could contain 60,000 pounds of \nexplosives. That is 10 to 15 times the amount in the Ryder truck used \nto blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. And a single \ncontainer ship can carry as many as 8,000 containers at one time.\n  So containers can and will be easily exploited to detonate a bomb \nthat could destroy a bridge, a seaport, or other critical \ninfrastructure, causing mass destruction and killing thousands.\n  Worse, a suitcase-sized nuclear device or radiological ``dirty bomb'' \ncould also be installed in a container and shipped to the United \nStates. The odds are that the container would never be inspected. And \neven if the container was inspected, it would be too late. The weapon \nwould already be in the United States, most likely near a major \npopulation center.\n  In addition, any attack on or through a seaport could have \ndevastating economic consequences. Excluding trade with Mexico and \nCanada, America's ports handle 95 percent of U.S. trade. Every year, \nour ports handle over 800 million tons of cargo valued at approximately \n$600 billion.\n  In its December 2002 report, the Hart-Rudman Terrorism Tack Force \nsaid something interesting:\n\n       If an explosive device were loaded in a container and set \n     off in a port, it would almost automatically raise concern \n     about the integrity of the 21,000 containers that arrive in \n     U.S. ports each day and the many thousands more that arrive \n     by truck and rail across U.S. land borders. A three-to-four-\n     week closure of U.S. ports would bring the global container \n     industry to its knees. Megaports such as Rotterdam and \n     Singapore would have to close. . . . Trucks, trains, and \n     barges would be stranded outside the terminals with no way to \n     unload their boxes. Boxes bound for the United States would \n     have to be unloaded from their outbound ships. Service \n     contracts would need to be renegotiated. As the system became \n     gridlocked, so would much of global commerce.\n\n  We have worked on this bill with a large number of port people over a \nsubstantial period of time. This has not been quickly put together. I \nthank the Justice Department, the Coast Guard, Customs, the \nTransportation Security Administration, and leaders of ports in my home \nState for their assistance with this legislation.\n  I also thank the working group that helped put our full bill \ntogether. This group includes Dick Steinke, executive director of the \nPort of Long Beach; Rob Quartel, CEO of Freightdesk Technologies; \nCharles Upchurch, president and CEO of SGS Global Trade Solutions; \nJason Clawson, president of JBC International; Stephen Flynn, Senior \nFellow, Council on Foreign Relations; Michael Nacht, dean of the \nGoldman School of Public Policy; Kim Peterson, Executive Director of \nthe Maritime Security Council; and Amanda deBusk, a member of the \nInteragency Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports and \nformer Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement, the Department of \nCommerce.\n  Mr. President, this has been vetted. We have passed it through all of \nthe applicable Federal agencies. We must close these loopholes. We must \ntighten these criminal penalties. We must make one person in charge of \nsecurity at every port so every agency isn't stumbling over the next \nagency there.\n  Senator Kyl has indicated that I speak for him as well. So I hope, \nthe managers of the bill on the floor will be able to accept this \namendment or, at the very least, allow us to vote for it and add it to \nthe bill.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I know he was ahead of \nme in line but he very graciously allowed me to proceed first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under rule XVI \nthat the amendment constitutes general legislation on an appropriations \nmeasure and is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order has been made.\n  The point of order is not debatable. The amendment does constitute \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. The point of order is sustained \nand the amendment falls.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1367\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this week the Senate has considered a number \nof amendments to increase homeland security funding to address known \nvulnerabilities in our Nation. These are vulnerabilities we know are \nthere. We have offered amendments to add funding for expanded homeland \nsecurity missions that have been authorized by Congress and signed into \nlaw by the President since 9/11.\n  I believe these amendments have been defeated not on the merits but \nbecause their adoption would have resulted in the bill exceeding limits \nestablished in the budget resolution. These are meritorious amendments, \nand I am confident some of the Senators who voted against them voted \nagainst them because the bill would then exceed limits established in \nthe budget resolution. That is a compelling reason for many to \nconsider.\n  Therefore, today I offer an amendment that addresses these known \nvulnerabilities to the extent possible within the limits of our 302(b) \nallocation. I do so because the vulnerabilities are documented and the \nneeds are clear.\n  This bill includes $823 million, consistent with the President's \nrequest for information, analysis, and infrastructure protection. Since \nFebruary, we have asked--now listen--the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to identify for us what specific infrastructure in this \ncountry is most vulnerable.\n  To whom should we go to find out the answers, if not the Department \nof Homeland Security? That is the Department which should be able to \npinpoint, should be able to give to the Congress, a list of the most \nvulnerable infrastructure and give us the priorities: Which is more \nvulnerable, A or B or C? That is the agency that ought to be able to \nanswer the questions.\n  Have we gotten any answer to our questions? No, no answer. This is \nthe Department that should be held accountable and will be held \naccountable, and the Department has not responded.\n  We have asked these questions more than once. So I shall offer an \namendment that addresses these known vulnerabilities, to the extent \npossible, within the limits of our 302(b) allocation, and I do so \nbecause the vulnerabilities are documented and the needs are clear.\n  This bill includes $823 million, consistent with the President's \nrequest for information, analysis, and infrastructure protection. Since \nFebruary--let me say that again--since February, we have asked the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to identify for us in the Congress, in \nthe Senate, what specific critical infrastructure in this country is \nmost vulnerable.\n  To date, the Department has provided no detail about how these funds \nwould be spent--no detail, none. We requested it, as I say, as early as \nFebruary and since February.\n\n  The President is asking us to buy a pig in a poke. The administration \nwants us to give them $823 million of the taxpayers' money and they \nhave not told Congress how the funds will be spent or whether these \nfunds can be used effectively. Now why wouldn't they tell us? Why \nwouldn't they tell us?\n  What we do know is that the Coast Guard has over $1.7 billion of \npending applications for port security grants in order to secure our \nmost vulnerable ports. We know that. What we do know is that the Coast \nGuard has estimated\n\n[[Page S9849]]\n\nthe cost of the ports implementing the Maritime Transportation Security \nAct security standards is $5.4 billion over 10 years and $1.1 billion \nin the first year. So when you add the funds in this bill to previously \nappropriated funds, the Department would have only $518 million to help \nthe ports improve their security.\n  What we do know is that the Department of Homeland Security received \napplications from over 20,000 of the Nation's local fire departments, \ntotaling $2.5 billion out of their desire to equip and to train \nthemselves to deal with weapons of mass destruction and to improve \ntheir capacity to respond to other emergencies in their communities.\n  What we do know is that only 10 percent of our fire departments have \nthe capacity to deal with a major building collapse. What we do know is \nthat only 13 percent have the equipment and training to deal with \nbiological or chemical terrorist attacks.\n  What we do know is that the Coast Guard commandant has testified that \nthere is no funding in the budget for the Coast Guard to enforce the \nnew port security standards that are mandated by the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act and that the Coast Guard imposed on the \nport industry on July 1.\n  What we do know is that the General Accounting Office has concluded \nthat 123 chemical facilities across the country--some of them in the \ngreat Kanawha Valley in West Virginia--has concluded that 123 chemical \nfacilities across the country, if attacked, could inflict serious \ndamage and expose millions of people to toxic chemicals and gasses. \nThere are 3,000 chemical facilities in 49 States that if attacked could \naffect more than 10,000 people each. This is serious business. The \nGeneral Accounting Office found that the Federal Government has not \ncomprehensively assessed the chemical industry's vulnerabilities to \nterrorist attack.\n  This amendment would address those issues by providing $100 million \nfor port security grants, $100 million for grants to fire departments, \n$42 million for the Coast Guard to implement the port security \nrequirements of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, and $50 \nmillion for chemical security vulnerability assessment.\n  This amendment is fully offset for both budget authority and outlays \nby reducing amounts in the infrastructure account by $292 million.\n  I say again that the amendment has fully offset both the budget \nauthority and outlays by reducing amounts in the infrastructure account \nby $292 million. Even after this reduction, the infrastructure account \nwill have a funding level which is three times the level from fiscal \nyear 2003.\n  I urge the Senate adopt the amendment. The Senate should address \nthese known vulnerabilities now.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The current amendment will be set aside and \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1367.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 785, line 6, insert the following:\n\n            TITLE VII--FULFILLING HOMELAND SECURITY PROMISES\n\n  Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security\n\n   Transportaiton Security Administration Maritime and Land Security\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Maritime and Land \n     Security'', $100,000,000, to remain available until September \n     30, 2005, for port security grants, which shall be \n     distributed under the same terms and conditions as provided \n     under Public Law 107-117.\n\n                       United States Coast Guard\n\n\n                           operating expenses\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Operating Expenses'', \n     $42,000,000, to remain available until December 31, 2004, \n     shall be for costs pursuant to Public Law 107-295 for \n     implementing the Maritime Transportation Security Act \n     including those costs associated with the review of vessel \n     and facility security plans and the development of area \n     security plans.\n\n                    Office for Domestic Preparedness\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Firefighter Assistance \n     Grants,'' $100,000,000, to remain available through September \n     30, 2005, for programs authorized by section 33 of the \n     Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. \n     2201 et seq.)\n\n      Office of the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and \n                       Infrastructure Protection\n\n       Of the amounts made available for the ``Office of the Under \n     Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure \n     Protection'', $50,000,000, to remain available until \n     September 30, 2005, shall be for chemical facility security \n     assessments.\n\n      Office of the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and \n                       Infrastructure Protection\n\n       On page 66, line 9, strike ``$823,700,000,'' and insert \n     ``$581,700,000,''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my intention to review the \namendment, and when I have had an opportunity to reread it, I will be \nin a better position to respond to it.\n  I am very hopeful the funding in this bill will enable the Secretary \nof the Department of Homeland Security and the heads of the various \ndirectorates and the other agencies that are funded in this bill--the \nCoast Guard and others--to carry out their responsibilities to improve \nthe overall security of our homeland to protect against terrorist \nattacks, to try to anticipate terrorists attacks, and to recover from \nnatural disasters.\n  We have within this Department a wide range of functions and \nresponsibilities, one of which has been identified in this amendment \nas, I suppose, being funded at too high a level because the offset that \nis contained is to take funds from one of these directorates and move \nit to the function of port security.\n  It is a very difficult challenge to try to balance the competing \ninterests within this Department to make sure each area is not only \nwell staffed with people who know what they are doing, but that they \nhave the funds to carry out their mission.\n  The directorate that suffers if this amendment is adopted is the one \nwho helps bring together the intelligence information to assess the \nvulnerabilities of various critical infrastructure areas such as \nchemical facilities identified by the Senator from West Virginia. If \nthat money is taken away, it will be less likely they can carry out \ntheir mission in the way we would all hope they could.\n  This is a very important area of activity for the Department of \nHomeland Security. It is an area that, if limited in the way proposed \nby this amendment, would reduce the capacity to obtain intelligence or \nwarnings and to carry out the threat analysis functions that are the \nresponsibility of this directorate, and $292 million would be taken \nfrom the directorate responsible for information analysis and \ninfrastructure protection.\n  That is 35 percent of the funds that are made available in the bill \nfor this directorate. This is a drastic cut. It is a meat-ax approach \nto one directorate, to shift funds to another area that we all \nrecognize is in need of funding, but it already is funded. It is funded \nat a level that, in the judgment of our committee, would help ensure \nthat our ports are protected, that we are able to defend against not \nonly terrorist attacks but any other activity that would threaten or \nundermine the security interests of the United States.\n  Just this week, an article was carried by the Washington Post talking \nabout inadequacies of the new intelligence unit at the Department of \nHomeland Security and talking about the challenges it faced. I read the \narticle and am familiar with some of the charges made in the article. \nBut the conclusion was that they were not able to compete with the CIA, \nthe FBI, the other established intelligence-gathering agencies because \nthey were having a hard time attracting competent people and getting \nthe number of analysts they ought to have in this Department to carry \nout their responsibilities. It pointed out, for example, that the \nintelligence analysts don't have the computers they need that are \ncapable of receiving classified, top secret and above, documents.\n  If this amendment is adopted, it is going to make it even more \ndifficult. I can't imagine their being able to sustain the workforce \nthey have. People they tried to recruit to come aboard this Department \nand help deal with these new challenges may have to be\n\n[[Page S9850]]\n\ndismissed. The ability of the Department to perform assessments of \ncritical infrastructure--drinking water supply systems, chemical \nfacilities, as I mentioned--and other areas where large numbers of \npeople may gather from time to time; arenas, stadium crowds, baseball \nparks, and the Nation's seaports are just some that come to mind.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will reject this amendment. It is clear \nto me that there are a lot of Senators who would like to increase the \nfunding available for port security grants. If you are going to award a \ngrant to a port, you have to be able to evaluate the security needs of \nthese ports. All the ports in the United States are filing \napplications. There is a backlog of applications. One of the reasons \nfor the backlog, in terms of assessing and approving and selecting the \nones to be funded, is lack of personnel to do the job.\n  It seems to me this amendment seeks to improve port security but at \nthe same time take away money that would be used to assess which ports \nare in greater need, where should the grant money go, which ones of the \napplications have the highest merit. You have to have people to do \nthat. This amendment takes away money for the people to make those \nassessments.\n  Also affected by the offset would be the National Communications \nSystem, which would be cut deeply if this amendment were accepted. The \npriority telecommunications programs would not be able to be \nimplemented, programs which allow high-ranking officials to be able to \nuse cellular telecommunications in the event of a terrorist attack or \nother catastrophic event. This was a major problem on September 11. We \ntalked about the breakdown in communications. One agency could not \ncommunicate with the other. This has been a problem nationwide. The \nadoption of this amendment would exacerbate that problem.\n  I think the amendment, while I know the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia is deeply concerned about the port security issue, would \nundermine one of the most important activities and cripple an already \ntight budget situation, make it more difficult for our intelligence \nunits to function effectively in the Department of Homeland Security.\n  At the appropriate time, it is my intention to move to table the \namendment of the Senator from West Virginia, but I do not intend to \nmake that motion until other Senators who may wish to be heard on the \namendment have a chance to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1318 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nwithdraw amendment No. 1318.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1367\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi \nuses an old phrase that I cut my teeth on when I worked in a meat shop \nback in the coal camps during the Great Depression. He speaks about \nthis ``meat-ax'' approach--meat-ax. Meat-ax, my foot. Is this \nadministration serious or is it not serious about homeland security? Is \nit serious or is it not serious? We have heard all this talk--or is it \nmere talk? Is it just rhetoric? Is it rhetoric without resources?\n  Let me say again, Congress, the Senate, has asked the administration, \nthe Department of Homeland Security, for a list of its vulnerabilities. \nHow would it spend the $823 million? We say to the Secretary of \nHomeland Security: How are you going to expend the moneys? What are the \nvulnerabilities? Tell us. The moneys have been sitting there unspent \nfor how long? Ten months? What are the vulnerabilities? Tell us. We are \nthe elected representatives of the people. The Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security wasn't elected by anybody to the \ncurrent position he holds.\n  I have great respect for former Governor Ridge, but what are the \nvulnerabilities? Let us see your list. To date, no list. The Department \nhas not responded. So we say: If you have $823 million sitting there, \nand we know that this Nation and its people cry out for security, we \nhear about al-Qaida being here and there, and about its being in Iran \nand about all the threats, the level of threats, we know about the code \norange and code yellow and the code red--but no list. Where is the \nlist?\n\n  I think we have a right to say if you are not going to show us a \nlist, we know there are vulnerabilities, and we propose to spend some \nmoney to meet those needs. The American people are busy. Those who have \njobs are busy trying to put a little bread and butter on the table. \nThey cannot read all of the news stories about budgetary problems and \n302(b) allocations. They depend on us in the Senate. They depend on the \nSenator from Mississippi. They are depending on the Senator from West \nVirginia. They depend on the Senator from Kentucky who presides over \nthe Senate at the moment. They depend on the Senator from New York and \nthe Senator from Vermont. They think we ought to know.\n  They think the Department of Homeland Security, which has been handed \nthese responsibilities by the Congress, is taking care of everything. \nThey think the Department is on top of the problem.\n  They believe their homes are secure and their schools are secure. \nThey believe the vulnerabilities that have been talked about are being \ntaken care of.\n  The American people go to their jobs every day and work hard. They \nreturn home in the evenings and read the newspapers. They watch the \ntelevision news and talk with their families over the supper table. We \nstill call it supper in West Virginia. They think all that is taken \ncare of. Many of them rest easy because they think we are on the job, \nthat we will do the job for them, and that we are looking out for them. \nWe are not looking out for them.\n  I say to you the Department will not respond to the Congress. Of \ncourse, it is not a surprise to me anymore because this administration \nlooks upon the Congress with contempt--at least that is my perception--\nwith utter disdain. Those peons up there, they want to know what the \nvulnerabilities are. We will tell them when we get ready.\n  Senator Stevens and I, upon more than one occasion in times gone by, \nhave sought to add moneys to appropriations bills to meet the needs of \nthe defense of this Nation and homeland security. The administration, \nwith some apparent contempt, wrote us back on more than one occasion \nthat the administration has everything well in hand. They don't need \nthe extra moneys that you are wanting to provide. The administration is \nnot ready for that. We will let you know. We on Mount Olympus from our \nethereal atmosphere will one day let you know how much money we need, \nbut not now.\n  That is the contemptuous attitude some of those people downtown have. \nIt is pretty clear from their letters and from the way they spurn the \nCongress and turn the back of their hand to the Congress.\n  I say the American people ought not be misled. But they are being \nmisled if they perceive and believe they are being protected, that we \nare on top of everything, and that the administration has its act \ntogether. They are wrong.\n  Here is an amendment that would address the known vulnerabilities to \nthe extent possible.\n  I don't believe the American people ought to be misled. They ought to \nhave a right to believe that we are attending to the gaps in their \nsecurity.\n  The distinguished Senator from Mississippi speaks about this $823 \nmillion that is there, and if we do this little amendment we will be in \nessence robbing the account or taking away from account moneys that the \nDepartment knows better how to spend. Even with the reduction in this \namendment, the account is tripled over the fiscal year 2003 level.\n\n  The chairman has called this amendment a meat-ax cut--meat ax. I bear \na scar on my left thumb today put there by a meat ax. I know what a \nmeat-ax cut is. A meat-ax cut in spending. Yes. The account would grow \nfrom approximately $180 million to $582 million. I don't see this as a \nmeat ax cut. I don't see this as a cut.\n  Securing our ports is important to our infrastructure by any \ndefinition. It is important to our infrastructure. How could we better \nspend that money? The money is lying there. It is not being spent. And \nthe Department won't even tell us in the Senate what\n\n[[Page S9851]]\n\nthe priorities are, and how they would suggest those moneys be spent.\n  This amendment defines the infrastructure investments that we know \nabout and know must be made.\n  I hope Senators will support this amendment.\n  There is nothing political about this amendment. The money has been \nappropriated for infrastructure. The Department in charge of the \nexpenditures of this money won't tell the Congress how the money should \nbe spent or what the priorities are or how the Department sees those \npriorities or how the Department intends to spend the money or how the \nDepartment would propose this money be spent or what the \nvulnerabilities are. The Department won't tell us that.\n  What are we to do? The American people think they are being secured. \nThey are not.\n  I hope Senators will support this amendment and spend the money where \nit will do the most good--on where we know there are vulnerabilities to \nthe Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the good government amendments that my colleague, Senator \nByrd, shall be offering later today. The public is looking to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to ensure that our country is prepared \nto the best of its ability for any future terrorist attack.\n  What must the public think when they see individuals who recently \nworked for Secretary Ridge turning around and lobbying for a specific \nspecial interest? What do they think when individuals who run companies \ncompeting for government contracts from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity are appointed to a special advisory council to that same \nDepartment?\n  These events may not be hindering our preparations against another \nterrorist attack, but they surely raise an appearance of am \nimpropriety.\n  To ensure that the public has full confidence in the Department of \nHomeland Security and the actions that are taken to prepare the \ncountry, the Senate should pass these important amendments.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Byrd, for raising these important \nissues. I urge my colleagues to support these good government \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I move to table the Byrd amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Senators Specter and Schumer are now going to offer an \namendment. They have agreed to take 30 minutes for the two of them. I \nask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour of debate evenly divided \nbetween the proponents and opponents of this amendment; that there be \nno second-degree amendments in order prior to any vote on or in \nrelation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1368\n\n (Purpose: To increase the funding for discretionary grants for use in \n                        high-threat urban areas)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Schumer, Senator Warner, Senator Clinton, Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Corzine, Senator Kennedy, Senator Murray, Senator Lautenberg, \nand myself and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mr. Schumer, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Corzine, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1368.\n       On page 58, line 6, strike ``$2,888,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,138,000,000''.\n       On page 59, line 1, strike ``$750,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,000,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nincrease the funding for high threat urban areas from $750 million to \n$1 billion for fiscal year 2004 of the Homeland Security bill. It is \nwell known that the threat of terrorism is with us on a daily basis, \nand it is our hope that another terrorist attack such as the one on \nSeptember 11, 2001 can be avoided.\n  Our intelligence agencies are working at a high pitch to try to avoid \nsuch a terrorist attack, but we know it is relatively easy to \ninfiltrate our borders, that we have vast areas where we are accessible \nfrom the sea, land, and air, and that it is possible to bring in \nexplosives and dangerous items by way of bioterrorism or explosives.\n  There is no doubt that the high-risk areas, urban areas, are more \nsusceptible for these kinds of attacks because they pose a target where \nterrorists could reach a large number of people, evidenced by September \n11 when the Trade Towers were attacked, going after thousands of \npeople, the plane that went into the Pentagon, and the plane which was \nmost likely headed for the Capitol, doing a maximum amount of damage.\n  It is obviously necessary to be as prepared as we can be within \nreason, and in order to avoid having the terrorists win, we have to set \na goal of concern but not being terrified, and a way not to be \nterrified is to be prepared--hopefully, adequately prepared.\n  Candidly, it is very difficult to make a determination factually as \nto how much money is adequate. Is $50 million adequate or is $1 billion \nadequate? Nobody can say with absolute certainty. But we believe this \nis a relatively modest increase in the appropriations for high-risk \nareas and that it is well warranted by the facts.\n  Earlier today, Senator Santorum and I traveled with President Bush to \nPhiladelphia where he spoke. His path is illustrative of the kinds of \nspecial risks that are present in an urban area such as the city of \nPhiladelphia. First,\n\n[[Page S9852]]\n\nwe landed at the airport, which is a natural target. Next, we went \nalong the highways, another target. Then we traveled over an enormous \nbridge spanning the Schuylkill River, then along the seaport.\n  At every step of the way, we were looking at high-risk areas, and the \nnumber of policemen and security personnel, in addition to the Secret \nService and Federal personnel, was very substantial.\n  In addition to the kinds of areas traversed by the President--the \nairport, the bridges, the seaport, and the highways--the major urban \nareas have subways, tunnels, and railyards, all of which exposes them \nto greater risks.\n  It is not only the major cities, the urban areas, which have the high \nrisks but there is risk really all across America. No one knows if the \nterrorists will strike again, where the terrorists will strike again, \nwhen the terrorists will strike again, but we have to be prepared.\n  During the July recess, I made it a point to travel through 14 \nPennsylvania counties and visit first responders. I went to the city of \nPittsburgh--a big city, obviously--to take a look at what was being \ndone there, to take a look at the paraphernalia, the clothes worn by \nthe firefighters as first responders. They are very expensive. I looked \nat the mechanical units that detect anthrax in the air, that detect \nbioterrorism substances in the area.\n  I went to a series of small towns, including the Indiana Volunteer \nFire Association. I went to the Oil City Fire Department. In the \nsmaller communities there is great concern. They are worried a \nterrorist attack on a small community would alarm smaller communities \nall over the country. Whereas smaller communities might feel it is the \nbig cities that are the first lines, perhaps it will be the smaller \ncommunities.\n  The funds are distributed to the smaller communities from the States. \nIf there is an increase in funding for a State such as Pennsylvania, \nNew York, New Jersey, or Maryland, for the high-risk areas, there will \nobviously be more funds available for smaller communities. The big \ncities are being called upon to spend a great deal of money when the \nthreat line is elevated.\n  In fiscal year 2002, the city of Philadelphia spent $21.2 million on \nincreased domestic security costs overtime by the police, fire, and \npublic health employees associated with rapid assessment teams. This \nyear, from February 7 to February 20, the threat level was increased \nfrom yellow to orange in the city of Philadelphia, costing an \nadditional $1.3 million during that 2-week period alone for domestic \nprotection.\n  The city of Pittsburgh has also had to bear the costs of increased \nprotection resulting from September 11. In fiscal year 2002, the \nPittsburgh Department of Public Safety spent almost $7 million for \nadditional protection. I visited the Allegheny County Threat Center and \nthe first responders in Pittsburgh. The money spent so far is clearly \ninsufficient. I repeat, no one knows exactly what the costs would be to \nmake it sufficient, but there would be some reassurance in the high-\nrisk areas and also in the balance of the country where the smaller \ncommunities will get increased funding as a result of a special \nallocation to the high-risk areas which would enable State governments \nto allocate more to the smaller communities with this additional \nallocation, with this additional appropriation.\n  Other urban areas are similarly affected. For example, the increased \npolice protection in New York City costs approximately $5 million a \nmonth; protection at the United Nations costs in the range of $8 \nmillion a month. This is just a thumbnail sketch. It could be amplified \nwith every city, every urban area, every high-risk area in the country.\n  It is our submission in putting forward this amendment that this is a \nmodest additional protection on a very serious threat which confronts \nour Nation today.\n  How much time remains for the proponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask for 8 minutes from my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is given 8 minutes \nfrom the proponents' time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor sponsoring this legislation along with me, Senator Warner, Senator \nClinton, and others. It is vital legislation.\n  In general, we have to make homeland security as large a national \npriority as security overseas. I have been supportive of the President \nin fighting the war on terror overseas, but I do not think we are doing \nenough at home. I have had a series of amendments in that regard. This \namendment may be the most important of all amendments.\n  Senator Specter laid this out quite well. We have certain areas that \nhave high needs in terms of the threat to them. To take all the money \nin an airplane and let it gradually disperse itself all over the United \nStates would not make sense.\n  My city of New York has tremendous problems. I live near the Brooklyn \nBridge. That is, obviously, a target. Our city has two police officers \nat each end of that bridge 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We could not \ndo less given the great needs of security. Just figure that out. Four \nofficers to fill a 24-hour a day, 7-day-a week shift. That is 20 just \nfor that bridge. Multiply it by the multiplicity of bridges, tunnels, \nthe airports and high buildings, and New York City is spending a \ntremendous amount on security.\n  It is not just cities such as New York. Buffalo, at the other end of \nmy State, is one of the 30 cities wisely included in the high needs \nformula last time by the Homeland Security Department.\n  Buffalo has a border with Canada, with bridges. They found a \nterrorist cell in Lackawanna, a city on the border with Canada. All the \ncommerce with Canada creates special needs.\n  Our amendment says: Let everyone get a certain amount of money. \nEveryone has a police department and a fire department. But understand \nthat there are certain areas that have high threat. We ought to do \nsomething for them.\n  This is a modest amendment. First, it only raises the high-needs area \n$250 million to $1 billion. Second--and I underscore this to my \ncolleagues because I have been asked--this does not have an offset. It \ndoes not take money away from the smaller States, smaller cities. The \ntheory behind this amendment is we need to do more for our police and \nour fire and our first responders. Therefore, we are not robbing Peter \nto pay Paul. We are, rather, saying let the high-needs areas, the high-\nthreat areas, be funded.\n  Secretary Ridge, former Office of Management and Budget Chair \nDaniels, and, in conversations on the phone, present OMB Chair Bolton \nhave all agreed we should improve the formula. We should make it better \nto correspond with high-threat areas. This amendment tries to do that \nby adding some money into the area that, in my opinion, this bill has \nmost underfunded: High threat.\n  I remind my colleagues of one other point. Last year, we allocated \n$800 million to high threat. The needs are greater. We should be going \nup. The House allocated $500 million in their bill. If we go to \nconference with only the $750 million in the mark, we are virtually \ncertain to go backward in terms of the money that high-threat areas \nneed and that high-threat areas deserve.\n  I quote from a well-received report from the Council on Foreign \nRelations, chaired by a former colleague, Warren Rudman. The Council \nhas estimated: The Federal, State, and local spending for homeland \nsecurity should increase by $19.7 billion a year for the next 5 years \nand more targeted to the areas where the threats are.\n  If they think we need $19.7 billion more and we are only increasing \nthis by $250 million, it shows the modesty of the request compared to \nthe actual need.\n  To come out of conference and cut money to high-threat areas would be \njust what many feared in the wake of September 11: that we were getting \ncomplacent; that we are going back to the pre-September 11 days; that \nbecause nothing has happened in the last year, year and a half, we can \nrelax.\n  The conditions that cause terrorism, the idea that small groups of \npeople\n\n[[Page S9853]]\n\ncan use technology to do us terrible damage is with us as much today as \nit was on 9/10/2001. The good news is we can do things to stop it. We \ncan do them at the Federal level, and we can do them at the local \nlevel. But this does cost money.\n  Money is dear. Obviously, with the deficit we have and other \nproblems, it is dear. But life is even dearer. This is one area where \nnobody disputes that the Federal Government has the lead role. This is \nnot something the private sector can do on its own. It is not something \nthe States and localities can do on their own.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. Again, it doesn't \ntake money from anything else. It does raise the overall amount by a \nmodest $250 million but probably in the area of the budget that is \nleast funded. Even the mark done by the chairman has less money for \nhigh-threat areas than we actually allocated last year.\n  I yield the floor and return the remainder of my time back to my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, but I hope we will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I make a point of order under section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act that the amendment provides funding in excess \nof the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order \npursuant to the applicable provisions of law.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is given 5 \nminutes of the proponents' time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, two weeks ago, when Defense Secretary \nDonald Rumsfeld testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nhe told us that the current cost of maintaining our troops in Iraq is \n$3.9 billion a month almost $1 billion a week.\n  The administration is prepared to meet that financial burden, even as \nthe American people are beginning to question the future direction of \nthe President's Iraq policies. Hopefully, the death of Saddam's sons \nwill reduce the intensity of the guerilla war being waged against our \ntroops. Hopefully, the administration will finally seek the support of \nthe United Nations and NATO to ease the burden on our troops.\n  We all agree that when it comes to homeland security, there is no \ndebate. Americans want our cities and our neighborhoods to be safe from \nterrorists, and the expect their government to do what is needed to \naccomplish that task.\n  Yet, while we are spending $3.9 billion each month in Iraq, this \nlegislation includes only $3.9 billion for the entire year for first \nresponders here at home--for the police and firefighters and emergency \npersonnel who are the first line of defense against terrorism in our \ncommunities.\n  Perhaps the fact that we are spending more in Iraq each month than we \nare in the United States on our first responders would only be an odd \ncoincidence if we were certain that we were doing all we can here at \nhome. Unfortunately, all the available evidence suggests otherwise.\n  Just last month, the Council on Foreign Relation's Independent Task \nForce issued a report entitled ``Emergency Responders: Drastically \nUnderfunded, Dangerously Unprepared,'' and it points a very stark \npicture.\n  According to the report, America faces a $98 billion shortfall in \nfirst responder funding over the next 5 years and only 10 percent of \nfire departments across the country have the personnel, training, and \nequipment to respond to a building collapse. The report also asserts \nthat American cities with between 250,000 and 500,000 residents have \nexperienced a net 16 percent reduction in police personnel over the \npast 2 years.\n  Since September 11th, mid-size American cities have had to reduce \npolice staffing by 16 percent. These figures are unacceptable, and they \nare getting worse.\n  And yet, time and time again during this debate, we have stood here \nand offered amendments to increase federal funding to help \nmunicipalities and public agencies with these new homeland security \nresponsibilities. But the White House has put its foot down each time, \nand demanded that our colleagues on the other side oppose this badly \nneeded funding.\n  Just this week we've offered eight critically important homeland \nsecurity funding amendments, each of which has been voted down with \nlittle consternation about the magnitude of our pressing homeland \nsecurity needs. Each was rejected on the basis of budgetary concerns, \nand with the belief that we are doing all we can. But clearly we are \nnot.\n  We have offered amendments like Senator Byrd's to add $1.8 billion \nthis year for a broad array of homeland security needs such as port \nsecurity, air cargo security, energy security, and transportation \nsecurity. It was rejected.\n  We have offered amendments like Senator Mikulski's to add $150 \nmillion to fully fund the firefighters grant programs. It was rejected.\n  We have offered amendments like Senator Murray's to add $100 million \nto the National Emergency Management Performance Grants program, which \nhelps states develop and implement comprehensive security and emergency \nresponse plans. It was rejected.\n  We have offered amendments like Senator Hollings' to add $300 million \nto fund essential port security programs. It too was rejected, even \nthough the security of our nation's ports is widely considered the most \nglaring vulnerability in our Nation's efforts to prevent terrorist \nattacks.\n  And finally, we have offered amendments like Senator Dodd's that \nwould fund homeland security needs by reducing the recent tax cuts for \nmillionaires. It wasn't even close.\n  Prudence would dictate that we pause and make absolutely sure that we \nare doing everything possible to provide for homeland security, and not \nsimply continue to vote down these amendments because the \nadministration doesn't want Federal spending to increase.\n  And we still have several more opportunities to do just that.\n  I strongly support the amendment offered by Senator Schumer and \nSenator Specter, because it is one such opportunity to make sure that \nour high-threat urban areas receive the assistance they so desperately \nneed. This amendment would add $250 million to protect our largest \ncities, which face particularly daunting security challenges.\n  My own city of Boston feels this pressure immensely and feels it \nacutely. Boston is the regional economic engine of New England, and the \ncenter of the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the country.\n  Boston is also home to the Nation's oldest subway system, several \nunderground highway tunnels, a bustling cargo port, and the only urban \nliquified natural gas facility in the country.\n  In short, protecting these pieces of critical infrastructure is a \ntask too herculean for the city to handle on its own, especially in the \ncurrent budget climate. It is also a Federal responsibility.\n  Additionally, as an international city, Boston is home to over 36 \nforeign embassies and tens of thousands of international students. It \nattracts more than 10 million visitors a year from all over the world, \nwho come to learn about this ``cradle of liberty,'' where the American \nRevolution began.\n  That history, and the numerous public monuments and structures that \nrecall it, make Boston a powerful symbol of the American struggle for \nfreedom, democracy, and liberty. Unfortunately, that symbolism also \nmakes Boston an attractive target.\n  Finally, Boston is home to the Nation's mutual fund industry, the \nlargest concentration of the world's leading hospitals, and more \ninstitutions of higher learning than any other city in the United \nStates. An incident involving Boston would most certainly cripple the \nnation's economy and dismantle the Nation's health care network.\n  I am grateful that Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge has \nrecognized Boston's unique needs and designated it as a high-threat \nurban area, and I also greatly appreciate that he recently visited \nBoston to see first-hand the challenges confronting Mayor Menino.\n  But while this assistance is welcome, it is simply not enough--in the \nface of massive municipal and State budget cutbacks--to meet Boston's \nextraordinary needs, which are only going to\n\n[[Page S9854]]\n\nbecome more severe during next year's political convention when some \n35,000 delegates, journalists, and visitors come to town.\n  Mr. President, we have voted down a great many important homeland \nsecurity funding amendments in the past three days, and we are not \ndoing all we can to protect the American people at home.\n  We have a $98 billion shortfall for first responders, at the same \ntime we have approved a trillion in tax cuts for mostly millionaires \nand at the same time we are sending $3.9 billion each month to Iraq. We \nneed to reassess our priorities, and this amendment provides us with \none more chance to do that before this debate concludes.\n  Mr. President, the 9/11 Commission released its report today, the \n``Joint Inquiry, Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the \nTerrorist Attacks of September 11.'' It is full, full of the missed \nopportunities that endangered the security of American lives. It \ncatalogues missed opportunity after missed opportunity that contributed \nto the suffering of the 177 Massachusetts families that lost loved ones \non that horrible day and thousands of other families across the \ncountry.\n  The best answer we can have in response to this report that was made \navailable to the American people today is to make sure we are going to \nprovide the kind of support for homeland security that this amendment \nprovides.\n  I hope this Senate will accept the Schumer-Specter amendment because \nit is an important downpayment for the security of our most vulnerable \nAmerican cities. If we are really interested in learning the lessons of \nthis report today, we will make sure that the necessary resources are \nprovided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who yields time to the \nSenator from New York?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from New \nYork wish?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 11.5 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor this time to speak and I also thank him for cosponsoring this \namendment along with my colleagues Senator Schumer, Senator Warner, and \nmyself.\n  This money is critically important for high-threat urban areas. It is \nalso money that the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \nhas already made clear is needed in order to address the vulnerability \nand threat and other intelligence information that comes in on an \nhourly basis, not only to the Department of Homeland Security but to \nall of our intelligence agencies.\n  The Secretary and the Department have identified so many communities \nas high threat during the past few months that it is a little bit \ndaunting. But I agree with that assessment because, whether it is a \nlarge city such as New York City, or a small community such as \nLackawanna, we have threats from one part of our country to the next.\n  Indeed, just last month Attorney General Ashcroft unsealed an \nindictment against a 34-year-old Ohio truck driver who plotted with al-\nQaida to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge. What more impressive symbol of \nNew York and America could you imagine than the Brooklyn Bridge, that \ngateway bridge that connects Manhattan and Brooklyn, which is traveled \nover by thousands and thousands of pedestrians and motor vehicles every \nsingle day. Faris pled guilty to delivering cash, cell phones, plane \ntickets, and sleeping bags to al-Qaida leaders. We learned that he, \nworking with terrorists, was planning to sever the Brooklyn Bridge's \nsuspension cables.\n  After getting close enough to the bridge to conduct surveillance, \nFaris decided to call off the terrorist attack because of the tight \nsecurity on and around the bridge, provided by the NYPD.\n  I am absolutely proud and confident in the activities of the NYPD. \nThere is not a better police force anywhere in the world than the New \nYork Police Department. They have been vigilant, providing the kind of \nsecurity that is needed. But the NYPD's Operation Atlas that provided \nthat security costs New York up to $700,000 a day.\n  Some people might say that is a lot of money. Yes, it is a lot of \nmoney. But compared to destroying the Brooklyn Bridge it is nothing. \nAnd the fact that the NYPD was on the job, there every single day, \nscaring off terrorist scouts like this man from Ohio, saved how many \nlives? We have no way of calculating.\n  In a guilty plea, Faris also admitted to conspiring to pinpoint \ntargets for simultaneous terrorist attacks on New York City and \nWashington.\n  This indictment was unsealed. His surveillance was conducted, not on \nSeptember 12, 2001, but in recent months. These threats have not gone \naway, and we need to make sure we do everything possible to provide \nmore funding to high-threat urban areas.\n  Unfortunately, the threat of acts of terrorism against our great \ncountry and Americans is real. And it is especially so with respect to \nhigh-threat urban areas like New York, like Buffalo, like Washington, \nand many communities across the United States.\n  That's the kind of threat we are talking about, the resources the \nNYPD used in Operation Atlas are the kind of resources that are needed \nto thwart a terrorist threat.\n  The NYPD's outstanding efforts also demonstrate how being prepared \ncan not only help our first responders and communities be prepared to \nrespond to a terrorist attack, but, equally and arguably even more \nimportant, it unequivocally demonstrates how being prepared--and how \nthe terrorists knowing we are prepared--serves to deter or prevent a \nterrorist attack.\n  Back in January, I gave a speech at the John Jay College of Criminal \nJustice in New York City to talk about how our country needed to renew \nits commitment to strengthen our domestic defense.\n  I also released a report that showed how 70 percent of New York \ncities and counties had not received any Federal homeland security \nfunding since September 11, underscoring the need for direct funding.\n  In that speech, I talked about the need to provide extra homeland \nsecurity attention to the most vulnerable communities in our country, \nplaces that are more appealing to terrorists as targets because, for \nexample, of the American values they represent or because they are \ndensely populated.\n  After hearing more and more about the particular needs of high-threat \nurban areas across the country, back in early March, I proposed the \nidea of a Domestic Defense Fund, which had three components: $5 billion \nin direct funding for local communities and States; a $1 billion \nemergency reserve fund that Secretary Ridge could draw down from to \nreimburse cities and States in times of heightened threat, or in the \nevent of a high-profile terrorist trial, discovery of a terrorist cell, \nor similar emergency need; and $1 billion for high-threat urban areas \nbecause, at the time, only $100 million, and more was needed.\n  Later than month, I offered an amendment to the budget resolution \nthat would have provided for funding for the Domestic Defense Fund, \nincluding $1 billion for high-threat urban areas, for Fiscal Year 2003. \nThough that amendment was narrowly defeated, I am pleased that I was \nable to bring greater attention to the needs of high-threat urban \nareas.\n  And in April during the Senate's consideration of the wartime \nsupplemental, I was pleased to join Senators Schumer and Mikulski in \noffering an amendment to the supplemental that would have, among other \nthings, provided approximately $1 billion in high-threat urban area \nfunding.\n  Though that amendment was also narrowly defeated, I am glad, for the \nsake of our country, that the supplemental did in fact include an \nadditional $700 million for high-threat urban areas.\n  This funding is critically important because of acute and urgent \nhomeland security needs that face certain communities in our nation.\n  Los Angeles City Councilman Jack Weiss noted that the city has \nactually received little funding to guard against terrorist attack, \neven though it is a high-threat area. Every time the Nation's terror \nalert goes from yellow to orange, it costs Los Angeles $1.5 million a \nweek and another $1 million a\n\n[[Page S9855]]\n\nweek to protect the Los Angeles International Airport.\n  Baltimore spent $17.5 million for homeland security and has received \nvery little help from Washington to date.\n  The New York City Police Department needs almost $10 million for air \nfiltration systems for sensitive police facilities and $27 million is \nneeded for additional vessels to patrol the Port of New York. Nearly 2 \nyears after the September 11 terrorist attacks, New York City's first \nresponders--38,000 police officers and 15,000 fire fighters, and \nthousands of EMS, health department and hospital workers--need nearly \n$100 million to ensure that they are properly trained using personal \nprotective and detection equipment and in being prepared for a possible \nterrorist attack.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has allocated high-threat funding \nbased on factors such as credible threat, vulnerability, population, \nthe identified needs of public agencies, and the existence of mutual \naid agreements.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at this chart.\n  Many communities, not just New York and Washington, have been \nallocated high-threat funding this year, including Houston, Chicago, \nLos Angeles, Denver, Detroit, Phoenix, Baltimore, Dallas, St. Louis, \nKansas City, Cincinnati, Honolulu, Pittsburgh, Portland, New Orleans, \nMemphis, Cleveland, and Charleston, among others.\n  This funding will help all of our Nation's most vulnerable targets. \nThe decision is left to Secretary Ridge, but the bottom line is that in \ndisbursing these funds, he is recognizing that some communities face a \nparticularized threat and need extra assistance.\n  I have said this before, but I will say it again that regarding New \nYork, I would give anything for terrorists not to be targeting New York \nor Buffalo, but, unfortunately, I can't. What I can do, and what I will \ncontinue to do, is to try and ensure that these and other high-threat \nurban areas receive the assistance they need and deserve.\n  I want to say again that, yes, we have made some progress since \nSeptember 11 in improving our homeland defense, but we have not done \nnearly enough.\n  Expert after expert has said it, the Homeland Security Independent \nTask Force of the Council on Foreign Relations--chaired by former \nSenator Warren Rudman)--being the most recent example. It echoes what \nour first responders have told us again and again. I hope, for the sake \nof our country and the American people, that we heed their call.\n  This map should serve as a warning. I hope it serves as a reminder, \nand hopefully a convincing display about why we need this extra money \nin order to deal with the threats that we know exist and to make sure \nwe have the job done, not only by the Department of Homeland Security \nbut by our police officers, our firefighters, and our other homeland \nfrontline defenders who live in and protect high-threat urban areas \nsuch as those on this map.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong \nsupport for this high threat urban area amendment, which I have \ncosponsored. This amendment is of particular interest to me because my \nState is the most densely populated in the Nation and highly vulnerable \nto terrorism.\n  New Jersey lost nearly 700 people on September 11 second only to New \nYork in the number of casualties. Tens of thousands of New Jerseyans \ncould literally see the Towers burning from their homes and offices.\n  Not only do these memories linger for my constituents, but the threat \nlingers as well. And part of why I wanted to return to the Senate was \nto work to reduce these threats and bolster homeland security.\n  That is why I am disappointed in the funding we have put forward for \nHomeland Security. I believe this bill provides insufficient funding \nfor our country's vast and diverse homeland security needs.\n  I know the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee worked \nextremely hard to put together a solid bill, but I believe the $28.5 \nbillion in this bill does not provide enough resources to protect our \nlocal communities this coming fiscal year.\n  The real problem is that there were not enough funds allocated by the \nbudget resolution earlier this year for our Nation's homeland security \nneeds. While the administration spent much of the winter eagerly \nplanning its tax cuts, the real needs of the American people--and the \nneeds of local firefighters, policemen and women and emergency room \nstaff--have been tragically neglected.\n  In addition to the overall spending level, I also want to address a \ntruism about homeland security: Whether we like it or not, when it \ncomes to which communities are most endangered by terrorism, all \nAmerican communities are not equal.\n  There are some parts of this country that are more in danger of a \npossible terrorist attack, because of geographical location, population \ndensity, number of major transportation hubs, etc. If we ignore this \nreality, than we are failing to adequately address homeland security.\n  My state has many densely populated, urban areas that face major \nthreats. In addition, a large percentage of my constituents commute to \nwork in New York City and Philadelphia every work day. My State is \ntraversed by major transit and highway systems that carry not only \nlocal traffic, but that also serve as major regional and national \nthoroughfares.\n  Each of my State's counties, cities, townships and boroughs need \ncritical resources to enhance the security of their communities. They \nneed first responder equipment and training; resources for hospitals to \nrespond to potential attacks; communications equipment for police, \nfirefighters and EMTs just to name a few of our pressing needs.\n  I must say, currently, in New Jersey, there is a certain \ndesperation--a panic even--pervading the first responders who know that \nthe communities they are charged to protect might be the next targets.\n  For example, the Chief of Police in Jersey City, Jim Buonocore said \nthe following about his police department:\n\n       We were the lifeline to New York City during the 9/11 \n     attacks. All the food and supplies came from Jersey City in \n     the days following the attacks. We know what it was like. New \n     York City suffered, but we lived through it and we suffered \n     too.\n\n  I am aware that smaller, less populated States across our great \nNation are also afraid of a possible attack and equally deserving of \nFederal appropriations to prepare themselves for such an eventuality. \nEach State deserves some share of the Federal pot. But the reality is \nthat high threat urban centers need a greater percentage, based on \ntheir population and based on the likelihood that an attack will indeed \noccur in their vicinity.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider what is best for the Nation, and the \nbest approach is to make sure our most vulnerable areas are protected.\n  I thank Senators Schumer and Specter for their leadership on this \nissue, and urge support for this amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthe motion to waive?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator on \nthe floor seeking recognition, I will make a few additional comments \nand then conclude.\n  The case in opposition to the proposed amendment has not been \ncompelling. The risks of terrorism are ever present. The urban areas \npose decisively high risks. Taking a look at airports, seaports, \nbridges, tunnels, and rail lines in the overall picture of homeland \ndefense, the amendment calls for a relatively modest sum of money.\n  I can represent to my colleagues that there is enormous concern among \nthe mayors and officials in urban high-risk areas as to what is \nhappening. This extra consideration will be very warmly received \nknowing that the Senate of the United States, and hopefully the\n\n[[Page S9856]]\n\nfull Congress in conference, recognizes this sort of unique risk and is \nprepared to back up their efforts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin be added as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in light of the tenor of the debate, as I \nhave noted the response that enough has been said, I yield back the \nremainder of the proponents' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question occurs on \nagreeing to the motion to waive the Congressional Budget Act in \nrelation to the Specter amendment No. 1368. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Dayton) is \nabsent attending a funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 301 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Dayton\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are \n46. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was rejected.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senators Specter and Schumer have an \namendment. They can complete the debate in 10 minutes. That would be in \ntime to have the moment of silence for the two slain officers.\n  Following that, Senator Reed of Rhode Island will offer an amendment \nand we will arrange with the leadership when the votes will take place.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, that is satisfactory with this side. We \nappreciate the help of the Senator from Nevada in working out this time \narrangement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be no \nsecond-degree amendments with respect to the Specter-Schumer amendment \nand there be a vote on or in relation to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1370\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senators Schumer, Warner, and Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mr. Schumer, Mr. Warner, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1370.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the funding for discretionary grants for use in \n high-threat urban areas and decrease funding for information analysis \nand infrastructure protection, science and technology, and research and \n                              development)\n\n       On page 58, line 6, strike ``$2,888,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,138,000,000''.\n       On page 59, line 1, strike ``$750,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,000,000,000''.\n       On page 66, line 9, strike ``$823,700,000'' and insert \n     ``$636,340,000''.\n       On page 66, line 23, strike ``$866,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$803,360,000''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very similar to the \nlast amendment, except that we have provided for an offset.\n  This amendment seeks to raise the allocation from $750 million to $1 \nbillion for high-risk areas, and there is an offset of $62.640 million \nfrom technology, research, development, and acquisition operations, \nwhich would bring this figure to the precise amount that is requested \nby the administration, so that this reduction should pose no real \nproblem. And there is a reduction of $187,360 from the information \nanalysis and infrastructure protection and operating expenses. This, \nagain, still leaves that account with considerable funding in the net \namount of $636.340 million. The last vote was 50-46, 50 for the motion \nto waive the Budget Act. There were some seven Republican Senators who \nvoted in favor of waiving the Budget Act, which I think is a sign of \nsome substantial support on this side of the aisle. A number of my \ncolleagues in the well commented that had there been an offset, there \nwould have been a more favorable consideration.\n  The essence of this amendment is to more finely target where we are \nspending the money for homeland defense. We really do not seek to take \nadvantage of the information analysis section or the science, \ntechnology, research, and development section, but I think a fair \nappraisal would be that taking a look at the risks on homeland \nsecurity, they are more profoundly present in the urban areas. Again, I \nrefer to the trip the President made earlier today to Philadelphia, \naccompanied by Senator Santorum and myself, and that route is \nillustrative--landing at Philadelphia National Airport, which is a \nmajor target; going over an enormous bridge, which is a major target; \nthe Delaware River, which is a major target; and going through tunnels.\n  I compliment Senator Cochran for the work that has been done as \nchairman of the subcommittee. I have worked with him as well. I do \nbelieve that this sort of an increase--relatively modest--would be a \ngreat encouragement to make the cities safer. I know from my \nconversations with the mayors of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and the \nmayor of New York, they are very much concerned about the tremendous \nadditional expenses. Earlier today, I made references to the high \nadditional costs of the cities, illustrated by the fact that in just a \n2-week period, from February 7 to 20, when the threat went from yellow \nto orange, the city of Philadelphia alone had an additional expense of \n$1.3 million.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Is there time in \nthe agreement for opposition to the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There had been a discussion about 10 minutes, \nbut there was no specific time agreement reached. However, under the \nprevious order, the Senate, at 3:40, will go into a moment of silence \nin honor of fallen Capitol Police officers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to reiterate what my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania said. It is the same amendment as last time, except \nit has an offset because many colleagues wanted that. The offset \ndoesn't come from small States or from any part of the homeland \nsecurity distributional money. Rather, it comes from two categories \ncalled information analysis and\n\n[[Page S9857]]\n\ninfrastructure protection, which is reduced by $187 million. We reduced \nit by adding up all the various specific amounts that were asked for in \nthe specific programs, and this was an overage after that. Second, \nscience and technology, research and development, where we went with \nthe President's commitment of $803 million, rather than the committee \nnumber of $866 million. Our high-needs areas need help. This will do it \nwithout breaking the budget by one nickel.\n  It does rearrange the priorities some, but it is the priorities we \nthink are fair. We are trying to accommodate many colleagues on the \nother side who wished for an offset. This seems to be the right one. I \nreiterate, our high-needs areas, wherever they may be, or high-threat \nareas, need more help than they are given in the bill. The bill goes \ndown from the amount we did last year, despite promises by all that it \nwould go up. We don't break the budget, and we don't take it from small \nStates.\n  I urge support for this amendment, and I yield the floor as we \napproach the time of 3:40.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9857-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE COURAGE AND SACRIFICE OF OFFICER J.J.

Mr. President, 5 years ago on this day, Officers J.J. \nChestnut and John Gibson were killed in the line of duty defending the \nUnited States Capitol.\n  At 3:40 p.m. on Friday afternoon, July 24th, 1998, a deranged gunman \nburst through what is now called the Memorial Door and shot Officer \nChestnut in the head. The gunman then moved to the first floor where he \nattempted to enter the majority whip's office. There, he met Officer \nGibson who blocked the intruder and opened fire. A gun battle ensued \nand Officer Gibson was fatally shot.\n  Officers Chestnut and Gibson lost their lives that day for us, for \nthis Capitol, for the United States of America.\n  Officer Chestnut, a father of five, was only months away from \nretirement. His sister-in-law said that J.J. was ``the most wonderful \nman you would ever meet . . . He just wanted to enjoy his garden and \nenjoy his children.'' A Vietnam vet, Officer Chestnut spent 20 years in \nthe Air Force before serving 18 years as a Capitol Police Officer. He \nwas recognized by all of his colleagues as a dedicated, kind, and good \nman.\n  John Gibson, also an 18-year veteran on the Capitol force, was a \nfather of three. He was described by friends as generous and God-\nfearing. Only a few days before the shooting, he told one of his \ncolleagues that he had never had to use his weapon, but if he did, he \nwould be focused, and concentrate on the task at hand. Little did he \nknow how soon he would be tested, and how valiantly he would perform in \nour service, in the Nation's service.\n  Officers Chestnut and Gibson will always be remembered for their \npersonal and professional integrity, their bravery, and their \nsacrifice. We honor them today with a brief moment of silence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The poet Archibald MacLeish was an ambulance driver in \nWorld War I. Years later, in a poem about soldiers lost in battle, he \nwrote:\n\n     The young dead soldiers do not speak.\n     Nevertheless, they are heard in the still houses.\n     Who has not heard them?\n     They have a silence that speaks for them at night and when \n           the clock strikes.\n\n  It is right, and it is important, that we stop every year at this \nmoment to remember in silence the courage and sacrifice of Officer J.J. \nChestnut and Detective John Gibson.\n  But it is not only at this moment, on this day, that we remember \nthese fallen heroes.\n  We remember Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson every \ntime we pass the Memorial Door and see that bronze plaque that bears \ntheir likenesses.\n  We remember them whenever we see Capitol Police officers working \ndouble shifts to protect us.\n  We remembered them yesterday, when we heard the awful news about the \nshooting at New York City Hall.\n  Like the young soldiers in the poem, 5 years after that terrible \nFriday afternoon, J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson are still heard in this \nhouse--the people's House.\n  We hear them in the conversations, the questions and the laughter of \nthe schoolchildren and scout troops and all the others who visit this \nCapitol.\n  Five years ago, we probably did not understand fully the risks the \nCapitol Police take every day when they put on their badges and come to \nwork, but Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson understood.\n  They knowingly risked their lives because they loved this building \nand what it represents, and they wanted others to be able to see their \nGovernment at work.\n  We are not as innocent now as we were then. September 11 and the \nanthrax attacks made us all more aware that there are those who want to \nsee the people's House closed, even destroyed.\n  The fact that this Capitol remains open--that visitors can still walk \nthese majestic halls and sit in these galleries--is a powerful symbol \nof America's commitment to democracy. It is a testimony to the skill \nand courage of the Capitol Police. And it is a daily, living tribute to \nOfficer Chestnut and Detective Gibson.\n  Today is a sad day for the members of the Capitol family, but it is \nnot just with sadness that we remember our two fallen heroes.\n  We also remember how much we liked and respected them. We remember \nhow much J.J. Chestnut loved his garden, and how crazy John Gibson was \nabout his Red Sox. We remember how proud they were of their work, and \nhow deeply they both loved their families.\n  Our hearts, and our prayers, go out today to their brothers and \nsisters in arms, the members of the Capitol Police, to the many friends \nthey left behind, and especially, to their widows and children and, in \nOfficer Chestnut's case, his grandchildren.\n  We think of them often, as well. Their sacrifices, too, will never be \nforgotten.\n  Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson gave their lives to \nprotect something that is sacred to all of us. In doing so, they surely \nsaved the lives of countless others. They are heroes.\n  Five years later, we remain in awe of their courage and sacrifice. \nAnd we are grateful to them beyond words.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9857-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9857-S9887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1370\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am bothered by the offset on this amendment. In the \n2003 bill, we provided $850 million to high-threat urban grants. This \nbill already contains another $750 million for high-threat urban \ngrants. That is a total of $1.6 billion for high-threat urban grants.\n  Every community in the country is affected by the alert system. Every \ncommunity in the country faces increased costs. These megalopolises of \nthe country, the large urban areas, are demanding that everybody pay \nmore for them, but the smaller cities, the smaller counties, the \nsmaller areas, have the same problem. On a per capita basis, it is a \nhigher cost to provide protection to small areas than the high-threat \nurban areas.\n\n  I do not know why we should have New York City and Philadelphia, in \nparticular. They are the ones seeking this money. There is no question \nthere is a need. But there is a need in Peoria. There is a need in \nCincinnati. There is a need in Tucson. There is a need in New Orleans.\n  The money they have taken for this is money that deals with homeland \nsecurity nationally. One of the offsets\n\n[[Page S9858]]\n\ntakes moneys from the small universities in the country. We had letters \nfrom many Senators asking for money to assist in terms of research, the \nresearch base of the country dealing with homeland security problems. \nWe ought to take a second look at what we are doing.\n  We created this Department of Homeland Security 8 months ago. They \nalready have in this bill and the bill we already enacted $1.6 billion \nmore than the rest of the country. Why should this happen now that we \nhave an offset against two of the most important accounts in Homeland \nSecurity? I hope we can talk a little bit more about that before we \nvote.\n  I will object to a time agreement until people understand what we are \ndoing. Part of this money is from information analysis and \ninfrastructure protection. It is a directorate, as they call it, in the \nnew Department of Homeland Security. This will limit the intelligence \nwarning and threat analysis functions of the Department we have just \ncreated. These are just being set up. This is for the 2004 costs of the \nDepartment we have just set up. Why should we take money from that? \nThese are assessments of critical infrastructure, including chemical \nfacilities, drinking water supply systems, arenas and stadiums, our \nNation's seaports. This is the money being offset. Do Members with \nseaports want to put this money into an account that already has $1.6 \nbillion? We ought to stop and think about this.\n  It would also be offset against the national communication system, as \nI understand. I will have to study this more deeply. The priority \ntelecommunications programs could not be implemented. We have been \ninterested in a national alert system. In the past, the national alert \nsystem went over the radio. Now, few people listen to the radio. They \nare on cell phones, they are on computers, they watch the television, \ncable. We are trying to get a national alert system. This offset goes \nagainst that study, how to put back into place a national alert system \nso the Nation will know, an area will know, if there is an extreme \nthreat about which everyone should know.\n  I understand the Senators from New York and Pennsylvania are trying \nto increase the amount of money available to their high-threat urban \nareas. I have a high-threat urban area in Anchorage, too, but we do not \nhave as large a population and we do not have the $1.6 billion either.\n  The Senate ought to think seriously about what we are doing. I intend \nto speak further if I can find additional information regarding the \nexact money that will be displaced by this amendment. The total amount \nof money here is too much, too soon. We ought to think about what we \nare doing. I hope others will come forward and take a look at what we \nare doing.\n  For those who sent letters asking for money in these areas, \nparticularly in the national intelligence systems and threat analysis, \nin the areas of chemical facilities, drinking water supplies, utility \nprotection, transportation protection, protection of bridges, this is \nwhat the money is. Why should that go to New York and Pennsylvania \nbecause they have a problem? Everyone else has, but they have a lot \nmore people. On a per capita basis, we have already given them more \nmoney. To give them this additional $250 million is going too far.\n  I hope the Senate will listen and not adopt this amendment.\n  I will return with greater details in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are listening to quite a tirade \nagainst giving money to the high-threat areas. The question is raised, \nWhy? When you go to a hospital and you have a sick patient, someone who \nis really in trouble, he or she will be among the first to receive the \nmedication. That is the situation about which we are talking.\n  We lost 3,000 people on September 11, 2001 most of them in New York. \nThis is the focal point for economic activity--probably the most \nimportant financial center in the entire world. We look at the cities \nof Philadelphia and New York and there is New Jersey, right in the \nmiddle, with lots of commuters. We lost 700 innocent citizens on that \nday.\n  We have $29 billion going into homeland security but we need more. I \nknow where to take it from: Take it from the huge tax cut that was \ngiven to those who do not need it.\n  For goodness' sake, the first round of emergency response grants had \nNew Jersey and New York among the least compensated on a per capita \nbasis. Our populations are squeezed together. New Jersey has the \nhighest population density of all the States in the country. We have \nall kinds of important facilities, beside harbors and the financial \ncenter, that affect the way our country functions.\n  To say, you got enough money, that's just not right. I repeat: when \nthe Department of Homeland Security gave out the first round of grants, \nNew Jersey and New York were among the States most poorly treated on a \nper capita basis and yet our two States paid the biggest price on 9-11 \nwhen it comes to what constitutes a terrorist threat.\n  We may be threatened here with repercussions because we want money \nfor the ports, we want money for transportation, or otherwise. Threaten \nall you want, but you cannot idly threaten the citizens of New York and \nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania and other high-threat urban areas, walk \naway, and say: You got enough money.\n  I hope everyone is listening. What we need to do is recognize our \nareas of susceptibility and help those areas first. When it comes to \ntoxic air or toxic water, we distribute the funds based on where the \nproblem exists, where there are Superfund sites, and we try to give \nthose areas more money so they can fix their problems.\n  The whole country wept on September 11, 2001. Everyone was weeping. \nAnd they all felt susceptible. But some know, many know, there are \nareas that are more susceptible than others. Those places are \nPennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and other high-density urban areas.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I know my colleague is aware the high-threat areas were \nnot just New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania when the last round of \nmoney was given out. I know my colleague is aware that 30 cities got \nspecial money because the cities had special needs, including Boston, \nDenver, Philadelphia, Miami, Detroit, Newark, San Diego, Phoenix, \nBaltimore, Dallas, Buffalo, St. Louis, Kansas City, Cincinnati, \nSacramento, Honolulu, Pittsburgh, Long Beach, New Orleans, Memphis, \nCleveland, Tampa, Seattle, New York, Washington, Chicago, Houston, Los \nAngeles, and San Francisco. The high-needs areas are not simply in \nthree States, they are in special areas.\n  I ask my colleague two questions. Was he aware that 30 cities got \nthis money? And this year we are putting less money into high needs \nthan last year.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I was not aware of the specifics. I just know that in \nthe areas already hit very hard--New York, New Jersey--a very serious \nthreat remains. There are port facilities that are not protected at \nall. There are rail facilities. There are all kinds of things that \ncould be destroyed or disrupted in a flash with the right kind of \nweapon or terrorist plan.\n\n  Whoever thought the Trade Center would come down--110 stories, just \ncrash to the ground, melted into nothingness? No.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for another question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I sure will.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Our good friend from Alaska said we have needs on a per \ncapita basis. But is my colleague aware that on a per capita basis the \nhigh-need States get less money? It is not the same. This is not evenly \ndistributed on a per capita basis, because the formula here has .75 for \nevery State--much higher.\n  I believe in helping all the States but this is higher than we have \never seen in a formula distributing money to every State. As a result, \na State such as Wyoming or Alaska, for instance, would get far more \nmoney on a per capita basis----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is the time of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Who has the floor, Mr. President?\n\n[[Page S9859]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. On a per capita basis than even a larger, high-threat \nState. Is my colleague aware of that?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am absolutely aware of that. That is why I am \nsurprised when I hear the distinguished Senator from Alaska, who knows \nthis place better than anybody, who knows how desperately grants are \nsought and fought for, as he has so many times for his own State of \nAlaska, as he should, and how many times he has been successful, and \nhow many times grants have been given to Alaska because his \nconstituents needed the help.\n  But what goes around comes around, as they say. Now its New Jersey \nand New York that need that kind of help and we shouldn't be turned \naway.\n  With regard to the offsets for this amendment, I would prefer that we \nnot take the money from communications and from science and technology. \nI would submit that there are other offsets, including the one I \nsuggested a moment ago--one I would be most willing to forego--and that \nis the tax break that has come along. Take some of that money, the \nhundreds of millions of dollars that are involved, the billions of \ndollars over the next several year years, and put that money back where \nit belongs, to protect our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey will reserve the word ``tirade'' with reference to me. I might \nhave a tirade sometime on the floor. I have not so far. And it will not \nbe because of an amendment like this.\n  But I call the Senate's attention to pages 58 and 59 in the committee \nreport. I will state to the Senator from New York that he is in error. \nThe .7 applies to the basic grants; it does not apply to this program \nat all. The .7 does not apply to this concept we are talking about now, \nnor the money to which he is referring.\n  If you look at page 58, it shows the committee recommendations for \nthe information analysis and infrastructure protection system. It is a \nnational system.\n  I call your attention to page 59:\n\n       The General Accounting Office has reported that chemical \n     facilities present an attractive target for terrorist \n     activity. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it \n     would cost $80,000,000 over 5 years for vulnerability \n     assessments at nearly 15,000 chemical facilities across the \n     United States. Therefore, the Committee [is directing this \n     money to be spent for that.]\n\n  We make a direct request for a report on the matter. The systems we \nare dealing with here are systems that deal with the Nation. But, in \nparticular, it is:\n\n       . . . the creation of the National Cyber Security Division \n     within Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection and \n     recommends $32,800,000 for the integration of physical and \n     cyber infrastructure monitoring and coordination from the \n     funds made available for information and warning advisories, \n     and $65,700,000 for cyberspace security from the funds made \n     available for remediation and protective actions.\n\n  We expect to move into this whole concept of critical infrastructure \nprotection. That needs:\n\n       . . . key asset identification, field assessments of \n     critical infrastructures, and key asset protection \n     implementation to help guide the development of protective \n     measures to harden facilities and assets.\n\n  It is a national program from which this money is being taken. The \ninference here is this is surplus money. This is not enough. We don't \nhave enough for this system. We don't have enough money for what the \nSenators from Pennsylvania and New York want. But the point is, some of \nthis protection starts at home. Some of it starts at home. Some basic \nconcept of protection is the responsibility of every government in the \nUnited States. But the one responsibility we have here is the national \nsystem of identification of those facilities and assets that are \ncritical, and also the establishment of a national alert system. This \nmoney is not enough for either one. But the Senators from New York and \nPennsylvania want to take $250 million from a fund that is already \ninsufficient, based upon the General Accounting Office report.\n  I do hope Senators will take a look at how this money is allocated:\n\n       Intelligence and Warning: Threat determination and \n     assessment, Information and warning advisories, Protecting \n     Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets: Infrastructure \n     vulnerability and risk assessment, Remediation and protective \n     actions, National Communication System.\n\n  That gets the bulk of it, the national communication system, finding \nsome way to put an alert system back in place that will notify \neverybody if there is a national disaster. That does not exist any \nlonger. It did, back in the days, as I said, when we all relied on \nradio. That got tested once a week, in fact, or once a month--whatever \nit was. But how long has it been since you had a test on a system? \nThere is no test possible coming through cell phones, through \ncomputers, through the cable systems, through the satellite systems. \nThey are not coordinated at all. We need a national system of alert and \nthis is going to go toward that, starting it up.\n\n  The bulk of the money that they are taking is in protecting critical \ninfrastructure and key assets. That is where $95 million is for the \ninfrastructure vulnerability and risk assessment; $383.9 million for \nremediation for protective actions nationally. This is protecting the \nports of New Jersey, of New York, of California, Florida, and even \nAlaska. But identifying the need for protection.\n  Why take that money out when we are just setting up the Department of \nHomeland Security and this is the basic money we need now? We need it \nnow.\n  The Senators from New York and Pennsylvania want money to be there in \ncase they need it if there is another national alert. There may not be \none. But there is a need for this. The General Accounting Office \ninsists the No. 1 responsibility of Congress is to deal with the \nvulnerability assessments of 15,000 chemical facilities and other \nsimilar assets around the country. Chemical facilities in particular, \nand the costs associated with protecting those chemical facilities, are \nessential to this homeland security.\n  I urge the Senate not to take this action. It will also go into the \nScience and Technology Directorate, taking money from the research and \ndevelopment capabilities of the entire Department of Homeland Security. \nThe reduction would severely limit the university-based centers \nprogram.\n  As I said before, nearly every Senator has made a request. I have the \nlist here, by the way. Here it is. These pages, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5--6 pages, \nsingle spaced, from Senators addressing this one particular account.\n  Senators, if you ask for this money and you expect to get it--we have \nnot earmarked any money; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is right.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is no money earmarked. But money, as much as we \ncould possibly put, is in the discretionary fund--and I think almost \nevery Senator has asked for money in this area: Vulnerability \nprotection, disaster assistance programs, homeland security initiative \nat the University of Washington, University of Nebraska. Maybe I should \nread them all, when we look at it: College of William and Mary, George \nMason, VMI, Utah, LSU, Wichita, Montana State, Colorado, University of \nDelaware, Brown University, University of Rhode Island, University of \nGeorgia, University of New York, SUNI Maritime College.\n  I could go on and on. Almost every college that has a capability of \nbeing involved in this assessment and determination of how to protect \nthese facilities has asked to get involved. We could not do that. So we \nset up a fund and the Department will determine how many of these \nuniversities can lock together and give us the assessment that the \nGeneral Accounting Office says is absolutely essential.\n  If you take the money for something that might happen, how are you \ngoing to know when it does happen?\n  This is the beginning of the homeland security assessment of threats \nand establishing an alert system. This amendment takes from both. I \nthink that is absolutely wrong. I hope we will get other people to \ncomment on this amendment. I understand the need. There is overwhelming \nneed throughout the country for homeland security money.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the subcommittee, the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi, for what he has done, along with his staff. \nThey have\n\n[[Page S9860]]\n\nallocated it in a way that is really fair. These other amendments so \nfar have been to add money beyond what we have available. This is \ntaking money that has already been assigned by the committee and the \nsubcommittee to a specific account and putting it in another account \nand saying it was shortchanged. But there is already money in that \naccount. The account they are adding to already has in this bill $750 \nmillion. It had $850 million in the bill we passed earlier this year. \nThat is enough. Compared to the rest of the demands in this country, \nthat is enough for that fund.\n  I urge the Senate to disapprove this amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \ncomments. He has put this matter in perspective. We appreciate his \ncomments and his statements about the effect of this amendment on those \nparts of the bill that will have funds transferred from them to this \nso-called high-threat urban area account.\n  When we started talking about this bill yesterday, we had Senator \nafter Senator talking about adding money for new technologies and \nmaking sure that we develop and deploy new kinds of the most modern \ndefensive systems we can have to defeat and detect terrorist attacks \nand to make our country share in security. One of those was an \nantimissile system for commercial aircraft. You may remember Senator \nBoxer was on the floor talking about immediately putting those \ncapabilities in the domestic commercial airline industry. We have funds \nin the bill to do just that. But guess what. This amendment cuts those \nfunds. This amendment would take money away from the antimissile \ndefense capability fund where we are developing and will deploy the \ncapability as soon as it is ready.\n  Funds for universities throughout the country that are now eligible \nfor grants for research into new technologies which will improve our \ncapability to defend ourselves across a wide range of areas that we \nneed to explore, develop, and deploy will be undermined by this \namendment. The funds will be cut if this amendment is agreed to.\n  We have had Members offering amendments for money for chemical \nindustry infrastructure protection--special money going to the chemical \nindustry. The money we have in this bill now for the chemical industry \nwill be cut if this amendment is agreed to.\n  The last vote we took on this was on the subject of waiving the \nBudget Act. Some Senators came up, and I heard them say, You are going \nto need 60 votes. They will need 60 votes to prevail to waive the \nBudget Act. So my vote really won't matter, since you already have 40 \nvotes to defeat this. I can vote for the amendment to add money, since \nit won't come from any other account.\n  Some other Senators were concerned because we were going to violate \nthe Budget Act. I heard some Senators say, If you could find an offset, \nI would vote for your amendment. Now we have an offset, and Senators \nare going to have to take a new look at this.\n  This is not an automatic decision that can be made. But to think \nabout its effect on those accounts and those activities which are going \nto be cut by this amendment, these are real cuts that are going to be \nmade.\n  I hope Senators will look carefully and balance their judgment \nagainst the need to add money for this account that is now in the $750 \nmillion area.\n  Think about this: We also put $750 million into this account when we \npassed the supplemental just a few weeks ago. We passed a supplemental \nfor the remainder of this fiscal year and added $750 million for these \nsame urban areas for which they now want to increase money. To me, that \nis not fair. That is not fair.\n  People throughout the country have an equal interest. Whether you are \nin an urban area or a rural area, you have an equal interest in this \nbeing a balanced bill that treats all areas of the country the same in \nterms of the quality of the response we are going to make in our \nindividual communities. You can't just channel the money to the big \ncities and expect it is going to solve our national problem. This is \nnot a problem just for the big cities to solve. It is a problem for our \ncountry to solve. It is a national problem. It is not just a Federal \nGovernment problem. Every town and every city and every State ought to \nbe able to share equally and fairly in the funds that are made \navailable in this bill. If this amendment is agreed to, the fairness \ndoctrine will go out the window.\n  I urge Members to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset, I agree with the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska. His presentation was not a tirade. \nFor those of us who have heard the Senator from Alaska speak on many \noccasions, there was nowhere near a tirade from the Senator from \nAlaska. That was a reasoned analysis of the substitution of funds.\n  When the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, presents his argument, it has great weight. The \nsubcommittee has very carefully considered the allocations. But this \namendment seeks to make a rather modest change. We have here a $29 \nbillion appropriations bill.\n  When you talk about high-risk areas, it is my view that $1 billion is \na minimum. The figure might realistically be appraised for much more \nthan $1 billion.\n  It is true that during the course of the last vote there were many \nSenators in the well who voted against waiving the Budget Act and who \nsaid had there been an offset they would be favorably disposed. That is \nnot a carte blanche commitment. It depends upon what the offset is.\n  We are talking about two accounts. The information analysis, \ninfrastructure protection, operating expenses still has a very \nconsiderable sum of money, $636.340 million. The science and technology \nresearch, development, acquisition and operations, where we have taken \n$62.640 million, still has more than $800 million.\n  What we are looking at here really is an analysis of what the highest \nrisk area is.\n  Again, I come back to the activities of President Bush today. Where \nwas President Bush today? He made a trip to Philadelphia. In \nPhiladelphia, he went to the airport, which is high risk. Then he was \non a long bridge which spans the Schuylkill River, which is high risk. \nThen he went along a highway again where there is very heavy congestion \nand high risk. Then he was at the seaport, again an area which is high \nrisk. It is a matter of making an analysis.\n  I have great respect for what the Senator from Mississippi has done \non this subcommittee. Perhaps the total figure of $29 billion is not \nsufficient. Perhaps it ought to be slightly more--not to take an offset \nfrom these two accounts.\n  But I supported the Senator from Mississippi on every one of his \ntabling motions. Other Senators have offered much greater amendments, \none in the range of $1.8 billion. It is true that on one of the motions \nto table by the Senator from Mississippi on firefighters, I deviated on \na motion to waive the Budget Act, which was nowhere near successful \nbecause of giving a little spiritual support to the firefighters who I \nthink have done such an outstanding job. But I believe a careful \nanalysis of the $250 million for high-risk areas contrasted with the \nfunds that would have been taken from these other accounts which are \nstill very well funded is appropriate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before we vote on this amendment, I am \nreminded that attacks have been thwarted in three locations. And if \nattacks have been thwarted, that suggests there is a certain risk \nattached to those locations. One is the World Trade Center, another is \nLAX Airport, and the third is the Space Needle in Seattle. As far as I \nknow, there were no attacks threatened in Wyoming and many other places \naround the country. So when we look at this issue, I think we ought to \nget focused.\n  First of all, Secretary Ridge is the arbiter of the discretionary \nfund. He is the expert. He gives out this additional money. We, the \nSenate--Democrats and Republicans--nominated him to make these \ndecisions. If the nondiscretionary part of the budget runs about $28 \nbillion, I don't know that these particular accounts are the places \nwhere we have to go to get the funding. And we can ask Secretary Ridge \nto be aware that we are most\n\n[[Page S9861]]\n\nconcerned because of the high-risk nature of the New York/New Jersey \nregion.\n  I hope in this case we will take seriously what we talk about so \nmuch: That we cannot be secure, no matter how good we are in \nAfghanistan, no matter how good we are in Iraq--and we have been \nterrific. Our people have fought valiantly. They have done what is \nasked of them. There are not enough of them. And when someone suggested \nthere were not enough of them, such as General Shinseki, he was kind of \nkicked out of the Corps.\n  So we have to look at this and ask, what constitutes security? It is \nnot having enough bombs and planes. It is making sure that bombs and \nplanes don't come our way, don't come to our soil.\n  You may have heard the prediction that was leveled by the former \nSecretary of Defense when he said, within a decade, if things go along \nas they are, we could be looking at a nuclear explosion on American \nsoil.\n  I think we ought to step up to the idea and express our interest in \npreventing any kind of a terrorist attack. We have had a couple, and \nthey were devastating, not only to the lives and families who were hurt \nbut to the morale of this country.\n  I think we ought to say: Look, these are areas that are constantly \nunder concern for a terrorist attack. Let's put the money there to make \nsure we are taking special care of them, just as we would a patient who \nis especially sick and we have a limited amount of medication. We give \nit to that patient, not to those who might get sick.\n  That is the situation we face. I hope we will get enough support to \ncarry this through. The message is important. And I leave it to \nSecretary Ridge to deal with his discretionary responsibility to \nallocate the funds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no Senators who want to speak \non this issue who have not already spoken. I think we are ready for the \nvote.

Following the \ndebating on those two amendments, I ask that there be a vote on those \ntwo amendments with Senator Byrd's vote coming first and the vote on \nSenator Reed coming next. Those votes would be on or in relation to \nthose two amendments with no second-degree amendments in order.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that the unanimous consent agreement \nbe amended to allow the Senator from Mississippi whatever time he shall \nconsume in opposition to the Reed amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree to that amendment, and I thank the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1372\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself and \n     Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered 1372.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To appropriate $100,000,000 for grants to public transit \n agencies to enhance public transportation security against terrorist \n                                threats)\n\n       On page 49, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n\n                            Transit Security\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Transportation Security \n     Administration related to land transportation security \n     services pursuant to the Aviation and Transportation Security \n     Act (49 U.S.C. 40101 note) and for other purposes, \n     $100,000,000, to remain available until December 31, 2004, \n     which shall be available for grants to public transit \n     agencies for enhancing the security of transit facilities \n     against chemical, biological and other terrorist threats: \n     Provided, That the Secretary of Homeland Security shall make \n     such grants pursuant to threat assessments previously \n     conducted by the Transportation Security Administration and \n     the Federal Transit Administration: Provided further, That \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall enter into a memorandum of understanding \n     regarding transit security. Provided further, That not later \n     than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to \n     Congress that includes--\n       (1) the amount of funds appropriated to the Transportation \n     Security Administration (TSA) that have been allocated for \n     activities designed to improve public transportation \n     security;\n       (2) the number of full-time TSA personnel engaged in \n     activities designed to improve public transportation \n     security;\n       (3) the strategic plan of the TSA for improving the \n     security of our Nation's public transportation systems; and\n       (4) recommendations from the TSA for any policy changes \n     needed to ensure that the TSA, in coordination with other \n     agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, will \n     effectively improve public transportation security for our \n     Nation's transit riders.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate debated a \ncomprehensive amendment by Senator Byrd with respect to deficiencies in \nthis bill regarding resources for homeland security. Essentially, what \nSenator Byrd was trying to do was to match the resources we need with \nthe rhetoric we have heard about protecting the homeland of the United \nStates.\n  I am disappointed Senator Byrd's amendment did not prevail. Within\n\n[[Page S9862]]\n\nthat amendment, there were resources devoted to transit security. \nToday, I offer an amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Sarbanes to \naddress what I think is an amazing and unacceptable lack of resources \nand investment for securing and protecting our Nation's trains, buses, \nand ferries. Indeed, these vehicles and these transportation modes \nprovide transportation for millions of Americans each day, and they \nrequire protection.\n  I want to be clear. This is not the fault of the committee, and \ncertainly not the fault of the chairman who has done an extraordinary \njob in securing an additional $1 billion for the subcommittee's \nallocation. But the fact is that the administration has not asked for \nsufficient resources to protect the transit systems in the United \nStates. Again, this is why, together with Senator Sarbanes, I am \noffering this amendment to add $100 million for the protection of our \npublic transit systems.\n  Each day, millions of Americans, old and young, rich and poor, every \nkind of American, board a bus or a train to go to work, school, or a \ndoctor's appointment. Each year the Federal Government spends billions \nof dollars to build and maintain these systems. Yet to date, \nshockingly, the Federal Government has only invested below $90 million \nin fiscal years 2002 and 2003 for transit security if we exclude the \nvery special circumstances of rebuilding transit systems that were \nattacked and severely damaged during the September 11 attack.\n  We have recognized the need to protect our airlines and we have spent \nbillions of dollars to do so, but there is the same compelling need to \nprotect the transit systems of the United States.\n  There are two major reasons we must protect these transit systems: \nFirst, we want to avoid, preempt, and prevent, a terrorist event \ninvolving a transit system; second, we need transit systems that have \ninteroperable communications, trained personnel, and additional \nequipment to mitigate the consequences of any type of terrorist event \nin the United States.\n  It is quite clear transit systems are a target of terrorists. \nAccording to a report in 1994 by John P. Sullivan and Henry I. \nDeGeneste: ``Transit systems are attractive targets for a number of \nreasons. They carry large numbers of people within concentrated, \npredictable areas and timeframes. They are accessible since they \nprovide easy user access. Finally, their target-rich infrastructure \nwhich often covers extensive geographic areas frequently renders \ncountermeasures impractical.''\n  So we know this. Indeed, the Federal Transit Administration knows it. \nTo their credit, they have taken meager resources to provide transit \nassessment assistance to any transit system that is required or \nrequested. They have been able to advise these transit systems. But \nadvice is not dollars. Advice does not build or buy equipment that will \nprotect commuters in our transit systems.\n  We already know transit systems are a target, in many cases targets \nof choice. The Mineta Institute indicates that between 1997 to 2000 \nthere were 195 terrorist attacks against transit systems worldwide. \nMost of these attacks were against buses. I should point out, 90 \npercent of these attacks occurred against buses. In the Middle East, we \nhave seen the horrific pictures of buses blown up by suicide bombers. \nNo one wants to see such pictures in the United States.\n  Of course, the most horrific example of a terrorist attack against \ntransit was the 1995 sarin gas attack in Japan where 11 people were \nkilled and 5,500 innocent people were injured due to the work of a \nsmall band of crazed individuals.\n  We understand there is a great potential for terror attacks against \ntransit systems. Given the increasing danger of proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, these transit attacks could be horrific in \nthe future.\n  I also mention that not only do we need to avoid attacks against \ntransit, we need to be prepared in the case of another terrorist attack \nin the United States. I refer to testimony before my subcommittee last \nyear, as I chaired the subcommittee with respect to transit's role in \nSeptember 11. The first is a statement by Jenna Dorn, the Administrator \non the Federal Transit Administration.\n       At 8:52 a.m. on September 11th, minutes after the first \n     hijacked jet plowed into One World Trade Center, a Port \n     Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) train master gave life-saving \n     instructions to conductors and operators.\n       A train from Newark, carrying about 1,000 passengers, had \n     just pulled into the station below the World Trade Center. \n     The train master told the crew to keep everyone on the train, \n     board everyone in the station, and immediately depart for the \n     Exchange Place stop in Jersey City. Public transportation \n     employees immediately evacuated passengers who mistakenly \n     left the train.\n       A train from Hoboken carrying another 1,000 people was just \n     behind the Newark train. The train master told that crew to \n     keep the doors closed at the Trade Center and head \n     immediately to Jersey City.\n       The train master then told another train in Jersey City to \n     discharge all passengers and head back to the World Trade \n     Center to evacuate remaining travelers and transit personnel. \n     That train departed with its precious cargo at 9:10 a.m., 40 \n     minutes before the first building collapsed.\n       That train master, Richie Moran, and PATH's emergency \n     response plan, saved thousands of lives. As we watched the \n     death toll climb in New York, it is astounding to realize \n     that no one riding the PATH or New York City subway lines \n     that morning was injured.\n  That is not an accident. That is the result of good communications, \nplanning, training, all the issues that they showed in New York City. \nBut let me suggest the level of planning, training, and equipment in \nNew York City is not duplicated in many cities around this country--and \nit should be.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record excerpts \nfrom the statement by Richard A. White, the general manager of the \nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, who talks of the \nintegral role of that system in evacuating personnel during the attack \non the Pentagon.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On September 11, when WMATA was needed most, and in the \n     midst of regional chaos, Metrorail and Metrobus were ready, \n     and delivered for the National Capital Region. We operated \n     the equivalent of back-to-back rush hours virtually without \n     incident, after the Federal Government and other regional \n     employers sent hundreds of thousands of workers home around \n     mid-morning. We were operating the entire day. We did what we \n     do best. We moved large numbers of people safely and \n     efficiently.\n       Throughout the day, the WMATA workforce performed \n     extraordinarily. Not once did an employee put their own \n     individual concerns ahead of their sense of duty to the \n     customers. The transit police, the bus and rail operators, \n     the station personnel, the customer service representatives--\n     everyone--demonstrated their dedication to our mission of \n     moving people safely and securely.\n       Further, we never lost communications throughout the day. \n     We established and maintained contact with local State, and \n     Federal authorities, and we communicated with our riders \n     through in-system messages, our phone system and over the \n     internet through the website.\n       WMATA, blessedly, suffered no property damage, no loss of \n     life, and no injury to any of its employees nor to any of our \n     customers on that terrible day.\n\n  Mr. REED. Senator Sarbanes and I asked for a GAO report on transit \nsecurity. The GAO visited 10 transit properties all over the country of \nvarying sizes and characteristics. They surveyed 200 of the 6,000 \ntransit operators of the Nation. Their report clearly indicates the \ncompelling need for Federal assistance.\n  In addition to that, it clearly indicates the scope of that system. \nOf just eight of the transit systems that had conducted professional \nsecurity assessments and asked professionals to come in and review \nprocedures, equipment, personnel, the cost to upgrade these systems, \nfor just 8 out of 6,000, was $700 million. If we were to upgrade all of \nour transit systems in this country, it would be on the order of \nbillions of dollars. Yet, those costs have not been met by the \nadministration for this compelling need.\n  The administration has barely funded transit security, about $88 \nmillion. Some of this, frankly, was discretionary funding from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security which they, to their credit, decided to \ncommit to the issue of transit security.\n  We have to provide the resources. In addition, we have to also ensure \nthat there is appropriate responsibility and oversight. That is why our \namendment also calls on the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of Transportation to sign a memorandum of agreement to \nensure that the two\n\n[[Page S9863]]\n\nagencies, as well as the Federal Transit Administration and the \nTransportation Security Administration, have in place strong linkages, \ncoordination, and understanding of their mutual and separate roles. We \nhave been repeatedly assured that this agreement was imminent. It has \nyet to be produced, yet to be issued. Our amendment asks that this be \ndone expeditiously. My colleague, Senator Sarbanes, will address these \npoints also.\n  Our position today is not to cause panic but to prevent panic by \nhaving the resources so that our transit systems are not targets of \nterrorists and that our transit systems can, in fact, provide value to \nthe support in the wake of any type of attack on a major urban area in \nthe United States by terrorists. This is a well-crafted amendment. \nCertainly the need is there. I urge support of the amendment.\n  I recognize at some point the chairman may raise a budget point of \norder against my amendment, and at the appropriate time either I or \nSenator Reid of Nevada will move to waive the point of order. I urge my \ncolleagues to support my motion to waive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 19 minutes allocated to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield me 8 minutes?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am very pleased to cosponsor the \namendment offered by my able and distinguished colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Reed. I commend him for his very strong leadership on \nthe important issue of enhancing the security of our Nation's public \ntransit systems. By allocating $100 million for transit security, this \namendment would enhance the safety of millions of Americans.\n  Every workday, 14 million Americans ride buses, subways, light rail, \nand ferries in cities and towns all across America. Transit systems \nthroughout our Nation link people to jobs, to medical care, to \nshopping, to school, and to other essential services.\n  More and more, Americans are recognizing the benefits that transit \nhas to offer. Over the last 6 years, transit ridership has grown faster \nthan any other mode of transportation.\n  These riders expect and deserve transit systems that are reliable, \nthat are safe, and that are secure.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Housing and \nTransportation, Senator Reed, during the last Congress, convened six \nhearings to examine our Nation's public transit systems, with two of \nthose hearings fully devoted to the security question. One hearing took \nplace just a few weeks after the attacks on September 11, and the \nsecond shortly after the first anniversary of those attacks.\n  The witnesses at those hearings included the Federal Transit \nAdministrator, representatives of transit agencies, including Richard \nWhite, the general manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \nAuthority, and representatives of transit labor.\n  I commend the record of those hearings to all of my colleagues. They \nwere extremely well done.\n  The witnesses testified about the contribution transit made to the \nNation on September 11, something my colleague already made reference \nto. That morning, transit agencies across the country ran extra trains \nand buses as long as needed to move people safely out of city centers.\n  Transit played a particularly vital role in New York and Washington, \nthe two cities directly under attack that day. Without the vibrant \ntransit systems in place in those cities, timely movement of our people \nwould have been impossible.\n  As more and more Americans are using public transportation, it is \nclear that transit must be a vital component of any city's emergency \nresponse plan.\n  As my colleague indicated, according to the Mineta Transportation \nInstitute in San Jose, CA, surface transportation was the target of \nmore than 195 terrorist attacks from 1997 to 2000, and transit systems \nare the mode most commonly attacked.\n  The witnesses before Senator Reed's subcommittee explained that \npublic transportation faces unique security challenges.\n  By its nature, transit must be easily accessible. It runs on \nidentified routes and at published times, and it uses an extensive \nnetwork of roads and rails spanning a wide geographic area.\n  It obviously is not feasible to screen all passengers and baggage \nbefore boarding, as is done in airports, or to check the identity of \nall who wish to use the system.\n  But, according to the witnesses who appeared before Senator Reed at \nthose hearings, there are measures that transit agencies can take to \nimprove their security, such as conducting vulnerability assessments, \ndeveloping emergency plans, investing in security equipment, and \ntraining employees--which was repeatedly emphasized to us as something \nthat would improve the security of our systems.\n\n  But these improvements do not come without cost, and the lack of \navailable funding was identified as a major impediment to making \ntransit systems more secure.\n  Early last year, Senator Reed and I joined in asking the General \nAccounting Office to review transit agencies' response to the threat of \nterrorism, and to identify the challenges they face in enhancing the \nsecurity of their systems.\n  The GAO report, released last December--and I commend this report to \nmy colleagues--found that transit agencies have taken a number of \nsteps, particularly since September 11, to improve security.\n  At the same time, the report identified significant remaining \nsecurity needs. Consistent with the testimony of our witnesses, the \nreport found that insufficient funding--insufficient funding--is ``the \nmost significant challenge in making transit systems as safe and secure \nas possible.''\n  In fact, at the 10 transit agencies they visited, the GAO found \nhundreds of millions of dollars in identified security needs.\n  Our Nation's transit agencies have made good use of the limited \nresources they have had available, but this report demonstrates that \nnew resources will be needed in the future to safeguard the security of \nour Nation's transit systems.\n  The pending legislation does not demonstrate the commitment necessary \nto help transit systems become more secure.\n  I believe we owe it to our Nation's transit riders to do more.\n  This amendment takes a critical step in the right direction by making \n$100 million available for transit security, to be allocated by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security according to threat assessments that \nhave already been conducted by the Transportation Security \nAdministration and the Federal Transit Administration.\n  Assessments have been conducted. The priorities are there. We can \nmove these funds quickly out into the field in order to enhance \nsecurity.\n  Transit agencies could quickly put this money to use, investing in \nsecurity equipment, conducting training exercises for transit \npersonnel, and otherwise enhancing their systems' ability to resist \nattack.\n  This is an investment that we cannot afford not to make--an \ninvestment we cannot afford not to make.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the able and \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment provides $100 million in \nadditional spending for grants for public transit agencies to enhance \nsecurity of transit facilities against chemical and biological attacks. \nThe bill already provides $71 million for the Science and Technology \nDirectorate to develop and deploy chemical, biological, and nuclear \nsensor networks. Public transit facilities are in line to benefit from \nthis appropriation.\n  The Science and Technology Directorate is piloting chemical and \nbiological sensors in subways that will demonstrate an integrated \nchemical detection and response system for six subway stations by \nSeptember of this year.\n  The amendment would place the Transportation Security Administration \nin charge of deployment of detectors prematurely, before the research \nand development has determined the best technology to accomplish the \ngoal. The bill before the Senate which\n\n[[Page S9864]]\n\nthe subcommittee and the full committee have approved also includes $25 \nmillion for the Department to develop standards nationwide for \ndetection sensors.\n  There is no offset for this additional spending in the amendment, and \nit would, therefore, cause us to exceed the limitations of the budget \nresolution. Therefore, I make a point of order under section 302(f) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides spending in \nexcess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not timely at this time. \nTime remains for the sponsor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, is it not correct that a motion to waive \nthe Budget Act would be debatable and would be debatable under the \nunanimous consent agreement? My purpose is not to cut off anyone's \nright to debate under the rules of the Senate or under the terms of the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive would be debatable. Under \nprecedent, the point of order should not be made until all time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I withdraw my point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the purpose of our amendment is not \nnecessarily to impede any deployment of technology. It simply \nrecognizes that even if this technology is deployed, tested, or \nevaluated in 6 stations or 100 stations, the cost of implementing this \nsystem and other systems--the amendment talks about protecting \ntransportation facilities, not just subway lines, but buses and \ninterurban transportation, all types and modes of transportation--even \nif you could deploy, the cost would be significant.\n  Our amendment asks that this budget recognize those significant \ncosts.\n  Again, there is no question that the chairman has tried his best to \ncome up with the resources to try to meet this need. But the need is so \nstaggering--billions and billions of dollars. The funds in this bill \ndevoted to transit security is so meager that our amendment simply \ntries to strike a balance. The $100 million would go to help systems \nbuy equipment and train personnel. All of that is necessary.\n  We also would ask that the Department of Homeland Security issue the \nplans they have long said they were going to do between the proper \ntransportation and the proper homeland security to coordinate their \nactivities with respect to transit security.\n  I urge the amendment be adopted.\n  I further point out that even if we were to adopt this amendment--I \nunderstand at the appropriate moment the Senator from Mississippi will \nmake a budget point of order--this is truly a very modest downpayment \non the cost of ensuring that all of our transit systems, our buses, and \nour subway systems have the same degree of preparedness as we are \ntrying to develop for our airlines and for other modes of \ntransportation.\n  If we reject this amendment, we will simply be in a situation where \nwe might be able to demonstrate a few projects, and we might be able to \ntest the system, but we will never deploy those systems across the \nNation in transit systems. There are 6,000 transit systems.\n  Again, it is $100 million, just a meager downpayment for what is \nreally a multibillion-dollar requirement for the United States.\n  I recognize that the Senator has said he is proposing to make a point \nof order.\n  At this point, I yield my time in anticipation of such a point of \norder.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield whatever time remains on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment provides \nspending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1373\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last November Congress enacted the largest \nreorganization of the Federal Government in half a century. At that \ntime, the Senate was under extraordinary pressure to pass a bill \nquickly. The President traveled the country giving campaign speeches \naccusing the Senate of not caring about homeland security. The Senate \nresponded by hastily approving the massive reorganization before \nMembers had a chance to study the contents of the 484 pages that were \ndropped into our laps just a few days before the vote.\n  There were a lot of items in that legislation that would not have \nsurvived scrutiny had the Senate spent more time debating the bill. A \nnumber of Senators objected to certain provisions in the bill and \nintroduced amendments. But those amendments were never considered \nbecause the Senate voted to shut off debate.\n  A good many Senators wanted to put the bill behind us even if it \nmeant settling for a bill that needed more scrutiny. One of the \nimperfections that the Senate was willing to accept was the \nunprecedented secrecy that was given to the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Although the original version of the bill took a responsible, \nmoderate approach to ensure public accountability, the final version \nthat was dumped on the Senate gave the Department carte blanche to \nconduct its operations in secret.\n  I filed amendments to scale back this excessive secrecy, as did \nseveral other Senators. But those amendments were never considered \nbecause, as I have already indicated, debate was shut off by cloture.\n  Now we read in the papers that full advantage is being taken of the \nsecrecy in the Department. Their friends and contributors in the \nprivate sector have a seat at the homeland security table. Corporate \nleaders and campaign contributors have been awarded coveted seats on \nthe advisory committees that make policy recommendations to Secretary \nRidge and to others in the Department.\n  Consequently, not only do these companies have a direct role in \nshaping our homeland security policy, but they also have direct access \nto Department officials who award the private sector contracts for \nimplementing those policies.\n  Last month, for the first time, the Homeland Security Advisory \nCouncil met to provide advice and recommendations to the Homeland \nSecurity Secretary about this Nation's homeland security needs.\n  It is my understanding Secretary Ridge took the opportunity to remind \nthe council that the Homeland Security Department was soliciting a wide \narray of innovative counterterrorism technologies. ``There are several \nmillion dollars available to the private sector,'' Secretary Ridge \nsaid. That information no doubt would have been more than just passing \ninterest to the members of the advisory council. With six CEOs and a \nmember of the board of directors from three top companies, the Homeland \nSecurity Advisory Council represents some of the top business interests \nthat are in competition for government contracts related to homeland \nsecurity.\n  It is worth noting that, according to the New York Daily News, of the \n818 members chosen to sit on the advisory committee, 11 members have \ncollectively given more than $200,000 in direct contributions to the \nRepublican Party at a time when questions are already being raised \nabout the propriety of former aides to Secretary Ridge lobbying a \nHomeland Security Department for Government grants. It is troubling \nthat the Homeland Security Secretary would risk further damage to the \nDepartment's credibility by naming to advisory council representatives \nof top companies that are vying for homeland security contracts and \ngrants.\n  At a time when questions are being asked or raised about the \npreferential treatment given to major corporate campaign contributors \nin bidding on Government contracts, it is disconcerting that companies \nsuch as Dow Chemical, Eli Lilly, Conoco-Phillips,\n\n[[Page S9865]]\n\nBlack & Decker, Procter and Gamble, and Lockheed Martin are \nrepresentatives serving on the advisory council.\n  This volunteering by these companies of their CEOs and board members \nto serve on the advisory council may well be a selfless act of \npatriotism, but that does not stop them from profiting from the \ncontracts and grants awarded by the Department.\n  Eli Lilly used its connections to use a provision in the Homeland \nSecurity Act to shield vaccine makers from lawsuits relative to the use \nof thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative once added to \nchildhood vaccines.\n  Dow Chemical received $1.4 million in port security grants from the \nHomeland Security Department last spring.\n  Lockheed Martin won a long-term contract to help modernize the Coast \nGuard, a contract that could be worth up to $17 billion. It also \ncontracted to assist the Transportation Security Administration in \ndeveloping CAPPS II, a controversial data tracking system that will \nreportedly collect information about nearly every adult American who \nbuys an airline ticket.\n  Despite the specter of the conflict of interest, and despite numerous \nwarnings from Government watchdog groups, the advisory council has been \nexempted from public disclosure laws. The American people have no way \nof knowing what is being discussed or what advice is being recommended. \nThere is no way to identify the financial interests of these council \nmembers in any advice or recommendations they may make to Secretary \nRidge.\n  With a $40 billion homeland security budget and the expectation that \nthe Federal Government will spend hundreds of billions of dollars in \nthe coming years on homeland defenses, corporate America is salivating \nover the money that is to be made from the grants and contracts being \ndoled out by the Homeland Security Department.\n  Also, being at the table when advice is given to the Homeland \nSecurity Secretary can be a very powerful tool. That is all the more \nreason the Congress should provide the American public with some kind \nof check to ensure that the advice being given to the Secretary is in \nthe best interests of the Nation's defenses and not just in the best \ninterests of companies soliciting a Government contract.\n  I am concerned about the makeup of these advisory committees and how \nthey are being used. We have no way of knowing what kind of \nrecommendations these corporate CEOs are making to Secretary Ridge or \nwhat actions this Department is taking in response to those \nrecommendations. We have no way of knowing whether there are real \nconflicts of interest when contracts are awarded to the same people who \nrecommended the contracts in the first place.\n  By requiring that the Department of Homeland Security comply with the \nFederal Advisory Committee Act, my amendment will ensure that Congress \nand the American people know how these advisory committees are being \nused. This law has served us well for over 30 years for advisory \ncommittees throughout the Federal Government. It includes long-accepted \nprotections for sensitive information relating to law enforcement and \nnational security, so there is no danger of disclosing information that \nwould make our Nation more vulnerable.\n  My amendment will require that the Department disclose basic facts \nabout who is participating in these advisory committees and what kinds \nof recommendations are being made. The American people have a right to \nknow that the Department of Homeland Security is acting in their best \ninterests, not simply in the interests of any administration's friends \nin the private sector. This knowledge will strengthen our homeland \nsecurity efforts, not weaken them, and will ensure public confidence in \nthe policies that any administration--not only this one, but any future \nadministration--chooses to follow.\n  The safety of the American people is at stake. I believe the \namendment will make the people safer and better informed.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I call attention to the fact that the amendment is \nproposed by Mr. Byrd, for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Levin.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Clinton's name be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Levin, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1373.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit funds appropriated under this Act from being used \n   by any advisory committee that has been exempted from the Federal \n                        Advisory Committee Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. 616. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \n     used to fund the activities of any advisory committee (as \n     defined in section 3 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act) \n     that has been exempted from the Federal Advisory Committee \n     Act (5 U.S.C. App.) pursuant to section 871 of the Homeland \n     Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 451).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, section 871 of the Homeland Security Act \nallows for an exemption to the Federal Advisory Committee Act so that \nmeetings of advisory committees at the Department of Homeland Security \ncould go forward in emergency and other unforeseen situations.\n  To form an advisory committee, the Federal Advisory Committee Act \nrequires notice of meetings, publication of meetings in the Federal \nRegister, timely public release of documents associated with the \nadvisory committee meetings, and so forth, including making reading \nrooms available for members of the public to read the documents that \nare being discussed by the advisory committee.\n  The Department of Homeland Security and its representatives, when \nthis legislation was being developed, convinced the committee and the \nCongress to grant a narrow exemption to the Department to permit it to \ndo its job in emergencies to protect and respond to threats to protect \nthe homeland.\n  For example, it was suggested if we had another attack, such as we \nexperienced on September 11, and damages were caused to the \ntelecommunications systems of the east coast, the Department would need \nto convene a committee of experts and people who understood things that \nneeded to be done to put the telecommunications systems back in running \norder. And they may not have time to put a notice of an advisory \ncommittee meeting in the Federal Register, or to give publication or \nnotice of the meeting, or to have what the act requires: timely public \nrelease of documents associated with the meeting to be held.\n  It was the view of the Congress, at the time the act was written \ncreating the Department of Homeland Security, that there were emergency \nsituations that could develop that would require such an exemption.\n  Also, the Department suggests that it requires the ability to meet \nwith private sector officials in private from time to time, as \nnecessity might require.\n  The Department, as I understand it, has not invoked this exemption up \nto this time, so there is no indication that they are abusing the \nexemption that has been granted them. They are following the provisions \nof the Federal Advisory Committee Act, I assume, in every other \nrespect. We have received no notice. I have no information personally \nthat any violations of the act have occurred.\n  The Senate passed the Homeland Security Act just months ago, and the \nDepartment has been operational only since March, I think, of this \nyear. So to repeal a part of the Homeland Security Act in an \nappropriations bill that passed the Senate overwhelmingly, and where \nthere has been no indication of abuse, seems to be unnecessary.\n  So I hope the Senate will reject the amendment that is offered by the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Secretary can, under the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act, exempt committees from notice rules in an \nemergency\n\n[[Page S9866]]\n\nunder existing law, whenever he determines it is necessary for national \nsecurity.\n  It is important that this amendment be adopted. We are not just \ntalking about this administration. We are not just talking about this \nSecretary of the Department. We are saying that there should not be a \nblanket exemption available to any Secretary of this Department, when \nwe keep in mind that from a national security standpoint, the \nDepartment is exempted, the President can exempt it, the Department \nhead in this case can exempt it.\n  But there are matters other than national security which are \nimportant and which are discussed by this Department. For the \nprotection of the American people not only under this administration \nbut also under other administrations that may come and may go, this \namendment should be adopted. It is in the interest of the American \npeople that they be protected and that we know that the American people \nknow who is being asked to make recommendations, what recommendations \nare being made and whether those recommendations are in the interest of \nthe American people.\n  I hope the amendment will be adopted. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nsupport of it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1374\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment by Mr. \nDurbin. I believe it has been cleared on the other side of the aisle. \nThe manager will speak to that. I send to the desk the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1374.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have no objection to the approval of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1374) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, there are 6,000 transit systems throughout \nthe United States in every State in the Union. All of them need \nadditional resources to improve their security. We know they are \ntargets. Worldwide, there already have been 195 attacks against transit \nsystems from buses in Israel to a sarin gas attack against the subway \nsystem of Tokyo which killed 11 and injured over 5,000 individuals.\n  To fully protect all of these systems, the GAO has estimated we would \nneed billions of dollars. The Reed-Sarbanes-Clinton amendment is a \nmodest first step to authorize the appropriation of $100 million for \ngrants to transit systems for equipment, training, and other security \nneeds. The need is clear. The threat is obvious.\n  I urge support for this amendment and retain the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the funding in this amendment is not \noffset. It adds $100 million to the spending in the bill. It therefore \nviolates the Budget Act.\n  I made a point of order under section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act; that the amendment provides spending in excess of the \nsubcommittee 302(b) allocation.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill in general. \nSecondly, I thank the chairman and ask unanimous consent for the two of \nus to engage in a bit of a colloquy. I also thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for allowing me to go forward first with this very brief \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, within the larger discussion of how \nhomeland security funds are allocated, there is a very clear need for \nsome limited discretionary authority for State officials to reallocate \nhomeland security funds to needs not foreseen months earlier and which \nmay arise due to increased threat assessments.\n  During my discussions across the State of Missouri about homeland \nsecurity, nearly every police chief and every first responder tells me \nthe same thing: Look, don't tie our hands on how we are going to use \nmoney you give us. Leave us some discretion on how to use those funds.\n  My colleague and friend, Senator Kit Bond, has heard the same message \nall over Missouri.\n  On the other hand, the Department of Homeland Security asserts it \nmust tightly control how every dollar is spent.\n  I appreciate the need for accountability given the Department's \nmission. I also appreciate that in many instances our first responders \nknow best how to allocate these funds and that sometimes very \nlegitimate concerns fall outside the narrow spending guidelines of the \nDepartment.\n  Accordingly, the amendment I would have offered--and I am not going \nto offer it--would have expressed the sense of the Senate that:\n\n       Five percent of State grants may go to provide security \n     costs as identified by the Office of Domestic Preparedness \n     for ``non-national security special events'' as approved by \n     the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n  In closing, I will give a very brief illustration of my point for the \nchairman and the Senate. In August, St. Louis is going to host a Jewish \nYouth Olympics called the Maccabi Games. It is a great event. It is \ngoing to draw over 5,000 Jewish youth from around the globe. The \nState's own Homeland Security Office threat assessment team stressed \nthe need for greater security, but there is no latitude to reallocate \neven a modest sum from the monies awarded to the State.\n  Clearly there are instances where greater latitude is needed, and I \nappreciate the chairman's willingness to work with me and with Senator \nBond to address this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the advocacy of the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri for increased latitude in spending \nauthority by State officials. I agree that greater flexibility is \nneeded to use homeland security funds to meet special security needs \nsuch as this.\n  I hope the committee of jurisdiction will consider a mechanism to \nallow spending a limited amount of State grant funds as my colleague, \nMr. Talent, suggests for ``non-national security special events'' which \nmay present particular security concerns. Certainly, the Maccabi Games, \nwhich he\n\n[[Page S9868]]\n\ncites as an example, would fall within this category.\n  I look forward to working with the Senators from Missouri on this \nimportant issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I close by thanking the chairman and the \nSenator from West Virginia and look forward to working with the \nchairman and the committee to establish a means for greater latitude in \nhow Federal homeland security funds are expended.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1376\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1376.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify the prohibition on contracting with corporate \n                              expatriates)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. PROHIBITION ON APPROPRIATIONS AVAILABILITY TO \n                   CORPORATE EXPATRIATES.\n\n       No funds in this Act shall be available for any contract \n     entered into after the date of enactment of this Act by the \n     Department of Homeland Security with--\n       (1) an inverted domestic corporation (as defined in section \n     835 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296; \n     6 U.S.C. 395)),\n       (2) any corporation which completed a plan (or series of \n     transactions) described in such section before, on, or after \n     the date of enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 \n     (Public Law 107-296; 6 U.S.C. 395), or\n       (3) any subsidiary of a corporation described in paragraph \n     (1) or (2).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reid \nof Nevada be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is truly appropriate that Senator Reid \nbe the principal cosponsor of this amendment because this is an issue \nwhich he has raised over the years with great passion, great feeling. \nThis would just as appropriately be a Reid-Levin, et al., amendment as \nwell as my offering it on our behalf.\n  Young men and women are putting their lives on the line for us and \nour country while some corporations have stiffed our country, \nrenouncing their citizenship, going through phony reincorporations in \nBermuda or other tax-haven countries to avoid paying taxes. This \nprocess is called corporate inversion. It is one of the abuses about \nwhich we all know as a shell headquarters being opened up in a tax \nhaven, while all the benefits of living in America remain, all the \nbenefits we would hope to provide in this bill--for instance, \nprotection, homeland security, police, fire, port security. They take \nadvantage of all the other services which are provided to these \nparticular corporations. But because a shell headquarters has been \nopened up for a few of these corporations in Bermuda, they have avoided \npaying taxes.\n  They continue to use our roads and our law enforcement, our education \nsystem. They use our free trade laws. But then they avoid paying taxes \nby opening up a post office box and a computer in a tax haven.\n  One of the colleagues of ours who was most deeply involved in trying \nto correct this was Paul Wellstone. He said: If they want to make that \ndecision, we haven't yet stopped them from gaining the tax benefits, \nbut at least let's not give them government contracts while they are \ndoing this type of activity. And when he was alive, our dear friend and \ncolleague Paul Wellstone offered an amendment such as the one Senator \nReid and I are offering today that was adopted. It was modified in \nconference so that it came back in such a weakened state that there are \nstill some loopholes in it which need to be closed.\n  That is what this amendment does. Basically what this amendment does \nis provide that the language of the amendment will apply to the \nsubsidiaries of the fake corporations in Bermuda or elsewhere so that \nwe get to the actual corporation which has remained in America and that \nwe also apply this to new contracts to corporations which have already \ninverted, as the word goes. We obviously would not in any way attempt \nto affect existing contracts. We don't intend to do that. We don't do \nthat. In fact, we can't do that in any event under the Constitution.\n  What we do believe, as Paul Wellstone passionately believed, is we \ndon't have to provide advantages through contracting with these \ncompanies, if they have chosen to abandon this country and to take the \nunpatriotic course of creating these phony headquarters and a tax haven \nwhile they are still here, in fact, enjoying all of the services of \nthis country.\n  To reiterate, while young men and women are putting their lives on \nthe line for us and for our country, some corporations are stiffing our \ncountry, renouncing their citizenship, and going through phony \nreincorporations in Bermuda or other tax haven countries to avoid \npaying taxes. This process, called a corporate inversion, is one of the \nmost egregious of all of the tax haven abuses that we know about--just \na shell headquarters being opened up in a tax haven, but all of the \nbenefits of living in America continue. These corporations continue to \nuse our roads, use our law enforcement, use our education system, use \nour markets and use our free trade laws, among other things, but they \navoid paying billions in taxes by setting up a post office box and a \ncomputer in a tax haven. One of the architects of these inversions \nwarned that for companies planning on doing this, patriotism was going \nto have to take a backseat to profits--boy did she have that right.\n  Inversions are unfair to the taxpayers who are left holding the bag \nand unfair to the U.S. companies that are doing the right thing by not \ninverting but who nevertheless are at a competitive disadvantage \nbecause of these sham moves. Last year, Senator Wellstone tried to do \nsomething about this problem, and we in the Senate agreed with him. \nSenator Wellstone introduced an amendment to the Homeland Security Act \nwhich prohibited inverters and their subsidiaries from entering into \nhomeland security contracts with the government. We adopted the \namendment. Why, Senator Wellstone wondered, should those that renounce \ntheir citizenship to avoid paying taxes--and who nonetheless receive \nall of the benefits of being U.S. citizens--get rewarded further \nthrough homeland security contracts? Why would we continue to permit \ninverters to take advantage of the competitive edge their sham moves \nhave provided them for as long as they've been inverted? Why should \ngood corporate citizens that do not engage in this egregious behavior \ncontinue to be penalized for doing the right thing and staying in the \nU.S.? There were no good answers to these questions last year when we \npassed the Wellstone amendment, and there are no good answers to these \nquestions today.\n  Unfortunately, the Wellstone provision came back from conference so \nwatered down that, when it was passed as part of the Homeland Security \nAct, it actually did nothing. All of those who engaged in these \nspecious inversion transactions in past years can still enter into \nhomeland security contracts--the current prohibition in the law only \napplies to future inverters, not those that did so previously. This in \nreality means that the law applies to no one, because no one is going \nto invert in the future in light of Senator Grassley's statements that \nthe tax benefits sought from future inversions won't be recognized. The \ncompetitive advantage these inverters enjoy vis-a-vis every other U.S. \ncompany therefore remains undisturbed.\n  The gutted version of the prohibition also only prevents the foreign \n``parent'' corporations, i.e., the paper Bermuda companies, from \nentering into homeland security contracts with the government. This, \ntoo, does nothing, because the U.S. ``subsidiaries,'' actually the main \ncompany but because of the inversions called subsidiaries, are actually \nthe ones entering into the contracts with the government. Prohibiting \nthe shell parents from entering into homeland security contracts \ntherefore has no impact whatsoever on\n\n[[Page S9869]]\n\ninverted companies or the homeland security contracts they wish to \nreceive.\n  My amendment would correct these two glaring loopholes in the current \nlaw, neither of which would exist had we stuck with the Wellstone \namendment which we passed last year.\n  First, this amendment would prohibit those that inverted in the past \nfrom receiving future--and I stress the word future--homeland security \ncontracts in fiscal year 2004. The existing law lets inverters continue \nto take advantage of the competitive edge they enjoy over other U.S. \ncompanies by letting them enter into future homeland security \ncontracts. We therefore continue to reward these companies for their \ndecisions to invert on paper to a tax haven.\n\n  Second, this amendment, consistent with the Wellstone amendment, \nwould apply the prohibition on fiscal year 2004 homeland security \ncontracts to the subsidiaries of the foreign ``parent'' corporations. \nAs I mentioned, the current law prohibits only the foreign parent from \nentering into homeland security contracts. This does nothing because \nthe U.S. ``subsidiaries'' are actually the ones entering into the \ncontracts with the government. This amendment would correct that \nobvious problem.\n  That is the entire amendment. There is nothing new here: Both of \nthese changes are identical to what we all agreed was the right \nsolution just last year. Those that have engaged in these inversion \npretenses should not continue to be rewarded for their egregious \nconduct to the detriment of their U.S. competitors and the U.S. public \nat large.\n  This provision is not retroactive. It does not affect existing \ncontracts. It refers exclusively to future homeland security contracts, \ni.e., to contracts entered into in the future. We are not asking \ncompanies to provide any refunds for past contracts or to break \nexisting homeland security contracts. It is solely meant to apply to \ncontracts in the future, on a going forward basis, not those in the \npast.\n  Failure to correct this problem will continue to give companies that \nentered into these sham deals a significant competitive edge over the \nother U.S. companies out there. Listen to what some U.S. companies who \ncompete with inverters have said. Stanley Tools of New Britain, CT, a \ntool manufacturer that itself contemplated inverting prior to changing \nits mind and doing the right thing, stated: ``Not only are we \ndisadvantaged against our foreign competitors, but two of our major \nU.S. competitors have a significant advantage over Stanley Works \nbecause they have already reincorporated [in Bermuda].'' Conair \nCorporation of East Windsor, NJ, a personal and healthcare products \nmanufacturer, stated: ``Our competitors have registered in Bermuda and \nevade paying a great deal of American taxes which makes it very \ndifficult and unfair for Conair to operate in an environment where \npeople are price-conscious of the products they are buying.''\n  It is a fact that U.S. companies that compete with these inverters \nare at a competitive disadvantage because of the tax and other benefits \nthat inversions provide. Failure to act now will continue to skew the \nplaying field against the U.S. companies who have chosen to remain in \nthe U.S. and pay their taxes like the rest of us.\n  Inverted companies have received unjustified benefits of moving their \nP.O. box to Bermuda. These ill-begotten gains have meant years of lower \nU.S. taxes while competitors pay taxes, giving inverters a competitive \nedge over other U.S. companies. As a result of their fake move to a tax \nhaven, these companies have had the best of all worlds for far too \nlong, all to the detriment of their U.S. competitors, the U.S., and the \npublic as a whole.\n  The solution for these companies is easy--come back home. No \nheadquarters, jobs or operations would need to be moved since it was \nall a paper transaction in the first place. That is their decision but \nit is ours as to whether we will give them more contracts.\n  Companies that entered into these transactions knew this could \nhappen. Laws change all the time, and these inverters knew that some \nmay not be pleased with their decision to put profits ahead of \npatriotism. They weighed the risks at the time and decided that \nrenouncing their U.S. citizenship was the way they wanted to go. That \nwas their choice, and they made it. The choice we have now is whether \nwe want to continue to reward unpatriotic companies that enjoy all the \nbenefits of being in the U.S.--our police, roads, security provided in \nthis bill but don't pay their share of the countless benefits they \nreceive year in and year out.\n  We should not continue to reward the inversion pretense. It is unfair \nto the U.S. companies forced to operate on an uneven playing field, and \nit is unfair to the rest of our taxpayers who pay their fair share. \nLet's do what we intended to do when we passed Senator Wellstone's \namendment last year.\n  I understand this amendment may be accepted. I haven't had a chance \nto talk to our good friend from Mississippi. I don't know that for \nsure. I ask him at this time whether or not the rumor mill is correct \nthat, in fact, this might be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to advise my good \nfriend from Michigan that I am prepared to accept the amendment and \nrecommend it be approved.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate my good friend's \nwords, as always, and his counsel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 1376. Without objection, the \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1376) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on another matter, this is an amendment \nwhich I had intended to offer but will not. I want to spend about 2 \nminutes discussing the formula which is in the bill before us relative \nto the distribution of the homeland security first responder grant \nfunds. Typically bills have what is called a small State guarantee. \nThat is not unusual. What is unusual in this bill is that the \nguarantee, the set-aside for small States, is so unusually high. That \nmeans other States with larger populations have less funds available to \nthem because of the small State guarantee. It is deeply troubling to \nthose of us who are from larger States, be it California, New York, \nOhio, Illinois, or many others. Due to this small state minimum, many \nother States do not receive what we consider to be an equitable or fair \nportion of the funds that are in here.\n  There has been great debate over the level of funding because of this \nsmall State guarantee. The leading organization that analyzes Federal \ngrants, the Federal Funds Information for States, FFIS, has stated the \nstructure ``of the three quarters of 1 percent guaranteed minimum as a \nbase represents a departure from traditional small State minimums which \nare typically half of 1 percent or less.''\n  There is an authorization bill moving along, which has come out of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, which is the Homeland Security \nfirst responder grant authorization bill. It also has the same formula \nin it, three quarters of 1 percent. Again, this is a rare and unusual \nformula. But this is not the time, in my judgment, to force the \nresolution of this issue. Better it be resolved on the authorization \nbill, which is on the calendar, so we will address it at that time. I \nknow feelings run deep in all of our States on this issue. Those of us, \nhowever, who represent more populous States really believe this \nparticular formula is overreaching. It is almost unprecedented, prior \nto the Homeland Security agency coming into effect.\n\n  We will save the debate on my amendment or other amendments similar \nto it for a different day. I thank those Members of the Senate who have \nworked so closely with me on this amendment. Senators from many of the \npopulous States who believe very strongly about the issue have worked \nclosely with me on it. I simply tell them I hope this decision meets \nwith their approval. It seems to me the wiser course, rather than on an \nappropriations bill where there are some\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\ntechnical problems with this, is to raise it instead on an \nauthorization bill. Hopefully by then all of us can come together and \nfigure out a more traditional way of protecting the small States with \nsome kind of a minimum guarantee. I will not offer the amendment \ntonight.\n  I thank my cosponsors, including Senators Boxer, Feinstein, New York \nSenators, my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, and other \nSenators who have been very supportive. Senator Voinovich and I, for \ninstance, in the Governmental Affairs Committee, worked on an approach \nto this that is somewhat different than the amendment I was going to \noffer. I know how deeply Senator Voinovich feels about this formula, \nand I welcome his support on a related amendment.\n  I see the good Senator from Texas on the floor. I will yield to her \nbecause she has been very deeply involved as well. She and I have had \nsome very productive conversations about the subject. She and many \nother States believe very strongly as I do about it. I thank her and \nall others who have been supportive of trying to resolve this in a fair \nway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, in answer to the Senator from \nMichigan, it is my intention to talk a little bit later in this process \nabout this same formula issue. We have a problem with the formula not \nfairly representing the needs of the large States. It is my hope--and I \ndo have a commitment from all of those involved--that we will get the \nauthorization bill that will allow us to address this inequity in the \nformula because right now, the high-risk areas do not include one of my \ncities that is one of the top 10 largest cities in America, and it is \nnot considered high risk. What are we thinking? So I want to talk about \nthat later.\n  I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1364\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 1364 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1364.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 62 of the bill, line 12, after ``investigations'' \n     insert the following:\n\n     ``: Provided, That the Under Secretary for Emergency \n     Preparedness and Response may provide advanced funding to \n     authorized entities performing duties under the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5131 et seq.) who respond to disasters declared by the \n     President''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that would allow \nthe Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response--basically \nthe disaster relief part of the homeland defense agency--to provide \nadvance funding for nonprofit entities performing duties they are asked \nto perform in major disasters.\n  Organizations such as the Red Cross have been unable to bring their \ncoffers back up because of the many disasters we have had in our \ncountry over the last few weeks. It is essential that they be able to \nbe called by the Under Secretary to go to a disaster and to provide \nimmediate help to people. The Red Cross is often first to arrive with \nreal help, such as medical help and help for people because their homes \nare flooded, or they have been in a hurricane. They went to Guam in the \nlast few months when Guam had this terrible hurricane that wiped out so \nmuch of the island, and they spent about $17 million. They were able to \nrecoup some, but not all, of those funds. So their coffers are low.\n  This amendment allows them to have advance funding when they are \ncalled to respond to a disaster and they are not able to provide that \nfunding up front, as you would hope you would be able to do in the \nfuture. I think this amendment is acceptable. It will certainly help \nthe Red Cross and other nonprofit agencies that just don't have the \ncapability to run to the bank and borrow, in 24 hours, money for their \ndisaster needs.\n  Until they can get their coffers built back up, I hope we can help \nthem with this problem because we are asking a lot of them in return. \nThey do a great job, and we want to provide the help for them to do \nthat job for the disasters they are called to serve.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have reviewed the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Texas, and we are prepared to accept it. I recommend \nthat it be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1364) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator Dole worked very hard with me \non this amendment. It was a joint effort. I particularly thank Senator \nCochran and Senator Byrd, along with Senator Inhofe and Senator \nJeffords and Senator Reid, for helping us work out the language on this \nbill. A lot of people had jurisdictions and everyone agreed that this \nwas necessary. I appreciate the cooperation of all of the Senators who \nhelped work this out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1378\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, and ask that it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Ms. \n     Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 1378.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Department of \n Homeland Security's Undersecretary for Science and Technology should \n   take all appropriate steps to ensure the active participation of \n    historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges, \nHispanic-serving institutions, and Alaskan Native serving institutions \n              in Department sponsored university research)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec. ____.

When establishing priorities for firefighting \n     vehicles in the Firefighter Assistance Grants program, the \n     Secretary shall take into consideration the unique \n     geographical needs of individual fire departments.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill to help protect our ports and \ncoasts from fire by making a small change to criteria for spending the \nappropriations for the Firefighters Assistance Grants program. I thank \nthe floor managers for their assistance and their support.\n  The amendment has the support of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency. The language will permit FEMA the flexibility to give fire \nboats equal consideration to fire trucks when awarding grants for \npurchases of fire vehicles under the Firefighter Assistance Grants \nprogram.\n  Ports security is critically important for Hawaii which imports 80 \npercent of its products. Ninety-eight percent of these products are \nbrought to Hawaii by ship, and about half of these products come \nthrough Honolulu Harbor alone.\n  Many of the Nation's largest cities are located on the water, whether \nan ocean, a harbor, or a major river or lake, where thousands of people \nmay live or visit. Suburban areas spreading out from a city can also be \non the water, having marinas or piers. Commercial ports are essential \nto our economy. Ninety-five percent of all U.S. trade flows through the \nNation's more than 400 ports.\n  In a major industrial port area having the necessary marine \nfirefighting equipment could prevent serious consequences for the port, \na State, or even the national economy. My state of Hawaii is only one \nexample. Eighty-five percent of all refined fuel products for the North \nEast come from Delaware River ports. If a ship were to burn and sink in \nthe single channel serving the ports the price and distribution of \npetroleum products in the North East could be seriously affected.\n  The Firefighters Assistance Grants program under the U.S. Fire \nAdministration is a major source of federal assistance to local fire \ndepartments around the Nation. It is a necessary and popular program \nthat has distributed hundreds of millions of needed dollars to fire \ndepartment nationwide.\n  Purchases of firefighting vehicles are authorized under the \nFirefighter Assistance Grant program. However, the U.S. Fire \nAdministration 2003 program guidance does not encourage fire \ndepartments to submit grants for fire boats. Fire trucks are given a \npriority one and fire boats a priority three in the Vehicle Acquisition \nProgram priorities for urban areas. In suburban and rural areas, fire \nboats are a priority four. Due to funding constraints, the program \nguidance notes that it is unlikely that vehicles that are not listed as \npriority one or priority two would be funded.\n  The Nation's fire boat resources are old and underfunded--a number of \nfire boats are more than 60 years old. If a fire department decides it \nwants a fire boat rather than a fire truck to meet its particular fire \nand disaster response needs it should be able to submit an application \nto that effect. Such an application should receive equal consideration \nto an application for a fire truck.\n  My amendment is revenue neutral. It does not seek to add to the $750 \nmillion appropriated for the firefighter assistance grants' program in \nFY 2004, although the efforts by Senator Byrd and other Senators to \nincrease the appropriations are timely and worthwhile. Rather, the \nintent of my amendment to put fire boats on equal footing with fire \ntrucks in the firefighter assistance grants program if the geograhic of \na local fire department makes the acquisition of a fire boat important \nto their fire fighting capabilities.\n  I thank my colleagues for the time, and I look forward to the \nSenator's support for their amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared by the \nmanagers on both sides. It provides the Secretary of Homeland Security \nwith flexibility in determining priorities for firefighting vehicles.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Stevens of Alaska be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1383\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it was just 1 year ago that the Senate was \npreparing to begin debate on the creation of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The September 11 attacks had occurred just 9 months earlier, \nand fear that more had to be done to protect the homeland pervaded.\n  In that atmosphere, at a time when few wanted to look too closely at \nthe fine print for fear of being labeled a stumbling block to the \nenhanced security of the American people, the administration pushed \nthrough a bill to create a huge new Federal department, the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  The budget for the Department of Homeland Security is $28.5 billion, \na level well below that needed to meet the Nation's true and pervasive \nhomeland security challenges. Billions of those dollars are up for \ngrabs in that budget for entities outside the Department, and outside \nthe Government.\n  The administration repeatedly reminds the American people that the \nnext terrorist attack could come any day, any time, anywhere. Do not \nthink that companies have not noticed. The Department's budget is being \neyed like a huge honey pot. Thousands of U.S. companies are reinventing \nthemselves, repackaging products, rearranging priorities, renaming \noperations, and just plain salivating to cash in on what they hope will \nbe hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending on domestic defense.\n  Some companies would like to sell their wireless communications \nsystems to Government emergency response agencies. Others are hoping to \nwin a Government contract to produce an antidote for anthrax. Still \nothers are pitching their software as an ideal tool for integrating \nsensitive computer systems in the defense community. One company is \ntrying to persuade the Federal Government to buy its dial-up video \ntechnology to install onboard thousands of airplanes to monitor cabin \nsecurity. One software giant has already sold its financial management \nsoftware to the Transportation Security Administration.\n\n  Go to the Washington Convention Center and one will find vice \npresidents of homeland security divisions standing in promotional \nbooths describing homeland security technology that would be ideal for \nthe Homeland Security Department. Publicly, the Homeland Security \nDepartment says it will judge businesses upon merit, but that is not \nstopping the more experienced insiders from quietly gobbling up \ncontracts with the help of Washington's lobbying corps.\n  The campaign finance research group PoliticalMoneyLine reported last \nspring that in early 2002 there were 157 companies registered to lobby \non homeland security issues. By April 2003, the number had more than \ntripled to 569, and this month the New York Times reported that the \nnumber had grown to 799. A New York Times editorial read, in part, the \nbig boom in lobbying in Washington in the past 18 months has been in \nthe lucrative world of homeland security where the role of new \nregistrants intent on selling the Government antiterror products and \nservices has grown fivefold to 799 and counting.\n  So lobbying firms are creating whole new departments for the sole \npurpose of lobbying for homeland security contracts. In fact, the \nhomeland security lobbying industry has blossomed full flower. The \nspring rains have not had any impact on them. I failed to set out my \ntomato plants this year because of the heavy rains, but the rains have \nnot stymied the growth of these lobbying activities.\n  The Federal Homeland Security Department is still being stitched \ntogether while the homeland security lobbying industry has blossomed \nfull flower. Among these lobbyists are a number of former aides to \nHomeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge who are lobbying on behalf of \ncompanies seeking contracts with the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Last April, the New York Times reported that at least four of \nSecretary Ridge's senior deputies at the White House are working as \nhomeland security lobbyists, as is his chief of staff from his days as \nthe Governor of Pennsylvania.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the New York Times \nnews service be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. The Times article is dated April 29, 2003.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial to \nwhich I earlier referred, dated July 8, 2003, be printed in the Record \nat the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Many Senators may not be surprised by these revelations. It \nis a well-established practice for former Government workers to lobby \ntheir old colleagues. What is alarming about this situation is how \nquickly Secretary Ridge's former aides stepped into new careers as \ndomestic security lobbyists. Those very people responsible for setting \nup the Homeland Security Department are the first people standing in \nline with their hands out. These are the same people who argued so \nvociferously in favor of rolling back the civil service laws to allow \ncontractors more access to Government work. They said that the new \nSecretary must have the flexibility to run the new Department, to hire \nand fire public servants, and now some of those same people are working \nfor the very companies that are competing for homeland security \ncontracts.\n  The Homeland Security Secretary has promised to put into place strict \nethical standards to make sure the agency's decisions are based on \nmerit. I commend him for the promise but I am impatient for the follow-\nthrough. Chairman Cochran has taken the bold step of not earmarking \nfirst responder, science and technology and infrastructure funds for \nspecific communities or specific technologies. This action places a \ngreat deal of discretion in the hands of the Secretary and his staff. \nWe must make sure that in allocating\n\n[[Page S9873]]\n\nthe funds contained in this bill, that the decision making process is \nfair, even-handed and free of improper outside influence.\n  So, I am offering an amendment to apply the same ethical post \nemployment standards that apply to Senators and their senior staff to \nemployees of the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of \nHomeland Security within the White House. All employees who have an \nincome of 75 percent or more of a level II of the Executive Schedule, \nwhich is comparable to a Senator's pay, would be prohibited from \nlobbying the Department of Homeland Security or the Office of Homeland \nSecurity for one year. An individual who violates this restriction \nwould pay a civil penalty equal to 100 percent of all gross receipts \nreceived by the individual from the conduct that violated the \nrestriction.\n  The appearance of impropriety is enough to suggest that we cannot \nwait for Secretary Ridge to issue new ethics rules for his sprawling, \nyoung department. The administration has pinned the hopes of the \nAmerican public on this new department being able to protect them from \nanother terrorist attack, and even the appearance of a conflict of \ninterest undermines the department's mission.\n  We cannot afford to handicap this new department. I urge the adoption \nof my amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         [From the New York Times News Service, Apr. 29, 2003]\n\n                  From Ridge Aide to Security Lobbyist\n\n                           (By Philip Shenon)\n\n       When Tom Ridge arrived here after the Sept. 11 attacks and \n     opened the White House Office of Homeland Security, he \n     quickly surrounded himself with a group of trusted deputies, \n     many of them drawn from the staff he had assembled when he \n     was governor of Pennsylvania.\n       But when Ridge was sworn in this year as the first \n     secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, many of his \n     inner circle did not follow. They took a spin through \n     Washington's revolving door, emerging as lobbyists whose \n     corporate clients want contracts from Ridge's multibillion-\n     dollar agency.\n       Lobbying disclosure forms filed in Congress show that at \n     least four of Ridge's deputies at the White House office are \n     now working as ``homeland security'' lobbyists, as is a chief \n     of staff from his days as Pennsylvania governor.\n       They are a small part of a booming new lobbying business in \n     Washington that is focused on helping large corporations get \n     a share of the billions of dollars that will be spent by the \n     vast domestic-security bureaucracy that Ridge oversees.\n       Ridge and the Homeland Security Department, with a budget \n     of about $40 billion this year, are obvious targets for an \n     array of industries and their lobbyists in the capital.\n       ``My one year is up, so I can lobby him and lobby the White \n     House and lobby the Hill,'' said Rebecca Halkias, who was \n     Ridge's legislative affairs director in the White House, \n     referring to the one-year ban on contacts between former \n     senior government officials and their colleagues.\n       Halkias, who also managed Ridge's Washington office when he \n     was governor, is now a partner in a lobbying company, C2 \n     Group, and congressional filings show that her clients \n     include Tyco electronics, which is eager to sell its wireless \n     communications systems to government emergency-response \n     agencies.\n       ``I'm not really comfortable talking about homeland \n     security lobbying,'' Halkias said in a brief telephone \n     interview, declining to answer most questions. Asked if she \n     was concerned about any conflict of interest in lobbying \n     Ridge, she said, ``This conversation is over,'' and hung up.\n       There is nothing unusual about former government workers \n     lobbying their old colleagues. The surprising thing about \n     Ridge's former aides is how quickly they chose to take up new \n     careers as domestic-security lobbyists.\n       Ridge's spokesmen at the Homeland Security Department said \n     that he was giving no special attention to products that were \n     being promoted by lobbyists who had worked for him at the \n     White House or in Pennsylvania.\n       The boom in domestic-security lobbying is viewed \n     skeptically by government watchdog groups, which say they \n     intend to monitor closely how the department spends its money \n     and how Congress appropriates money to Ridge.\n       ``Homeland Security appears to be viewed by the lobbying \n     firms as a huge honey pot,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president \n     of Democracy 21, a group that advocates restrictions on \n     corporate lobbying.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 8, 2003]\n\n                     Opinion: Security Against Pork\n\n       The big boom in lobbying in Washington in the past 18 \n     months has been in the lucrative world of homeland security, \n     where the roll of new registrants intent on selling the \n     government antiterror products and services has grown \n     fivefold, to 799 and counting. That is a whole new level of \n     competitive importuning, contact wooing and just plain \n     salivating after this year's $30 billion budget at the new \n     Department of Homeland Security. The more polished capital \n     lobbyists usually work with some subtlety. Still, as The New \n     York Times' Philip Shenon has reported, some of the pioneers \n     in this burgeoning field talk candidly to potential clients \n     of securing your piece of the homeland security pie, and of \n     offering expertise to avoid the land mines and find the gold \n     mines in homeland security.\n       Among these post-Sept. 11 lobbyists are several former \n     aides to Tom Ridge, the homeland security secretary. Ridge \n     has assured Congress that these are proven public servants \n     who will have no inside track on reaching and profiting from \n     his agency. The secretary also promised lawmakers two months \n     ago that there would be strict ethical standards to make sure \n     that his agency's contract decisions were based on merit, not \n     political favoritism. Interim rules are in place, the agency \n     emphasizes. The new standards, not yet announced, cannot come \n     a moment too soon for Tim Hutchinson, a former Republican \n     senator from Arkansas who is now a lobbyist. The other day, \n     he sent out an e-mail message inadvertently, by his account \n     about a client, an Arkansas maker of antidotes to germ \n     warfare. The client's Washington schedule includes a meeting \n     with Asa Hutchinson, the lobbyist's brother, who also happens \n     to be an undersecretary of homeland security. The e-mail \n     wound up in the hands of rival lobbyists and, soon after, The \n     Washington Post. Both brothers stress that the meeting will \n     be social, not business. We do not doubt this, thanks to the \n     disclosure of the e-mail note. But we avidly await the tough \n     lobbying standards promised by Ridge to see security from \n     politics established as one of the hallmarks of homeland \n     security.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I read it, this amendment would single \nout employees of the new Department of Homeland Security and have \ndifferent standards for them compared with other executive branch \nemployees.\n  We have come to appreciate the government-wide ethics standards as \nrepresenting a level playing field that has been the foundation of \nother Federal ethic laws as well; a single government-wide system of \npublic financial disclosure requirements where officials, officers, and \nemployees of the Federal Government has been in place for the last 14 \nyears. The government-wide Ethics Act of 1989 created a level playing \nfield for all three branches of Government. This act was a successful \nbipartisan effort to reform and strengthen Federal ethics standards. \nThe goal of uniformity is a recurring theme in the legislative history \nof that act.\n  This amendment would break the equanimity of the current system. When \nwe start treating one Department or Agency different from another, we \ncould end up with a patchwork of different standards, unworkable and \nunfair, as employees transfer from one Department to another in the \nFederal Government.\n  I must oppose the amendment that singles out the new Department of \nHomeland Security for different treatment than other executive branch \nagencies and departments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the able Senator from Mississippi is correct \nin stating that this provision would apply postemployment standards to \nmore employees at the Department of Homeland Security than other \nexecutive departments. The amendment applies the same standard, as I \nindicated, as is applied to Senators and their senior staffs.\n  The reason I believe this amendment is appropriate is that the \nlegislation creating the Department gave the Department extraordinary \nauthorities. For example, the Department has extraordinary flexibility \nwith regard to civil service rules and procurement standards. Secretary \nRidge and his staff were given unusual discretion and perhaps that is \nwhy lobbyists are swarming all over the Department.\n  I believe my amendment is appropriate. I think it is in the interests \nof the American people that we adopt this amendment. Congress should do \nno less. I urge my colleagues to join in voting for the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1383.\n\n\n[[Page S9874]]\n\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, my understanding is the Senator from \nTexas has an amendment.\n  The Senator from Texas has indicated she is not going to offer the \namendment. I told several Senators she was, but she is going to speak \nafter the vote.\n\n\n                federal law enforcement training centers\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to make sure that the chairman of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee is aware of an issue of the utmost \nimportance to the security of our Nation's homeland, namely the \ntraining of our Federal law enforcement officers who are charged with \npreventing, mitigating and investigating attacks on America.\n  We have hired a number of federal law enforcement officers since the \nevents of September 11, and we, quite appropriately, continue to hire \nmore. We fail the American people, however, if we don't give these men \nand women the training necessary to do the job we have asked of them.\n  Our responsibility does not stop there. We must retrain Federal law \nenforcement officers whose mission has changed since that fateful day. \nWe must also commit to providing advanced training so these officers \nwill have the most current knowledge and abilities as they take on this \nHerculean challenge.\n  We are fortunate to have state-of-the-art facilities for just these \npurposes located on Glynco, GA and Artesia, NM. The Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center is charged with providing basic and \nadvanced training to the law enforcement officers working for the \nFederal Government. Unfortunately, these facilities are not always \nefficiently used because there is no centralized authority responsible \nfor the scheduling of training. I believe this problem is easily solved \nby placing this authority in the hands of the Director of the Federal \nLaw Enforcement Training Center. Would the chairman be amenable to this \nidea and commit to working toward this goal?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I agree with the assessment of the Senator from New \nMexico of the situation with respect to the training of our Federal law \nenforcement officers and I am pleased to pledge to work with the \nSenator to address the problem he has presented. In fact, I believe S. \n1245, which was recently reported unanimously out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, may provide the appropriate vehicle for making this \nchange.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman for her \nconsideration and support for our Federal law enforcement officers. I \nlook forward to working with her to continue to strengthen our homeland \nsecurity.\n\n\n     virginia military institute contribution to homeland security\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \ngreat capabilities that one of the institutions of my State can offer \nto our Nation in homeland security, and ask my distinguished colleague \nfrom Mississippi to consider it as he proceeds through the budget \ncycle. That institution, the Virginia Military Institute, has for over \n163 years provided a unique environment to develop young men and women \ninto citizen-soldiers--leaders with the broad skills necessary to keep \nAmerica and its values secure regardless of the threats we may face.\n  In the wake of September 11, 2001, new challenges have arisen for our \nNation, not only to our physical well-being but also to the social and \nmoral fabric of our society. As in the past, VMI is responding to help \nsafeguard our country, by preparing civilian, government, and corporate \nleaders to succeed on the new domestic battlefields of the 21st \ncentury. To do so, VMI and the Commonwealth of Virginia are undertaking \nthe establishment of the Center for Preparedness and Homeland Security, \nwhich will bring together Federal, State, military, business, and \ncommunity leaders to undertake research, and develop new policy and \nresponse mechanisms to secure our homeland. It will engage in \neducational curriculum development, training and outreach programs, and \nnational conferences to disseminate policy best-practices as widely as \npossible. In addition, VMI has already been asked to join one of the \nhandful of distinguished educational institutions compromising the \nNational Domestic\n\n[[Page S9875]]\n\nPreparedness Consortium, one of this country's most important assets \nfor training and policy development in the first-responder communities.\n  Although no additional funding will be available for individual \nprojects through this bill, I have been informed by the Appropriations \ncommittee that a new program will be established under the Office of \nDomestic Preparedness in FY04 for Emergency Training Grants, providing \na sum of $60 million in peer-reviewed competitive grants to develop new \ncapabilities for first-responders and disaster planning. I can offhand \nthink of no educational program which would fit more appropriately into \nthis mission area, and I will strongly encourage VMI to apply for a \nshare of this funding. I would also ask my distinguished colleague from \nMississippi to look at the valuable contributions VMI can make in this \narea and give every consideration appropriate to provide an opportunity \nfor this great institution to secure reasonable resources.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very familiar with the institution \nmy friend from Virginia speaks of, VMI, and I assure my colleague that \nI will work with him to ensure that the necessary resources are \nprovided to it.\n\n\n                           Letters of Intent\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to engage the chairman and ranking \nmember in a colloquy regarding letters of intent for the installation \nof airport security equipment.\n  The bill before us includes $309 million for the installation of \nElectronic Detection Systems, also known as EDS, at our Nation's \nairports, which is an increase of $309 million over the President's \nrequest.\n  I applaud the inclusion of these funds as our Nation's airports face \nincreased security demands and limited growth in passenger traffic \nrevenues in the wake of September 11. My State's airport authority, the \nRhode Island Airport Corporation, RIAC, was amongst the first airports \nto have EDS screening of all passenger bags. However, RIAC was forced \nto place these large machines in the terminal waiting area at my \nState's main airport, T.F. Green, causing significant disruption. Since \nthat time, RIAC and my office have worked to make sure that the TSA and \nFAA are aware of this situation and the need for Federal assistance to \nmodify the terminal at T.F. Green to increase the efficiency of the \nfacility, the security of the EDS machines, and ease of passenger \nmovement.\n  I would ask my colleagues, the Senators from Mississippi and West \nVirginia, if it is their understanding from the Transportation Security \nAdministration that the level of funding included in this bill is \nsufficient to meet the needs of airports such as T.F. Green which are \nfar along in the planning process and that the TSA believes that it \ncannot expend more than the $309 million in fiscal year 2004?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is my understanding from the TSA that the $309 \nmillion for LOI's in our bill is sufficient to meet the expected \ndemands of airports that are ready to begin formal design and \nconstruction.\n  Mr. BYRD. I concur with the distinguished Chairman's assessment and \nsupport the Senator from Rhode Island's efforts to assist his State's \nairport.\n  Mr. REED. I thank my colleagues for providing this level of funding, \nand I look forward to working with them to ensure that our Nation's \nairports can successfully meet their security needs.\n\n\n             Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to engage the chairman and ranking \nmember in a colloquy regarding the increasing demand for investigative \nwork by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Rhode \nIsland.\n  Neither the Bureau nor its predecessor, the U.S. Customs Service, has \nstationed a permanent investigator or special agent in Rhode Island. \nSeveral years ago, two special agents were designated to serve my State \nbut were stationed in Boston, where they have frequently been pulled \naway to other duties.\n  Without a permanent investigative presence in Rhode Island, serious \nand growing challenges remain unaddressed, including financial crimes, \nmoney laundering, and the smuggling of narcotics and other contraband \nthat enter by marine vessels and on international flights at Rhode \nIsland's T.F. Green Airport.\n  The legislation before us includes an additional $20,300,000 to \nincrease investigations staffing for the Bureau of Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement. I applaud the chairman and ranking member for \nproviding these funds and for including language in the committee \nreport recognizing the need to devote additional resources to the core \ninvestigative missions of the Bureau. I would ask my colleagues, the \nSenators from Mississippi and West Virginia, to join me in urging the \nBureau to ensure that Rhode Island and other underserved States receive \na permanent investigative presence to meet these growing challenges.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nbringing this important issue before the Senate today. The committee \nreport that accompanies this Homeland Security appropriations bill \ncalls on the Bureau to review staffing nationwide and to submit a \ncomprehensive deployment plan, to include existing and newly funded \npositions. We expect the Bureau to use these additional staffing \nresources to address any pressing needs.\n  Mr. BYRD. I concur with the remarks of the distinguished chairman and \nI support the interest of the Senator from Rhode Island in establishing \nan investigative presence in his State. There is no substitute for \nhaving investigators and special agents on the ground who are closely \nfamiliar with the ports of entry and organizations they are required to \nmonitor.\n  Mr. REED. I thank my colleagues for their support, and I look forward \nto working with them to ensure that the Bureau of Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement can successfully meet its investigative \nresponsibilities in Rhode Island and throughout the Nation.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this first appropriations bill \nfor the Department of Homeland Security should have been a highpoint in \nour shared quest to secure the homeland. In the anguished days after \nSeptember 11, Members of both parties were able to unite around our \ncommitment to fight for a different, more secure future. The new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, should be a monument to that \ncommitment. But the Department and its partners cannot make a \ndifference without real resources to fight terrorism here at home. This \nbill does not provide those resources, and it does not provide them \nbecause the President has refused to lead on this issue.\n  We are fighting a war on terrorism that demands our full energy and \ndetermination. It must be waged not only overseas, but also at home. \nYet President Bush has repeatedly balked at carrying out a serious \neffort at homeland defense. In the face of numerous expert reports \nchronicling the terrorist threat to U.S. citizens and property here at \nhome--and the need for a dramatic infusion of new Federal funds--\nPresident Bush has consistently failed to embrace the challenge of \nhomeland security with vision or resources.\n  Recall that President Bush had to be dragged to the table to consider \na Department of Homeland Security. For months, President Bush rejected \ncalls by myself and others to create a Cabinet-level department that \ncould robustly tackle the daunting challenge of homeland security. \nCritical time was lost as the administration continued to insist that \nthe monumental task of securing our homeland could be handled by a \npolicy advisor in the White House without budget or line authority over \nany of the Federal workers tasked with our homeland security. But when \nthe administration changed tacks and signed onto the idea of a new \ndepartment last summer, I welcomed them to the cause. And when the \nlegislation was passed to create the department, I held out hope that \nthe administration would now vigorously address the vulnerabilities in \nour homeland defenses.\n  Sadly, that trust was misplaced. Having belatedly agreed to create \nthe Department of Homeland Security, the President now refuses to seek \nthe resources DHS--and its partners at the State and local level--must \nhave in order to succeed. Even before the legislation to create the \ndepartment went through, I had urged the White House\n\n[[Page S9876]]\n\nto boost spending on critical homeland security programs. Yet \nthroughout the last appropriations cycle, the administration resisted \nrepeated Democratic attempts to obtain more resources for first \nresponders and other critical homeland security accounts. Whether the \nquestion was equipping our first responders, bolstering our border \npersonnel or money for transit security--to cite just a few items--the \nadministration kept saying no.\n  Then, in February, with the Department of Homeland Security nearly \nlaunched, the President sent the Congress a status quo budget for \nhomeland security for fiscal year 2004--requesting only $300 million \nmore than it planned to spend on homeland defense activities in the \npreceding year. Incredibly, the President's request included no new \nmoney for first responders, no new money to equip our hospitals and \npublic health clinics to combat bioterrorism, and no money at all for \nport security grants. The President's proposed budget actually cut \nfunds for the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, an agency \nwhose urgent work is just beginning. It provided almost no money to \nassess and help protect our Nation's critical infrastructure. It was a \nbusiness-as-usual budget, when we needed a call to arms to address the \ndire new threats confronting us. And that timid request drove the \nbudget debate this spring and shaped the broad contours of the \nappropriations bill before us.\n  I can hardly overstate the gravity of this failure to lead. The \nFederal Government may have no more fundamental obligation than to \nprovide for the common defense. Today, as September 11 so painfully \nshowed us, that means more than building a strong military and \ndeploying our outstanding servicemen and women in hot spots around the \nworld. Now, it also means securing our borders and, within the country, \nbuilding a network of shared security with our State and local \ngovernments. We must equip and empower our frontline homeland defense \nworkers--be they Customs inspectors, baggage screeners, local police \nand firefighters or public health professionals--just as robustly as we \nhave readied our soldiers, sailors, and airmen for combat overseas.\n  Homeland security is expensive. We must invest in the people and the \ntechnologies that can prevent or help respond to terrorism, and that \nmeans making substantial new investments in our services and \ninfrastructure. We must employ, train and equip top-flight first \nresponders. We must hire more border personnel, create biometric \nsecurity systems, install information sharing networks and develop \nbiological and chemical testing and treatment capabilities. Securing \nthe Nation's ports, as well as chemical and nuclear plants, must become \na top priority. In transportation, we must move beyond aviation and \nalso secure mass transit, highways, rails, air cargo, container \nshipments, pipelines, tunnels, and bridges. Dollars alone will not \nsolve these challenges, but they certainly cannot be conquered without \nmore resources. Nor should we ask State and local governments, who are \nalready facing the worst fiscal crises in decades, to shoulder an \nunfair portion of the burden. The war against terrorism is a national \nfight, and a substantial portion of the financial responsibility falls \nto the Federal Government.\n\n  That is why, in February, I called for an additional $16 billion for \nhomeland security in fiscal year 2004, including an additional $7.5 \nbillion for grants for first responders. My proposal advocated \nsignificant new resources for port security grants, public health \npreparedness, heightened security in all modes of transportation, \ncritical infrastructure protection, and more. I argued that we must \napproach homeland security with the same urgency, and resources, that \nwe would deploy against terrorists overseas. In the same vein, last \nmonth I sought to authorize $10 billion for first responders in fiscal \nyear 2004 during consideration of S. 1245, a bill to improve the \nprocess for distributing first responder grants to State and local \ngovernments, in the Governmental Affairs Committee. Unfortunately, my \namendment was rejected on a party-line vote.\n  An expert task force has recently delivered the same message about \nthe urgent needs of our first responders. An Independent Task Force of \nthe Council on Foreign Relations, led by former Senator Warren Rudman \nand former White House terrorism adviser Richard Clarke, called for \nbillions more to equip and train the Nation's first responders. The \nreport's title says it all: ``Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously \nUnprepared.'' The task force, which included a former Director of the \nFBI and CIA as well as a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nfound a nation still ``dangerously ill-prepared to handle catastrophic \nattack on U.S. soil.'' It found fire departments without proper \nbreathing apparatuses and interoperable radios, cities without the \nmeans to determine whether terrorists had struck with dangerous \nchemicals or other hazardous materials, and public health labs \nincapable of responding to a chemical or biological attack. This expert \ntask force concluded that government would need to spend an additional \n$98.4 billion over 5 years to prepare the Nation's first responders. \nThe administration's response to the warning from this respected \ncommission? The administration brushed off the report's spending \nrecommendation as ``grossly inflated.''\n  The administration simply cannot be listening to our first \nresponders. Far from seeming inflated, the funding recommendations of \nthe task force report only corroborated what I have heard from first \nresponders around the country, including testimony before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. First responders need equipment such as \npersonal protective clothing, respirators, and devices for detection of \nchemical, biological, and radiological hazards. They need training to \nuse such equipment effectively and to learn how to respond to a serious \nterrorist attack. However, local fire and police officials at our \nhearings told the committee that they do not have the resources to pay \nfor training or equipment that they need to prepare for a possible \nattack.\n  For instance, Captain Bowers of Prince Georges County, MD, told the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee that approximately 57,000 firefighters \nlack personal protective clothing and many fire departments do not have \nenough portable radios to equip more than half of the firefighters on \nshift. Indeed, most emergency workers still do not have the training or \nthe equipment they require. State and local governments and first \nresponder organizations cannot train and equip these personnel on their \nown, and they are not getting the help they need from the Federal \nGovernment. The administration's own budget documents estimate that \nonly about 80,000 first responders were trained and equipped in 2002 \nwith funding at the Federal level of $750 million.\n  Unless this administration provides significantly more funding, it \nwill take us decades to train our first responders to cope with weapons \nof mass destruction. That is time we do not have.\n  First responders are not the only homeland workers left in the lurch \nby this administration. Independent experts and the General Accounting \nOffice, GAO, have cited substantial shortfalls in other areas of \nhomeland security as well. Transportation security is one glaring \nexample. By law, the Transportation Security Administration is \nresponsible for security in all modes of transportation. But TSA has \nthus far focused almost exclusively on commercial aviation, leaving \ntreacherous weaknesses in other transportation systems--a problem I \noutlined in a July 9 letter to Secretary Ridge. With respect to \nmaritime transportation, the Coast Guard has identified billions of \ndollars worth of necessary improvements--and Congress has mandated \ngreater security--yet the administration requested no money for port \nsecurity grants to help make the changes. This even as expert upon \nexpert has identified the Nation's 360 commercial ports as a leading \ncause for concern on the homeland front--in large part because of the \nvaluable goods and energy imports channeled through these ports and \nbecause the millions of containers that enter this country by sea can \nhide untold dangers.\n  Stephen Flynn, a homeland security specialist at the Council on \nForeign Relations, summed it up this way in the June 21 Boston Globe:\n\n       A government that is wringing its hands over 1 or 2 \n     million-dollar grants is still a nation that hasn't come to \n     grips with the fact\n\n[[Page S9877]]\n\n     that the threat has changed. I was more forgiving in the \n     first 18 months, but when you pass an act and you make sure \n     there is no money to execute it, that goes beyond being slow \n     to not taking this seriously.\n\n  Mass transit systems are another grave source of concern. According \nto a December 2002 GAO report, mass transit systems are frequent \ntargets for terrorists. We all remember the 1995 attack on the Tokyo \nsubway, when members of a Japanese cult released sarin, a lethal \nchemical nerve gas, on five subway trains during rush hour. Twelve \npeople were killed and thousands injured. Only mistakes by the \nterrorists kept the death toll from being far higher.\n  Here in the United States, our transit systems remain vulnerable to \nsuch an attack. The GAO report concluded that ``insufficient funding is \nthe most significant challenge in making . . . transit systems as safe \nand secure as possible.'' Yet the administration is not seeking any \nsignificant resources to secure our Nation's transit systems--a project \nthat could run into billions of dollars. Nor do we see a commitment to \nimprove rail security, although vast quantities of hazardous materials \nare shipped by rail. Even in the area of passenger aviation, where TSA \nhas focused virtually all its resources, troubling gaps remain. \nOfficials have made strides in screening passengers themselves and \ntheir baggage, yet they have not developed a reliable system to screen \ncommercial cargo loaded onto the very same planes.\n  Look in almost any direction, and you will find pressing, unmet \nsecurity needs. The administration's budget will not fulfill existing \ncongressional mandates to secure the borders with more personnel and \nbetter, biometric identification systems. Our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure--chemical and nuclear plants, energy grids, water \nsystems and more--remain dangerously exposed, yet the administration \nseems content to continue studying these vulnerabilities rather than \nmove aggressively towards creating greater protections.\n  In March, I wrote to Secretary Ridge seeking firm timetables for \ncompleting inventories, risk assessments and protective measures for a \nwide array of critical infrastructure segments. The Secretary has yet \nto provide these timetables.\n  These shortfalls are disturbing enough when taken in isolation. Seen \ntogether, they form a shockingly dismal picture of our homeland \nsecurity. That is why former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman, who \nwere the first to call for a Department of Homeland Security and who \nwarned of terrorist attacks within the United States even before the \nSeptember 11 tragedy, last fall issued a new report warning that: \n``America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a \ncatastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil.'' They concluded the \nFederal Government must invest more to equip and train first \nresponders, to boost the health community's capacity to prepare for and \nrespond to chemical or biological attacks, and to improve \ntransportation security beyond commercial aviation. Several months \nlater, an expert study by the Brookings Institute came to a similar \nconclusion: The Administration was shortchanging key homeland security \naccounts such as port security and critical infrastructure protection.\n  Even Republicans here in Congress have called for more. Indeed, this \nbill does go beyond the President's request to provide some additional \nfunds for certain homeland security accounts. But the appropriators do \nnot go nearly far enough. So, as our firefighters and police officers \nface layoffs due to tight budgets, this bill would offer even less \nassistance to first responders than in fiscal year 2003. And as the \nCoast Guard predicts it will cost $1 billion this year to conduct the \nmost basic port security assessments and improvements, this bill \nprovides only $150 million for port security grants and would not give \nCoast Guard the personnel it needs to carry out its statutory mandate \nto review port security plans. It makes no sense to me that the Bush \nadministration is willing to shortchange homeland security. This is a \nprofound failure of leadership that threatens to undermine our promise \nto the American people to do all we can to ensure this country never \nagain suffers the tragic loss and disruption experienced on September \n11 and its aftermath.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \ndisaster mitigation programs as funded in the fiscal year 2004 Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill.\n  The Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, currently has two \nprograms for disaster mitigation, a pre- and postdisaster program. \nSince 2001, the administration has sought to combine these two programs \ninto one predisaster program. In response to the administration's \ninitiatives, I asked the General Accounting Office, GAO, to examine the \nadministration's proposed changes. The GAO report, released in 2002, \nconcluded that FEMA's mitigation programs, ``differ substantially in \nhow they have sought to reduce the risks from hazards but each has \nfeatures that the State emergency management community believes has \nbeen successful for mitigation.''\n  Congress funded both programs in fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year \n2003. In addition, the Senate and House Homeland Security \nappropriations reports for the fiscal year 2004 Homeland Security \nappropriations speak highly of both programs. The Senate report noted \nthat the committee thought the post-disaster program had been ``very \nsuccessful and will continue to be a valuable tool in the disaster \nrelief process.'' The report goes on to say the committee ``has also \ncontinued funding for the national pre-disaster mitigation fund, \nbelieving that a balance in pre- and post-disaster mitigation funds \nallows for greater flexibility in emergency management at the local \nlevel.''\n  The House Appropriations Committee also reviewed the two programs \nfavorably. The House committee report said the ``postdisaster hazard \nmitigation grant program is an effective mechanism to ensure mitigation \nactivities are undertaken when the need is most apparent, which is \nimmediately after a disaster strikes. When used in conjunction with the \npre-disaster mitigation grant program, a comprehensive mitigation \nstrategy can be accomplished.''\n  I look forward to Congress's continued support for these two \nimportant programs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member as \nwell as Senator Stevens for working with me on my amendment that was \napproved unanimously last night by this body. This amendment had two \nparts: first, it would allow the Coast Guard Research and Development \nCenter to maintain the funding level necessary to keep it functioning \nat current capacity; and second, it would mandate a comprehensive \nreview of the Coast Guard's system for developing new technologies to \nmeet the fleet's needs.\n  This legislation is critically important because without it, the \nCoast Guard R Center's exceptional scientists, researchers, and other \nemployees, who work under the excellent leadership of CPT Francis \nDutch, would not receive paychecks for the work they do in 2004. Basic \noperations and maintenance would be left unfunded and might cease in \nthe coming fiscal year. The work that is done at this facility is first \nrate. With a minimal $13 million budget for operations and maintenance, \nour Coast Guard tracks down cutting-edge technologies to support its \nvarious missions for maritime safety, search and rescue operations, \ndrug interdiction, and even new homeland security missions.\n  I am pleased that Senators Stevens, Cochran, and Byrd have supported \nmy amendment which also calls for a study to explore the Coast Guard's \nability to gain access to the most advanced technology necessary to \nperform its mission effectively. The GAO and several independent policy \ninstitutes are joining a growing chorus of experts suggesting that more \nneeds to be done to protect our Nation's ports. Among some of their \nfindings is that the Coast Guard may currently be inadequately prepared \nto keep pace with its expanding missions. This is a significant \nconclusion given that our ports are principal access points for the \nNation's commercial shipping and import/export traffic.\n  My amendment will mandate indepth study of the Coast Guard's \nprocesses for developing new technologies and will require \nrecommendations to address shortfalls in the Coast Guard's current \nscience and technology apparatus. It is critical that an independent\n\n[[Page S9878]]\n\npolicy institute provide such comprehensive analysis to improve the \nCoast Guard's approach to innovative research and development. With \nthis information, we can assure that the Coast Guard remains on the \ncutting edge of crucial technology development and make certain it \ntakes a proactive approach to addressing our nation's many port \nsecurity challenges.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed into the Record \nat this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2003.\n     Dr. Dennis McBride, President,\n     Potomac Institute for Policy Studies, Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Dr. McBride: As the nation seeks to secure its \n     homeland from both traditional and emerging threats, the \n     importance of the U.S. Coast Guard's mission will certainly \n     grow and evolve. As one result of this maturation process, \n     the Coast Guard must examine new ways to increase its \n     research and development (R) and enhance its abilities to \n     transition effective technologies to the fleet.\n       I am concerned about the Coast Guard's ability to develop \n     new technologies that will keep pace with the service's \n     expanding missions. But perhaps more importantly, I am \n     concerned about the potential requirements of the Coast Guard \n     vis-a-vis the new Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and \n     its relationship with the Department's Homeland Security \n     Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA).\n       As I understand it, up until last year, discretionary \n     spending for Coast Guard R averaged a yearly budget of $10 \n     million, compared to its counterpart in the Navy, the Office \n     of Naval Research, whose annual discretionary budget totals \n     approximately $1 billion. The scarcity of resources forced \n     the Coast Guard to develop an R architecture that \n     emphasized adaptations of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) \n     technologies or ad hoc relationships with other government \n     agencies to find Coast Guard applications for already \n     existing equipment. While resourceful, this way of thinking \n     is certainly not indicative of the government's new mindset \n     for providing a comprehensive homeland defense. For example, \n     the challenges posed by vulnerabilities in our nation's ports \n     necessitates that the Coast Guard replace its apparently \n     reactive approach to R with a more proactive methodology.\n       It is urgent that the Coast Guard R system undergo a \n     comprehensive evaluation of its current structure. I am \n     writing to request the assistance of the Potomac Institute \n     for Policy Studies in examining the evolving management of \n     science and technology development for the USCG, and to help \n     develop an architecture for its future. The Institute's track \n     record and its unique, demonstrated ability to address these \n     issues are very clear. I strongly encourage you to bring to \n     bear the necessary skills that are required to pursue such a \n     study in the immediate term, and to work with the appropriate \n     components of the Administration in doing so. I look forward \n     to working with you on this important endeavor, and to \n     securing support for the Institute on this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Potomac Institute for\n\n\n                                               Policy Studies,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, June 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: The Potomac Institute for Policy \n     Studies, a not-for-profit think-and-do organization, \n     appreciates your request for assistance and gratefully \n     accepts the challenge. Examining the evolving management of \n     science and technology (S) development for the U.S. Coast \n     Guard (USCG) is a matter of serious importance, one that the \n     Institute has considered at great length. There has never \n     been a more appropriate time to undertake such a study, and \n     the Institute's track record and unique ability make it a \n     logical home for such a project.\n       Potomac understands the need for an appropriate and \n     comprehensive set of technologies to counter emerging threats \n     and new missions. Our work with the New York Police \n     Department (NYPD) and other first responder organizations \n     enables us to understand the role of the Coast Guard as law \n     enforcement entity, while our ongoing, extensive work with \n     the Services gives us insight into the USCG's role as a \n     military organization. It is of fundamental importance, as \n     you clearly recognize Senator, that the Coast Guard is \n     nationally unique as a law enforcement as well as a naval/\n     military organization. This unique combination is of vital \n     importance for our future; and the Coast Guard must establish \n     and sustain a clear and decisive technological edge.\n       The Institute has examined ways to increase effective \n     research and development yield and technology transition for \n     many of this nation's top S organizations including the \n     Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Office \n     of Naval Research (ONR), and NASA, and we will bring such \n     knowledge and experience to bear on this project. Our \n     endeavors have ranged from leading extremely important \n     science efforts for the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), \n     the National Research Council (NRC), and the National Science \n     Foundation (NSF), to conducting highly visible Congressional \n     policy studies, as with our examination of the nation's \n     competitive status in shipbuilding. We are proud to have been \n     awarded for example, the editorship of the Review of Policy \n     Research, a testimony to our fierce objectivity and \n     pragmatic-oriented scholarship.\n       The most appropriate time for this comprehensive, \n     organizational thought process is now. The future entails \n     more than technology transition to Service field-use as we \n     have learned it and practiced it so well over the years. \n     Defense of the homeland requires very sensitive consideration \n     of myriad domestic and international variables that are \n     specific to our homeland as well as those that are \n     traditional to the military services. The technologies and \n     their deployment in so many ways will imply ``business that \n     is not at all as usual.''\n       Thank you for your support and your interest in this timely \n     topic. We look forward to working with you, the Coast Guard, \n     and your staff on this extremely important endeavor.\n           Very respectfully,\n                                                Dennis K. McBride,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1318\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, who is offering an amendment to \nestablish $20 million in grants to protect tourist populations. This \namendment will ensure that homeland security funding allocations \nproperly reflect a State's population, including its tourist \npopulation.\n  Currently, Federal first responder funding is based on a State's \npermanent population. States with large tourist populations are left \nwith the responsibility for protecting a larger number of individuals \nthan is reflected by the funding they receive from the Federal \nGovernment. As a result, first responders in these States face severe \nfunding shortfalls. We need to ensure that methods for allocating \nFederal assistance for homeland security, especially first responder \nfunding, considers the resources needed to protect each and every \nindividual in a State.\n  Tourists represent a significant proportion of the population in many \nStates. This is especially true for Hawaii, where, at any given time, \nthere are over 160,000 tourists in the State.\n  Since the current first responder grant formula does not account for \ntourist populations, Hawaii is responsible for protecting 13 percent of \nits total population without Federal assistance.\n  This funding is critical for all States with significant tourist \npopulations. For this reason, I am pleased to have worked with Senator \nCollins, chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, to include \nlanguage in S. 1245, the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of \n2003, to ensure that tourist populations are fully addressed in first \nresponder funding. This bill favorably passed out of committee \nunanimously. The Reid amendment builds on S. 1245 by providing the \nadditional funding needed to protect tourist populations in Federal \nfirst responder funding.\n  Federal funding for homeland security should fully account for the \ntotal population in a State, including tourist populations. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as with every appropriations bill, I come \nto the floor of the Senate to speak about the objectionable provisions \nthat are often hidden in the text of the legislation. Just last week, I \nspoke at length about all the wasteful spending in this year's Defense \nAppropriations Act. However, I must commend the Appropriations \nCommittee--especially the distinguished Senator from Mississippi--for \ntheir efforts in reporting out of committee a Homeland Security bill \nwith minimal earmarks or unrequested spending. Seeing as this is the \nfirst ever Homeland Security appropriations bill, I am very encouraged \nthat my friends on the Appropriations Committee resisted the urge to \nload this legislation with unrequested spending. I urge my colleagues \nto ensure the bill remains this way as it progresses through \nconference.\n  The Department of Homeland Security plays a crucial role in our \nNation's defense. In no place is the role of our Department of Homeland \nSecurity more vital than in protecting our Nation's borders.\n\n[[Page S9879]]\n\n  Waves of undocumented immigrants still cross the border daily, \nleaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake. Those who \nsurvive the journey place enormous strains on the residents of Arizona \nand other border States. All aspects of life for the residents of \nArizona are affected by costs of illegal immigration. The situation has \ngotten so desperate along the border, a group of citizens has resorted \nto vigilante actions to defend the borders because they believe the \nFederal Government has failed them. While I believe the actions of \nthese groups are dangerous, they illustrate the dire situation faced by \nthe residents of Arizona. It is vital that we continue to increase \nresources, particularly manpower and improve the technology along our \nborders. I am particularly encouraged by the development of new \ntechnologies such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, UAVs, which may prove \nextremely useful in patrolling the areas between our ports of entry.\n  This bill provides much-needed funding for our Nation's borders. \nHowever, money alone will not solve this problem. The militarization of \nour borders is not the answer. As long as there are better paying jobs \nin the United States, there will be a steady supply of people coming \ninto this Nation looking for work. Legal immigration plays an important \nrole in contributing to the economic growth and prosperity of our \nNation. Our Nation's tradition of legal immigration must be respected \nwhile the Federal Government works to solve the problems along the \nborder. One solution to the problem that will address our Nation's \nnational security needs and prevent further deaths in the Arizona \ndesert is to enact comprehensive immigration reform. This is not just \nan issue that affects those residing in border States, it affects all \nAmericans. We must work together to address this situation.\n  Despite the overall lack of objectionable provisions in this \nlegislation, I would like to express my concern about the committee's \ndecision to move funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant, FIRE \ngrant program, from the Department of Homeland Security's Emergency \nPreparedness and Response Directorate to the Office for Domestic \nPreparedness. As the chairman of the authorizing committee of \njurisdiction, I am familiar with the success of the Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant Program. FIRE grants are made directly to local \njurisdictions after their applications undergo a competitive, merit-\nbased process. FIRE grant recipients use such funds to help meet their \nbasic needs for equipment and training to respond to ``all-hazards,'' \nincluding wildfires, tornadoes, floods, and structural fires--not just \nantiterrorism efforts. I am concerned that the Office for Domestic \nPreparedness, ODP, has no experience with the basic needs of \nfirefighters or administering a program like the FIRE grant program.\n  I wish to acknowledge that the administration's budget submission \nseeks to move this grant program over to ODP, while promising to \nadminister the grant program in a manner similar to that which is done \nnow, with an interest in ensuring that there is one-stop shopping and \nbetter coordination for emergency preparedness grants. I understand \nthat goal and am more than willing to work with my colleagues to ensure \nbetter coordination of our emergency preparedness efforts. In fact, \njust last month, the Commerce Committee reported legislation to \nreauthorize the U.S. Fire Administration and improve coordination and \ntraining for first responders. That legislation is the appropriate \nvehicle to consider any programmatic changes, instead of this or any \nother appropriations bill.\n  I am also disappointed that the Senate choose to accept a ``Buy \nAmerica'' provision by voice vote. I firmly object to all ``Buy \nAmerica'' restrictions, as represent prime examples of protectionist \ntrade policy. I continue to be very concerned about the potential \nimpact of our restrictive trade policies with our allies. From a \nphilosophical point of view, I oppose these types of protectionist \npolicies. I believe free trade is an important element in improving \nrelations among all nations and essential to economic growth. From a \npractical standpoint, ``Buy America'' restrictions could seriously \nimpair our ability to compete freely in international markets and also \ncould result in the loss of existing business from long-standing trade \npartners. Buy America'' provisions cost our Department of Defense over \n$5.5 billion each year, I do not want to see the same problems arise \nwith the Department of Homeland Security. I urge the removal of this \nprovision during the House-Senate conference.\n  Once again, I thank the appropriators for their diligence in passing \na relatively clean homeland security appropriations bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the objectionable provisions I have \nfound in this legislation be printed in the Record. I hope that this \ncontinues with future appropriations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               2004 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill\n\n\n                  Objectionable Provisions in the Bill\n\n                 Transportation Security Administration\n\n       $210 million for Maritime and Land Security.--\n       Explanation: The bill would provide $295 million for \n     Maritime and Land Security which is $210 million above the \n     President's FY2004 request. Within this amount the bill would \n     provide $150 million for port security grants not requested \n     by the Administration. In addition, the bill would provide \n     $30 million for Operation Safe Commerce, an increase of $27.5 \n     million over the President's request. The accompanying report \n     further describes the appropriators' intentions for the \n     Operation Safe Commerce funds.\n       Explanation: Provides money for port security grants and \n     for Operation Safe Commerce. Operation Safe Commerce is a \n     program intended to serve as a test-bed for new techniques to \n     increase the security of container shipments--from the point \n     of destination through the supply chain to the point of \n     origin. Operation Safe Commerce is not, and has never been, \n     authorized. Report language would expand the program beyond \n     the original pilot program ports--the ports of Seattle and \n     Tacoma, Los Angeles and Long Beach, and the Port Authority of \n     New York/New Jersey. This is objectionable because it is a \n     policy change that has not been reviewed by the authorizing \n     committee.\n       $10,000,000 for Intercity Bus Security. Explanation: This \n     money was not requested by the President.\n       $25,000,000 for Trucking Industry Grants. Explanation: This \n     money was not requested by the President.\n       $13,000,000 for Hazardous materials permit program/truck \n     tracking. Explanation: This money was not requested by the \n     President.\n       $4,000,000 for nuclear detection and monitoring. \n     Explanation: This money was not requested by the President.\n\n                            U.S. Coast Guard\n\n       The bill provides $18 million to repair bridges under the \n     Truman-Hobbs Act and the report further earmarks these funds \n     to the following specific bridge projects: $5 million for the \n     Florida Avenue Railway/Highway bridge in New Orleans, LA; \n     $1.5 million for the EJ railroad bridge in Morris, IL; $2 \n     million for the John F. Limehouse bridge in Charleston, SC; \n     $2.5 million for the Chelsea Street Bridge in Boston, MA; \n     $2,500,000 for the Sidney Lanier Highway Bridge in Brunswick, \n     GA; and $7 million for the Fourteen Mile CSX Railroad Bridge, \n     Mobile, AL. Explanation: The Administration did not request \n     this funding and the bridges earmarked are not necessarily \n     the bridges with the greatest need to be altered under the \n     Truman-Hobbs Act. These earmarks continue a trend where only \n     bridges in select states annually are funded without \n     undergoing a need or risk-management based process.\n       The bill states that funds for bridge alteration projects \n     conducted pursuant to the Truman-Hobbs Act shall be available \n     for such projects only to the extent that the steel, iron, \n     and manufactured products used in such projects are produced \n     in the United States, unless contrary to law or international \n     agreement, or unless the Commandant of the Coast Guard \n     determines such action to be inconsistent with the public \n     interest or the cost unreasonable.\n       The report earmarks $4 million to assist the Coast Guard in \n     transitioning its voluntary ballast water management program \n     to mandatory enforcement. Explanation: This money was not \n     requested by the Administration, and the Coast Guard \n     currently is in the process of drafting regulations to \n     transition its ballast water management program from a \n     voluntary program to one that is mandatory.\n       The report contains language adding $12 million in funding \n     for the Coast Guard's 17th District in Alaska and contains \n     language directing the Coast Guard to fund a total of seven \n     Marine Safety and Security Teams (MSSTs) while the \n     Administration only requested funding for six. Explanation: \n     The Administration requested six new Marine Safety and \n     Security Teams (MSSTs) in its budget request for Boston, San \n     Francisco, Honolulu, San Juan, San Diego, and New Orleans. It \n     appears this additional funding will create a seventh \n     unrequested MSST for Alaska.\n       The report adds $202 million for the Coast Guard's \n     Integrated Deepwater system project. Explanation: The \n     Administration requested $500 million for the Coast Guard's \n     Integrated Deepwater system project which is\n\n[[Page S9880]]\n\n     approximately $50 million less than the national Deepwater \n     plan requires. The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported \n     in March 2003 that if the Administration's FY04 Deepwater \n     request is enacted, the Deepwater project will have a \n     cumulative $202 million shortfall. This additional $202 \n     million increase would erase this shortfall and get the \n     Deepwater project back on schedule.\n       The report earmarks $40 million to acquire and install a \n     shore-based universal Automatic Identification System (AIS) \n     coverage system in ports nationwide. Explanation: The \n     Administration did not request this funding. While the \n     Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) of 2003 requires \n     the Automatic Identification System (AIS) carriage by vessels \n     to be phased in beginning in 2003, the Coast Guard is in the \n     process of analyzing its shore-based coverage requirements \n     and has not determined what the system design or calculated \n     its costs. This $40 million is not based on any in-depth \n     analysis and is simply a guess.\n\n           TITLE IV--ASSESSMENTS, PREPAREDNESS, AND RECOVERY\n\n            Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC)\n\n       Salaries and Expenses. Explanation: $50,357,000 above the \n     President's request to cover additional student weeks of \n     basic training.\n       Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related \n     Expenses. Explanation: $5,029,000 above the President's \n     request to construct an indoor/outdoor firearms range at \n     FLETC's Artesia, New Mexico, location\n       Office for Domestic Preparedness. Explanation: $15,000,000 \n     above the President's request for emergency management \n     performance grants.\n       Cerro Grande Fire Claims. Explanation: $38,062,000 above \n     the President's request for Cerro Grande fire claims \n     settlement.\n\n\nDirective Language found in the FY 2004 Department of Homeland Security \n                           Appropriations Act\n\n       The Under Secretary of Transportation and Border Security \n     is directed to provide a comprehensive report to the \n     Committee describing the specific measures taken by the \n     Department and its legacy agencies since September 11, 2001, \n     to enhance security at the northern border. The report should \n     include a discussion of (1) increased personnel deployment, \n     technological improvements, and enhancements in interagency \n     coordination; (2) measures for improvement of northern border \n     security authorized by the Congress that the Department has \n     not yet undertaken; and (3) aspects of northern border \n     security requiring additional resources and focus. Because of \n     the sensitive nature of many aspects of this report, the \n     Department should provide both an unclassified and, if \n     necessary, classified version of the report.\n       The Department is expected to submit a plan that explains \n     the privacy policies that will be put in place to protect the \n     information that is housed in the U.S. VISIT system. Both the \n     expenditure plan and the privacy plan shall be submitted to \n     the Committee no later than 45 days after the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       The Committee directs BCBP to review staffing nationwide, \n     and to submit a comprehensive deployment plan to include \n     existing (direct and fee funded) and newly funded positions. \n     Included in the amount recommended by the Committee is \n     continued funding at the fiscal year 2003 level for part-time \n     and temporary positions in the Honolulu Customs District.\n       The Committee directs BCBP to submit a deployment plan to \n     the Committee for the new agents provided, and to ensure that \n     this plan is coordinated with construction projects.\n       The Committee directs BCBP to quickly implement deployment \n     of the systems as planned and to submit a report to the \n     Committee no later than October 1, 2003, on the progress made \n     in meeting this goal.\n       The Committee directs the Department to work with the \n     General Services Administration to develop a nationwide \n     strategy to prioritize and address the infrastructure needs \n     at the land ports-of-entry and to comply with the \n     requirements of the Public Buildings Act of 1959 to seek \n     necessary funding.\n       In addition, BCBP should review the priority funding list \n     for construction projects for the Border Patrol, and submit \n     to the Committee an updated plan no later than July 1, 2004.\n       The Committee expects BICE to review staffing nationwide, \n     and to submit a comprehensive deployment plan, to include \n     existing and newly funded positions.\n       The Department is directed to submit to the Committee an \n     annual review of the program. This review should include a \n     discussion of its effectiveness, compliance by certified \n     schools, status of compliance reviews, the rate of student \n     non-compliance, and the results of investigations. The first \n     report is to be submitted by December 31, 2003.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will speak for a couple of minutes \nabout the big State formula in the Department of Homeland Security. I \nam not going to take long. It is very important we address the issue of \nthe formula in the bill just passed.\n  The formula is not fair to the large States where the greatest risk \nis. The large States generally have the larger population centers which \ngenerally have the highest risk for homeland security. Yet the formula \nunder which we are proceeding is a formula that takes away from our 13 \nlargest States because of a floor put in for the smaller States. I \ndon't think any of the large States want to be totally whole but the \nlarge States would like to have more of a fair shake than the formula \nunderlying in this bill.\n  I hope the Senate will agree to hear the bill that has come out of \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs which does authorize new formulas \nand will seek to change the formulas in a way that is more fair. To \ngive a couple of examples, the State of California on a strict \npopulation basis would get $216 million; the State of California has a \nlong coastline, they have major cities, they certainly have a high-risk \ndesignation. Under the bill, they will get $146 million for a deficit \nto California of $64 million. Georgia should get $53 million; it would \nget $46 million for a deficit of $5 million. New York should get $118 \nmillion; it will get $86 million for a deficit of $28 million. My home \nState of Texas should get $134 million; it will get $96 million for a \ndeficit of $34 million.\n  This does not make sense. It does not pass the fairness test. The \nlarge States do not ask for complete parity but we do ask for fairness. \nThere is a formula we used in the State aid package in the most recent \ntax cut legislation that does not give the big States full parity but \nit does give them a much more fair formula.\n  That is what I intended to offer in the bill. It would have been \nsubject to a point of order, so I withheld. But I am serving notice \nthat I, along with Senators Voinovich, Specter, DeWine, Santorum, \nWarner, Chambliss, Cornyn, and Levin, am going to readdress this issue \nand hope that everyone will come together, small States and large, for \nsomething that is fair to the States that are at the highest risk.\n  That is a very important component of securing our homeland. If we \nare going to leave our biggest States and biggest cities vulnerable, \nthat is not protecting the part of our country that is most at risk.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I am serving notice we will try to \naddress this issue in the bill. I ask the majority leader and minority \nleader to please assure that we will address this issue in the bill \nthat has come out of the Governmental Affairs Committee so that we can \ncorrect this inequity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would oppose the amendment of my friend \nfrom Texas. I understand that she has agreed not to offer the \namendment, and instead to just debate the issue at this time. As I \nnoted yesterday, when a similar amendment was offered by the Senator \nfrom New York, formula fights are never easy. But they deserve careful \ndeliberation and consideration.\n  An appropriations bill is where Congress spends money once it has \nsettled on a formula in authorizing legislation. An appropriations bill \nis not the right place to have a formula fight.\n  My friend from Texas has raised an issue that falls squarely within \nthe jurisdiction of the Government Affairs Committee, which has held \nthree hearings on this topic this year. We have heard from \nfirefighters, police officers, mayors, governors, State emergency \nmanagement directors, county officials, and Secretary Ridge.\n  As a result of these hearings, I have developed legislation, on a \nbipartisan basis, with Senator Carper and 15 other cosponsors.\n  Just last month, the Governmental Affairs Committee approved this \nlegislation by a unanimous vote. My legislation would address the very \nissue that the amendment of the Senator from Texas seeks to address on \nthis appropriations bill.\n  I cannot support the amendment of the Senator from Texas because it \nwould pre-empt a debate that we began in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and that should continue when our legislation reaches the \nSenate floor.\n  But I also oppose this amendment because it is bad for Maine--and \nStates across the country. And because I believe it could compromise \nthe security of this great Nation.\n  This amendment would not only reduce the small State minimum from .75\n\n[[Page S9881]]\n\nto .5 percent of the amount appropriated, but it would also make the \nsmall State minimum a ceiling, rather than a floor, which it is in \ncurrent law, and should remain.\n  Moreover, big States already get plenty under the bill that Chairman \nCochran and Ranking Member Byrd have so ably crafted.\n  The bill distributes $1.75 billion to all 50 States, territories, and \nthe District of Columbia. Of this amount, $1.05 billion, or 60 percent, \nwill be distributed strictly based on population, meaning more populous \nstates do well.\n  In addition, however, the bill sets aside $750 million just for big \ncities. That means states such as Maine, Mississippi, West Virginia, \nand Alaska will not see a dime of this money--$750 million just for the \ncountry's biggest cities--$250 million more than the House \nappropriated. And yet big States want more.\n  The Senate should not be considering these kinds of authorizing \nchanges to an appropriations bill.\n  I know it is tempting to offer amendments like this to appropriations \nmeasures--I considered offering my grants bill, or parts of it, as \namendments--but the practice must be resisted. It does an end-run \naround authorizing committees, which are set up to address matters such \nas these in a deliberate, thorough manner.\n  Any modifications to ODP's formula should be considered in a \ncomprehensive manner, not as piecemeal amendments. By changing the \nformula on an ad-hoc basis, we may produce unintended consequences, \nwhere a State may end up with insufficient homeland security resources.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose changes to the \nexisting funding formula on this bill.\n  At the same time, I pledge to work with my friend from Texas to \naccommodate her legitimate concerns. Big States have big homeland \nsecurity needs, and the Federal Government has an obligation to help \nthem.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the efforts of Senators Levin, Voinovich, Hutchison, myself, \nand others to modify the USA PATRIOT Act formula for homeland security \ngrants. This formula, as currently interpreted by the Department of \nHomeland Security, DHS, greatly disadvantages larger States.\n  Unfortunately, as Senator Levin stated earlier, it looks as though we \nwill not be able to use the Homeland Security Appropriations bill to \nmake such a modification. Any such amendment would face a point of \norder and fail.\n  However, we will be back. I intend to continue to raise this issue in \nthe Senate until we finally change existing law to ensure that the DHS \nhas the authority to distribute homeland security money fairly to all \nStates.\n  In my view, the Department should distribute homeland security funds \naccording to population or, at a minimum, according to threat and \nvulnerability assessments, location of critical infrastructure, and \npopulation density.\n  On March 7, 2003, DHS released their State-by-State allocations for \nthe $566 million State Homeland Security Grant Program.\n  Although this program is described as being distributed on the basis \nof population, smaller States received a higher level of funding on a \nper capita basis than larger States.\n  For instance, California received $1.33 per capita while Wyoming \nreceived $9.78 per capita. This means that residents of Wyoming \nreceived more than five times what residents of California received. \nThe national average was $1.98 per capita.\n  However, if you look at all the homeland security grants awarded by \nthe DHS Office of Domestic Preparedness, ODP, for FY 2003, the numbers \nare even worse. This fiscal year, California received $4.85 per capita \nin ODP homeland security grants and Wyoming received $35.67 per capita. \nIn other words, residents of Wyoming received more than seven times \nwhat residents of California received.\n  I do not want to pick on Wyoming or focus inordinately on California. \nThe issue is not about any State in particular. It is about the fact \nthat States with large populations and large amounts of critical \ninfrastructure are more vulnerable to terrorism and also generally \nsubject to more credible terrorist threats.\n  However, since I represent California in this distinguished body, I \ndo want to explain why I believe that California--as other populous \nStates has been shortchanged on homeland security grants.\n  California is what people in the counterterrorism field called a \n``target-rich'' environment. We have two of the biggest seaports in the \ncountry, Disneyland, the Golden Gate Bridge, two of the biggest ports \nin the country, some of the busiest airports in the country, and much \nelse as well.\n  Moreover, with the release of a congressional report today on \nintelligence failures by the FBI and CIA, the American people now know \nthat at least several of the September 11 hijackers had numerous links \nwith California. And, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nI can assure you that terrorists and their sympathizers continue to \noperate in California.\n  Finally, we have all heard about credible threats to important \ntourism and commercial sites in California--and those are just the ones \nthat have become public.\n  However, in spite of all this, my State received this fiscal year \nless than one-seventh per capita of ODP homeland security grants than \nthe least populous State--a State that is not a target-rich \nenvironment, has little if any connection with any terrorists, and has \nbeen subject to few if any terrorist threats.\n  In my view, that is absurd.\n  Americans in every State should be more afraid knowing that a \ndisproportionate amount of homeland security money is flowing into \nStates that may not need that money.\n  The reason that homeland security grant allocations favor small \nStates is because of the way that ODP applies Sec. 1014 of the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  Under the USA PATRIOT Act, ODP gives each State .75 percent and each \nterritory .25 percent of the appropriation for homeland security \ngrants.\n  For the 50 States and five territories, these amounts total \napproximately 40 percent of the total appropriation.\n  However, the USA PATRIOT Act is silent on how ODP should distribute \nthe remaining 60 percent. ODP has opted to distribute the remaining 60 \npercent based on population.\n  It is worth pointing out that the USA PATRIOT Act does not require \nthat the .75 minimums be allocated first and then the remainder \ndistributed according to population. ODP could, under the USA PATRIOT \nAct, distribute all the money according to population and then bump up \nany State that has not received .75 percent.\n  If ODP followed this method, it would mean millions of additional \ndollars for more populous States. I would urge ODP to look into using \nsuch a method.\n  In any event, because of the USA PATRIOT Act formula, California only \nreceived $149 million of the $1.87 billion appropriated in FY 2003 for \nthe ODP State homeland security grant program about 8 percent of the \ntotal.\n  However, California has over 12 percent of the population and a \ndisproportionate amount of the country's critical infrastructure--all \nterrorist targets of opportunity.\n  If this money had been allocated according to population, California \nwould have received $76 million more for homeland security just this \nfiscal year.\n  There is no question that the USA PATRIOT Act formula greatly \ndisadvantages California and other States with high threat potential. \nThese are States that possess densely populated areas and critical \ninfrastructure such as landmark buildings, large gathering places, \nstadiums, amusement parks, tall buildings, underground transit, \nbridges, and ports.\n  Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge has made this very point \nover and over. For example, in a hearing before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, he expressed frustration with the USA PATRIOT Act formula \nand urged that Congress enact legislation that would require such money \nto be distributed based on the likely terrorist theat and vulnerability \nof a given area.\n  Most reasonable observers agree. It is ludicrous to pour homeland \nsecurity money into small, rural States that are at little risk of \nterrorist attack and shortchange States that have densely populated \ncenters and/or have critical infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S9882]]\n\n  It is also worth noting that the .75 small State minimums are not \napplied to other grant programs. In an exhaustive survey of Federal \ngrant programs, we could find only two grant programs that used such a \nhigh percentage for State minimums: State homeland security grants and \nsport fish restoration grants.\n  While an argument could be made that perhaps less populous States \ndeserve more sport fish restoration money, that argument fails with \nregard to homeland security. The fact remains that the areas most \nvulnerable to terrorist attack are large cities and those with critical \ninfrastructure, which tend to be in more populous States.\n  Grant programs other than for homeland security or sport fishing \nrestoration have either no small State minimums, percentages ranging \nfrom .25 percent to .50 percent, or minimum dollar figures.\n  The current formula for allocating homeland security grants is unfair \nand illogical. And, to be brutally honest, it wastes taxpayers' money \nby sending to it to areas where it may not be needed. I urge my \ncolleagues to support efforts to modify this formula.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart listing \nHomeland Security grants per capita.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        FISCAL YEAR 2003 ODP HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS PER CAPITA\n                      [Grant dollars in thousands]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             Per capita\n        Rank and state           ODP grants    2000 Census    spending\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Mr. President, I thank the subcommittee chair and ranking \nmember for their work on this bill. A difficult task was set before \nthem in marking up this first appropriations measure for the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. September 11 changed much about how \nAmericans view the role of the Federal Government and its most basic \nfunction--providing physical security for American citizens.\n  We cannot protect the nation completely from every conceivable \nthreat. We have to devote available resources to those threats we judge \nto be the likeliest and most serious. This poses difficult choices for \nCongress and the administration, as well as for local communities who \nface similar decisions. Deciding which threats to public safety it is \nmost important to prepare for is perhaps most difficult for first \nresponders, those men and women most directly tasked with the job--men \nand women whose bodies and even lives are regularly on the line.\n  One of my first goals upon being appointed to the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee has been to attempt to address directly the \nneeds of these people in Iowa who are on the front lines, the people \nwho are most responsible for public safety throughout the State. My \nstaff and I have had a number of conversations with the Governor of \nIowa, his staff and with others in State government. I also asked \nmembers of my Iowa staff to visit each of the State's 99 officials. I \nasked my staff to check in with people in each of these local \ncommunities to find out what they think is most important when it comes \nto homeland security, what they think is working and what is not.\n  I think the meetings have been a big success. Not surprisingly, \nIowans were pleased to be asked what they think are the top priorities \nin this area of policy. Security is on people's minds, and the \ncommunities that my staff visited have provided me with great insight \nabout how to approach homeland security issues here in Washington. Mr. \nPresident, I ask consent that two items be printed in the Record at the \nend of my statement: first is a letter I have sent today to Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Ridge regarding the findings of my staff from their \nmeetings around Iowa; second is the list of the locations in Iowa for \nthose meetings, along with the dates they occurred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. When Senator Lieberman first proposed creation of a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, in his role at that time of chairman \nof the Government Affairs Committee, I supported his effort. We knew \nthen that balancing, and probably shifting, among competing priorities \nwould be a challenge. We must do all we can to safeguard the vital \ninterests of the Nation form the threat of terrorism. But it remains \nessential that we don't disregard the need to protect people from \nother, more likely hazards, especially in areas away from large towns \nand critical assets.\n  We must not merely redirect funds badly needed current programs, \ncreating new holes in our security infrastructure. In fact, we should \nseek wherever it is possible to expand and strengthen existing \nemergency response mechanisms. We should increase their capacity in \nways that allow local authorities to prevent or respond to terrorist \nthreats while also helping them to deal better with the much more \ncommon threats and emergencies they face. I believe this is possible.\n\n  Iowans told my staff that the biggest challenges Iowans face today \ninclude many of the same problems they faced in June of 2000: crime, \nthe methamphetamine scourge, natural disasters.\n  Over the past several years, FEMA, now part of Homeland Security, has \nbecome a truly remarkable and world-class organization for dealing with \nfires, floods, tornadoes and earthquakes. These occur every year, \nregardless of other threats, and they continue to take away lives and \nlivelihoods. Earlier this week, a tornado hit Cedar Rapids, IA, and \ncaused damage to 25 homes. We cannot back away from our commitment to \nhelp people in need due to these natural disasters. One example of \nmaking sure we continue that commitment is the successful fight that I \nand others have undertaken to ensure that the fire grant program is \nretained.\n  There is also no question that many Iowans feel that their world \nchanged on 9/11. People want their families to be safe from terrorist \nthreats. Larry Hurst is County Emergency Management Director in \nGlenwood, IA, which is in Southwest Iowa. He is afraid that Iowa could \nbe comparatively neglected in this regard, that we might ``find it easy \nto cut public safety, defense and health funding, betting that nothing \nwill happen here.'' Of course, we hope that no terrorist incidents do \noccur in Iowa. But, we are only as strong as the network of first \nresponders throughout the Nation.\n  First responders in my State tell me that they are frustrated. When \nthe alert level changes, they learn about it from CNN, not from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. They don't know why the alert level is \nraised, or which kinds of threats they ought to look for. Mahala Cox, \nthe Emergency Manager in my home county. Warren County, says that ``we \ncannot afford to be behind the curve and reacting to a media\n\n[[Page S9883]]\n\nmessage.'' People like Ms. Cox must respond to vague mandates they \ndon't fully understand, taking time away from other pursuits. Mandates \nare unclear, and can be costly. While some money is flowing, \ncommunities are unsure how exactly they should be spending it, and they \nfear spending it in a way that might not meet a later mandate.\n  At the same time, some current reporting requirements are onerous and \nillogical. One county emergency manager in Iowa relayed to my staff \nthat they are required to report on contingency plans in case there is \na tidal wave, and they understand they are not allowed to answer ``not \napplicable.'' I suspect if a tidal wave big enough to cause damage in \nIowa were to hit the U.S. our least concern would be what a given \ncounty emergency manager plans to do about it. These increased burdens \nare coming at a time when State and local governments are hurting. Many \nalready are laying off police, fire, and emergency management \npersonnel. The vast majority of firefighters in the United States are \nvolunteer, increased training requirements for these personnel, while \nuseful, might be very burdensome at a time when we are already losing \nfirefighters in Iowa. If we at the Federal level are to create \nmandates, funds must follow those, mandates.\n  Walter ``Ned'' Wright is the Emergency Management Director in Linn \nCounty, IA, which is home to Cedar Rapids, one of the State's larger \ncities. He spoke to my staff about reporting requirements. He talked \nabout ``analysis paralysis,'' which he described as ``assessment after \nassessment, and blue ribbon panel assessments, but no real results.\n  Law enforcement and first responders are being watchful of Government \nwaste. They are worried that we are reinventing the wheel. I share \ntheir concern. I was concerned to hear of the great costs incurred by \ncertain communities in my State to protect critical asset bridges. I \nwant to make sure that communities are made whole for necessary \nexpenses, but I also want to make sure that The Department spends its \nmoney in a way that isn't wasteful. The security of our homeland is so \ncritical that we can't afford to waste a single penny. I would be happy \nto work with my colleagues and the Department to help to identify ways \nto be more efficient.\n  I am pleased with language in the report requiring the Department to \nestablish clearly defined standards for all levels of government \nemergency preparedness, and detailing the costs of meeting these \nstandards, and to take into account heir opinions.\n  I think the committee has done a commendable job at trying to \nmaintain funding for the kinds of programs I was most concerned with, \nparticularly three emergency programs that are close to my heart--\nEmergency Management Performance Grants, Firefighter Assistance Grants, \nand Hazard Mitigation Grants, through I was disappointed with the cuts \nto the Hazard Mitigation Grants last year from 15 percent of public and \nindividual assistance to only 7.5 percent for post-disaster mitigation \nand $150 million for pre-disaster mitigation. I would like to see this \nreturned to the 15 percentage level. In Iowa, this program has been \nsuccessfully used to reduce the damage from future disasters. In many \ncases, it saves the Government money in the long run by avoiding the \ncosts of repairing dangerously placed structures that are repeated \ndamaged.\n  Finally, I would like to mention the subject of agri-terrorism. As my \ncolleagues know, a major agri-terrorism event could easily cause \nbillions of dollars in losses. Anyone who has spent time in rural \nAmerica knows the difficulty in trying to guard against every avenue \nthrough which agriculture could be attacked. It is impossible. The key \nfor protecting U.S. agriculture is making sure our intelligence and \nresponse capacities are in place to both prevent acts of terrorism in \nthe first place, and respond quickly, should an attack occur, to limit \nthe damage. I think we are still falling short on response. I am very \ndisappointed not to see more resources directed to building the \ncapacity of our agricultural first response system. I think we really \nneed to take a hard look, and make sure we are doing all we can to \nprotect U.S. agriculture and rural communities.\n  I have been working closely with the State of Iowa, particularly with \nthe state Homeland Security director, Ellen Gordon, on appropriate \nState and Federal responses to agi-terror. The State has been working \novertime trying to map out a comprehensive plan to deal with this very \ndifficult issue. I applaud their work, and look forward to working with \nthem and with my colleagues as we move forward to improving our \ncapability to respond to this very serious and very real threat.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2003.\n     Secretary Tom Ridge,\n     U.S. Department of Homeland Security,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Ridge: This June and July, members of my \n     staff traveled to every county in Iowa to better understand \n     the needs of local first responders and emergency management \n     officials. Please find enclosed a more thorough summary of \n     the comments provided to me by those public officials. I hope \n     that you find it as helpful as I have.\n       I would appreciate it if the Department could comment on \n     some of the broader recurring themes of their reports, \n     including, but not limited to, those items I will discuss in \n     this letter. As a member of the Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Subcommittee in the Senate, I understand some \n     of the difficulties inherent in pulling together a broad \n     agency with a unified mission.\n       I fully supported legislation creating this agency. We knew \n     then that balancing, and probably shifting, among competing \n     priorities would be a challenge. We must do all we can to \n     safeguard the vital interests of the nation from the threat \n     of terrorism. But it remains essential that we don't \n     disregard the need to protect people from other, more likely \n     hazards, especially in areas away from large towns and assets \n     that have been identified by the Department as critical. As \n     evidenced by the Oklahoma City bombing, anyone could be \n     targeted. Also, it is critical to maintain the ability local \n     departments currently have to respond to the things they \n     always have; fires, floods, tornadoes, and crime. In order to \n     do so, I think it is critical to make sure that we keep the \n     lines of communication open between the rule makers and \n     public safety officials.\n       To that end, allow me to summarize the administrative \n     issues that seemed to arise most often. Topping almost \n     everyone's list was the desire for more information about \n     terror alert level elevation. Public officials have \n     complained that they learn of the increased alert level from \n     CNN before they hear from DHS. Upon receipt of this \n     information, they are not sure how they should alter their \n     current behavior, if at all. It was suggested in these \n     meetings between my staff and local officials that better \n     intelligence from DHS as to specific threats could eliminate \n     unnecessary cost to departments and limit complacency among \n     citizens.\n       Another near-universal concern is the relationship of \n     mandates to funding. The time and manpower needed to complete \n     various emergency management plans come out of local budgets \n     that are already stretched. One county emergency manager in \n     Iowa relayed to my staff that they are required to report on \n     contingency plans in case there is a tidal wave, and they \n     understand that they are not allowed to answer ``not \n     applicable.'' At the same time, these communities are laying \n     off firefighters and police officers due to budget \n     constraints.\n       Training requirements are also difficult to cover for many \n     small departments. While they may be reimbursed for the \n     training itself, they may also have to pay overtime to cover \n     for the missing staff. The vast majority of fire departments \n     in Iowa are volunteer, so leaving a duty station for training \n     means using vacation time from a paying job. This costs many \n     departments valuable personnel.\n       On the other hand, there are funds flowing for equipment, \n     but localities claim that guidance on how those funds could \n     be best spent is not available from the federal level. If \n     that is the case, is guidance planned in the near future, and \n     if so, would that guidance require further equipment \n     expenditures? I understand that many communities still have \n     cold war era siren alert systems. What is the feasibility of \n     more advanced equipment, like radios, or more advanced siren \n     technology?\n       There is broad support for many of the grant formulae, such \n     as Fire Grants, that go straight to local departments from \n     the federal level. I have been a long time supporter of the \n     program, first in the authorization, then as a member of VA/\n     HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, and \n     now as a member of Homeland Security. It is my hope that DHS \n     will list programs like Assistance to Firefighters, Hazard \n     Mitigation Grants, and Emergency Management Performance \n     Grants individually in its budget request to Congress, and \n     will request increased funding for these accounts in future \n     years as needs grow.\n       Law enforcement and first responders are being watchful of \n     government waste. They are worried that we are ``reinventing \n     the wheel.'' It is my hope to work with you to make sure that \n     we do our best to weed out duplicative and overly burdensome \n     requirements so that we may find best practices to\n\n[[Page S9884]]\n\n     more effectively strengthen the nationwide network of first \n     responders.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Harkin,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n\n                   Summary of Comments From Counties\n\n       Homeland Security Alerts are received via CNN instead of \n     through formal Homeland Security Channels.\n       Homeland Security staff at the federal and state level is \n     increasing, but stagnant at the local level. All \n     coordination, reporting, and emergency response is being done \n     at the lowest level, which receives the least funding.\n       In order to qualify for grant funds, a great deal of \n     planning efforts and reports are required, but local \n     emergency management cannot spare resources to do this work. \n     Each country needs a full time emergency management staff \n     person.\n       All counties have the same requirements regardless of \n     county size or the number of paid employees.\n       Many rural communities do not have the means for protecting \n     the community well or sanitary lift station.\n       Funds should be used to fix security problems rather than \n     study them.\n       More decision making should be local, to respond to the \n     unique needs of the community.\n       More funds are needed for training and to cover overtime \n     for replacement workers when others are away at training.\n       Grants are increasingly important with dwindling state and \n     local budget capacity.\n       The feasibility of developing regional capabilities for \n     training, planning, exercising and equipment should be \n     explored.\n       State, county, and city fiscal restraints, combined with \n     certain other unfunded mandates to local jurisdictions, limit \n     growth of public safety and emergency management budgets.\n       Administrative burden of regionalization will be huge and \n     cannot be borne by local jurisdictions without funds or \n     staff.\n       Local jurisdictions are just now beginning work on \n     bioterrorism, and have not started work on agriterrorism.\n       Due to the specific work that the public health agencies \n     have to accomplish in this federal fiscal year, they are \n     finding it difficult to become leaders in pulling the \n     community resources together for multi-agency planning and \n     are depending upon emergency management to assist in this \n     endeavor.\n       Instead of a nationwide security upgrade to level orange, a \n     state by state, or region by region analysis of the situation \n     would be better.\n       There is a need to update the sirens or early alert system. \n     Most are 30-40 years old and there is no longer funding \n     available to replace them.\n       Food processing sites want to be notified of threats \n     directly when relevant intelligence is received by the \n     Department. The rapid production in many food processing \n     plants require this because of the length of time between \n     processing and distribution.\n       Farm Service Agencies and veterinarians expressed concern \n     about the easily spread hoof and mouth disease. The plan for \n     quarantining a contaminated herd is critical. There is no \n     known action plan in the event of this or any other \n     infection. There is talk that the State's Department of \n     Emergency Management is working to compile a plan, but many \n     fear not fast enough.\n       Regional storage facilities for equipment would be useful \n     for communities to share equipment they otherwise could not \n     afford.\n       Forms are confusing with requirements that don't apply to \n     the state. Some forms require an explanation of country plans \n     in case of tidal wave. The applicant may not answer ``not \n     applicable.''\n       Hazmat teams need more funding.\n       Interoperability should apply to training as well as \n     equipment.\n       Information technology funding is needed.\n       Pre-Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 hazard mitigation plans \n     require a rework of every community's plan with new standards \n     that are very difficult to meet.\n       Training requirements are difficult. There is no \n     compensation to cover overtime to fill in for those away at \n     training. Most fire departments are volunteer, and training \n     requires that firefighters take vacation from paying jobs.\n       More training should be available over the internet or the \n     fiber-optics Iowa Communications Network.\n       Communities need more education on the nature of possible \n     agriterrorism threats, and how to respond.\n       Grants that require a local match can be difficult for \n     small communities to obtain, due to budget constraints.\n\n Schedule of Staff Meetings with Local Emergency Management and First \n              Responders--Senator Tom Harkin--Summer, 2003\n\n       June 9--Muscatine, Wapello, Mount Pleasant, Burlington, \n     Fort Madison, Keosauqua.\n       June 12--Bloomfield, Centerville, Corydon, Chariton, Albia, \n     Ottumwa.\n       June 13--Fairfield, Washington, Sigourney, Oskaloosa, \n     Montezuma, Marengo.\n       June 16--Iowa City, Tipton, Anamosa.\n       June 17--Waverly, Allison, Charles City, Cresco, New \n     Hampton.\n       June 18--Osage, Northwood, Mason City, Hampton, Eldora.\n       June 19--Waterloo, Independence, Cedar Rapids.\n       June 24--Webster City, Fort Dodge, Dakota City, Algona.\n       June 25--Forest City, Garner, Clarion.\n       June 26--Vinton, Toledo, Grundy Center.\n       July 1--Elkader, Waukon, Decorah, West Union.\n       July 2--Manchester, Dubuque, Maquoketa.\n       July 7--Boone, Jefferson, Guthrie Center, Adel.\n       July 8--Nevada, Marshalltown, Newton, Knoxville, Indianola.\n       July 10--Bedford, Corning, Atlantic, Greenfield.\n       July 11--Clarina, Sidney, Glenwood, Red Oak.\n       July 15--Ida Grove, Sac City, Rockwell City, Pocahontas.\n       July 16--Logan, Council Bluffs, Audubon, Harlan.\n       July 18--Cherokee, Primghar, Sibley, Rock Rapids, Orange \n     City.\n       July 21--Spencer, Spirit Lake, Estherville, Emmetsburg.\n       July 23--Sioux City, LeMars.\n       July 24--Onawa, Denison, Carroll, Winterset, Creston, Mount \n     Ayr, Leon, Osceola.\n       July 30--Storm Lake.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the committee \nreport to H.R. 2555, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations \nAct of 2004, to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security \nfulfills it non-homeland security missions.\n  I am pleased that the committee report includes many of the same \nreporting requirements of non-homeland security missions at S. 910, the \nNon-Homeland Security Mission Performance Act of 2003, which I \nintroduced on April 11, 2003. My bill, which is cosponsored by Senators \nCarper, Lautenberg, and Durbin, will guarantee the fulfillment of non-\nhomeland security functions that Americans rely on daily. S. 910 was \nreported out of the Government Affairs Committee unanimously on June \n13, 2003.\n  In my view, the reporting requirements in the committee report to \nH.R. 2555 and those in S. 910 achieve similar goals. However, I believe \nthe reporting requirements in H.R. 2555 could be improved by including \nthe reporting requirements in S. 910.\n  The Department of Homeland Security should indicate the management \nflexibilities and personnel used to carry out non-homeland security \nfunctions; clarify whether any changes are required to the department's \nroles, responsibilities, and organizational structure to enable it to \nfully accomplish its non homeland security functions; and describe the \nmanagement strategy the department will use to fulfill its non-homeland \nsecurity missions.\n  Moreover, the report should complement, not duplicate, existing \nreporting requirements the U.S. Coast Guard already provides the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Inspector General. The department \nshould fully describe and evaluate how homeland security and non-\nhomeland security functions will be fulfilled in government-wide \nperformance reports to Congress, and the General Accounting Office \nshould evaluate the extent to which the department is implementing the \nprovisions in this bill and its non-homeland security missions \ngenerally.\n  This report should be provided annually over a five year period, and \nsubmitted to the appropriations Committees, Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and the Government Reform Committee.\n  The cost of creating a Department of Homeland Security should not \ncome at the expense of essential non-homeland security missions.\n  I urge that these provisions be included to complement those in the \nCommittee Report to H.R. 2555.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, since September 11, 2000, Congress has \nprovided the President, our military, our intelligence agencies, and \nour Federal law enforcement officials with the resources and tools \nneeded to hunt down members of al-Qaida and to break up their \nactivities and the activities of other terrorist organizations. In \naddition to the regular appropriations bills that provide funding to \nour troops and our intelligence and law enforcement agencies, we have \npassed several supplemental appropriations bills totaling close to $100 \nbillion to cover the unanticipated costs of these operations.\n  Regrettably, the record is not as good when it comes to making our \nhomeland and home towns more secure. Within weeks of the 9/11 tragedy, \nSenate Democrats, led by Senator Byrd, launched an effort to begin \naddressing the major gaps in our Nation's efforts to defend itself from \nfuture attacks. Senator Byrd proposed that we provide $15 billion for \nfirst responders\n\n[[Page S9885]]\n\nand to address the vulnerabilities of our Nation's transportation \nsystem, chemical and nuclear facilities, public health system, and \nborders.\n  Sadly, the administration adopted a view that we did not need \nadditional resources for homeland defense. Hundreds of billions of \nadditional resources for the Pentagon? The administration stated, and I \nagreed, that we must give our troops what they need to wage the war on \nterrorism. Billions in additional resources for intelligence? The \nadministration stated, and I agreed, that we needed to strengthen our \nintelligence capabilities. Billions more for Federal law enforcement? \nThe administration stated, and I agreed, that Federal law enforcement \nofficials needed more resources to tackle the terrorist threat. But for \nsome reason, in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the \nadministration decided to draw the line on providing additional \nresources to protect America and Americans. In a November 28, 2001, \nletter to Senator Byrd, Tom Ridge, then the President's Homeland \nSecurity Director, said, ``No additional resources to protect the \nhomeland beyond what the President has already requested are needed at \nthis time.'' No additional resources were needed beyond what the \nPresident requested before the 9/11 tragedy had exposed to America and \nthe world how vulnerable we were to terrorist attack.\n  And what has happened since then? Study after study has affirmed this \ncountry's vulnerability to terrorist attack and the need for additional \nresources. According to America--Still Unprepared, Still In Danger, a \nbipartisan study by former Senators Warren Rudman and Gary Hart \npublished in October, 2002, ``America remains dangerously unprepared to \nprevent and respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack.''\n  Our newspapers are filled almost daily with reports about the \nvulnerability of various aspects of our economy, our infrastructure, \nand our communities to terrorist attacks. In a follow-up report \nentitled ``Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared,'' the \nauthors concluded, ``Nearly two years after 9/11, the United States is \ndrastically underfunding local emergency responders and remains \ndangerously unprepared to handle a catastrophic attack on American \nsoil.'' In the words of Warren Rudman, former Republican Senator and \none of the principal authors, ``There isn't a place in America today, \nthat if we had a nuclear, biological, or a chemical attack, that the \nfire and police departments could respond to it and survive the \nresponse.''\n  Only a small percentage of the 21,000 containers that arrive in our \nports every day are inspected. Little has been done to enhance the \nsecurity of our Nation's 103 nuclear plants and scores of chemical \nfacilities, despite the fact that many of them are located near \npopulated areas. According to the EPA, there are 123 chemical \nfacilities in 24 States where an attack could expose more than 1 \nmillion people to highly toxic chemicals. Our rail lines carry more \nthan 23 million passengers and 40 percent of the Nation's freight. Yet \nthe administration has done very little to improve rail security.\n  This is only a sample of the many challenges we must confront before \nwe can look the American people in the eye and say we have done \neverything we can to make them and their families more secure. Time and \nagain, Senate Democrats led by Senator Byrd have led the charge to \nbegin addressing these vulnerabilities only to be rebuffed by the \nadministration and Senate Republicans.\n  By their words and their votes on this bill, Republicans have \nconfirmed that the position espoused by Secretary Ridge in the days \nafter 9/11 is a position they remain largely committed to today. On the \nbill before us, they defeated Democratic efforts to add resources for \nStates and local communities to hire, equip, and train thousands of \nadditional police, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians. \nThey have opposed Democratic efforts to provide resources to hire, \nequip, and train more than 1,000 Border and Customs personnel to police \nour porous borders. They voted against Democratic attempts to hire \n1,500 port security personnel to enhance port security. Republicans \ndefeated a Democratic effort to provide funds to mass transit agencies \nand our railways. And they opposed a Democratic proposal to provide an \nassessment of the vulnerability of our nuclear and chemical plants to \nterrorist attack.\n  Democrats will not give up in our attempts to protect the American \npeople. We will return again and again in the days and months ahead to \nsee that we provide the resources needed to make our homeland and our \nhome towns more secure.\n  Finally, before leaving the floor, I would like to say a few words \nabout Senator Byrd's latest homeland security effort his amendment to \nhelp ensure that the homeland security funds we do appropriate are \nspent on the proper priorities and for the proper reasons.\n  Hundreds of billions of taxpayers' dollars will be dedicated to \nhomeland security in the coming years. The ethical standing of the \nFederal employees making these life-and-death decisions that affect the \nsecurity of all Americans must be above reproach. Even the appearance \nof impropriety could be damaging.\n  Yet news reports indicate at least four of Secretary Ridge's senior \naides have left government service and are working as homeland security \nlobbyists trying to influence the decisions of their former colleagues. \nTrying to deliver millions of dollars in contracts to their new \nemployers.\n  Senator Byrd's important amendment merely says we should employ the \nsame post-employment ethical standards to homeland security employees \nas we do to Senators and their senior staff. Based on the critical \nnature of their work, we should ask no less of these employees and I \nhope all of my colleagues join me in supporting Senator Byrd's \namendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no other amendments that will \nbe offered. I think we are ready for third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week, the Senate approved a bill making \nappropriations for the Department of Defense. That bill totaled some \n$368.6 billion. It is an important bill, both in size and in \nimportance. That $368.6 billion bill pays our men and women in uniform. \nIt pays for all the advanced weapons and technology that make the Armed \nForces of the United States second to none on the planet. The \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill funds the forces and \nactivities that keep the United States at the forefront of military \nactivities around the globe, protecting American interests and lives as \nwell as responding to humanitarian and security crises in distant \nlands.\n  That $368.6 billion does not include, mind you, the actual costs of \nthe war on terrorism. Our activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, aside \nfrom salaries paid to military personnel, are funded through \nsupplemental appropriations--over $60 billion thus far. But that $368.6 \nbillion does provide the weapons, the forces, the training, and the \ninfrastructure that allow the Armed Forces to provide a very high level \nof preparedness, a very high level of readiness, and a very high level \nof security. It provides the means to keep U.S. troops stationed in \nKorea, Japan, and Europe as a uniformed tripwire and global 911 \nemergency service. In its unanimous vote in favor of the bill, the \nSenate has indicated its support for that level of funding and for \nfully supporting the men and women serving in our military.\n  This week, the Senate has debated an equally important appropriations \nbill. The bill under consideration this week funds the Department of \nHomeland Security. It pays the salaries of the men and women whose job \nit is to keep safe the people of the United States here at home. It \npays for the advanced technology needed to prepare American communities \nto defend against and respond to attacks against Americans on U.S. soil \nand in U.S. airspace. It pays for the forces, border patrol and \ninspectors strung out along America's vast land and sea borders, \nstriving to keep dangerous people and materials out of our vulnerable \nheartland. It pays for America's infrastructure security, America's \ntraveling public. In every way and by every measure, the activities \nfunded in the homeland security appropriations bill are as important as \nthose funded in the Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S9886]]\n\n  So how much money will we spend on protecting Americans here at home \nin fiscal year 2004? Well, it is not $368.6 billion. Mr. President, it \nis nowhere close to $368.6 billion. It is not half that amount, or even \na quarter of that amount. It is just $28.5 billion. In fiscal year \n2004, this bill funds the Department of Homeland Security at $28.5 \nbillion, almost 13 times less than the amount approved for the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Do we care about the world outside our borders 13 times more than we \ncare about Americans at home? I do not think so. Do we care about \nguarding Baghdad 13 times more than we care about guarding our own \nborders? I do not think so. Do we care about patrolling the skies over \nAfghanistan and Iraq 13 times more than patrolling the thousands of \ncommercial airliners streaking over our heads right now? I do not think \nso.\n  I do not believe that this amount is adequate. Over the last year, we \nhave all read the press reports about security lapses at our airports, \nborder checkpoints, and elsewhere. Things are improving, but not nearly \nfast enough. This bill does not do enough or go far enough to provide \nthe Federal resources necessary to assist a community that falls victim \nto a terrorist attack, and it is woefully inadequate to provide \nindividual States and communities the resources to prepare themselves \nto respond to such an attack. Indeed, given the number of reservists \nand National Guard troops who have been called into active service, our \nFederal Government is robbing States and communities of critical \ncore defenders. If an attack does come, state governors may not have \nthe resources on hand to respond effectively, and Federal support may \nor may not materialize in a timely manner, especially if attacks occur \nat a number of places simultaneously. The so-called war on terrorism \nhas put troops bristling with arms across the globe, but it is leaving \nAmerica with a hollow core, its towns and communities undefended.\n\n  I know, as does everyone who reads the paper or watches the news, \nwhat a difficult State the economy is in. I, too, have shaken my head \nat the latest forecast on the size of the deficit. At an estimated $455 \nbillion, this year's deficit surpasses even the Department of Defense \nbudget. We have had a very difficult year in the Appropriations \nCommittee, trying to craft bills under these circumstances. But just as \nwe should not and will not shortchange the men and women in uniform who \nput their lives on the line every day in Baghdad, Kabul, Seoul, and \nelsewhere, we should not shortchange the families they leave behind and \nthe men and women in uniform who patrol our coast, our borders, our \nairports, and our streets, and who prepare every day to face the \nunthinkable of a deadly biological, chemical, or nuclear attack here at \nhome.\n  These defenders of American security here at home need all the help \nthat we can give them. They, too, need new tools to help them face and \ndefeat their enemies. They need sensors that can detect toxins and \npathogens in near real time, so that contaminated areas can be cordoned \noff and proper decontamination procedures initiated. They need \ncommunications systems that let doctors and epidemiologists track and \ncontain disease outbreaks, be they from infected prairie dogs, \nmosquitos, or more nefarious vectors. They need scanners to rapidly and \neffectively check the million of tons of cargo that enter the United \nStates every day. They need better ways to protect the free and open \ncommerce that will return the United States to a vibrant and growing \neconomy. These tools and technologies may not be as sexy and high tech \nas antiballistic missile technology, or as imposing as an Aegis \ncruiser, but they are just as necessary for creating and maintaining \nthe security and well-being of our Nation.\n\n  We must not forget that it is the individual communities and their \nState governments that will bear the brunt of any response to a \nterrorist event, just as they bear the brunt of responding to other \nnatural and manmade disasters.\n  On September 11, 2001, the United States was attacked on two fronts, \nin New York and in Washington, DC. Both locations were well served by \ntheir large emergency response teams of police, firefighters, and \nrescue crews.\n  The fact is, every State and every community must be prepared to \nrespond, or to assist neighboring communities should multiple attacks \noccur--whether it be Fairmount, WV, or Fairbanks, AK, Chicago, IL, or \nSt. Paul, MN. Many communities are not ready. The first line of \nprevention--and defense--is the local and state leadership, not the \nFederal Department of Homeland Security. While the Department of \nHomeland Security fiddles with selecting a common computer operating \nsystem, the towns around Rome may burn. These communities need \nguidance, and funding, and they need it now. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity needs to get its game face on and get moving, both to do its \nmany jobs better, and to fulfill its role in helping States and local \ngovernments to prepare for the unthinkable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on the engrossment of the amendments and \nthird reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, earlier this afternoon a \ndeclassified version of the report of the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittees on the events of September 11, 2001, were released to the \npublic. I will take a few minutes to recognize those who performed a \ngreat public service in producing this report and to commend it to my \ncolleagues and those who are watching. The public version of this \nreport is available at the Web site of the Government Printing Office, \nwww.access.gpo.gov.\n  This report fulfills the commitment that was made to the American \npeople and particularly to the families of those who perished in this \ntragedy. The commitment was to conduct a thorough search for the truth \nabout what our intelligence agencies knew or should have known about \nal-Qaida and its intentions prior to September 11. It was then to apply \nthe lessons learned from that experience to reform the intelligence \ncommunity in such a way as to mitigate the likelihood of a repetition \nof September 11.\n  This was a historic first-of-a-kind effort. For the first time in the \nhistory of the Congress, two standing committees, the House and the \nSenate, joined together to conduct a special inquiry with its own \nstaff. That staff was led by the very capable Ms. Eleanor Hill. The \nstaff reviewed nearly 1 million documents and conducted some 500 \ninterviews. The joint inquiry committee held 22 hearings last year, 9 \nof which were open to the public. The result of this effort was \nreleased today.\n  This document includes both findings of fact and 19 recommendations \nfor reform. I am extremely proud of the commitment that the Members of \nthe House and Senate Intelligence Committee have given to this review. \nI would especially like to recognize the vice chairman of the Senate \ncommittee, Senator Shelby, and the chairman and vice chairman of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee, Congressman Porter Goss and Congresswoman \nNancy Pelosi.\n  The report's findings are grouped in 24 subject areas, but they have \na single bottom line: The attacks of September 11 could have been \nprevented if the right combination of skill, coordination, creativity, \nand some good luck had been brought to the task.\n  There is an abundance of important information in this report that \nsuggests, for example, institutional resistance to making \ncounterterrorism a high national priority prior to September 11. This \nresistance took many forms. It included a lack of information sharing \namong key agencies. It included budget cuts at the Department of \nJustice for the FBI's counterterrorism program. Simply put, those \nproblems contributed to the Government's inability to successfully \nlaunch an offensive against al-Qaida.\n  As an example of this difficulty, a previously classified finding, \nNo. 14 in the report, states that senior military officials were \nreluctant to use military assets to conduct offensive counterterrorism \nefforts in Afghanistan or to support or participate in CIA operations \ndirectly towards al-Qaida prior to September 11.\n  In part, this reluctance was driven by the military's view that the \nintelligence community was unable to provide the intelligence necessary \nto support military operations. For example, the report confirms that \nbetween 1999 and 2001, U.S. Navy ships and submarines armed with cruise \nmissiles were positioned in the north Arabian Sea. Their mission was to \nattack Osama bin Laden, but it was a mission frustrated because they \nwere not able to get the actionable intelligence which only could have \ncome by our ability to place spies close enough to al-Qaida to tell us \nwhat that organization would be doing and where Osama bin Laden might \nbe on any given day.\n\n  The report makes it clear we should have known that potential \nterrorists were living among us. Indeed, two of the terrorist-turned-\nhijackers lived with an FBI informant in San Diego, CA, for 6 months or \nmore in the year 2001. A resourceful FBI agent in Phoenix wanted to \nfollow up on suspicions about foreign-born students who were honing \ntheir skills at American flight schools. Officials at FBI central \nheadquarters shut him down.\n  To assure the American people that we take such actions seriously, we \nincluded a recommendation, No. 16, that calls for the Director of \nCentral Intelligence to implement new accountability standards \nthroughout the intelligence community. These standards would identify \npoor performance and affix responsibility for it. It would also set a \nstandard to recognize and reward excellent performance.\n  Had such standards been in place 2 years ago, we might have been able \nto hold those whose performance fell short of what our country deserves \naccountable for their errors, omissions and commissions, particularly \nin the critical period immediately before September 11.\n  Had these standards been implemented last year, it is possible the \nNation could have avoided the embarrassment and damage to our \nGovernment's credibility that has occurred because of the use of \ndiscredited intelligence information in the President's State of the \nUnion Address. So far, we have seen no one suffer more than the \nindignity of a newspaper headline in either incident.\n  With the release of the joint inquiry report, it is time to look \nahead and continue to implement the important reforms of the \nintelligence community that are necessary and to enhance the Federal \nGovernment's partnership with State and local law enforcement and other \nfirst responders.\n  If the recommendations in this report are heeded by the White House, \nby the agencies, and by this Congress, we should be able to make great \nstrides in improving the security of the American people.\n  It is my intention to introduce legislation soon, with cosponsorship \nof members of the joint inquiry, that would implement the reforms which \nrequire legislative action. I hope it will move expeditiously to \npassage with the full support of the administration. I will also begin \nthat effort with a sense of outrage because we have lost valuable time.\n  It took 7 months, almost as long as it took to conduct the inquiry, \nfor the intelligence agencies to declassify the portions of the report \nthat we are releasing today.\n  What are the consequences of that 7 months' delay? One is that the \nmomentum for reform, which was at a high tide in the weeks and months \nimmediately after 9/11, has begun to diminish despite the scope of the \ntragedy. We will learn shortly whether we can reinvigorate that reform \nmovement. This Senate will face the test of its will to do so. I, for \none, am committed to see this report is not forgotten or overlooked.\n\n  In my view, the delay reflects the excessive secrecy with which this \nadministration appears to be obsessed and which is keeping important \nfindings of our work from the American people. Such censorship also \nsaps the urgency of reform and precludes the American peoples' ability \nto hold its leaders accountable.\n  The most serious omission, in my view, is part 4 of the report which \nis entitled ``Finding, Discussion and Narrative Regarding Certain \nSensitive National Security Matters.'' That section of the report \ncontained 27 pages between pages 396 through 422. Those 27 pages have \nalmost been entirely censured. This is the equivalent of ripping out a \nchapter in the middle of a history book before giving it to your child \nor grandchild and then telling her ``good luck on the test.''\n  The declassified version of this finding tells the American people \nthat our investigation developed ``information suggesting specific \nsources of foreign support for some of the September 11 hijackers while \nthey were in the United States.''\n  In other words, officials of a foreign government are alleged to have \naided and abetted the terrorist attacks on our country on September 11 \nwhich took over 3,000 lives.\n  I would like to be able to identify for you the specific sources of \nthat foreign support but that information is contained in the censured \nportions of this\n\n[[Page S9888]]\n\nreport which are being denied to the American people.\n  What are the consequences of this? It significantly reduces the \ninformation available to the public about some of the Government's most \nimportant actions, or more accurately, inactions prior to September 11. \nSecond, it precludes the American people from asking their Government \nlegitimate questions such as, How was the information that our \nGovernment might have had prior to September 11 utilized after \nSeptember 11 to enhance the security of our homeland and American \ninterests abroad? Third, almost 2 years after the tragedy of September \n11, the administration and the Congress, in the main, have not \ninitiated reforms which would reduce the chances of another September \n11.\n  For example, we are allowed to report that the estimates of the CIA's \ncounterterrorism center is that between 70,000 and 120,000 recruits \nwent through al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan before those \ntroops were attacked in late 2001. The important questions as to the \nsignificance of that statement, to the security of the American people, \nare not available.\n  This obsession with excessive secrecy is deeply troubling. The \nrecognition of the evils of secrecy in a free society date back to the \nbeginnings of our Nation. Patrick Henry declared: The liberties of a \npeople never were, nor ever will be, secure when the transactions of \ntheir rulers may be concealed from them.\n  President John F. Kennedy observed in the first year of his \nPresidency: ``the very word secret is repugnant in a free and open \nsociety, and we are, as people, inherently and historically opposed to \nsecret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings. We \ndecided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted \nconcealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers, which are \ncited to justify.'' These are traditional American values that are \nbeing trampled.\n  So the joint committee included our report with this recommendation, \nrecommendation No. 15. ``The President should review and consider \namendments to the Executive Orders, policies, and procedures that \ngovern the national security classification of intelligence information \nin an effort to expand access to relevant information for Federal \nagencies outside the intelligence community and for State and local \nauthorities which are critical to the fight against terrorism and for \nthe American public''.\n  In addition, the President and heads of Federal agencies should \nassure that the policies and procedures to protect against unauthorized \ndisclosure of classified intelligence information are well understood, \nfully implemented, and vigorously enforced.\n  It is my observation that because classification is used so \nexcessively, the corollary is only a minimal effort to enforce \nclassification of materials that truly do deserve to be classified.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that these recommendations were written \nlate in 2002 before the current crisis developed over the use and \npossible misuse of intelligence leading us to war in Iraq. But that \ncrisis has given this recommendation even greater urgency for the \nGovernment's credibility with the American people and our credibility \nwith the rest of the world.\n  These qualities have been severely eroded in large part because of \nexcessive secrecy. To regain the people's trust we must bring new \ntransparency to our decisionmakers. We must bring new transparency to \nour decisionmaking. We must move decisions and governmental information \ninto the sunshine. We owe that and much more to the 3,000 victims of \nSeptember 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ENZI).

The Campbell amendment No. 886 is pending.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have cleared this on both sides. I ask unanimous \nconsent that amendment be set aside so we can conduct some business \nthis evening. There are two or three amendments of substance that \nSenators would like to offer. Senator Campbell and Senator Bingaman \nhave no objection to setting this aside.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I have spoken to Senator \nCampbell earlier this evening. We have, now--however many weeks it has \nbeen since we were on this bill. The Senator on our side we said would \nbe here to offer the next amendment is Senator Durbin. Senator Durbin \nis ready whenever the Senator yields the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Surely.\n  Mr. REID. He is ready to offer that right now, whenever the Senator \ndesires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I certainly have no objection to Senator \nDurbin having the first amendment this evening. I just want to make \nsure we have an understanding about how long he might take and what \nwill be next. There are a number of people who want to offer similar \namendments. We understood the purpose tonight was to stay, even though \nit is late, so Senator Durbin might offer an amendment in the area of \nCAFE standards, and that two other Senators might follow.\n  Mr. REID. If I can respond to the Senator from New Mexico, the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, the Senator from Illinois \nintends to lay down the amendment tonight and that is all.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before I yield the floor, I ask if the Senator from \nGeorgia wishes to ask something of the Senator from New Mexico, or does \nhe want the floor?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for no \nmore than 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He asked to speak as in morning business prior to the \namendment. I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would love to hear the Senator from Texas, \nbut Senator Durbin is going to take less than a minute to do his.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will then sit down. Certainly you can seek \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S9889]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't object. I don't know what is \ngoing on, but I understood we were yielding so Senator Durbin could \noffer an amendment. Now I understand there are two amendments.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I ask unanimous \nconsent only one amendment be considered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank you.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am prepared, having filed this amendment, to yield so \nthe Senator from Georgia may be recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator would like to get the floor, after 5 \nminutes yielded to the Senator from Georgia, the Senator from New \nMexico asks the floor be returned to him so he can make brief opening \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Chambliss are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have all been waiting for a long \ntime. The minority has been telling us that we can't finish the Energy \nbill in 1 week starting on Monday and working for the entire week. Our \ndistinguished majority leader has been telling us--at least 10 times--\nthat it won't be 1 week, it will be 1 week and whatever else it takes \nto finish it. He is sending a nice warning to all of us, as I see it, \nthat we don't intend to put up with long delays. Nobody is offering the \nlast phase of this Energy bill so that we can all have fun on the \nfloor.\n  The idea is, if you want to recess, finish the Energy bill. I will do \neverything in my power to keep it right in focus. But I can't do much \nmore than the rules permit me and the minority manager on that side \nwill let me do. But I guarantee you that from our standpoint, there \nwill be no efforts to go outside the scope of what is required to \ncomplete an Energy bill for the United States.\n  My colleagues know this is how the Senate works. We have scores of \namendments listed on the so-called final list. But if anybody were to \nlook at them in this country, they would say: What are you talking \nabout? Those aren't amendments. That is right. They are not. It is just \na list of words with numbers alongside them that Senators have put in.\n  I am looking at my friend from Illinois. Some Senators put 30 and 40 \nof them down. There is no intention to offer those kinds of amendments. \nWe can finish this. The fact is there are 392 amendments. It doesn't \nmean a thing. As a matter of fact, we have put together a bipartisan \nelectricity bill. It was circulated. I believe that bill alone might, \nby itself, take between 30 and 50 of the amendments on that so-called \nlist. Those are the kinds of things that have been incorporated in this \nmajor electricity amendment.\n  While I am on it, let me suggest that if things work right, we should \nbe on the electricity portion of this bill on Monday. Monday is a \nworkday here, too, according to our leader. There is no holiday on \nMonday. Tomorrow is a workday, even though it is Friday.\n  Essentially, the bill that was submitted to everyone will have many \ncosponsors. It has been worked out over a long period of time with \nalmost all the interests in the electrical future of our country as \npart and party to seeing the solution put together. We believe it \nrepresents a very wide scope of coverage, and that should be found \nacceptable. Certainly there will be amendments, and we will debate \nthem. But the main bill should be found acceptable by an overwhelming \nmajority.\n  In talking about what is really left in this bill, this huge bill--if \nwe pass it and it goes to conference--will be the basis for America \nproducing all kinds of energy for her future and jobs.\n  I think there are seven major issues left.\n  CAFE: My good friend from Illinois offered not two but one CAFE bill \namendment tonight. He will get his turn. If not tonight, we are going \nto finish up CAFE in the morning. Other Senators have amendments also.\n  With cooperation, which I think we will get, our plan is to have the \nnext one, and the next one, and the next one, with the Senator from \nIllinois reserving his right. If he wants to have his amendment voted \non first, he is the first one up. We believe CAFE will be disposed of. \nFrankly, we believe it will be disposed of by Monday night. We don't \nintend to spring this on everyone. This requires everybody who can be \nhere to be here. It looks as if that will be Monday afternoon sometime.\n\n  We think climate change will be offered by two or maybe three \nSenators. This Senator could make the point--but I think it will fall \non deaf ears--that climate change doesn't belong in this bill. I don't \nthink we have jurisdiction. I don't think it belongs in the Environment \nand Public Works bill. But we are going to get it anyway. We are very \nhopeful that can come up after CAFE.\n  I have explained electricity.\n  That makes three major items.\n  Then we have one that I thought was resolved between the \ndistinguished Senator Craig and the ranking minority member, Senator \nBingaman, on hydroelectric relicensing. But I understand it has not \nbeen resolved. So we had better list it as four in terms of serious \namendments.\n  Fifth is an Indian energy issue. We just set it aside prior to the \namendment of the Senator from Illinois. It involves a serious \ndiscussion between the junior Senator from Colorado, Mr. Campbell, and \nthe minority leader. Senator Bingaman wants to amend it. I understand \nthe distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, may also want to \namend it, which would mean the Indian energy bill would have two \namendments.\n  There is the longstanding, always recurring issue called renewable \nportfolio standards--the RPS. I don't know whether we call it a \nstandard. But essentially it is an approach that says we are going to \ntake some of this renewable energy supplied by wind and solar. Even \nthough we are giving them plenty of incentives in this legislation, \nindeed wind is--it is kind of a strange way of saying it--coming on \nstrong; there is no question but that it is. It has even been enough to \nshow up on these various diagrams that talk about energy. We have given \nthem all kinds of incentives.\n  But the idea is mandating that companies which produce electricity in \nour sovereign States have a percentage each year of the renewables. \nThus, the renewable portfolio standard will be an issue.\n  That is as I see it. That is the sixth issue. I am aware of two \namendments in that area; again, one from the distinguished Senator \nBingaman, and one from the distinguished Senator Jeffords from Vermont.\n  Then everybody should know there sits on the sideline a package. It \nis called a tax package. The way we have been doing this on energy \nbills is: Those of us concerned with energy, we all go to the Finance \nCommittee, which has total jurisdiction over taxes, including tax \nincentives, and we make our case, and they produce for us a package of \ntax incentives and tax legislation. They have done so again this year. \nThat is ready.\n\n[[Page S9890]]\n\n  At a point in time--let me suggest--I cannot predict exactly, but I \nam thinking some time about Wednesday or the latest Thursday--we would \noffer this tax package in its entirety to become part of this bill.\n  I know there are many Senators who are anxious to offer tax measures, \nand this tax package will be no different. It will be an opportunity, \nfor those who want to offer tax amendments, to do so. Except I might \nsuggest that the precedent, if you can count on it, has been that \namendments that are not relevant to this package do not find themselves \nin this bill; that is, if somebody does not like the current state of \nplay on the child tax credit, they may want to offer that on this bill \nthat has incentives for windmills, incentives for biomass.\n  I can say, here and now, as manager of this bill, the rules are the \nrules. Senators' prerogatives are Senators' prerogatives, but I would \nask--and I will ask in advance as many Senators as I can talk to--that \nwe table any such amendments, and we keep the tax package to the energy \npackage.\n  There will be some who want the Energy bill to pass, and they will \nquickly understand that is the right way to do it; and they will help. \nI don't know of any, so I am just talking. But there may be some who do \nnot want us to finish by next Friday night or Saturday or Sunday or \nMonday--part of our vacation--and they may not like the idea of getting \nthis tax package over with, and they may want to spend their recess \ndebating taxes. I hope not because there are a lot of Senators around \nhere who do not want to spend their recess debating taxes. They want to \nfinish this bill and go home or go wherever their plans are.\n  I note that our leader is serious enough about this where he can be \nhere an extra 3 days or 6 days before his plans take effect. Just to \nshow us he is serious, that is what it looks like in his regard.\n  Let me tell my colleagues that it is 9:05 p.m. The minority has \ngenerously let us set aside the Indian amendment and offered the first \nCAFE amendment. I am hopeful that in a few minutes the senior Senator \nfrom Missouri, Mr. Bond, will be here. I am hopeful he will seek to \noffer a CAFE standards amendment and that the other side will be as \ngenerous as we were and let him offer his without jeopardizing the CAFE \namendment of the distinguished Senator from Illinois--just setting it \naside temporarily while Senator Bond offers his.\n  Frankly, I do not see any reason after that occurs--unless somebody \ncomes here with some business--to stick around very long. There have \nbeen many votes today. I am just as tired, if not more tired, than most \nof the Senators who have already left the premises. So I do not want to \nstay beyond the offering of the two CAFE amendments.\n\n  I say to Senators, there is great cooperation taking place. And \ntomorrow morning, if we can get the same cooperation, the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona intends to offer his CAFE amendment. I say to the \nSenator, as you know, he has been telling us about that amendment for \nquite some time. And then immediately after that, if everyone continues \nto be somewhat harmonious, there will be another modified CAFE \namendment that will be offered by Senator Feinstein, joined by others, \nbut I know joined by Senator McCain.\n  That will put us tomorrow, before noon, with four CAFE amendments of \nsorts--I say to the Senator, his being one kind and the last one I \nspoke to being another kind--all pending before the Senate. After they \nare pending, we can determine what voting on each one does, one to \nanother. But until then, we will hope that each Senator, who is \ninterested in what they will clearly tell us is one of their important \nissues, what they perceive to be very important; namely CAFE--they will \nhave a chance to make their presentation, as I understand it.\n  Senator Bond will be here shortly. I say to the Senator, if you do \nnot mind, without going into any detail, I have a Senator to take my \nplace for the rest of the evening.\n\n\n                        Death of Colin McMillan\n\n  Mr. President, I received word today, not too many hours ago, that \none of our President's nominees to become Secretary of the Navy, Colin \nMcMillan--some of my colleagues knew him; he would have been up here \nfor confirmation shortly; he was a very good friend of mine for 35 \nyears--he is dead. That is as much as I can say. And that is not a \ngreat way to start the evening.\n  One of my fellow Senators has told me that if I put in a brief quorum \ncall, he will take my place and save enough time for Senator Bond, whom \nwe have imposed upon to come down and offer his amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't know if a quorum call has been \nordered. If not, I would like to ask recognition from the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was going to suggest the absence of a quorum. I say \nto the Senator, if you don't mind, I would like a Republican to be \nhere. If he will just tell me he wants to speak on his amendment--is \nthat what the Senator wants to do?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, when Senator Bond arrives, upon \nrequest, will the Senator from Illinois yield and let him offer his \namendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we do that? Under those conditions, rather than \nsuggest the absence of a quorum, I will relinquish the floor. Senator \nDurbin can start. Senator Bond will be here shortly, and a Senator will \nbe here to replace me in short order.\n  Here is Senator Bond now.\n  I ask the Senator how long he thinks it will be before he is ready?\n  Mr. BOND. About a minute and a half.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's proceed as we had planned and let the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri proceed next.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1386\n\n       (Purpose: To impose additional requirements for improving \n     automobile fuel economy and reducing vehicle emissions)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Domenici, and Ms. Stabenow, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Domenici, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1386.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as we continue debate on the Energy bill, \nthere are a number of very important issues and amendments facing the \nSenate. One is of great interest to me and, frankly, any Senator who \nhas automobile plants or suppliers in his home State. It actually \nshould be of interest to every Senator since it directly affects all \nAmerican consumers in every State who drive a car, SUV, other vehicle, \nor even ride in one. It is also of vital interest and a high priority \nto the Chamber of Commerce, the United Auto Workers, the American Farm \nBureau, and a very large, diverse coalition of labor, business, and \nconsumer groups. I refer to Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, \nstandards.\n  I am a great baseball fan, and I can think of no higher authority \nthan Yogi Berra to quote when I say it is deja vu all over again. I \nmust admit I was holding out hope that the Senate could avoid a lengthy \ndebate this year over the CAFE standards. After all, this body examined \nfuel economy proposals in great detail during debate on the Democratic \nEnergy bill last year. As some of my colleagues may recall, Senator \nLevin and I, with the help of others, developed an amendment to strike \nthe job-killing antisafety CAFE provisions offered and proposed by \nother Members and replace it with commonsense language mandating that \nthe experts at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration set \nnew CAFE standards at the maximum feasible level.\n\n[[Page S9891]]\n\n  The Levin-Bond amendment last year passed on a vote of 62 to 38, \nobviously including Senators from both sides of the aisle. I am pleased \nto be offering a similar amendment again this year with Senator Levin, \nChairman Domenici, and Senator Stabenow.\n  Members supported our amendment last year because they knew then and \nI believe they know now that setting fuel economy standards is \ncomplicated. Future standards should be based on sound science, and \nthey must take into account a number of important criteria, including \nthe impact on jobs, safety, technology, consumer choice, and many \nothers. They should not be based on a political number, and that is why \nthe Kerry-McCain provision was stripped out of last year's bill. In \nfact, it was withdrawn for an obvious lack of support.\n  When the Senate debated the Levin-Bond amendment last year, some in \nthe Chamber doubted whether the Bush administration would take CAFE \nseriously and issue new standards in a timely fashion. The \nadministration did act earlier this year and announced the biggest \nincrease in 20 years in CAFE levels for light trucks and SUVs.\n  Regrettably, proponents of higher CAFE standards are back again this \nyear. Several Senators have developed proposals to increase CAFE \nstandards significantly without regard to the effect on American jobs \nand the American economy. If I might borrow a line from a recent movie, \nthose CAFE numbers are ``too fast, too furious.''\n  I did some research on the economic job impact to the automobile \nindustry in Arizona, Illinois, and California. Perhaps the sponsors of \nthe higher CAFE amendments are not familiar with some of data for their \nhome States. Let me provide for the record, in Arizona there are over \n75,000 auto-related jobs, including 16,000 directly employed in the \nindustry. In Illinois, there are 311,000 auto-related jobs, including \n45,000 directly employed. Lastly, the great State of California has \nover 462,000 auto-related jobs, including 118,000 direct jobs.\n  Here are a couple of figures on a national scale: 6.6 million, this \nis the number of Americans employed in direct or spin-off jobs related \nto the automotive industry. Here is another big one: $243 billion, that \nis the economic contribution of the industry. In fact, every State is \nan auto State. Let me show my colleagues this chart. Most people would \nknow that Michigan, Missouri, Indiana, and Ohio are big manufacturing \nStates. But even smaller States--Nebraska, New Hampshire, Delaware, \nArkansas--have suppliers and other industries whose success and \nbusiness profitability are directly related to the bigger \nmanufacturers.\n  Nebraska has 33,700 jobs; Arkansas 46,800; New Hampshire, 27,300 \njobs; Delaware has 30,100 jobs. This chart is here for everyone to \nview.\n  Proponents of arbitrarily higher CAFE standards try to avoid any \ndiscussion of the job impact or they just dismiss concerns as being \noverreactive. But I have heard from a broad array of union officials, \ntechnical experts, plant managers, local dealers, and small businesses. \nThey tell me that these proposals could cost jobs, because the only way \nfor manufacturers to meet these unrealistic political numbers is to \nmake significant cuts to light truck, minivan, and SUV production--the \nvehicles, quite frankly, Americans are demanding.\n  In fact, I had recently read in Roll Call that some of my colleagues \nhere on the floor right now actually drive these bigger SUVs here in \nWashington, though there may be some fender damage to at least one of \nthem.\n  I have also read the National Academy of Science's report on CAFE \nstandards issued in 2001. Let me share with you a key finding about \nsafety and higher standards:\n\n       In summary, the majority of the committee finds that the \n     downsizing and weight reduction that occurred in the late \n     1970s and early 1980s most likely produced between 1,300 and \n     2,600 crash fatalities and between 13,000 and 26,000 serious \n     injuries in 1993.\n       If an increase in fuel economy is effected by a system that \n     encourages either downweighting or the production and sale of \n     more small cars, some additional traffic fatalities would be \n     expected.\n\n  That is the National Academy of Science. I believe that NAS report \noffers us in the Senate clear guidance and expert scientific analysis \nas we debate fuel economy standards. CAFE standards which cannot be met \nby technological improvement have killed roughly 2,000 people a year--\nthat is almost as many as in the tragedy of September 11--because of \nwhat we in Congress have mandated. That is a frightening number.\n  This past April, the Energy Committee debated an amendment by Senator \nFeinstein to raise the light truck CAFE standard. That could have had \nnegative consequences for pickup trucks for ranchers and farmers across \nMissouri and in many agricultural States. The amendment would have also \nnegatively impacted soccer moms and dads driving minivans, too, since \nthey are part of the light truck category.\n  The committee soundly rejected the Feinstein amendment 15-7, on a \nbipartisan vote, including four Senators from the other side of the \naisle opposing adoption. I look forward to working with those Senators \nand others to defeat excessive CAFE amendments to be offered on the \nfloor.\n  I urge and strongly encourage Members who voted for the Bond-Levin \namendment last year to do so again this year. It is a commonsense \namendment to the Energy bill that will protect jobs, safety, consumer \nchoice, and continue to pursue reasonable, scientifically achievable \nenvironmental improvements.\n  I know that some in this Chamber believe our fellow Americans cannot \nbe trusted to make the right choice when purchasing a vehicle. For my \npart, in choosing between the Government or the consumer making \nchoices, I side with consumers. I do not pretend to know what is best \nfor each of the 16 million Americans who purchase a new vehicle every \nyear.\n  For those who say, ``too bad, we must force Detroit to build more \nfuel-efficient cars and trucks,'' do you know that under CAFE, it \ndoesn't matter what the companies manufacture and build? It is \ncalculated based on what they buy. There are over 30 vehicles in \nshowrooms that get over 30 miles to the gallon, but guess what: They \nrepresent less than 2 percent of sales. In their buying decisions, \nconsumers consistently favor safety, utility, performance, and other \ncharacteristics over fuel economy.\n  Do we still have a free society? I think so and I hope so. Higher \nCAFE standards could lead to downsizing of many popular vehicles. I \ndon't want to tell parents in Missouri, or in any State, they cannot \nget the SUV or minivan they wanted for their family or business because \nCongress decided it would be a bad choice. Is that any way to develop \nsound public policy? Of course not.\n  Last year, I said on the floor that I would be most interested to see \nthe hard data and the solid science which supposedly justifies the \nhigher CAFE standards put forward by some of my colleagues.\n\n  Mr. President, I never did get a firm answer. Frankly, I doubt one \nexists. The numbers in these CAFE amendments are political numbers \npicked out of thin air. Some of my colleagues are trying to indicate \nthat their proposed standards are suggested in the NAS study. I remind \nmy colleagues the National Academy of Science report states the \nfollowing:\n\n       The committee cannot emphasize strongly enough that the \n     cost-efficient fuel economy levels are not recommended CAFE \n     goals.\n\n  Mr. President, automakers are investing billions of dollars in \nadvanced technology research and new products, such as hybrid and fuel \ncell vehicles, which offer great promise to improve fuel economy and \ncontinue to offer the driving public the comfort, safety, and utility \nthey demand. We should be encouraging this type of research. In fact, \nthe President has recognized the importance of advanced technology and \nhas pledged $1.2 billion in fuel cell research funding, so that America \ncan lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles. \nWe have already voted to accept Senator Dorgan's amendment, which paves \nthe way for production and deployment of 2.5 million hydrogen fuel cell \nvehicles by 2020.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment allows the Transportation Department to \ncontinue its plans for a multiyear rulemaking to set new CAFE standards \nin the future. Our amendment includes provisions so that the Government \nplays its part in addressing vehicle fuel efficiency.\n\n[[Page S9892]]\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues to oppose higher CAFE amendments, which \nwill only hurt consumers and do very little for fuel economy and are \nnot based on sound science. I ask that we save jobs, improve safety for \nour fellow Americans, and continue to make scientific progress toward \ngreater fuel economy and environmental improvement. Vote ``yes'' on the \nBond-Levin-Domenici-Stabenow amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri made reference \nto a colleague on the floor who is driving a big SUV with a dented \nfender.\n  I drive a 1993 Saturn, and I just took it, with my wife, on a trip to \nNorth Carolina. We averaged 35 miles a gallon with the air conditioning \non. I wanted that on the record so people won't believe I am standing \nhere talking about fuel efficiency and the only car I drive is an SUV. \nI don't own an SUV. People who want to are certainly entitled to. That \nis their free choice.\n  You have just heard the opening statement by the Senator from \nMissouri, but you may not have noticed the flapping in the background. \nIt was the waving of a white flag. It was a concession by the Senator \non his behalf and on behalf of the cosponsors that America is incapable \nof developing a technology to make our cars and trucks more fuel \nefficient--so incapable that if we establish a new fuel efficiency \nstandard, the Senator from Missouri tells us it will cost us thousands \nof jobs. So we are just going to give up. America is going to walk \naway, surrender. There is no way we can deal with the challenge of an \namendment which says we need more fuel-efficient cars.\n  The Senator is prepared to say to us, if that battle is underway, we \nconcede defeat to all the foreign automobile manufacturers. America \njust cannot keep up. We are just going to fall behind, and our workers \nare going to lose their jobs.\n  Forgive me, but I don't have that negative attitude or pessimistic \nview of the people who work in the automobile industry, nor those who \ndesign cars and trucks. When given a challenge, I believe they can meet \nit. But if not given a challenge--which is what the Senator from \nMissouri and his cosponsor, Senator Levin of Michigan, are proposing--\nwe know what will happen. We have seen it happen. Take a look at the \nhistory of this.\n  First, consider the fact that we are debating an Energy bill. How can \nyou have a serious Energy bill and not talk about conserving energy? If \nyou are going to talk about conserving energy, how can you avoid the \nlargest consumer of petroleum products in America, the cars and trucks \nwe drive on the highway? How can you have an honest Energy bill that \ntalks about America's energy future and doesn't address the critical \nneed to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to make certain that \nthe cars and trucks we are driving are more fuel efficient?\n  I think the answer is obvious. When I go through my State of \nIllinois, whether I am talking to soccer moms or corporate executives, \nthey all understand this. If you continue to say to Detroit that you \ncan continue to build the heaviest, most fuel-inefficient vehicles \nimaginable and put them on the road with absolutely no motive or no \nimpetus to change, we are going to continue to import oil from \noverseas, and we are going to continue to be dependent upon Saudi \nArabia and all the other oil sources in the Middle East. We are going \nto continue to pollute our air until our children have a planet that, \nfrankly, has been blighted by our own neglect, and that is an \nabdication of our responsibility. So I offer an amendment to improve \nthe fuel efficiency of vehicles across America.\n\n  This is not a radical concept. We have done this before. When we get \ndown to it, there are only two or three ways to basically improve fuel \nefficiency of the vehicles we drive. One, we can wait for consumers to \ndemand it. Well, they might, over some period of time, driven by \nforeign policy concerns or environmental concerns. It might happen. \nSecondly, we can increase the cost of fuel in America. And we know what \nhappens then. If gasoline went up over $5 a gallon, every spouse would \nbe asking his or her spouse, what kind of fuel economy do we get on \nthat car in the driveway? At $5 a gallon, we need to know, and maybe we \nneed to get a more fuel-efficient car. But I think that is a poor way \nto do it.\n  Imposing new taxes or new cost in fuel means families across America \nare going to spend more. Small businesses are going to struggle with \nmore cost. That certainly is not the way to answer it.\n  There is a third way, a proven way. It is one we have used before. \nRemember back in 1975 when America was struggling with this whole \nquestion, and people were in long gas lines wondering whether we would \nhave enough gasoline to fuel our vehicles? Congress took a look at the \naverage fuel economy across America and found that the cars we were \ndriving were averaging about 14 miles a gallon. So Congress said: We \nare going to impose a new standard; over 10 years, the automobile \nindustry has to virtually double the fuel economy of its vehicles to \nalmost 28 miles a gallon.\n  What did the critics say about that? Well, exactly what the Senator \nfrom Missouri just said: We cannot do that. We cannot double fuel \neconomy in 10 years; why, that is technologically impossible. Secondly, \nif you want to build a car that gets 28 miles a gallon, it will not be \nsafe. It will be light, it will be dangerous, it will not be fair to \nfamilies, and people will die.\n  The third thing they said was: If we impose this standard of 28 miles \na gallon, bet dollars to donuts those cars are going to be made \noverseas. They will be made in Japan and Germany and other countries, \nand American workers will lose their jobs. Sound familiar? Those are \nexactly the arguments we have heard from the Senator from Missouri: \nTechnologically impossible; cars will be unsafe; we are going to lose \njobs.\n  What did this Senate and the House of Representatives say about that? \nThey rejected it. They said: We are not going to give up on American \ningenuity and American technology. We believe that given a goal, \nDetroit and other automobile manufacturers can meet it. And we imposed \na mandate to increase the fuel efficiency of vehicles and double it \nover a 10-year period of time.\n  What happened? It worked. By the end of 10 years, average fuel \nefficiency was up to about 27\\1/2\\ miles a gallon. They found the \ntechnology, cars were safer, and there were still plenty of jobs in the \nUnited States, good paying jobs, in the auto industry. That is what \nhappened.\n  What has happened since 1985, when that requirement to double fuel \nefficiency ended? Nothing. Eighteen years of no improvement in fuel \nefficiency of the cars and trucks in America; and, even worse, because \nof loopholes in the law, we decided to call SUVs ``trucks'' so they \nwere exempt from fuel efficiency.\n\n  So what happened over the 18 years? We started to slide backwards, \nfrom 27\\1/2\\ miles a gallon to now about 24 miles a gallon average fuel \nefficiency across America. What does it mean? More dependence on \nforeign oil; more dependence on Saudi Arabia and the oil sheiks; more \ndependence on the tangle of politics in the Middle East; more air \npollution because the cars that we are driving, those big SUVs and \nheavy trucks, with less fuel efficiency and less fuel economy, are \nburning more gallons of gasoline, tossing more emissions out of the \ntailpipe, creating a bigger soup in the atmosphere to heat up our \nplanet Earth, endangering not only lives with the problems that come \nfrom pulmonary disease and lung disease but endangering species around \nthe world and endangering our environmental future. That is what we get \nfor 18 years of neglect.\n  What is the answer of those who come before us today with the \nalternative amendment? More neglect. They believe America is not up to \nthis challenge, America cannot come up with this technology. Sadly, \nthere is some evidence that they are right.\n  Take a look at the hybrid cars that are on the road today. Do my \ncolleagues know the cars I am talking about? The ones that combine \ngasoline engines and electric-powered engines and they get \nsubstantially better fuel mileage than most cars that are on the road. \nWhere are the two models of these cars coming from today? Sadly, they \nare coming from Japan. Detroit is running second again in the race for \ntechnology.\n\n[[Page S9893]]\n\n  I am not giving up on American ingenuity and technology. I do not \nagree with those who say there is no way we can make our cars and \ntrucks more fuel efficient. I think we can do better, and I think we \nwill do better, but we have to establish challenges and goals.\n  Let me talk for a moment about this concept of soccer moms. I have \nheard this--the Senator from Missouri often refers to it--there are a \nlot of soccer moms in Illinois and, yes, they drive minivans and SUVs \nand a lot of other types of cars. But when I sit down and talk to these \nsoccer moms, they understand that they have a responsibility beyond \njust picking out the biggest and heaviest automobile they can buy. They \nunderstand their responsibility to the future that their children are \ngoing to share with others. They understand their responsibility to the \nenvironment.\n  They ask me: Senator, are you saying that Detroit, given 10 years, \ncannot give us a safe, fuel-efficient vehicle?\n  I tell them, I believe they can. But the Bond-Levin amendment says \nthey cannot, that there is no way they can; that soccer moms are going \nto be stuck driving some flimsy old vehicle that may get better gas \nmileage but at the expense of the safety of their children.\n  I do not buy it. I am not that pessimistic. I am very optimistic. \nWhen it comes to American creativity, I think we can meet this \nchallenge, and I think those soccer moms and dads want to drive more \nfuel-efficient vehicles, not just for the money savings--that is \nimportant to every family--but also because they feel a responsibility \nto the future of their children. They feel a responsibility to the \nenvironment in which we live. They understand that the No. 1 diagnosis \nof kids going into emergency rooms and hospitals across America today \nis asthma and lung disease that is caused by air pollution. They \nunderstand that.\n\n  They want to do their part. To do their part, they need leadership \nright here on the Senate floor, not waving the flag of surrender, not \nretreating, but moving America forward with a new vision, a vision \nwhich says to Detroit, to Chrysler, to General Motors, to Ford, to \nmanufacturers in our country, let us show the rest of the world we can \nlead. We do not have to surrender, as the amendment that is being \noffered tonight suggests. We want to lead. In leading, we will solve \nthe environmental problem and reduce our dependence upon foreign oil.\n  I have a few charts, but it is late, and I understand that staff has \nbeen here for a full day, so I am not going to belabor this issue. \nThere will be time. I think we will return to this issue next week, and \nat that time on Monday evening, when I return, I plan to give a full \nstatement and show charts that talk about the CAFE standard, which I am \nsure will be very convincing to my colleagues.\n  I do hope my colleagues will consider this: If we are serious about \nan Energy bill, if we are serious about tomorrow's energy supply, if we \nare serious about looking at this issue in an honest fashion, how can \nwe avoid talking about conservation? What we have proposed by a variety \nof amendments, including the one from the Senator from Missouri, is \nmore study: Let's take a look at this; surely there must be some way we \ncan study this problem into a solution.\n  I do not think it works that way. The choices are very few: raising \nthe gas tax, which I oppose for reasons I have stated, or establishing \nstandards to reach a 40-mile-per-gallon standard fuel efficiency. That, \nI think, is what America needs, and that is what we can achieve. We can \ndo it over a reasonable period of time.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1385, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for his \ncomments. I regret that he did not apparently gather what I was saying \nin my remarks because his characterization of my position was \nuntenable. He suggested that we do not want to increase CAFE standards. \nThe amendment that Senators Levin, Domenici, Stabenow, and I prepared \non page 4 reads that the Secretary of Transportation shall issue new \nregulations setting forth increased fuel economy standards for \nnonpassenger automobiles, among others. We say they shall increase it. \nBut you know something? We say they ought to base it on sound \ntechnology and sound science. For example, on page 2, we say when \ndeciding the maximum fees of fuel economy, the Secretary shall \nconsider:\n\n       ``(1) Technological feasibility.\n       ``(2) Economic practicability.\n       ``(3) The effect of other motor vehicle standards of the \n     Government on fuel economy.\n       ``(4) The need of the United States to conserve energy.\n       ``(5) The desirability of reducing United States dependence \n     on imported oil.\n       ``(6) The effects of the average fuel economy standards on \n     motor vehicle and passenger safety.\n       ``(7) The effects of increased fuel economy on air quality.\n       ``(8) The adverse effects of average fuel economy standards \n     on the relative competitiveness of manufacturers.\n       ``(9) The effects of compliance with average fuel economy \n     standards on levels of employment in the United States.\n\n  These are all points that are very important. But we start off \nsaying, don't push something that is purely political. Make sure there \nis a technological basis for it.\n  Yes, my colleague is right. We did increase the CAFE achievements, \nbut much of it came through lowering the weight of the vehicles. If my \ncolleagues will listen and pay attention, we have the very frightening \nstatistic from the National Academy of Sciences that those lower weight \nvehicles, vehicles initially designed for safety, were\n\n[[Page S9895]]\n\nforced to be downsized, and they caused roughly 2,000 additional \nfatalities a year in automobile vehicle accidents and some 13,000 to \n26,000 serious injuries. That is why we say safety is part of it. That \nis why we say we need to make sure we can achieve these \ntechnologically. We are pushing the technology.\n  My colleague talks about soccer moms. If they want to drive a very \nsmall fuel-efficient car, they can. If they want to drive an SUV, they \ncan. We are going to push the technology to make those as efficient as \npossible. But we are not some kind of dictatorial or authoritarian \nsociety that says, no; we will tell you what you can buy.\n  We want to have parents, whether they are soccer moms, baseball dads, \ngranddads who want to take their kids to the ball game, to have the \nability to choose the kind of car they want.\n  It is about safety, it is about choice, and it is about jobs.\n  I am very grateful for a letter I have just received dated July 24, \n2003, from Alan Reuther, legislative director of the UAW. He says in \npart:\n\n       The UAW strongly opposes a number of other CAFE amendments \n     that may be offered by Senator McCain, Senator Feinsten or \n     Senator Durbin. Although taking different approaches, all of \n     these amendments would mandate excessive, discriminatory \n     increases in fuel economy standards that would directly \n     threaten thousands of jobs for UAW members and other \n     automotive workers in this country. In our judgment, fuel \n     economy increases of the magnitude proposed in these \n     amendments are neither technologically or economically \n     feasible. The study conducted by the National Academy of \n     Sciences does not support such increases. Given the economic \n     difficulties currently facing the auto industry, we believe \n     it would be a profound mistake to impose additional burdens \n     on the companies by mandating excessive increases in the CAFE \n     standards.\n\n  That is why, in summary, the UAW says it strongly supports the Bond-\nLevin amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: This week the Senate is scheduled to take up \n     the comprehensive energy legislation. At that time, the \n     Senate may consider a number of important amendments relating \n     to Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.\n       The UAW strongly supports the Levin-Bond amendment, which \n     would require the Department of Transportation to engage in \n     expedited rulemaking to issue new fuel economy standards for \n     both cars and light trucks. DOT would be required to take \n     into consideration a wide range of factors in establishing \n     the new standards, including employment, safety, technology, \n     economic practicability and the relative competitive impacts \n     on companies. This amendment is similar to the Levin-Bond \n     substitute that the Senate approved by a wide margin last \n     year. The UAW supports the approach contained in this \n     amendment because we believe it will lead to a significant \n     improvement in fuel economy, without jeopardizing the jobs of \n     American workers.\n       The UAW strongly opposes a number of other CAFE amendments \n     that may be offered by Senator McCain, Senator Feinstein or \n     Senator Durbin. Although taking different approaches, all of \n     these amendments would mandate excessive, discriminatory \n     increases in fuel economy standards that would directly \n     threaten thousands of jobs for UAW members and other \n     automotive workers in this country. In our judgment, fuel \n     economy increases of the magnitude proposed in these \n     amendments are neither technologically or economically \n     feasible. The study conducted by the National Academy of \n     Sciences does not support such increases. Given the economic \n     difficulties currently facing the auto industry, we believe \n     it would be a profound mistake to impose additional burdens \n     on the companies by mandating excessive increases in the CAFE \n     standards.\n       In addition, the UAW is particularly concerned that the \n     structure of the proposed fuel economy increases--a flat mpg \n     requirement for cars and/or light trucks--would severely \n     discriminate against full line producers (such as GM, Ford \n     and DaimlerChrysler) because their product mix contains a \n     much higher percentage of larger cars and light trucks. This \n     could result in severe disruption in their production, and \n     directly threaten the jobs of thousands of UAW members and \n     other workers associated with the production of these \n     vehicles. Furthermore, by eliminating the distinction between \n     foreign and domestic car fleets, the McCain amendment would \n     enable the Big Three automakers to outsource their domestic \n     small care production to other countries, resulting in the \n     loss of thousands of additional automotive jobs in this \n     country.\n       The UAW continues to believe that modest improvements in \n     fuel economy are achievable over time. Indeed, NHTSA has \n     already promulgated new CAFE standards for light trucks that \n     will yield significant fuel savings. In our judgment, we can \n     continue to make progress on fuel economy by following this \n     same approach, and directing NHTSA to promulgate new fuel \n     economy standards for both cars and light trucks, as called \n     for by the Levin-Bond amendments. But we also believe it is \n     critically important that the Senate reject the extreme, \n     discriminatory CAFE proposals contained in the amendments \n     sponsored by Senators McCain, Feinstein and Durbin, which \n     would threaten the jobs of thousands of American automotive \n     workers.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this priority issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9895-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the tragedy that \noccurred in my city yesterday.\n  Everyone knows that a gunman came into our city hall, into the city \ncouncil chamber, raised his gun, and killed one of our brave city \ncouncilmen. I knew the councilman. I knew him well. He did not live far \nfrom my home in Brooklyn. One of my happiest moments with him was \nspeaking at his inaugural ceremony only 2 short years ago.\n  So I would like to speak about Councilman James Davis, and also about \nOfficer Richard Burt, who acted with bravery. In short, in the wake of \nthis terrible tragedy, we really celebrate two heroes: mourning the \nlife of one, thankful for the bravery of the other.\n  First, I would like to talk about Councilman Davis. He came from \nBrooklyn. He went to a high school that was one of my high school's \nrivals, and followed in the footsteps of his father. He was a \ncorrections officer, and then a police officer, and then ran for public \noffice.\n  He was always a maverick. He liked to challenge the conventional \nwisdom. He was unafraid. He was virtually fearless. But he was always \nfearless with a smile on his face. He would take on whatever powers \nthat be because he believed it was right.\n  He cared so much about his community. Long before he became an \nelected official, he would sponsor ``Stop the Violence'' marches in \nCrown Heights. Everyone knew it was August when the big signs saying \n``Stop the Violence'' would be emblazoned across Eastern Parkway.\n  When he got elected to the city council, it was a dream come true for \nJames Davis. He had run for office many times before and been defeated, \nbut he kept working and working. The people in the community saw that \nthe man was sincere and put him in the office of city council.\n  Once on the city council, it was clear that James Davis was one of \nthe rising stars in his own way because he always did things in his own \nway. He was a maverick. He would oppose things everybody else thought \nwas good, and then he would have good reason for it. And he always had \na twinkle of mischief in his eye, and often, when he would greet you, \nhe would have some kind of little joke to mention with you. But he \nnever hesitated to speak his mind. He never hesitated to vote his \nconscience, regardless of how it would affect his career. He refused to \nroll over for anyone, even some of the most powerful politicians in New \nYork City.\n  So we miss James Davis. It is a tragedy he has been taken from us so \nyoung, with so much potential. It is a tragedy he has been taken from \nthis Earth, untimely ripped. But his smile, his passion, his desire to \nfight, his desire to tilt at windmills will remain with us forever.\n  There is another hero we celebrate today, and that is Police Officer \nRichard Burt, so typical of the bravery of New York City police \nofficers. Officer Burt acutely saw what was happening on the balcony \nduring the New York City council meeting, and though he was 45 feet \naway, he fired shots at\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\nJames Davis' murderer, and the shots struck true and killed the \nmurderer.\n  Richard Burt saved lives. Richard Burt, just like James Davis, was \nbrave. James Davis' bravery was about his willingness to challenge the \nestablishment and to do what he thought was right. Burt's bravery came \nas well in the line of duty, as a police officer. We thank him because \nmany lives were saved.\n  I read the reports this morning that in the murderer's sock were more \nbullets. Lord knows what would have happened had Richard Burt's aim not \nbeen brave and true.\n  So it is a sad day in New York today. It is a sad day because our \ncity council chamber, our city hall, has been violated by violence. It \nis a sad day because we miss and mourn for James Davis, and our \nthoughts and prayers are with his family.\n  Two brave men: One we mourn, gone, his memory, his courage live with \nus; one we thank for saving the lives of so many others.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9896-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9896-S9897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SGT PHILLIP RANDALL RUGG II\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to speak about \nsome very exciting and heartwarming events in Monroe, Louisiana, today \nand tomorrow. I regret I will be unable to attend the events. But, they \nare very important to Marine Sergeant Phillip Randall, II, his family, \nthe city of Monroe, and for all the people of Louisiana. Quite frankly \nSgt. Rugg's actions tell a story that will be heartwarming to the \nNation.\n  As we consider how to best defend our borders, and also as we \ncontinue to aggressively pursue the standing up of a new government in \nIraq to establish a democracy there, I wish to pay tribute to our \nmilitary by highlighting the heroic actions of one of the Marines' \nbest.\n  Marine Sgt Phillip Randall Rugg II, is being honored today by the \ncity of Monroe, Louisiana. Monroe is a city of about 50,000 in \nnortheast Louisiana that has its share of men and women in the active \nand reserve forces serving our country at this time. They are doing the \nbrave and difficult work necessary for us to achieve victory. Having \nwon the war, we are now in an all-out effort to win the peace. These \nmen and women from Louisiana and around the Nation are putting their \nlives on the line, and the Nation is grateful.\n  Monroe is opening its arms and its hearts to a true hero. With his \nwife Nicol and his 2-year-old son Trey, Sgt. Rugg will be honored by \nthe people of Monroe. I rise to explain why.\n  A few months ago, on March 22, then-Corporal Rugg was serving in Iraq \nwith the 1st Tank Battalion, the 1st Marine Division. On that day, his \ntank recovery vehicle was hit by at least four rocket-propelled \ngrenades. Shrapnel from the RPGs tore through his body, leaving him \nunable to use his legs. His vehicle was on fire. Using only his arms, \nwith great injury to himself, he pulled himself out of his vehicle. \nOnce outside, he realized that his gunnery sergeant, Guadalupe \nDenojean, was still inside the burning vehicle.\n  Then, without regard to his own safety, obviously having been \nseverely injured with broken legs, he climbed back into the burning \nvehicle which was engulfed in flames and pulled the gunnery sergeant \nout. Regrettably, after this incident, Sgt. Rugg's wounds were not able \nto heal fully and his left leg had to be amputated below the knee. He \nmay have had part of his leg removed, but no doctor or enemy weapon \ncould remove his spirit.\n  I spoke to this young marine yesterday by phone. He is proud of his \nservice. He is proud of his country. He said: Senator, this is not a \nstory about sadness or pity. I am proud I went to serve in defense of \nmy nation.\n  I want to say how proud we are of him and his family, how proud I am \nthat one of the cities in Louisiana is honoring him today. This is the \nMarine spirit. It is one that has existed for over 200 years. It is a \nflame that will not go out.\n  He has now been promoted to sergeant. Again, he is proud to serve his \ncountry. As he told me yesterday: Senator, I have no regrets. I was \nhappy to do what I did. My family is happy to support me in this \neffort.\n  He will soon reenter school to complete his degree in accounting. His \nother leg is rehabilitating well, and he is working with his doctors \nand therapists to some day not only walk, but run. He also wants to get \nback on the golf course. With his positive outlook, I am sure Sgt. Rugg \nwill go on to do great things and continue to be a proud father and \ndevoted husband. As the city of Monroe celebrates the recovery and \nreturn of Sgt. Rugg, I am certain his faith and positive outlook will \nonly bring more causes for the Rugg family to celebrate in the years to \ncome.\n  Former Senator Max Cleland of Georgia is a triple amputee as a result \nof a grenade explosion in Vietnam. Senator Cleland says his injuries \nchanged his life and gave him even greater purpose to serve his country \nas a Senator and Cabinet Secretary. Senator Cleland always says he is \nstronger at the broken places. After talking with Sgt. Rugg, I know \nthat he, too, is stronger at the broken places.\n  I want to tell Sgt. Rugg how proud the United States Senate is of his \nservice. I want to tell the thousands of other men and women in uniform \nhow grateful we are for what they do each day to protect and promote \nliberty. I want to wish Sgt. Rugg and his family well, and know my \nthoughts and prayers are with them. Sgt. Rugg, I salute you.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the following document in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Sergeant Phillip Randall Rugg, II\n\n       Phillip Randall Rugg, II was born at St. Francis Hospital \n     in Monroe, Louisiana on April 26, 1977 to Jan Elizabeth \n     Falletta Rugg and Phillip Randall Rugg. Randall was \n     christened at Our Lady of Fatima church and attended Our Lady \n     of Fatima School from grades K-8. He attended St. Frederick \n     High School where he lettered in football, basketball, and \n     baseball for three years and graduated with honors in 1995. \n     Randall attended the University of Louisiana at Monroe and \n     Louisiana Tech University from 1995 to 1998.\n       On June 28, 1999, Randall joined the Marine Corps and \n     immediately did twelve weeks of basic training at the Marine \n     Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, California. After basic \n     training, Randall attended fourteen weeks of Tank Mechanic \n     School at Fort Knox where he graduated first in his class. On \n     February 25, 2000, Randall was assigned permanent duty at the \n     Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command in Twenty Nine \n     Palms, California.\n       On March 25, 2000, while serving at Twenty Nine Palms, \n     Randall married Andrea Nicol Freeman of Ferriday, Louisiana. \n     Randall received several letters of commendation and \n     appreciation, and was meritoriously promoted twice while \n     stationed at Twenty Nine Palms. His military achievements \n     were overshadowed, however, by the birth of Phillip Randall \n     Rugg, III, on March 18, 2001, whom Randall and Nicol have \n     nicknamed Trey.\n       On March 22, 2003, the third day of Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom, shortly before sunrise, Randall, Sergeant Eric W. \n     Percy and Master Gunnery Sergeant Guadalupe Denogean \n     (referred to by his crew as ``Master Guns'') were operating \n     an M88 Tank Recovery Vehicle when they sustained direct hits \n     from at least five to eight rocket-propelled grenades which \n     were fired from a nearby farmhouse. Sergeant Percy escaped \n     the vehicle through the side door, which had been blown off \n     in the explosion. Randall, finding his legs were useless \n     managed to pull himself up to the top hatch and roll out of \n     the vehicle from the turret, which is eighteen feet from the \n     ground. Once out of the M88, Randall and Sergeant Percy \n     realized that ``Master Guns'' was still inside. Randall and \n     Sergeant Percy managed to return to the inside of the M88 and \n     drag him to safety. Within minutes, Randall, Sergeant Percy, \n     and Master Gunnery Sergeant Denogean were flown to a field \n     hospital to receive medical attention. Sergeant Percy had \n     received two shrapnel wounds, Sergeant Denogean had received \n     a head injury rendering him unconscious and Randall had \n     sustained extensive shrapnel wounds to both legs, his face, \n     and one shoulder. The damage to Randall's left leg was \n     irreparable, requiring an amputation below the knee. His \n     right leg sustained compound fractures of both lower leg \n     bones and tissue damage requiring skin grafts. All three \n     soldiers are recovering.\n       Randall spent a week in the hospital in Ramstein, Germany \n     before being flown to Bethesda, Maryland where he spent \n     seventeen days in the Bethesda Naval Hospital. He returned to \n     Louisiana on April 15th. Once Randall's injuries heal and he \n     is able to be fitted for a prosthesis for his left leg, he \n     plans to go back to college and graduate in accounting.\n       Randall's story is similar to thousands who have gone \n     before him. This Country, founded on the belief in freedom \n     for all of her people, stands upon the shoulders of those who \n     have, time and again, willingly stepped into harm's way to \n     protect our freedom. Through life-altering injury to body or \n     mind, or by paying the ultimate price, these brave young men \n     and women and their families have borne the weight of freedom \n     for our families\n\n[[Page S9897]]\n\n     and the families of our children. What makes Randall special \n     is that he is ours, and through his sacrifice, we have become \n     his.\n       What an honor and a privilege it will be to thank Randall \n     in person on July 24th and 25th, 2003. The Community Salute \n     to Sergeant Phillip Randall Rugg, II, will feature a free \n     community gathering at the American Legion Hall at Forsythe \n     Park in Monroe to meet Randall from 3 to 6 p.m. on July 24th. \n     There will be a sponsor's reception and silent auction from 7 \n     to 10 p.m. on July 24th also at the American Legion Hall at a \n     cost of $15 per person. The following day, July 25th, there \n     will be a golf tournament at Calvert Crossing Golf Club, For \n     information regarding sponsorships call (318) 329-5890.

Mr. President, I rise tonight in response to the \ncomments of my friend, the Senator from Florida, about the report that \nwas issued today about September 11. There were a lot of innuendoes and \ndirect statements by the Senator from Florida with respect to the \nadministration, faults on the part of the administration leading up to \nSeptember 11 and the connection of causation between the administration \nand some deficiencies with the administration and September 11. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth.\n  My friend from Florida made the comment that the lack of resources in \nour intelligence community played a big part in the intelligence \ndeficiencies that allowed September 11 to happen. I agree with him 100 \npercent. What he failed to say is that this administration had been in \noffice less than 8 months when September 11 happened. This \nadministration had not even been through an appropriations cycle. It is \nthis body and the House that made the appropriations over the last \nseveral years that, in fact, did lead to a decline in resources, with \nthe leadership of the previous administration, that caused the \nresources not to be put in the right place, that allowed the problems \nwithin the intelligence community to arise.\n  The Senator mentioned certain declassification, or failure to \ndeclassify certain aspects of the September 11 report that were not \nincluded in the report that was released today. Again, he is exactly \nright. But there is a reason for that. The public does have a right to \nknow everything we can tell them about the facts leading up to \nSeptember 11. But the intelligence community does not have the right \nand should not release information relative to sources and methods.\n  The intelligence community is a very complex community. The \nintelligence community has human assets in place all around the world, \ngathering information from an intelligence standpoint that is important \nto saving the lives of Americans.\n  In addition to that, we have methods of gathering intelligence that \nwe simply cannot disclose and divulge to people we are gathering that \nintelligence from, or it will reduce or significantly lessen, or maybe \neven not allow us to gather information from them. So it is very \nimportant that we not release sources and methods.\n  Last, let me say my friend made the comment about secrecy on the part \nof this administration, this President. Again, nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. Secrecy is not the issue here, as set forth in that \nreport that was released today.\n  The real issue as set forth in that report is the protection of \nAmerica and the protection of Americans. This administration had done \neverything within its power leading up to September 11 to make sure the \nintelligence community had the ability to gather intelligence and that \nthe law enforcement community had the ability to interrupt and disrupt \nintelligence activity. Unfortunately, as was concluded in the report \ntoday--the Senator from Florida was the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee that participated in that report--that report says that, in \nspite of everything, there is nothing that could have been done on the \npart of the intelligence community that would have prohibited September \n11 from happening.\n  What we need to be aware of and what the American people need to be \naware of is that the intelligence community has learned a lesson from \nSeptember 11, and we are moving forward to make sure our children and \nour grandchildren live in a safe and secure America just like we have \nenjoyed. We have a lot of recommendations within that report that are \nbeing followed today to make sure America is a safer place.\n  While I commend the men and women--and I was part of it--who worked \nvery hard to get that report together, there is a lot of information in \nthat report that was not declassified and which should not be \ndeclassified so that we can have a safer and more secure America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico ought to be \ndoing the thanking. I knew when the people of the Senator's State sent \nhim up here--he thanked us, but we ought to be thanking him; we thank \nthe people of his State for sending him here--we knew when the Senator \ncame that he was going to be a stalwart and someone to whom we could \nlook. We knew we would be getting the ``straight scoop,'' so to speak. \nTonight it didn't take the Senator very long to set this record \nstraight.\n  There is no use playing politics with things that do not need any \npolitics added to them. There are already plenty of problems \nsurrounding that big tragedy that came to America. We thank the Senator \nfor telling us the way it is, the way it was, and the way we ought to \nunderstand it. This Senator thanks him for that. I wish he had more to \nsay. I hope before it is over, he will have more to say about it.\n  With all of the inferences and implications when things go wrong, \nthere is a political campaign. Just wait, and somebody will find some \nreason to blame the person running for office. Regardless of how \nfarfetched or how wild, or how irrelevant it is, it will be there.\n  Frankly, we have a Senate with lots of privileges. I like the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida. He had a big job when he had to put \nthat report together. He doesn't have any more to say about it than a \nlot of other people. He just happens to be running for President. So he \nhas a lot to say. But we thank the Senator very much for his few words \nwhich are excellent, as I understand it, and it is something we needed \nto hear.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I will have a lot more to say about it \nlater.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I hope so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9897-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9897-S9898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ELECTIONS IN CAMBODIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Cambodians will go to the polls this \nweekend for the third round of parliamentary elections since the 1991 \nParis Peace Accords.\n  Elections half way around the world in a country best known for the \nkilling fields of the 1970s would ordinarily warrant little attention \nby Washington or other foreign capitals. However, in the post-September \n11 world such political exercises have heightened importance to America \nand the free world.\n  Cambodia today is a lawless country, with the thin veneer of \ndemocracy bestowed by U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 all but worn \naway by political turmoil and crises. Under the repressive rule of \nPrime Minister Hun Sen and the ruling Cambodian People's Party, CPP, \nhuman rights abuses are committed with impunity, developments stymied \nby corruption and incompetence, and a palpable climate of fear persists \nthroughout a country side controlled by CPP authorities.\n  Under Prime Minister Hun Sen's lawless rule, Cambodia has become the \nZimbabwe of Southeast Asia.\n  Many in the diplomatic community continue to wrongly believe that the \nCPP offers Cambodia stability. This thinking is nonsensical.\n  A CPP coup d'etat in July 1997 destroyed the coalition government \ncobbled together after the 1993 polls. Grenade attacks against \nopposition parties in 1995 and 1997 were a clear attempt by CPP to \nsilence its rivals through violence and intimidation. And anti-Thai \nriots earlier this year were fueled by the reckless comments of the \nPrime Minister, who failed to protect Thai diplomatic property and \npersonnel from government-paid thugs, the Pagoda Boys.\n  More worrisome to the international community should be the arrest of \nsuspect regional terrorists in Cambodia.\n\n[[Page S9898]]\n\nLax border controls and official corruption have allowed terrorists a \nfree reign in the country since the early 1990s. Cambodia is a haven \nfor criminal triads--and fertile ground for extremists. While the \nCambodian government has arrested some suspected terrorists, the \nabsence of democracy and the rule of law in Cambodia only guarantees \nthat terrorism will be a perpetual problem for that country, an and the \nentire region.\n  The Cambodian people must not miss the opportunity to use the \nupcoming polls to hold Hun Sen and the CPP accountable for the failure \nof leadership. While CPP has done everything it can to subvert the \noutcome of the elections even before the first ballots are cast, \nCambodians must vote their conscience. They hold the key to breaking \nthe cycle of violence and poverty that has gripped Cambodia for the \npast several decades.\n  I recognize that this may not be easy for many Cambodians. Anyone \nolder than 28 years old lived through the nightmare of the Pol Pot \nregime and the Vietnamese invasion and occupation. Politics got people \nkilled then--and it still does today. But unlike the past, today the \nfate of Cambodia is in the hands of the people and in the ballots they \nwill cast on July 27.\n  Cambodians must hold those in power accountable for their actions. \nThey should know that America is watching and willing to help them \nrebuild a nation committed to democracy and the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9898-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9898-S9899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, recent developments in Iraq have given \nAmericans cause for renewed confidence in our efforts there, as our \nsoldiers systematically track down, capture, or eliminate the remaining \nfugitives on the most-wanted list. The cowardly hit-and-run attacks and \nambushes on our troops have claimed American lives, but they have not \ndeterred our troops from their task of ridding Iraq of every vestige of \nthe brutal regime that ruled for so long.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to those service members who have fallen \nin this noble effort. As a nation, we must always keep in mind that our \nmilitary successes come at a high cost in the loss of promising young \nhuman lives. My State of Indiana has paid a very high price indeed. As \nof this date, 13 Indiana families have suffered the loss of a loved one \ntaking part in Operation Iraqi freedom. Seven of our losses were the \nresult of combat action. Four Indiana soldiers have died from injuries \nnot related to combat, and two have died of illnesses. I pray that \nthere will be no more, but I know the danger still exists.\n  Army Specialist Chad L. Keith of Batesville, IN, died on July 7 in \nBaghdad when his motorized patrol was ambushed. He was riding in the \nlead vehicle when it was struck by the detonation of a mine hidden \nalong the roadway.\n  Specialist Keith was 21 years old. He had joined the Army immediately \nafter graduating from Batesville High School in 2000. He went through \nparatrooper training and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at \nFort Bragg, NC. A week before he died, he talked to his mother by \ntelephone from Baghdad and spoke enthusiastically about wanting to get \nthe job done in Iraq.\n  Chad Keith was an outstanding soldier. He will be missed.\n  Army Private Robert L. McKinley of Peru, IN, died on July 8 in a \nhospital in Homburg, Germany, where he had been taken for treatment of \nsevere heat injuries suffered in the Iraqi desert. Private McKinley was \n23 years old. He had enlisted just 8 months ago and was very proud to \nbe serving with the fabled 101st Airborne Division.\n  Private McKinley, a 1998 graduate of Peru High school, was raised by \nhis grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Feller, who loved him as if he \nwere their own son. At his funeral, Private McKinley was posthumously \nawarded the Bronze Star Medal.\n  Robert McKinley was an outstanding soldier. He will be missed.\n  Sergeant First Class Craig A. Boling of Elkhart, IN, died on July 8 \nat Camp Wolf in Kuwait after being stricken by a sudden illness. \nSergeant Boling was a member of the 1st Battalion, 152nd Infantry, one \nof two Indiana National Guard battalions mobilized to provide robust \nforce protection to key bases and supply lines in Kuwait and Iraq. \nThese units have done an extraordinary job.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor several \ntimes this year to eulogize our young men and women who have died \nduring the war in Iraq, as well those who have been killed during the \npostwar period.\n  Today, I want to honor and remember three additional Americans who \nwere from California or were based in California who have died since \nthe war officially ended.\n  Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class David J. Moreno, age 26, of Gering, NE, \nwas killed July 17 in Iraq. David was assigned to the Naval Medical \nCenter, Fourth Marine Division Detachment, San Diego, CA.\n  Marine LCpl Jason Andrew Tetrault, age 20, of Moreno Valley, CA, was \nkilled in Kuwait on July 9 in a vehicle accident. He was assigned to \nthe 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Twentynine Palms, CA. He \nwas the quarterback for the Moreno Valley High School football team. He \nloved the outdoors, and told his family that he was looking forward to \nreturning to California's beaches and seeing the Pacific Ocean again.\n  Marine LCpl Cory Ryan Geurin, age 18, of Santee, CA, was killed in \nIraq on July 15. He graduated from West Hills High School in suburban \nSan Diego and was the captain of the school's wrestling team his senior \nyear. Cory was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st \nMarine Division, Twentynine Palms, CA.\n  Mr. President, 58 individuals who were from California or based in \nCalifornia have died while serving our country in Iraq. The people of \nCalifornia, as well as all Americans, mourn their loss. I continue to \npray for the safety of all of our troops and hope that they will soon \nbe reunited with their families. I also continue my call for burden \nsharing in postwar Iraq so that American soldiers will not be singled \nout.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to a brave \nvolunteer of the North Dakota National Guard who this week made the \nultimate sacrifice for his Nation. Specialist Jon Fettig was a proud \nand patriotic American killed in action in Iraq on Monday. He was many \ntimes over a volunteer, from when he made his commitment to America's \nArmed Forces by enlisting and re-enlisting in the National Guard, to \nwhen he stepped forward to serve in Iraq despite the fact that his own \nunit had not been activated.\n  Jon Fettig is the first North Dakota National Guardsman killed in \ncombat since the Korean war. Even before he volunteered to deploy to \nIraq as a combat engineer with the 957th Multi-role Bridge Company he \nhad already served 11 years in the Guard. His fellow soldiers admired \nhim and valued his service. Those still at home in North Dakota \ngathered yesterday to celebrate his memory and mourn his passing.\n  SP Fettig lived his life in a way that is surely familiar to many of \nmy distinguished colleagues here in the Senate. As Senators we are \nblessed with the opportunity to meet countless fine young Americans who \nserve our Nation in the military. Like so many National Guardsmen, SP \nFettig was a good soldier, a good civilian employee, a good citizen and \na good spouse. That he carried all those burdens at once is a tribute \nto him.\n  In this difficult time, our thoughts are with his father Larry, his \nmother Shirley, and his wife Cody. SP Fettig's sacrifice is a tragedy, \nbut we all must take comfort from the fact that, as his father has \nsaid, he died doing what he loved, a hero serving his country to the \nbest of his ability.\n  Specialist Brandon Erickson of Bismarck was another casualty of \nMonday's attack on the 957th, bringing to three the number of North \nDakota soldiers wounded in combat in Iraq. Though SP Erickson has had \npart of his arm amputated, his condition is now improving. We are \ngrateful for his service and that of the medics and doctors who treated \nhim, and thankful that he will soon be returning home.\n  Our Nation asks so much of our Guard and Reserve, and they are coming \nthrough with flying colors. The tremendous contribution of North \nDakotan active-duty personnel is matched by a truly remarkable \ncommitment by\n\n[[Page S9899]]\n\nNorth Dakota's reservists. Per capita, no State has more citizens in \nthe National Guard, and today no State has more Guard personnel \nmobilized. According to the Associated Press, 36 of every 10,000 North \nDakotans age 18 or older served on active duty with the Guard or \nReserve during this conflict. Eight hundred members of the North Dakota \nArmy National Guard are still deployed in Iraq.\n  Nearly every city and town in my State has felt the impact of an Army \nNational Guard unit activation, including Fargo, Lisbon, Bismarck, \nGrand Forks, Edgeley, Grafton, Devils Lake, Rugby, Bottineau, Wishek, \nCando, Carrington, Mayville, Oakes, and Wahpeton. And the loss of SP \nFettig, whose family lives in Dickinson, brings home the fact that many \nvolunteers from units in other communities stepped forward to fill \nvacancies in units deploying overseas. Now some of these communities \nare further scarred by their losses.\n  Today, millions of people across Iraq and America are hearing the \nnews of the death of the two brutal sons of Saddam Hussein, fully \ncomplicit in the crimes of his regime.

Mr. President, I want to share with my fellow colleagues \nan article written today by Larry Kudlow for National Review Online \nconcerning Chairman Greenspan's detrimental effect on the bond market.\n  Mr. Kudlow very clearly points out how Chairman Greenspan once again \nusurped his monetary role as Chairman of the Federal Reserve by doing a \ncomplete rhetorical 180 on deflationary pressures. As a result of the \nChairman's verbal roller coaster ride, the bond market is trading at \n4.2 percent compared to 3.1 percent in mid-June, the worst bond market \nprice rout in 9 years.\n  Many people in Congress and throughout the business world blindly \nfollow and trust Chairman Greenspan. I have never and will never wear \nthis blindfold. This is just another in a long line of examples where \nMr. Greenspan oversteps his bounds and causes economic malaise.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       This past spring Maestro Alan Greenspan issued official \n     Federal Reserve statements that deflationary declines in the \n     prices of goods and services people buy was the nation's top \n     economic danger. Consequently, he said his Fed might make \n     special purchases of Treasury bonds in order to pump new \n     money into the economy, and get bond rates lower to stimulate \n     investment.\n       But last week, in congressional testimony, Maestro G \n     changed his tune. Totally. Completely, Utterly. Suddenly he \n     said that next year's economy would be strong, and that this \n     revival would begin in the second half of this year. Hence, \n     his new thinking goes, deflation is apparently not a threat \n     and there's no need to add liquidity through special bond \n     purchases.\n       That's right. According to our Fed chairman, we've gone \n     from deflation to reflation lickety-split. If someone from \n     the CIA--after reading documents from Niger--had pulled this \n     180, they'd be forced to take a lie-detector test.\n       But what about the bond traders who trusted Greenspan and \n     stocked up on Treasuries for future sales to the Fed? Said \n     traders got their brains beaten in. Blindsided by Greenspan's \n     policy reversal, bond traders were forced to sell heavily. \n     Now the 10-year Treasury is trading at 4.2 percent compared \n     to 3.1 percent in mid-June, the worst bond-market price rout \n     in nine years.\n       Fortunately, at mid-year 2003, the whole deflation shtick \n     has turned out to be a mirage, though Greenspan was unable to \n     fathom this since late last year. The dollar's value in \n     relation to the prices of gold, commodities, and foreign \n     currencies has declined sufficiently to remove deflation as a \n     real threat. There are no Japanese-style catastrophies \n     looming out there.\n       And believe it or not, there is a silver lining to this \n     Treasury travail. A stronger outlook for economic growth--\n     from prior Fed money-creating and the newly enacted Bush tax-\n     cut plan--has driven up the real-interest-rate component of \n     the 10-year Treasury (not the inflation premium) by roughly a \n     full percentage point. So, interest rates--which had been \n     heading down for three years--are moving up.\n       This is meaningful. More normal interest-rate levels send a \n     signal to consumers and investors that it is time to push the \n     button on new purchases or new capital commitments. In fact a \n     lot of folks will be rushing to beat the next group of rate \n     hikes.\n       Of course, Maestro G himself told Congress that it is \n     unlikely the central bank will tighten in our lifetime. But \n     can anybody believe this guy anymore?\n       That aside, with supply-side tax cuts kicking in, there's \n     all the more reason for Americans to start spending and \n     investing right now. Stock market traders, who may be less \n     guillible than bond traders, seem to have known this for some \n     time. Since March equity markets have skyrocketed over 20 \n     percent.\n       Democrats may be howling about false reports of uranium \n     from Niger and big budget deficits from Washington, but these \n     will be non-starter issues in next year's presidential \n     election. The stock market crowd knows a peace-and-prosperity \n     election landslide when they see one. The guys in the stock \n     trading pits have also figured out that anytime taxes on \n     investment are cut, more investment will quickly follow. \n     While bondland has been hemorrhaging, equityland has fully \n     understood an age-old axiom: When you slash marginal tax \n     rates, you always get higher asset values and more powerful \n     economic recovery.\n       Watching Britain's Tony Blair standing resolute and tall in \n     the saddle next to George W. Bush, it's pretty clear that a \n     bunch of ankle-biting Democrats won't deter the age-old \n     Anglo-American partnership in their just quest to bring \n     freedom and liberty to the Middle East (and elsewhere). If \n     liberal critics would unlock their eyeballs for just a \n     nanosecond, they would clearly see that the Bush/Blair axis \n     of freedom is causing peace dominos to fall throughout the \n     Arab region. Rather than a McGovernite quagmire in Vietnam, \n     the prospect for free elections and free enterprise looks \n     better today as a result of the application of force in the \n     defense of liberty than at any time in the last 700 years.\n       At home, low-tax free enterprise is also gathering force. \n     There has never been a major upturn in the stock market or \n     the economy without broad-based tax cuts. President Bush has \n     delivered--as promised--and this country's entrepreneurial \n     and ownership-oriented investor class is rightly looking to \n     much better times ahead.\n       As for the bond-bungling Greenspan, perhaps the 77-year-old \n     Fed chairman will take a page from the book of Citigroup \n     Chairman Sandy Weill, who recently chose a successor and then \n     gracefully announced retirement at age 70. As usual, the \n     private sector is way ahead of government.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9899-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       AMAZING GRACE ON THE SEAS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, earlier this month, newlyweds Walt and \nDonyelle Wilkins from Greenville, SC, were on their way to their \nhoneymoon, when the small plane they were on crashed into the ocean. \nBecause of their quick action and disregard for personal safety, they \nsaved the lives of two young children, also passengers on the plane. I \nrise to salute this couple, and to thank them for their true heroism.\n  Walt and Donyelle were married in Charleston two Saturdays ago. The \nday after the wedding the couple took off from Ft. Lauderdale, heading \nto the Bahamas, when the plane crashed into the open sea. After \nassisting others out of the sinking plane and distributing life \njackets, Walt jumped into the rough sea without a life jacket and swam \nto others, assisting them in inflating their jackets, while Donyelle \nheld an infant above the waves.\n  After the parents of the infant were located in the water the child \nwas passed to them so that Walt and Donyelle could assist two small \nchildren whose mother had just drowned. Several of the surviving \npassengers decided to attempt to swim to the nearest land some six \nmiles away. But Walt and Donyelle stayed with the young children, \nkeeping their heads above the waters and calming them by singing \n``Amazing Grace.'' Approximately 2 hours later, they were rescued by a \nCoast Guard helicopter.\n  The children are alive today because of the Wilkins' amazing grace \nunder threats no one should ever have to face.

Mr. President, I rise today to point out the \naccomplishments of the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center \nfor Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder for fiscal year 2002. As spelled out \nin its 13th annual report, the Center for PTSD has made significant \nstrides in the treatment of this trauma--steps that became particularly \nmeaningful following September 11, 2001.\n  Born during a time of crisis, the Center was created just months \nbefore the Loma Prieta, CA, earthquake in 1989. That event's aftermath \nbecame the Center's first real emergency-response experience. Since \nthen, the Center has been called in time and time again to treat the \nmental trauma resulting from disasters, including the crisis brought on \nin my own state of Florida following Hurricane Andrew.\n  Though the Center's primary focus has always been and continues to be \ntheis country's veterans, the knowledge and expertise gained through \nwork in the VA system has proved to be invaluable in all areas related \nto disaster mental health. This became all too clear in the weeks and \nmonths following September 11, 2001. The Center for PTSD's fiscal year \nactually began on October 1, 2001, just weeks after the events of 9/11. \nThe year that followed proved to be the Center's greatest test of its \n13-year history, calling into play all three of the Center's main areas \nof endeavor: research, education, and consultation.\n  In 2001, the Center took leadership of a 3-year project to develop \nbest-practice guidelines for emergency mental health interventions, \ntaking into account both criminal and natural disasters. By the time 9/\n11 had taken place, staff were one year into the project, enabling them \nuse the wealth of research and analysis already accumulated. During the \nrecovery efforts, the Center's education materials, especially those on \nthe website, proved very helpful in educating relief workers, victims, \nfamilies and bystanders about PTSD and how to cope with it.\n  In addition, Center staff were called upon to consult for several \nagencies. Its researchers used the recovery process as an opportunity \nto gather data and conduct long-term research studies on the effects of \n9/11, including a major study involving the entire Fire Department of \nNew York.\n  In the end, this report proves mostly to be a living history of the \nevents of September 11 and the way our Nation coped with those \ntragedies. As documented in the report's pages, the lessons of that day \nwill remain invaluable to the future treatment of PTSD, for both our \nNation's veterans as well as the rest of the country.\n  As Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am proud \nof the accomplishments the Center for PTSD has made in treating \ndisaster-related mental health. The hard work and dedication of its \nstaff proved invaluable to all those affected by September 11, 2001, \nregardless of whether they witnessed firsthand the attacks in New York \nCity and Washington, DC, or simply watched the events of that terrible \nday unfold on their television.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9900-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KOREAN WAR ARMISTICE\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, more than half a century ago, America \nanswered the call to defend freedom in South Korea. Today, we continue \nto defend democracy and freedom in over 100 countries around the world.\n  This war against communism is sometimes referred to as the \n``Forgotten War'' because it came at the heels of World War II and was \novershadowed by the Vietnam War. Indeed, there are fewer pages in our \nchildren's textbooks about this war than that of other wars. But the \ncause of freedom was no less important. The bravery of the Nation's \nKorean War veterans was no less significant. And the sacrifices of \nthese veterans and their families were no less meaningful.\n  Twenty-two nations joined 1.8 million Americans in risking life and \nlimb to defend a country they did not know and a people they had never \nmet. Included were the young men and women who fought on the mountains \nof Korea in places such as Pork Chop Hill and Bloody Ridge. The United \nStates suffered 36,934 casualties and 103,284 wounded during the Korean \nWar; another 8,000 were taken prisoner or met an unknown fate. In my \nstate of Arkansas, 466 brave servicemen and women paid the ultimate \nsacrifice. These are our Nation's heroes and they acted selflessly to \nbring forth freedom and opportunity for generations.\n  July 27 marks the 50th Anniversary of the armistice with North Korea. \nI take this opportunity to thank our Korean War veterans and their \nfamilies for their great service and dedication to our Nation. We owe \nour Korean War veterans a debt of gratitude that we can never repay.\n  The Korean War veterans defined ``new opportunity for all.'' They \ndefended and promoted the virtues of democracy abroad, providing an \nemerging Nation a chance to develop and flourish into the viable \ncountry it is today. I can not begin to imagine how different Southeast \nAsia and the world would be if it was not for the true determination \nand unbelievable courage demonstrated by our soldiers, airmen, marines \nand sailors.\n  American servicemen and women remain on-point in Korea to protect \nfreedom along what is referred to as the world's most dangerous border. \nI commend them also for their bravery and commitment to democracy.\n  From Korea to Iraq, let us not forget the sacrifices that our men and \nwomen in uniform have made on behalf of our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9900-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9900-S9901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN REMEMBERANCE OF STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it is with great pride and honor I rise \namongst my fellow colleagues to honor one of America's finest citizens, \nSenator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.\n  When I look at Strom's unbelievable life and career and all that he \nhas accomplished, I often find myself wondering how one man could \npossibly do so many different and amazing things in just one lifetime. \nStrom Thurmond truly deserves the title of renaissance man.\n  He has been a farmer, teacher, coach, lawyer, judge, author, \nGovernor, war veteran, major general in the U.S. Army Reserves, State \nSenator, United States Senator, Democrat, Dixiecrat, Republican, \nhusband and father, and most importantly to all of us--a friend. He was \nborn when Theodore Roosevelt was president and lived through 18 \ndifferent Presidencies. To put the longevity of his political career in \nperspective, Strom Thurmond won an election 18 years before President \nGeorge W. Bush was even born. This is also a man who enlisted during \nWorld War II and jumped on D-Day with the 82nd Airborne when he was in \nhis forties.\n  From 1954 when he ran and won a seat in the United States Senate as a \nwrite-in candidate, until his death on June 26, 2003, Strom Thurmond \nworked tirelessly and selflessly for the people of South Carolina and \nthe citizens of this great Nation, casting more than 15,000 votes in \nhis senatorial tenure. Whether or not people ever agreed with Strom \npolitically, they certainly admired his zest and his passion.\n  In his earlier days in Congress, Strom argued for segregationist \npolicies. In many ways, people have used\n\n[[Page S9901]]\n\nthis to try and discredit this American icon. But most people forget he \nlater championed civil rights laws and Black institutions. As Winston \nChurchill said, ``To improve is to change, to be perfect is to change \noften.'' Strom Thurmond was an honest and principled man, but he also \nwas a man constantly striving to make this a better nation.\n  I now ask my fellow members of the Senate to join me in honoring our \ngood friend and colleague for all he did throughout his life and \nthroughout his tenure in the Senate. His brilliance, leadership and \nunmatched wit will be sorely missed by this legislative body and by the \nentire Nation. On June 26, 2003, one of this Nation's brightest stars \nfaded away. Even though the light may be out, I believe we all will \nfind our own way to hold on to the many memories and stories Strom \nThurmond left behind with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9901-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      IN MEMORY OF MR. PAUL BERNAL\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a great New \nMexican, Paul Bernal, who passed away on July 16. Mr. Bernal was a \ntruly remarkable--yet remarkably humble--man.\n  Mr. Bernal was best known for his work to recover the Pueblo de Taos' \ntitle to its people's sacred Blue Lake, which lies in the Sangre de \nCristo Mountains of northern New Mexico. Mr. Bernal served the Pueblo \nfor many decades as a strategist and interpreter in its struggle to \nrestore this sacred piece of land, which was taken without just \ncompensation by the United States at the turn of the century. The \nPueblo de Taos is a very traditional community and at that time had few \nleaders who spoke the English language. This language barrier stalled \nthe Pueblo's efforts for decades. Mr. Bernal, who in 1946 had completed \nhis service to this country aboard the aircraft carrier Ticonderoga in \nWorld War II, was appointed by the Pueblo elders to overcome this \nbarrier and achieve the goal of restoring these sacred lands.\n  Mr. Bernal and his colleagues did achieve their goal, and the \nrestoration act returned 48,000 acres of the Carson National Forest to \nbe held in trust for the Pueblo to use for traditional purposes. It \nalso restored to the Pueblo their rights to hunt, fish, graze livestock \nand, most importantly, to hold their lakeside ceremonies undisturbed. \nMr. Bernal's courage and dedication is an inspiration and a testament \nto perseverance from which we can all learn.\n  I am honored to say that I had the opportunity to work with the \nPueblo and Mr. Bernal when I cosponsored a bill in the mid-1990's to \nrestore a final tract of sacred land to complete the Blue Lake \nwilderness' integrity--a tract the Taos Pueblo people use as the sacred \nPath of Life Trail that connects the Pueblo itself with Blue Lake. At a \n1994 hearing on the bill, I had the privilege of hosting the last of \nMr. Bernal's many appearances before the Senate Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources. At that hearing, Mr. Bernal remembered the days when \nhe testified before the distinguished and longtime Committee Chairman \nScoop Jackson: ``They used to call me Mr. Blue Lake,'' Mr. Bernal said, \n``I loved that name.''\n  Mr. Blue Lake surely will be missed. My thoughts and prayers are with \nPaul Bernal's family and community. I hope they can be comforted by the \nfact that his was a life of dedicated service to his people and \ncountry, and that his legacy will endure with the continued use of the \nsacred Blue Lake and its surrounding wilderness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9901-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLIN ``BIG C'' MacGUIRE\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to give tribute to \nMr. Colin MacGuire, affectionately known by all as ``Big C.'' Standing \nat 4-foot-7-inches, Mr. MacGuire is a small man in stature, but a large \nman in character, integrity, and heart. ``Big C'' is an avid and \nfaithful Alabama fan and is even touted by some as one the South's \nbiggest Bama fans.\n  ``Big C's'' love for the Crimson Tide began at an early age, when he \nreceived four College Football Digest books. He immediately began \nmemorizing the Tide's scores, stats, and other historical information \nand has continued to this day. It is this deep knowledge and love for \nhis team, that led ``Big C'' to author ``Crimson Tide: 1,015 Questions \nand Answers.''\n  After graduating from Fort Dale Academy in 1976, Mr. MacGuire took \nthe advice of his father and enrolled in Marion Military Institute, but \nafter only one year, he transferred to the University of Alabama. While \nat the University, he was the manager for the wrestling team in the \nfall of 1977, and in the spring of 1978, he began managing the Crimson \nTide football team. During this time, Colin had the wonderful \nopportunity to work for the legendary Coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant, as \nwell as, to run the sidelines while the Tide won back-to-back National \nChampionships on the field.\n  Mr. MacGuire graduated from the University of Alabama in the spring \nof 1980 with a bachelor's degree in communications, but his hear has \nnever left Tuscaloosa. ``Big C'' continues this commitment to the Tide \nas both a fan and alumnus. He has never met a stranger and continues to \nspread his kindness and infectious laugh to his community.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an Idaho \nbusiness that is celebrating 20 years of providing wonderful food \nproducts, jobs, and economic strength to the citizens of Canyon County \nand Idaho.\n  Matterhorn Ice Cream, Inc. is located in Caldwell, ID. They are a \nhome-grown company that has become a nationally recognized leader in \nice cream novelty products. Matterhorn is an independent producer of \n``Super Premium'' ice cream novelty products sold primarily in \nconvenience stores. They also have production contracts with industry \nleading companies such as Costco, Kroger, ConAgra, Weight Watchers, and \nmore. This year they developed a World Series commemorative ice cream \nsandwich for the World Champion Anaheim Angels.\n  Matterhorn has won Convenience Store News' ``Best New Product of The \nYear'' award three times. And company President Tom Nist was recently \nrecognized as a finalist for Ernst and Young's prestigious 2003 \n``Entrepreneur of The Year'' award.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to low-interest \n     loans for military personnel called to active duty; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 151\n\n       Whereas, The recent events in our country have served to \n     remind us of the degree to which our nation relies upon the \n     sacrifices of our men and women in the military. With the \n     call to active duty of thousands of members of National Guard \n     and reserve units for overseas deployment and an increasing \n     range of domestic security assignments, it is clear that our \n     military strength is rooted in both the professional ranks \n     and those working in civilian life while serving as ready \n     reserves; and\n       Whereas, The men and women called to active duty to help \n     the country respond to a crisis such as we have faced since \n     September 11, 2001, do so at great cost to their families \n     and, often, their careers. The uncertain length of the \n     activation in the current situation can make the return to \n     active duty a devastating blow to the finances of a family or \n     a small business. When the person called to duty is the \n     primary breadwinner in a family, for example, as is often the \n     case, the family can face many difficulties. The mortgage \n     payments, food and utility bills, and costs of raising \n     children do not go away when the regular paycheck is replaced \n     by a military paycheck that is usually far less; and\n       Whereas, While it would be impossible to cover the entire \n     burden facing many families, it would be helpful for the \n     federal government to do all it can to address this issue. A \n     low-interest loan program for those whose active duty pay is \n     less than civilian levels can provide short-term help with \n     the monthly bills. For families who have sent someone to \n     fight terrorism, whether overseas or on assignments at \n     airports or border crossings, this would be an appropriate \n     step to take: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to provide a program of low-interest loans \n     for military personnel called to active duty; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-236. A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of Nevada relative to expenditures of money for \n     restoration of and water developments on the public lands in \n     Nevada; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, In recent years, wildfires have caused extensive \n     damage to the public lands of this state by destroying \n     thousands of acres of public lands used for economic, \n     wildlife and recreational purposes, and have increased the \n     threat of infestation of exotic annual grasses and noxious \n     weeds which may, if not controlled cause further degradation \n     of the lands, deterioration of wildlife habitat, erosion, and \n     diminished water quality; and\n       Whereas, Responsible management and preservation of the \n     public lands of this state require restoration of the public \n     lands through various means, including, without limitation, \n     reseeding, planting indigenous grasses and shrubs, combating \n     exotic annual grasses and noxious weeds and reducing the\n\n[[Page S9903]]\n\n     encroachment or density of certain plants for purposes of \n     fire suppression; and\n       Whereas, Because of a lack of adequate water developments \n     on the public lands of this state, wildlife and livestock on \n     those public lands have been forced to concentrate near the \n     limited number of water developments thus jeopardizing the \n     ecological health of the public lands; and\n       Whereas, Responsible management and preservation of the \n     public lands of this state require increasing the number of \n     water developments on the public lands of this state so that \n     the wildlife and livestock on those public lands will be \n     properly dispersed; and\n       Whereas, Proper management and preservation of the public \n     lands and waters of this state are critical as these lands \n     support a wide variety of vital activities that are integral \n     to the economic success and enjoyment of the natural \n     resources of this state, including ranching, mining and \n     recreation, and are a unique and important historical, \n     cultural and environmental resource that must be maintained \n     and preserved for the use and appreciation of current and \n     future Nevadans; and\n       Whereas, The continued economic success of this state, \n     existence of wildlife diversity in this state and enjoyment \n     derived from the natural resources of this state depend on \n     the maintenance of healthy ecosystems within the public lands \n     and waters of this state; and\n       Whereas, The Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of \n     1998, Pub. L. 105-263, 112 Stat. 2343, authorizes the \n     Secretary of the Interior to expend a portion of the proceeds \n     of the sale or exchange of certain public lands in Clark \n     County for conservation initiatives on certain public \n     lands in Clark County; and\n       Whereas, It would greatly benefit and protect the \n     ecosystems on the public lands in Clark County if the \n     Secretary of the Interior expended the money authorized for \n     such conservation initiatives to pay for restoration of and \n     water developments on certain public lands in Clark County; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, 43 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2301 et seq., which addresses the sale or \n     exchange of public lands in areas other than certain public \n     lands in Clark County, requires the Secretary of the Interior \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture to use the proceeds of such \n     sales or exchanges for certain purposes, but the Act does not \n     specifically designate any money for restoration of and water \n     developments on the public lands in the areas in which the \n     sales or exchanges occurred; and\n       Whereas, It would greatly benefit and protect the \n     ecosystems on the public lands in the areas of this state \n     where public lands are sold or exchanged pursuant to the \n     Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, 43 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 2301 et seq., if the Act authorized the Secretary \n     of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to expend a \n     portion of the proceeds obtained from such sales or exchanges \n     for restoration of and water developments on the public lands \n     in those areas: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the Nevada Legislature hereby \n     urge the Secretary of the Interior to expend the money \n     authorized pursuant to the Southern Nevada Public Land \n     Management Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105-263, 112 Stat. 2343, for \n     conservation initiatives on certain public lands in Clark \n     County to pay for restoration of and water developments on \n     such public lands in Clark County; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Nevada Legislature hereby \n     urge Congress to amend the Federal Land Transaction \n     Facilitation Act, 43 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2301 et seq., to \n     authorize the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to expend money obtained pursuant to the Act to \n     pay for restoration of and water developments on the public \n     lands in the areas of Nevada where public lands are sold or \n     exchanged pursuant to the Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, \n     the Director of the Bureau of Land Management and each member \n     of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-237. A joint resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of Nevada relative to the allocation of water rights \n     for watering livestock on public lands; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, Approximately 87 percent of the land in Nevada is \n     held by the Federal Government and approximately 68 percent \n     of the land in Nevada is administered by the Bureau of Land \n     Management of the Department of the Interior; and\n       Whereas, Proper management and allocation of water \n     resources on those lands are critical to the State of Nevada \n     as those lands comprise a vast majority of the land in Nevada \n     and as Nevada is one of the most arid states in the nation; \n     and\n       Whereas, The State of Nevada has traditionally allocated \n     water rights on public lands managed or controlled by the \n     Federal Government pursuant to a system that provides an \n     option for a range user to hold water rights for watering \n     livestock solely in his own name; and\n       Whereas, In the mid-1990s, the Secretary of the Interior \n     adopted regulations to be administered by the Bureau of Land \n     Management which departed from that system by establishing a \n     new approach to the allocation of water rights for watering \n     livestock on public lands; and\n       Whereas, This new approach is codified in the second \n     sentence of 43 C.F.R. Sec. 4120.3-9 and has the effect of \n     significantly interfering with a range user holding such \n     water rights solely in his own name even if the range user \n     was fully responsible for the development of the water rights \n     and putting the water at issue to beneficial use; and\n       Whereas, Since the adoption of the federal regulation at \n     issue, important water developments on the public lands in \n     Nevada have been postponed while the State of Nevada and the \n     Bureau of Land Management attempt to resolve issues \n     concerning the allocation of water rights for watering \n     livestock on public lands; and\n       Whereas, If the sentence of 43 C.F.R. Sec. 4120.3-9 which \n     is at issue were deleted.:\n       1. The State of Nevada could provide a range user the \n     option of holding water rights for watering livestock on \n     public lands in Nevada solely in his own name, without \n     interference, as the State has done successfully for many \n     years;\n       2. A range user who is fully and solely responsible for the \n     development of water rights and putting those water rights to \n     beneficial use would be authorized to hold such water rights \n     in his own name; and\n       3. Important water developments on the public lands in the \n     State of Nevada could be resumed; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the 72nd Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature hereby urge the Secretary of the Interior to \n     amend the regulations set forth in 43 C.F.R. Sec. 4120.3-9 by \n     deleting the second sentence of that regulation in its \n     entirety; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as presiding officer of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, the Director of the Bureau of Land \n     Management and each member of the Nevada Congressional \n     Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-238. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to urging the United States Department of Homeland \n     Security to locate its Midwestern Headquarters at the \n     Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 47\n\n       Whereas, As our country continues to put in place stronger \n     defenses against terrorism through homeland security \n     measures, a key component will be the establishment of \n     regional headquarters for the United States Department of \n     Homeland Security. The President has called for regional \n     centers in his 2004 budget proposal; and\n       Whereas, In the Midwest, an excellent site for a regional \n     headquarters is the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in \n     Macomb County. The advantages this location offers range from \n     low costs, unsurpassed strategic significance, and facilities \n     that can provide for a swift and smooth transition to the \n     responsibilities of homeland security work; and\n       Whereas, Located at the heart of the nation's freshwater \n     network and near several of the busiest international points \n     of entry along our northern border, Selfridge is well \n     positioned to handle quickly any type of task to protect \n     America's people, resources, and infrastructure. Clearly, \n     this location offers opportunities for enhanced \n     responsiveness to the challenges before us in safeguarding \n     our nation in the years ahead; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     United States Department of Homeland Security to locate its \n     Midwestern headquarters at the Selfridge Air National Guard \n     Base in Macomb County; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland \n     Security, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-239. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to \n     repealing the federal excise tax on telephone and other \n     communications services; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, The federal tax on telephone service was put in \n     place in 1898 as a temporary luxury tax on the new technology \n     of the telephone. At that time, the government needed money \n     to help pay for the Spanish-American War. Over the past \n     century, this tax, which is now three percent, has been \n     changed many times; and\n       Whereas, Recently, a focal point of tax policy has been the \n     question of taxing another emerging communications \n     technology, the Internet. This discussion has caused some \n     observers to reexamine the nature of certain taxes. There is \n     a strong parallel between the\n\n[[Page S9904]]\n\n     notion of taxing some aspect of the Internet and the tax \n     applied to the telephone a century ago; and\n       Whereas, The federal excise tax on telephone services \n     provides an example of poor public policy. This tax is \n     regressive in that all taxpayers, regardless of ability to do \n     so, pay the same rate even though a phone is a necessity of \n     modern life. Unlike other federal excise taxes, the telephone \n     tax is not an attempt to reduce public use of a product like \n     tobacco or alcohol that can be harmful and is not needed. In \n     addition, the money raised from this excise tax does not go \n     to any specific purpose related to telecommunications; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to repeal the federal excise tax on telephone and \n     other communications services; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-240. A resolution from the Senate of the Legislature of \n     the State of Michigan international border crossings; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 149\n\n       Whereas, The events of September 11, 2001, have shattered \n     the illusion that past practices are adequate when it comes \n     to security issues. One of the most important elements of \n     security for our state is the need for stronger and more \n     thorough measures at Michigan's international points of \n     entry. While some people have long called for increased \n     resources at border crossings, there is a little disputing \n     the significance of this now; and\n       Whereas, Because of its unique and mutually beneficial \n     relationship with Ontario, Michigan includes some of the \n     busiest crossing points along the entire United States-Canada \n     border. In addition to the number of people who cross the \n     border each year, the amount of equipment and goods here far \n     surpasses the traffic in other regions. The importance of \n     free trade to both our countries is reflected in the volume \n     of material that comes into Michigan each day; and\n       Whereas, Although there may eventually be other ways to \n     heighten security at border crossings with new technologies \n     and other strategies, the most effective, immediate, and \n     practical approach to take is to increase significantly the \n     number of customs agents working at entry points. No single \n     step offers a greater return than putting more trained and \n     dedicated customs agents at our international border \n     crossings. In addition to the added measure of security from \n     better inspections and examinations of people and goods \n     entering the country, the increased staffing would also bring \n     benefits by reducing delays as much as is practical; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to increase the number of customs \n     inspectors at Michigan's international border crossings; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-241. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Pennsylvania relative to \n     prescription drug benefits to recipients of Medicare; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                           Senate Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The United States House of Representatives is \n     about to consider legislation proposed by President Bush that \n     would provide prescription drug benefits to recipients of \n     Medicare; and\n       Whereas, The proposed legislation utilizes private \n     companies to provide the benefits but does not consider \n     public programs such as PACE and PACENET; and\n       Whereas, PACE, PACENET and public programs like them in 12 \n     other states have saved millions of dollars in expensive \n     medical procedures which have been prevented or delayed \n     because participants have been kept healthy with their needed \n     prescription medications; and\n       Whereas, Because the benefits of State programs will likely \n     be more generous than any Federal benefit, low-income seniors \n     will not leave PACE and PACENET, and Pennsylvania will see no \n     savings; and\n       Whereas, Consequently PACE and PACENET should be recognized \n     as PROVIDERS under any Medicare prescription drug bill passed \n     by the Congress of the United States; and\n       Whereas, Our seniors would be allowed to continue to use a \n     program they trust while reimbursing PACE and PACENET \n     appropriately; and\n       Whereas, Protecting seniors' options for coverage so they \n     have real choices is paramount and can lead to significant \n     cost savings and expanded benefits as well as rewarding \n     states that invest in prescription drug coverage; and\n       Whereas, Congress is urged to include the following \n     language in the proposed legislation:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, at the option \n     of the State, any person enrolled in a State prescription \n     assistance program or a Section 1115 Medicaid Pharmacy Plus \n     Demonstration Program and eligible for Medicare benefits \n     shall be deemed enrolled in the Medicare prescription program \n     established by this act to the extent of but no more than the \n     benefit amount provided under this act. The Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services shall transfer a sum to each \n     eligible State equivalent to the amount of Federal funds that \n     would have been expended under the program established by \n     this act. The sum shall be transferred once every three \n     months and shall provide funding for prescription services \n     and related administrative expenses for the total number of \n     enrolled individuals in the previous three months. In the \n     case of a State with a Section 1115 Medicaid Pharmacy Plus \n     Demonstration Program, the amount transferred pursuant to \n     this act shall be deducted from the State's Medicaid claim \n     for quarter covered by the transfer; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urge Congress to consider the \n     PACE and PACENET programs for inclusion in the President's \n     proposed program to provide prescription drug benefits to \n     recipients of Medicare; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9904-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCAIN, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, without amendment:\n       S. 1260.

A bill to reauthorize programs under the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Act and the Missing Children's Assistance Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``the Runaway, \nHomeless and Missing Children Protection Act of 2003.'' This bill would \nreauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act as well as the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act enables public and private \nentities to establish and operate centers for runaway and homeless \nyouth. These centers--which provide, among other things, shelter, \ncounseling, drug and sexual abuse education and treatment for youth--\nserve as alternatives for youths who are in the child welfare or \njuvenile justice systems. These alternatives have proven successful in \nkeeping children off of our streets and from returning to our juvenile \njustice system.\n  The Runaway, Homeless and Missing Children Protection Act amends the \noriginal Act in the following ways: 1. It includes testing youth for \nsexually transmitted diseases; 2. It allows an exception to the 20 \nperson maximum capacity to comply with States laws which may allow \nhigher capacities; 3. It allows youths to go to maternity group homes, \nadds the homes to the list of eligible groups; 4. It increases the \nmaximum amount of time a youth may spend in a home; 5. It requires the \ncenters/groups to inform school districts of the status of youths, and \nit requires the centers/groups to inform youths of post-secondary \neducation and training opportunities; and 6. It authorizes the Act \nthrough fiscal year 2008.\n  In addition, the Act reauthorizes the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children through Fiscal Year 2008. The Center is a critical \ncomponent of our Nation's battle against child pornography and child \nexploitation. It is absolutely dedicated to eradicating these evils, \nand its members work tirelessly towards this end. The Center deserves \nmore than just kind words for these heroic efforts; federal funding is \nnecessary for it to continue this good work. Indeed, Congress has \ntasked the Center with many missions, including maintaining the cyber-\ntipline that receives reports of online child pornography, which the \nCenter forwards to appropriate law enforcement officials and the new \npilot program to study the feasibility of instituting a national \nbackground check for volunteers who work with children. In these, as \nwell as many other areas, the Center forms a valuable partnership with \nboth Federal and State law enforcement officials and prosecutors in \nredressing a host of crimes against children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this Act and these important \nprograms.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Hatch to \nintroduce legislation to reauthorize and improve the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Act, and to extend the authorization of the Missing \nChildren's Assistance Act. We would extend both laws through 2008. This \nbill follows in the footsteps of the recently enacted PROTECT Act \nlegislation, and presents another milestone in our efforts to safeguard \nall of our children.\n  In the 29 years since it became law, the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nAct has helped some of the most vulnerable children in our country. A \nJustice Department report released last year estimated that 1.7 million \nyoung people either ran away from home or were thrown out of their home \nin 1999. Other studies have suggested an even higher number. This law \nand the programs it funds provide a safety net that helps give these \nyoung people a chance to build lives for themselves. It is slated to \nexpire at the end of this fiscal year, and Congress should not allow \nthat to happen.\n\n[[Page S9907]]\n\n  Under the Act, ever State receives a Basic Center grant of at least \n$100,000 to provide housing and crisis services for runaway and \nhomeless youth and their families. Community-based groups around the \ncountry can also apply for funding through the Transitional Living \nProgram, TLP, and the Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach grant \nprogram. TLP grants are used to provide longer-term housing to homeless \nyouth between the ages of 16 and 21, and to help them become self-\nsufficient. The Outreach grants are used to target youth who have \nengaged in or are at risk of engaging in high-risk behaviors while \nliving on the street.\n  In my State, the Vermont Coalition for Runaway and Homeless Youth and \nSpectrum Youth and Family Services in Burlington receive grants under \nthese programs and have provided excellent services both to young \npeople trying to build lives on their own and to those who are \nstruggling on the streets. Reauthorizing this law will allow them to \ncontinue their enormously important work.\n  This bill would improve the TLP by extending the period during which \nolder homeless youth can receive services, to ensure that all homeless \nyouth can take advantage of TLP services at least until they turn 18. \nIt would also amend the grant allocation formula to allow between 45 \nand 55 percent of funding to be used for TLP services, an increase from \nthe current statutory maximum of 30 percent. In practice, TLP services \nhave proven so critical that the appropriations committees already \nallocate 45 percent of the fund to TLPs, and this change will bring the \nauthorizing statute in line with reality.\n  The bill would also make permanent the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices' authority to make grants explicitly to help rural areas meet \nthe unique stresses of providing services to runaway and homeless \nyouth. Programs serving runaway and homeless youth have found that \nthose in rural areas are particularly difficult to reach and serve \neffectively, and this bill recognizes that fact.\n  In addition, we take steps in this bill to ensure that runaway and \nhomeless youth are aware of the educational opportunities available to \nthem, and to increase coordination between HHS and the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development.\n  The improvements proposed in this bill to the Missing Children's \nAssistance Act build on provisions included in the PROTECT Act \nlegislation that we enacted earlier this year. In that bill, we \nauthorized National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \n``NCMEC'', activities through 2005 and authorized the Center to \nstrengthen its CyberTipline to provide online users an effective means \nof reporting Internet-related child sexual exploitation in distribution \nof child pornography, online enticement of children for sexual acts, \nand child prostitution. The legislation we introduce today would extend \nNCMEC through 2008. Now more than ever, it is critical for Congress to \ngive the Center the resources it needs in order to pursue its important \nwork. A missing or abducted child is the worst nightmare of any parent \nor grandparent, and NCMEC has proved to be an invaluable resource in \nFederal, State, and local efforts to recover children who have \ndisappeared.\n  Although this is a very good bill on the whole, I am disappointed \nthat Senator Hatch did not agree to remove a provision that was \nincluded in the House bill that prohibits grantees from using any funds \nprovided under this program for needle distribution programs. This is a \nsuperfluous provision that simply repeats what is already law. In \naddition, it is unnecessary because no grantee under this program \noperates needle exchange programs or has expressed interest in doing \nso. The inclusion of this needless provision, however, does not change \nthe fact that this is still a good bill.\n  These programs have received tremendous bipartisan support over the \nyears, and the House has already passed this bill by a vote of 404-14. \nThe Senate should consider this bill as promptly as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1453. A bill to expedite procedures for hazardous fuels reduction \nactivities and restoration in wildlife fire prone national forests and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to address \nthe growing concern over the future of our Nation's Federal forest \nlands. The debate over the administration's proposed Healthy Forests \nInitiative indicates just how important these public lands are and \ncalls for Congress to provide visionary leadership over the future of \nthese lands. My bill, the Forestry and Community Assistance Act, \nstrives to provide that vision through a balance of sound land \nstewardship and immediate active management to address the wildfire \nrisk to communities and the forest health needs of our Federal and \nprivate forest lands.\n  The catastrophic fires that plague our western national forests and \nBureau of Land Management lands are not a new phenomenon. Forest fires \nare part of the natural landscape. However, the intensity of these \nfires and the impacts of them on the urban interface due to past \nmanagement decisions must be appropriately addressed. This a complex \nissue requiring prudent and deliberate thought, not rash reaction that \ncuts the public out from the debate over the future of their Federal \nlands.\n  The administration claims that over 190 million acres are in need of \ntreatment. By its own admission, treating even a small fraction of \nthese acres will take almost a decade. Most people believe it will be \nmuch longer and could cost billions of dollars. Unfortunately, we do \nnot have the time or money to take the broad, unfocused approach the \nadministration proposes in H.R. 1904.\n  We need to take a step back and work together on a bill that will \ntarget funding and projects first to help those communities at greatest \nrisk from wildfires. My bill, the Forest and Community Assistance Act, \nwill expedite fire threat reduction projects on high-risk forest lands \nnearby communities, private property, and municipal watersheds. It \nprovides new authority for Federal land management agencies to enter \ninto cooperative agreements with local and State government, homeowner \nassociations, and local fire districts to plan and execute thinning \nprojects across ownership boundaries.\n  It would do all of this without compromising environmental laws, the \npublic input process, or judicial review. The administration, through \nH.R. 1904, is suggesting that they should be able to get around all of \nthese. They are wrong. Those who we entrust with the management of our \npublic lands should be held to the highest standards of accountability. \nTo end the open dialog with the American public, remove objective \noversight, and, when necessary, limit review of decisions by the \njudiciary is irresponsible. These are the American public's lands, not \nthe lands of a small minority who want to bypass over 30 years of \nenvironmental laws and jurisprudence.\n  The administration continues to argue that these problems have been \ncreated by unnecessary analysis, appeals, and lawsuits. It still \nboggles the imagination that an agency with a $4.84 billion budget, \nsuch as the Forest Service, is brought to its knees by thirteen \nlawsuits as recently noted in a May 2003 General Accounting Office \nreport.\n  Maybe the devil is in the details, but as a former States attorney \nand ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of my \ngreatest concerns with the House bill, H.R. 1904, is its encroachment \ninto the judicial branch. H.R. 1904 not only interferes with how the \ncourts should manage their dockets, but it further tips the scales of \njustice in favor of the government. This is not the appropriate role of \nthis Congress or of the executive branch. As noted, by my good \ncolleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, in a debate last week on \nanother bill, ``the separation of powers is one of the most distinct \nadvantages of this democracy. It is the longest living government on \nthe face of the Earth today because it is a government of the people, \nby the people, and for the people, but it has a Constitution. That \nConstitution we all swear to uphold and defend. Part of that \nConstitution is the separation of powers concept.'' H.R. 1904 violates \nthat concept.\n\n[[Page S9908]]\n\n  The Forestry and Community Assistance Act of 2003 allows for public \ninvolvement, requires compliance with environmental laws, and allows \nfor judicial review, while allowing work to be completed in an \nexpedited manner. Further, my bill works towards addressing the health \nof our Nation's Federal lands by placing an emphasis on addressing the \nlarge-scale insect and disease epidemics that are harbingers of an \nunhealthy forest. The bill would also conserve lands in a healthy \nforest reserve program to provide protection for species at risk. \nLastly, but not of least significance, the Forestry and Community \nAssistance Act focuses on providing economic and technical assistance \nto rural communities that depend on this Nation's natural resources for \na living.\n  I hope that my colleagues will take a very close look at H.R. 1904 \nand recognize that it goes much further than its claims of addressing \nwildfire. I hope my colleagues will recognize that we need to take a \ndifferent approach.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Burns, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Smith, Mr. Warner, Mr. Craig, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1454. A bill to establish a National Drought Council within the \nDepartment of Agriculture, to improve national drought preparedness, \nmitigation, and response efforts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nDrought Preparedness Act of 2003. I want to start by thanking my \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, for joining me as my lead \ncosponsor on this important legislation.\n  The National Drought Council will formulate strategies to alleviate \nthe effects of drought by fostering a greater understanding of what \ntriggers wide spread drought conditions. By educating the public in \nwater conservation and proper land stewardship, we can ensure a better \npreparedness when future drought plagues our country.\n  Drought is a unique emergency situation; it creeps in unlike other \nabrupt weather disasters. Without a national drought policy we \nconstantly live not knowing what the next year will bring. If we find \nourselves facing a drought, towns could be scrambling to drill new \nwater wells, fire could sweep across bone dry forests, and farmers and \nranchers could be forced to watch their way of life blow away with the \ndust. We must be vigilant and prepare ourselves for quick action when \nthe next drought cycle begins. Better planning on our part could limit \nsome of the damage felt by drought. I propose that this bill is the \nexact tool needed for facilitating better planning.\n  The impacts of drought are also very costly. According to NOAA, there \nhave been 12 different drought events since 1980 that resulted in \ndamages and costs exceeding $1 billion each. In 2000, severe drought in \nthe South-Central and Southeastern States caused losses to agriculture \nand related industries of over $4 billion. Western wildfires that year \ntotaled over $2 billion in damages. The Eastern drought in 1999 led to \n$1 billion in losses. These are just a few of the statistics.\n  I am pleased to be following through on what I started in 1997 when I \ncommissioned a taskforce to study the widespread effects of drought. As \na result, the taskforce concluded that the development of a national \ndrought council would be an important factor in proactively combating \ndrought.\n  The bill that I am introducing today is the next step in implementing \na national, cohesive drought policy. The bill recognizes that drought \nis a recurring phenomenon that causes serious economic and \nenvironmental loss and that a national drought policy is needed to \nensure an integrated, coordinated strategy.\n\n  What the future holds is very uncertain but the continuing apathy in \na national drought policy is not. The need for this act is now. We can \nill afford to suffer the devastating after-effects of drought knowing \nthat we could have prepared ourselves better.\n  Before I close I would like to give some information about the bill. \nThe National Drought Preparedness Act of 2003 establishes a National \nDrought Council within the Department of Agriculture to improve \nnational drought preparedness, mitigation, and response efforts. It \nalso develops a cohesive strategy for national drought policy where \nnone previously existed. Addressing these concerns should be of \nparamount importance as we enter into yet another year with predictions \nof continued drought.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1454\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, this year will mark the 7th year of \ndrought for some parts of Montana\n  The current drought has been disastrous, not only to agriculture \nproducers, but also to the surrounding rural communities. When \nproducers are hurting, everyone in that region huts. Main streets, die, \nschools close, and rural towns dry up.\n  The economic costs are immeasurable, but the social costs are also \nsubstantial. Domestic abuse increases; suicide rates rise; People's \nlives are turned upside down. Drought is not something we can ignore.\n  In Montana, agriculture accounts for over half of our economy. It's \nour backbone--both economically and socially. We can not ignore the \ndrought.\n  According to the National Drought Monitor, nearly one-third of the \nUnited States is currently experiencing ``moderate'' to ``exceptional' \ndrought. Nearly one-third of the United States is experiencing the \ndevastating effects of drought.\n  Yet despite the colossal economic and social costs of drought, we do \nnot have a national drought policy.\n  The last prolonged drought of substantial magnitude in the United \nStates was during the 1930s. While not all of us were around during \nthis time, we have all heard about the dust bowl years. The drought \ncoincided with an economic downturn and rural areas were devastated. \nBanks closed, schools closed, main streets disappeared. Millions of \npeople migrated to urban areas.\n  The effects of the current drought are frighteningly similar. We are \nexperiencing an economic downturn, schools are closing, main streets \nare disappearing.\n  Following the dustbowl years, the Federal Government enacted the \nfirst proactive response to drought with the creation of the Soil \nConservation Service--now the Natural Resources Conservation Service--\nto stress soil conservation measures. It's time to expand this \nproactive approach and create a national drought policy.\n  We need a national drought policy and we need it now.\n  I am pleased to introduce the National Drought Preparedness Act with \nmy colleague Senator Domenici of New Mexico.\n  The National Drought Preparedness Act accomplishes four main \nobjectives. This bill: (1) creates a national policy for drought, (2) \nimproves the delivery of Federal drought programs, (3) provides new \ntools for drought preparedness planning, and (4) improves drought \nforecasting and monitoring.\n  We have waited too long for this bill. Drought is occurring now and \nit will occur again. It's time to create a proactive, preparedness \napproach to drought and this bill will do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9912-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 58--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH \nRESPECT TO RAISING AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGING PREVENTION OF STALKING IN \n   THE UNITED STATES AND SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \n                        STALKING AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Biden) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 58\n\n       Whereas an estimated 1,006,970 women and 370,990 men are \n     stalked annually in the United States and, in the majority of \n     such cases, the person is stalked by someone who is not a \n     stranger;\n       Whereas 81 percent of women who are stalked by an intimate \n     partner are also physically assaulted by that partner, and 76 \n     percent of women who are killed by an intimate partner were \n     also stalked by that intimate partner;\n       Whereas 26 percent of stalking victims lose time from work \n     as a result of their victimization and 7 percent never return \n     to work;\n       Whereas stalking victims are forced to take drastic \n     measures to protect themselves, such as relocating, changing \n     their address, changing their identities, changing jobs, and \n     obtaining protection orders;\n       Whereas stalking is a crime that cuts across race, culture, \n     gender, age, sexual orientation, physical and mental ability, \n     and economic status;\n       Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal law and under the \n     laws of all 50 States and the District of Columbia;\n       Whereas there are national organizations, local victim \n     service organizations, prosecutors' offices, and police \n     departments who stand ready to assist stalking victims and \n     who are working diligently to craft competent, thorough, and \n     innovative responses to stalking; and\n       Whereas there is a need to enhance the criminal justice \n     system's response to stalking and stalking victims, including \n     aggressive investigation and prosecution: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) National Stalking Awareness Month provides an \n     opportunity to educate the people of the United States about \n     stalking;\n       (B) all Americans should applaud the efforts of the many \n     victim service providers, police, prosecutors, national and \n     community organizations, and private sector supporters for \n     their efforts in promoting awareness about stalking; and\n       (C) policymakers, criminal justice officials, victim \n     service and human service agencies, nonprofits, and others \n     should recognize the need to increase awareness of stalking \n     and availability of services for stalking victims;\n       (2) Congress urges national and community organizations, \n     businesses in the private sector, and the media to promote, \n     through National Stalking Awareness Month, awareness of the \n     crime of stalking; and\n       (3) Congress supports the goals and ideals of National \n     Stalking Awareness Month.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nsupporting the establishment of a National Stalking Awareness Month. \nEach year, approximately 1.4 million Americans--over 1 million women \nand about 400,000 men--are stalked. This statistic is truly staggering. \nYet given the prevalence of stalking, this crime surprisingly goes \nlargely unrecognized.\n  Stalking is an issue that affects 1 in 12 women and 1 in 45 men \nduring their lifetime. It cuts across all lines of race, age, and \ngender. Women and men from all walks of life across the United States \nhave struggled emotionally and financially to rebuild their lives after \nbeing victimized by stalking.\n  Stalking is a tremendous problem, and it is one that we need to do \nmore to address. A National Stalking Awareness Month would help to \neducate and increase awareness about stalking. This resolution applauds \nthe efforts of policymakers, law enforcement officers, victim service \nagencies, and non-profit organizations that currently promote awareness \nof stalking.\n  This resolution also encourages these groups to examine new and \ninnovative ways to promote prevention and prosecution of stalking \ncrimes. By increasing awareness and devising practical, effectual \nmethods for handling stalkers, we can help the police, we can help \nprosecutors, and most importantly, we can help victims to confront this \nhorrible crime.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. We can--and we \nshould--do more to ensure that stalkers are brought to justice and that \ntheir victims are not forced to live in fear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/24/senate-section/article/S9912-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9912-S9913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1362.
