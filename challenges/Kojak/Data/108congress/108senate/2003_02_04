Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart, which was \nlifted with the inspiring and thoughtful words of our guest Chaplain. I \nthank him for helping us see the greater design, the hope for the \nfuture, and the good news that we have been given by the Lord.\n  As did millions of Americans, I spent Saturday watching the dreams of \nseven brave astronauts streak back to Earth in sadness. The sadness we \nstill feel today, and we will feel for many days, is because those \nseven astronauts carried our dreams with them.\n  That is the wonder and the magic of our space program. Our astronauts \ngo into space in large part for those of us who cannot go. Our hearts \nand our spirits are their cargo. We soar and ride with them into a \nrealm that is beyond the grasp of most men but not beyond the grasp of \nmankind.\n  Even while we engage in the somber work of recovering from this \nterrible accident, in recovering the crew and the Columbia itself, our \nthoughts have already returned to the work of ensuring the safety of \nthe U.S. manned space flight program and of the remaining shuttles. \nThat is one of the responsibilities entrusted to us with the funding \nand oversight of the space agency.\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\n  Shuttle safety is not a new issue to those of us on the \nAppropriations Committee--or the authorizing committee--which funds the \nspace agency and its operations. It is our job--my wonderful friend, \nthe Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, and me--to ensure we know and \nunderstand each crucial element of the budget that safeguards the lives \nof our brave astronauts.\n  Whether during my service as chairman or under the leadership of my \nable colleague from Maryland, the direction of the VA-HUD and \nIndependent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee has been consistent \nthroughout. Space shuttle safety is paramount.\n  I am proud the subcommittee I currently chair has consistently fully \nfunded NASA's request for manned space flight program safety. \nNevertheless, nothing about manned exploration of space is or will ever \nbe free of risk. Manned space flight is, by its very nature, life \nthreatening. Flying a space shuttle is nothing less than hurtling \nacross the heavens where a slightest mistake guarantees instantaneous \ndeath.\n  No matter how successful we are, and no matter how many safe shuttle \nlaunches we have under our belts, we can never forget the dangers \ninherent in space travel. We can and should never be complacent.\n  We have an ironclad social and moral contract with our astronauts: In \nreturn for their willingness to place themselves in jeopardy on behalf \nof all mankind, we in return have an obligation to provide them with \nall the resources required for a safe flight.\n  While it is our goal to eliminate risk, to be quite frank, we cannot. \nWe can only minimize risk. That is the cruel reality of manned space \nflight. Some element of risk haunts every mission. And in the face of \nsuch risks, we still have Americans and international partners \nwilling--yes, anxious--to go. They know the risks. Their families \nunderstand they are in harm's way and still they dare to live a dream \nthat very few of us can fully appreciate. It is precisely that element \nof human nature that inspires us to seek challenges greater than \nourselves.\n  To those who question the value of our space program, I ask them: How \ncan you quantify the dreams of millions of children here and across the \nworld? How can you quantify the spirit of discovery? What value should \nwe place on our quest to understand our place in the universe?\n  Those are the questions we must ask ourselves during this period of \nrecovery. The weeks and months ahead will be filled with questions. So \nfar, we have too few answers.\n  Our questions did not begin with Saturday's terrible loss of \nColumbia. The subcommittee has had continuing concerns about whether \nthe budget requests from NASA accurately reflect the full safety needs \nof the space agency and the shuttle program. It is reflected in our \nreports. It is all in the public record. I know NASA has always placed \nthe safety of our astronauts as its highest priority, we have an \nobligation to ensure that the analysis of safety, no matter what the \ncost, is fully disclosed, understood, and addressed. We have labored to \ndo so in the past and will continue to do so in the future.\n\n  We recognize that Congress, NASA, and the administration have to live \nwithin a budget. At the same time, we cannot allow a budget to force \nour hand on safety decisions. We have not done so, nor will we. I do \nnot believe NASA has done so, nor this, nor the previous \nadministration. Nevertheless, our concerns on VA-HUD appropriations \nwere heightened by the March 2002 NASA Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel \nReport which stated that the current budget projections for the space \nshuttle were insufficient to accommodate significant safety upgrades, \ninfrastructure needs, and the maintenance of critical workforce skills \nover the long term.\n  Our most recent report to the appropriations bill endorsed these \nconcerns as well as the need for additional funding for shuttle safety \nupgrades. Our concerns were sufficient to request that NASA conduct an \nassessment of future safety needs in light of the shuttle's longer than \nexpected operational life and use. We need to know more and we need to \nknow more now.\n  NASA has already responded with a request for additional shuttle \nupgrades and safety funding over the next few years. This was the right \nresponse, but we need to know how much more we need to do to ensure \nthat every funding decision continues to make the lives of our \nastronauts the paramount priority at NASA.\n  Clearly, we had concerns, and those concerns remain. We must work \ntogether to gain greater confidence in NASA's budget.\n  I applaud and have the highest admiration for NASA Administrator Sean \nO'Keefe, who is already working hard on this and many more issues at \nNASA. He took over a troubled agency drowning in cost overruns and out-\nof-control spending on the International Space Station program. He \nstopped the bleeding of huge cost overruns and has righted NASA's ship \nthrough responsible program management. I look forward, as do, I am \nsure, the rest of the Members of this body, to continuing to work with \nAdministrator O'Keefe in our efforts to ensure the safety of our \nshuttle program and the well-being of our astronauts. This will, as \nalways, remain our top priority.\n  Of course, we must find out what happened to the Columbia, fix the \nproblem, and move our space program forward, as the deputy \nadministrator for space so eloquently stated on Saturday. But this is \nnot a simple issue. We have three international astronauts on the \nInternational Space Station, two Americans and one Russian. We need to \nbe able to bring them home in complete safety.\n  The administration is moving forward with two commissions to \nunderstand what happened, and to make sure it does not happen again. In \naddition, I believe it is appropriate to hold a hearing in the \nappropriations subcommittee on shuttle funding upgrades and safety \nneeds. This is too important an issue not to receive the full attention \nof the Senate. I assure my colleagues that we will work to provide \nwhatever funding is necessary to meet the immediate needs of the space \nagency through the remaining months of the fiscal year.\n  We are currently waiting to hear back from NASA at this moment, and \nclearly we will provide whatever additional funds are necessary for \nNASA in the 2003 supplemental, as appropriate, or even if we receive a \nrequest in time in the conference report on the 2003 measure that is \npending. I will convene a hearing on safety needs as soon as \npracticable, as soon as NASA has information for us, understanding full \nwell that the immediate needs focus on recovery of the Columbia, the \ncrew, and the twin investigations now underway.\n\n  At a time of such tragedy, we all function as part of a team with a \nsingle mission, to find out what went wrong, and then to take steps to \nmake sure it never happens again. We must and we will leave no stone \nunturned. There are astronauts who have not yet flown but who will \nperhaps this year and in 10 years. They dream of carrying our hopes \nbeyond this planet we call home. We must always keep faith with them \nand their families. We must honor the contract that binds us in this \ngreat endeavor.\n  That dream has not died with Columbia and her proud crew. Her dream \nlives on in the hearts of all of us who look to the heavens on a quiet \nnight in awe and wonder, and we see the Columbia still. We mourn for \nthe astronauts and we pray for their families. We shall always remember \nthem, along with the Challenger and the Apollo crews. The courage of \nall of the astronauts shall forever inspire our dreams and brighten our \nhopes for the future.\n  Manned space exploration is a great challenge, a great opportunity. \nYes, there are dangers with it, but fulfilling the hopes and the dreams \nof those who have gone before is our great opportunity and our \nobligation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California be recognized for up to 15 minutes after I complete my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Missouri leaves the \nChamber, I say to him that the work he and Senator Mikulski have done \non the appropriations subcommittee that deals with the funding for the \nspace program\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\nis exemplary. We have gone through some very tough times. There are \nmany Senators who have offered amendments to do away with the space \nstation and defund the space program. I have always been proud of the \nbipartisan relationship that Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski have had \nin fighting for the space program. It is a program we have to protect. \nI know there have been editorials saying do away with it; it is not \nworthwhile, but I really think it is important for so many reasons, not \nthe least of which is to explore space.\n  The second is, I went running this morning. It was raining. It was \nwindy and cold. I had on a very brief wrap, thin as this piece of \npaper, but I was warm. Why? Because it was Goretex. It was invented to \ntake people into space.\n  We have accomplished so much in space that is scientific I think it \nwould be a terrible shame to stop the space programs, and it would not \nbe a legacy of which this country would be proud.\n  I publicly acknowledge and congratulate the Senator from Missouri and \nthe Senator from Maryland for their exemplary work on the subcommittee.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I may, I wish to extend sincere thanks to \nthe Senator from Nevada for his remarks. Senator Mikulski is and has \nbeen one of the foremost champions of NASA and its mission. She is in \nHouston today. I am sure we will hear from her. It is her ongoing and \nstrong commitment to space shuttle safety that inspires and leads all \nof us, and I thank the distinguished assistant minority leader for his \nwords.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in remembering the \nseven astronauts who perished on the Columbia Space Shuttle. Nevadans \nand all Americans, along with the people of India, Israel, and all over \nthe world, mourn their loss, marvel at their courage, and take pride in \ntheir accomplishments. Our country's space program has made remarkable \nsuccess, but many people often overlook the ingenuity, intelligence, \nand inspiration that made this success possible. They take for granted \nthe enormous difficulty involved in the extraordinary achievement, \nasking: If we can put a man on the moon, why can't we solve other \nproblems to overcome other challenges?\n  The moon landing was a great technological and engineering \nachievement. That event and subsequent space travel testify to American \ndetermination, know-how, and our can-do spirit. But sadly, as the \nColumbia shuttle tragedy reminds us, space travel remains difficult and \nextremely dangerous. The brave men and women who embark on journeys \ninto the skies are pioneers.\n  One of the original explorers of outer space is our former colleague \nin the Senate, John Glenn. He is a true patriot who served our great \nNation so well in so many capacities. He was a fighter pilot in World \nWar II, a fighter pilot in Korea, who distinguished himself in many \ndifferent ways in the skies defending our country's interests. He was \nlater, of course, a test pilot who set a transcontinental speed record, \nand in 1962 he piloted Friendship 7 spacecraft in the first manned \norbital mission of the United States. He represented Ohio in the U.S. \nSenate for 25 years, and nearing the end of his final term, he \nvolunteered to return to space at age 77 as part of the shuttle crew \nthat deployed the Spartan solar-observing spacecraft. His encore flight \nallowed us to learn about the aging process.\n\n  John Glenn was part of that select group depicted by writer Tom Wolfe \nin his fascinating book about the early efforts to explore space. John \nGlenn indeed proved he has the right stuff.\n  Another of our Senate colleagues, Bill Nelson, is a veteran of space \ntravel. He and I served together in the House of Representatives when \nhe was chosen to be a crew member on the Columbia space shuttle. In \n1986, he participated in a 6-day flight that traveled over 2 million \nmiles and orbited the earth 96 times. He returned safely just 10 days \nbefore the Challenger space shuttle crew was killed.\n  Senator Nelson has applied his own experience in space to speak \npassionately about the value of such missions.\n  In the wake of the Columbia shuttle tragedy, it is important that we \nunderstand the significance of the shuttle voyages and America's entire \nspace program.\n  Sending men and women into space further our understanding of the \nmysteries of the universe, and reveals answers to some eternal and \nprofound questions about the cosmos and the heavens above. In addition, \nspace exploration improves our everyday lives on Earth in ways both big \nand small because the insight we gain has important applications for \nour health, environment, safety, comfort and wellbeing.\n  The Columbia shuttle mission was devoted strictly to onboard science, \nwith no spacewalks or space station visits involved. More than 80 \nexperiments were conducted during the 16-day flight, including a study \nof how zero-gravity affected low-level combustion that might have \nhelped reduce automobile pollution, observations of the sun that could \nteach us more about global climate change, research into water \nconservation and reuse, and medical research intended to fight cancer.\n  So space travel is important to Americans and has benefits for all of \nus on Earth. I will continue to be a strong supporter of our space \nprogram.\n  Certainly, we must investigate what caused the Columbia's demise--and \nwe must ask difficult questions and get all the answers in order to \nimprove the safety of future astronaut heroes--but now is a time to \nremember the lives of wonderful crew and to grieve.\n  I encourage everyone to read the newspaper articles about this \ndiverse team of courageous, dedicated and talented individuals. You \nwill be impressed with, and inspired by, the range and degree of their \naccomplishments.\n  Nevadans mourn their deaths and extend our sympathy to all of their \nfamilies and loved ones. My colleagues will speak about each of the \ncrew members we lost, and I will in the future discuss more of them, \nbut in my brief remarks today, I especially offer my condolences on the \nloss of Columbia's pilot, William McCool, a Navy commander who was 41 \nyears old. His mother Audrey is a dean at the University of Nevada Las \nVegas and his father Barry both teaches part-time at UNLV and is a \ngraduate student there.\n  ``Willie'', as their son was known to family and friends, was an \noutstanding student who maintained a 4.0 grade point average and \ngraduated 2nd in a class of over one thousand at the demanding U.S. \nNaval Academy. He also excelled in sports, especially running, and was \nelected captain of the Navy cross-country team. He was well liked by \nall. He had a great smile, a ``stunning personality,'' is how his \nclassmates described CDR McCool. Later, after the academy, he received \nadvanced degrees in computer science and engineering and became an \nelite pilot. He had more than 400 carrier landings. Perhaps the most \ndifficult test for any pilot is landing on those carriers as they bob \nup and down in the ocean. His parents were proud of him. He was \ninspired by his parents.\n\n  Willie's father, Barry, was a Navy and Marine pilot, a veteran of \nVietnam. They built model airplanes together when CDR McCool was a boy. \nThese childhood experiences influenced Willie to pursue aviation and \nserve his country, as he did so well. His example was set his by \nfather. Barry McCool will now serve on the team investigating the \ndisaster that claimed his son's life and the other six Columbia \nastronauts.\n  Willie had more than 2,800 hours of flight experience. He reacted to \nhis journey into space with awe and amazement. He said: It's beyond \nimagination until you actually get it and see it and experience it and \nfeel it . . . I have had the opportunity to be on the flight deck \nprobably more than most of my crew mates, to look outside and really \nsoak up the sunrises, the sunsets, the moonrises and the moonsets, the \nviews of the Himalayas.\n  For someone who appreciated nature and spending time outdoors hiking \nand camping, it must have been such a joy to witness the Earth from the \nheavens where Willie now resides. My thoughts and prayers are with CDR \nMcCool's parents, with his wife, his three sons, and all of his loved \nones.\n  Let me also note that David Brown, a Navy captain, aviator, and \nflight surgeon, who was also lost aboard the flight Columbia, was an \ninstructor at Fallon Naval Air Station in Nevada, the premier tactical \nair warfare training facility.\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\n  Even after the loss of their children in the Columbia shuttle \ntragedy, the mothers of both these crewmembers want the space program \nto continue. Dorothy Brown said in an interview: We're a nation of \nexplorers. That's why this great Nation has come to what it is, and the \nspace program will go on, too, for that reason. Audrey McCool, CDR \nMcCool's mother said: We're very distressed, but we want the space \nmissions to go on.\n  What strong women these grieving mothers are. We can surely be \ninspired by them, as well as their sons and the entire Columbia crew.\n  I am reminded of a poem that came about as a result of a revolution \nin Ireland. The poem that came from that I have on my desk. I read to \nthe Senate today ``The Mother.''\n\n     I do not grudge them: Lord, I do not grudge\n     My two strong sons that I have seen go out\n     To break their strength and die, they and a few,\n     In bloody protest for a glorious thing.\n     They shall be spoken of among their people,\n     The generations shall remember them,\n     And call them blessed;\n     The little names that were familiar once\n     Round my dead hearth.\n     Lord, thou art hard on mothers:\n     We suffer in their coming and their going:\n     And tho' I grudge them not, I weary, weary\n     Of the long sorrow--And yet I have my joy:\n     My sons were faithful, and they fought.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent immediately following my remarks, \nSenator Enzi be recognized for 8 minutes, and Senator Leahy for 10 \nminutes after Senator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the people of my \nState, California, who have very strong ties to the space program and \nthe shuttle program. Today I pay tribute to the seven astronauts who \nlost their lives in the Columbia disaster. Our Nation and the world \ndeeply mourn their loss. These seven brave explorers--Rick Husband, \nWilliam McCool, Michael Anderson, Kalpana Chawla, David Brown, Laurel \nClark, and Ilan Ramon--gave their lives to extend the frontiers of \nscience. With their mission accomplished, the shuttle and its crew were \nreturning to Earth in triumph. So near to landing, yet so far. As we \nall know, the flight ended in tragedy.\n  We know that we gained valuable new knowledge and understanding of \nspace from this mission, from Columbia. But we have lost something that \nis truly priceless, the lives of seven outstanding men and women who \nhad worlds left to conquer. As we look at their faces, our best and our \nbrightest, we grieve for their families.\n  I wish to say a few words about three of the astronauts who had \nspecial connections with my home State of California.\n  William McCool, pilot of the Columbia, was born in San Diego, where \nhe spent much of his first 15 years. His NASA assignment capped a \ndistinguished Navy career as a test pilot, avionics researcher, and \nadministrative and operations officer.\n  Dr. Kalpana Chawla lived and worked in California from 1988 to 1994. \nAfter 4 years at the Ames Research Center near Sunnyvale, she joined \nOverset Methods, Inc., of Los Altos, as vice president and research \nscientist. There she formed and headed a research team that made \nimportant advances in computational field dynamics, particularly in \nstreamlining the flow of air over vehicles during launch.\n  Like Willie McCool, Kalpana Chawla had character traits that are \noften associated with California such as a great sense of adventure and \na desire to stretch the boundaries in her case of traditional women's \nwork--and she did.\n  Rick Husband, Columbia's commander, served as an instructor pilot and \nacademic instructor at George Air Force Base in California and attended \ntest pilot school at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Working \nthrough a college extension program at Edwards, he then earned a \nmaster's degree in mechanical engineering from California State \nUniversity at Fresno in 1990. In November 2002, citing his role as \nastronaut and mission commander, the Fresno State Alumni Association \nhonored Colonel Husband at its Top Dog Alumni Awards ceremony. A proud \nFresno State alumnus, he wore his red Bulldog sweatshirt in space \naboard Columbia.\n  The people of my State are proud of our connection to these three \nastronauts. We honor their memory, along with that of their crewmates, \nMichael Anderson, David Brown, Laurel Clark, and Ilan Ramon. We know, \nof course, since we did have an Israeli on board, this has become an \ninternational tragedy. We send our condolences to the family of \nAstronaut Ramon and to the Government of Israel.\n  I stated how proud my people at home are of our connection, not only \nto these astronauts but to the shuttle program. California was the \nbirthplace of the shuttle. All were built in California, in Palmdale. \nThe Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena was instrumental in development of \nthe shuttle, and most years, shuttle missions ended with landings at \nEdwards Air Force Base.\n  So this has hit home to us. We shall forever honor and remember these \nseven heroes, as we build on their accomplishments and carry on their \nimportant work. May God bless their memories and comfort their families \nand colleagues and inspire future explorers with the courage to follow \nin their footsteps.\n  As we honor these courageous men and women, we must also begin the \ntask of finding the answers--answers to the hard questions why and how \ndo we prevent these happenings--questions about the cause of this \ntragedy and also about the future of space exploration. As a member of \nthe Senate Commerce Committee, which has oversight over NASA, I will be \nasking many questions in the weeks ahead. Could the Columbia disaster \nhave been prevented? We know that space travel cannot be completely \nfoolproof, but are there steps that could have been taken to prevent \nthis weekend's tragedy? Was the shuttle program compromised by budget \ncuts and cost-cutting?\n\n  I support a strong space program, but you can't do it on the cheap. \nWere safety warnings ignored or, worse yet, suppressed? Were members of \nNASA's safety advisory board removed after raising these questions?\n  Yesterday, the New York Times reported that five members of NASA's \nAerospace Safety Advisory Panel--that is more than half the panel--were \ndismissed shortly after warning about safety problems. And a sixth \nmember of the panel was so disgusted with the dismissals that he quit. \nThere are allegations that these panelists were removed as a result of \ntheir critical statements about safety problems. We need to get to the \nbottom of this matter. I have written to Senator McCain and Senator \nHollings, the chair and ranking member of the Commerce Committee on \nwhich I serve. I have asked them to invite the members of the safety \nadvisory panel, many of whom were fired, one of whom quit, to give \ntheir testimony.\n  I also asked that Senator John Glenn be invited. He is a major \nsupporter of the space program and he really has important things to \nsay. I spoke with him. I don't even want to quote what he said because \nI think he knows so much and should say it in his own way, as to what \nwe need to do here. As a former Senator and as an astronaut, he brings \nan incredible expertise to the table. I know he has the respect of all \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Let me say there is one thing that is not an issue in my mind and \nthat is the future of the manned space program. I strongly support \nthat. But now is the time to use this moment to examine the future of \nspace exploration. For example, what is the future role of the space \nshuttle? Are the existing shuttles sufficient to carry out the mission? \nAre they in good enough condition--excellent condition, perfect \ncondition--to carry those men and women in the future? What is the role \nof the International Space Station? Is too great a share of our limited \nresources being spent on the space station? Is too much money on the \nspace station being spent on maintenance rather than scientific \nexperiments?\n  I have read that the astronauts are saying they are scientists and \nthey are spending 80 percent of their time on the platform, on the \nspace station, keeping house, doing maintenance on the space station \nrather than the experiments they really want to do.\n  What about a possible manned mission to Mars, which seems to have \ndisappeared from anyone's agenda? Most\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nfundamentally, how do we recommit ourselves to a space program that \ncaptures the imagination of America, and what would this take in terms \nof funding its goals?\n  So we need to ask all these questions and we need to get the answers. \nWe have to work together, across party lines, to come up with this \nvision. Whatever we come up with, it needs to be funded, funded in a \nway so safety will never be at issue; we will know that we have done \nevery single thing we could possibly do.\n  The family of Columbia's crew has said, ``the bold exploration of \nspace must go on.'' I fully agree with them. But it sits on our \nshoulders, those of us here who are called upon to fund this program, \nto make sure we are funding it in the right way; that we are not \nwasting dollars but that the dollars are going to ensure that the \nprogram's goals are met; that there are clear goals; and that safety \ncomes first.\n  Over the past two decades, shuttle crews have carried out scores of \nexperiments in space that have helped to advance science on Earth. For \nexample, they have studied the effects of gravity on humans, animals, \nand plants. They have tracked the movement of fault lines on the \nEarth's crust, something very important to many of our States, \nparticularly mine. They have gauged the impact of typhoons and other \nstorms. They have measured changes of forest cover in remote areas of \nAlaska and Canada. And they have helped archaeologists locate the long \nlost city of Umar, a 4,000-year-old settlement on the Arabian \npeninsula.\n  Many shuttle missions have included medical researchers who used the \nenvironment of space to further their understanding of cell growth, \nhuman metabolism, and a variety of diseases.\n  We have much to be proud of in these days as we mourn.\n  I will join Chairman McCain and the other members of the Commerce \nCommittee in seeking to determine the cause of the Columbia disaster \nand outlining the steps we must take to avoid its recurrence. At the \nsame time, I will work to define the goals and the mission of the space \nprogram and make sure the funding is there for accomplishing the \nmission in the safest possible way.\n  In closing, I can't help but remark that their faces--those beautiful \nfaces--will stay with me for a long time, and that they represent the \nhope and the promise of our future.\n  Mr. President, as you sit with me on the Foreign Relations Committee, \nI know all of our Members on both sides are very concerned that we \nprotect the lives of not only our young people but young people all \nover the world, and that we will find a way to do that which makes \nsense for our stronger Nation.\n  We are reminded when we read what the astronauts say every time a \ndifferent astronaut goes up: what a fragile planet we live on. It \nalways renews my commitment, as I am sure it does your commitment, Mr. \nPresident, that we must protect this planet--the air, the water, the \nforests, and the wetlands. They are a gift from God.\n  In memory of those who lost their lives this weekend, we will \ncontinue to explore and we will continue to reach for the stars. We \nshould do no less.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for the challenges which she placed before us as well as the \nmemories to which she spoke.\n  Today, here in the Senate and the House, in Houston, TX, all across \nthe country, and in places throughout the world, people of all faiths \nand from all walks of life will take a moment to remember the tragic \nloss of the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia this past weekend. As we \ndo, we will put aside our differences and come together as a family to \nremember those who were lost and the great cause for which they gave \ntheir lives.\n  For me, the story of this past weekend's events begins when I was \ngrowing up--a Boy Scout who was fascinated by rockets and rocketry. \nThat interest continued to show itself as I became a young man who was \nfascinated by the two latest creations of the day--television and the \nstart of our space program. As science worked to develop the tools we \nwould need to explore outer space, television gave us all a front row \nseat so we would see what was happening.\n  Back then, the early successes in rocketry--mostly by Russia--fired \nour imaginations and steeled our will to win the race to reach the \nheavens. It was only natural for me and the people of Wyoming to feel \nso moved. After all, we were the products of the pioneer spirit. Our \nancestors had left the comforts of the East behind and headed West \nlooking for a new life and to explore what was then the new frontier. \nThey were pioneers.\n  As television became a more common addition to our homes, it brought \nthe next new frontier--space--into our very living rooms. Each day we \ncould see the latest events of the day that were happening around the \nworld beamed right into our living rooms. We watched in fascination as \nthings that were happening miles and miles away were seen right in the \ncomfort of our own homes. For me, the stars of the sky came in second \nplace in importance only to the stars of the space program. Me and all \nof my friends, especially those who had been in the Scouts, wanted to \nbe just like them.\n  I still remember the days when we would go to a local field and work \non our own experiments in rocketry. Then, as we grew older, when a new \nflight was announced by NASA, we would grab the first chance we had to \nwatch it as the miracle of television brought the wonders of space \nflight to our homes and our schools.\n  Competition was with the Russians. But now there is cooperation with \nthe Russians in space and with the space station.\n  Our efforts to explore space and the continuing impact of seeing it \nall live on television made for a powerful pair as we heard the words \nof John F. Kennedy as he challenged the Nation to land a man on the \nmoon. His vision led us onward and upward. And it wasn't all that long \nafterwards that my wife and I--newlyweds--felt a personal stake in what \nwe saw on the television before us. We sat spellbound as we watched \nNeil Armstrong take his one small step on the Moon that meant so much \nfor all mankind.\n  Neil Armstrong was part of a long line of astronauts who braved the \nodds to do the impossible as, together as a nation, we reached for \ngreatness. Over the years, there had been disappointments, failures and \ntragedies, but with each success we felt like we had a grip on the \nprocess and that the odds would be forever in our favor.\n  Somewhere along the way in the years that passed, we forgot that \nspace is a cold, unfriendly place and that space flight brings with it \ngreat risks and dangers as well as great rewards. We forgot the lesson \nlearned from the early days of the space program--that when we dream \ngreat dreams and achieve great successes, we are also courting great \ndanger.\n  We think of the shuttle as an airplane. And we know how safe \nairplanes are. That danger was brought painfully home when we launched \nthe Space Shuttle Challenger.\n  All at once and without warning, the reliable space machine we had \ncome to trust and take for granted blew up and disintegrated before our \neyes.\n  I remember that day so well because it was the day we were to send \nour first educator into space, Christa McAuliffe. In schools all over \nthe country, children and their teachers watched excitedly as a school \nteacher prepared to make her voyage into space. When it ended in \ntragedy, a lot of fathers and mothers sat down that night with their \nchildren to talk about what they had seen at school that day. They got \na lot of tough questions from little children with sad eyes who \nwondered why these things have to happen.\n  Mothers and fathers have no answers for those questions and they can \nonly say that sometimes bad things happen to good people. They can only \nhug and hold and remind their little ones that there is a God and \nsomehow He works all things for His good. Someday we may know what \nthat good is. But for now, all we can do is trust and hope and pray.\n\n  Now we have felt that pain for a second time. The first brought us an \nawareness of the risks we take in exploring the unknown. It reminded us \nthat despite the best of planning and\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\npreparation sometimes things happen that we could never have possibly \nprepared for. Now we watch these events unfold for a second time with a \ndifferent sense--and from a different perspective. We remember the \nrisks of space flight. But, as we mourn those who were lost, we renew \nour feeling of determination and our resolve to succeed no matter the \nodds or the obstacles to be overcome.\n  The crews of the Challenger and the Columbia--those modern day \npioneers--will be forever linked in our minds, tied together by the \nsame terrible helplessness we felt as we watched both tragedies unfold. \nEach time we searched for answers that we knew would never come. In the \nend, each time we found ourselves more determined than ever before to \nmove ahead, and to continue the exploration of space that must never \nend. And, in the end, that is the important lesson we will take with \nus. We may experience defeat, but we will never be defeated. In this \nand all we pursue in life, we will ultimately succeed as long as we \nhold true to our dreams and follow our star.\n  And the success is far-reaching. I have a heart repair that would not \nhave been possible without the space program. Science moves on, \nstimulated by the unknown and represented by space.\n  When the crew of the Challenger died, President Reagan comforted the \nNation with the words that the crew that had slipped the surly bonds of \nEarth had reached out and touched the face of God. This past weekend, \nPresident Bush assured us that the ``God who names the stars also knows \nthe names of the seven souls we mourn today.''\n  Then and now, both crews left us with our eyes gazing toward the \nskies and the heavens above, hopeful and prayerful that if they had to \nleave us, they had done so in pursuit of a better place as they \nreturned, not to Earth, but to their home in God's holy heaven.\n  This night, and the next, and for many to come, when we go out on our \nback porch or sit in the backyard and look up at the stars, we will \nremember the Challenger and the Columbia and their valiant crews. The \nlights of the sky will remind us of their indomitable spirit and our \npledge that as long as there are stars in the skies, we will never stop \nreaching out to them to explore, to dare and to dream in space and on \nEarth. That is our life, our legacy and our shared vision as Americans. \nIt is what makes us unique, and it is why our nation will always be \nknown as the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I listen to my friend from Wyoming and \nmy friend from California and others who are speaking in this Chamber \ntoday, I am reminded of what I heard throughout the State of Vermont \nthis past weekend while I was home--whether it was people who stopped \nme in a grocery store and just wanted to reach out and touch somebody--\nperhaps we would embrace for a moment--or whether it was coming out of \nmass on Sunday at the church, where the same thing occurred--the people \nhave felt such sorrow and shock. There is no other way you could \nexpress yourself.\n  Those of us who have grown up seeing the space program have seen so \nmany of the triumphs. I still remember our own colleague, Senator John \nGlenn, a man I was elected with in the same year, in his amazing orbit \nof the Earth. Then later, when he was well into his 70s, he had another \ntrip as an astronaut. We saw that too. We saw man's first steps on the \nmoon, of which every one of us remembers exactly where we were when \nthat occurred. We also remember exactly where we were when the \nChallenger was destroyed. And I suspect we will always remember exactly \nwhere we were when we got the news about the Columbia space shuttle.\n  Today we are so connected automatically, with live television, radio, \nand friends and neighbors calling us when something such as this \nhappens, a tragedy which unites not only the whole country but the \nwhole world. Everybody seems to know it almost immediately.\n  So, as so many other Senators, I rise to pay tribute to the seven \nastronauts who lost their lives in the Columbia tragedy last Saturday \nmorning. Here was this magnificent space vessel, with these seven \nwonderful, exemplary human beings, streaking across the sky dozens of \nmiles above the Earth at eight times the speed of sound; and then, \nsuddenly, Columbia disintegrated.\n  A clergyman in Florida aptly described the fiery contrails we watched \nrepeatedly on Saturday as: ``a glistening tear across the face of the \nheavens.'' There is nothing I could write that would say it any better.\n  We were and are sad not only because of the loss of these heroes and \nthe interruption of space exploration, but because this tragedy reminds \nus of other astronauts who have paid the ultimate price.\n  As with every national tragedy, we rise from the shock and the \nsadness through commemoration and perseverance. We heard the President \nof the United States, who spoke shortly after the tragedy, and again \neloquently today, as did others in Texas. The President tells us--and \nwe know in our hearts--we cannot forget these heroes: Rick Husband, \nWilliam McCool, Michael Anderson, David Brown, Kalpana Chawla, Laurel \nBlair Salton Clark, and Ilan Ramon. Each represented a special kind of \nintelligence, dedication and energy we should all aspire to, and \ncertainly all young people in this country should aspire to.\n  Over and over we have read their biographies, their stories. We have \nheard their neighbors, their friends, their teachers, their classmates, \nand their fellow astronauts tell of the barriers they had to overcome \nin their lives and the almost superhuman rise above senseless bias and \ndiscrimination. They will be missed, but they will continue to stand as \nmodels. I hope we will continue to read of their stories because they \nare role models for us here in the United States, but also for those in \nIsrael, as with COL Ramon, and for those in India, and really for \neveryone across the globe.\n\n  Someone said: This is such a public tragedy. But that is the way the \nspace program has been. We have shown publicly our triumphs, and we \nhave shown publicly our disasters. We have shown the fears and the \noverwhelming thrills over the years.\n  I close with this, Mr. President: To remind everybody we are at the \nbicentennial of the congressional authorization for the Lewis and Clark \nexploration of the West, when President Thomas Jefferson said: Go forth \nto explore the West and our boundaries. And the Congress said to go \nforth.\n  Lewis and Clark knew no frontiers. They did not know what they would \nfind. And these astronauts knew no frontiers. We Americans have never \nknown frontiers.\n  So we will find the cause of Columbia's loss. We will fix it. The \nshuttle program will continue. The manned space program will move \nforward. We will return to space. It is our destiny, I believe. And \nthere, in the spirit of the seven, we will again invest our knowledge \nand resources to learn about our origins, our daily lives, and, maybe, \ncatch a glimpse of the future.\n  I see my friend from Oregon in the Chamber. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I express admiration for Senator Leahy's \nwords and for the contribution that many of our colleagues will make in \nthis Chamber to try to give expression to their own feelings and, more \nimportantly, to the feelings of those who reside in our respective \nStates.\n  I am mindful that in each one's own way and on one's own terms, every \nAmerican--every Oregonian, suffers from the Columbia tragedy. All I can \ndo is reflect on what I feel, but I think that in saying what I will \ntoday, it is similar to what many also feel.\n  As an American citizen, as someone who is 50 years old, I have always \ntaken particular pride that we are descended from Pilgrims and \npioneers. We have a history, a heritage, a legacy that stretches from \nColumbus to Columbia. We are the children of an American spirit that \nbelieves in discovery, in development, in pioneering new ways, and \nexploring new frontiers.\n  I remember, as a young boy, the experience of hearing about the \nRussian launch of Sputnik, and seeing the satellite in the sky as it \nmade its way over the American continent.\n  With particular wonder, I remember, as an elementary school boy, how\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\nWeekly Reader--which was something we would always spend time learning \nfrom--began to fill with stories of our own space program.\n  I remember, like many of my colleagues, taking inspiration from the \nleadership of John F. Kennedy challenging us in pursuit of the new \nfrontier and in a man landing on the moon and his safe return.\n  I remember, with great pride, the launch of Alan Shepherd as part of \nthe Mercury program, just to see if man could live in outer space.\n  I remember, as an elementary school boy, attending the parade that \nwas held in Washington, DC for John Glenn. Little did I realize that \none day I would have the privilege of serving with John Glenn in the \nU.S. Senate. I remember his parade down Pennsylvania Avenue and how we, \nas a new generation of Americans, celebrated the renewing of the \nAmerican spirit of exploration.\n  I remember following with great interest the Apollo program and being \ninspired by the remarkable realization that two Americans were on the \nMoon. Neil Armstrong is a hero, the first to make that small step for \nman but that giant leap for mankind. I remember the pride I felt when \nthe Apollo program was merged with the Soyuz program and began to break \ndown the cold war barriers with Russia. Then, of course, the space \nshuttle came and we watched with awe as this new configuration of the \nspace program inspired us all in the new possibilities of learning and \ndiscovery.\n  I don't think any of us will forget that day that Challenger went \ndown and the heartache we felt as it exploded upon its launch. Now we \nadd the memory of watching Columbia disintegrate as it reemerged into \nthe Earth's atmosphere.\n  Where do we go from here? As we stand on the verge of a foreign \nconflict and struggle with our economy, it is entirely appropriate for \nCongress to look at the space program and, with our President, set new \ngoals. I hope they will include a space station, even a Moon station, \nand eventually a landing on the planet of Mars. That reflects the \nhighest standards of American leadership. This demonstrates America's \ncourage and it will firmly fix, in the firmament of heaven, America's \nplace among the leadership of nations.\n  My final thoughts are to the families. As we witnessed the ceremony \ntoday, we all grieve for the parents and the children of these \nastronauts who have lost their parent or their child. I am reminded of \nan admonition that the only way to take sorrow out of death is to take \nlove out of life. Death often looms as the ultimate calamity, but it \nneed not be if we keep it in perspective of eternity.\n  Some time ago, I was attracted to a monument I saw in England. Its \nwords seem appropriate at this occasion. They were about time. As I \nlooked at these families who are suffering and saw how tragic death \nloomed for them, I am sure they wondered how they could endure time \nwithout their loved one. This monument said: Time is too slow for those \nwho wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, \ntoo short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is \neternity.\n  I add my voice to those of my colleagues here today to say God bless \nthe memory of Rick Husband, William McCool, Michael Anderson, Kalpana \nChawla, David Brown, Laurel Clark, and Ilan Ramon of Israel. To them I \nsay: Godspeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Hawaii for \nallowing me to proceed ahead of him. I certainly appreciate his \nkindness.\n  I rise today to salute the seven astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle \nColumbia who lost their lives as they endeavored to conquer the vast \nunknown of space.\n  I would like to take a moment to praise the work of Commander Rick \nHusband, Pilot William McCool, Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla, \nMission Specialist David Brown, Mission Specialist Michael Anderson, \nMission Specialist Laurel Clark, and Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon.\n  These great heroes will always be remembered for their willingness to \ncarry the hopes and aspirations of a country with them into space, even \nthough they made the ultimate sacrifice for their efforts.\n  I know the months and years ahead will be filled with debate over \nmany issues surrounding this tragedy.\n  Certainly, we will hear questions asked about the ongoing funding of \nNASA and the safety concerns surrounding such adventurous exploration.\n  The Nation will need answers to these questions.\n  Hearings should be held. Investigations should be conducted. But in \nthe final analysis, let us not forget how valuable the space program is \nto our country and to the American spirit.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues, administration officials, and NASA \nto proceed with their investigations in a prudent manner and return our \nastronauts to space as soon as possible.\n  I would like to see a renewed focus for NASA, a focus that would \nrival President Kennedy's challenge to be the first Nation to send a \nman to the moon.\n  This can only be done by pressing forward with bold new space \ninitiatives and not by prolonged critiquing and endless investigations.\n  Just the mention of the word ``space'' conveys so many special \nmeanings to each of us.\n  Thoughts of heroes such as Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong come \nimmediately to mind. In many ways, our Nation is defined by the \nadventurous space program which has been a part of our national \nheritage for over 40 years.\n  Terms such as courage, bravery, and pioneer are not afforded to those \nwho take no risk and who sit on the sidelines and watch. No, those \nterms are reserved for people and nations willing to take risks in \norder to learn and advance the knowledge of all mankind. As President \nReagan said, in the face of the loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger, \n``The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the \nbrave.'' The seven astronauts who piloted the Space Shuttle Columbia \nheard that call and will forever be remembered for their bravery.\n  No American relishes the loss of life and the sacrifice of those \ncourageous astronauts. But every American is thankful for the \nwillingness of these astronauts to press forward--even when the risks \nare so great--in order to provide more knowledge and nurture a new \ngeneration of scientists who are inspired to look at the universe \ndifferently every time astronauts venture into the darkness of space.\n  The space program is so vitally important to our Nation's science \neducation. Every year, bright, energetic, wide-eyed students enter the \nNation's school systems and are motivated by the new scientific \nfindings in our universe. They grow to love science, a love that will \nstay with them throughout their lives and continue to propel our \nNation's scientific discoveries into the future.\n  We cannot let that love die. It is our duty to push the envelope, to \nexplore the outer reaches of our universe. Innovation and determination \nshape our scientific future and the space program is such a crucial \npart of that.\n  My home State of Utah has long been actively engaged in America's \nspace program. Our own Richfield, UT native, former Senator, and my \nfriend, Astronaut Jake Garn, left Cape Canaveral on the Space Shuttle \nDiscovery in April 1985 and return to earth over 6 days later after \nhaving orbited the earth 110 times.\n  As well, ATK, a leading-edge aerospace company based in Utah provides \nstate-of-the-art solid rocket motors which makes the idea of people \nbeing able to fly through space a reality.\n  Utah's contribution to the success of our Nation's space program goes \non and on, but let it suffice to say, that the entire State of Utah \nmourns for the loss of these brave astronauts. We pray for their \nfamilies and those they have left behind.\n  Now is not the time to take a huge step backward in our space program \nand send the message to the next generation of Americans that when \nthings get hard or when plans go wrong, we should give up . . . give up \nand let our dreams and aspirations fall victim to a task that appears \nhopelessly difficult.\n  No, now is not that time.\n  Now is the time when we need to stare adversity in the face. Learn \nfrom past mistakes. Refocus our vision on what we can accomplish by \nworking together toward a unified goal. Now is\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\nthe time to raise a new generation of heroes and teach them how to \novercome difficult circumstances.\n  Yes, America will continue its space program. We will be more than \nmere spectators of the universe. We will be active participants and we \nwill train a new generation of explorers who will build on the \nfoundation laid by these great astronauts abroad the Space Shuttle \nColumbia. Who knows what this new generation may discover? With the \nrapid pace of technological advances and the courage to conquer the \nunknown, it is sure to be something great.\n  Elaine and I send our very strongest condolences to the families of \nthe astronauts who have lost their lives in the service of their \ncountry. We will pray for those families and pray that somehow they \nwill be comforted in this hour of need.\n  I personally know what it is like to lose a member of the family \nwhile serving our country. My older brother was killed in the Second \nWorld War at the Ploesti oil raid that helped to knock out Hitler's oil \nsupply. It was a very difficult thing for our family, and it still is. \nIn the last month, I have been reading the letters he wrote to my \nmother and I have gotten to know him better than I ever thought I \nwould--as a person who gave his life for us and did it willingly so \nthat we might be free.\n  These astronauts have given their lives for us and they have given \nthem willingly, helping us to be free, to have a better society, to \nexplore in this day and age, much like Lewis and Clark did in their day \nand age, the outreaches of the universe and help us to gain \nscientifically every step of the way. I am grateful to them and their \nfamilies and I pray for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues on \nthis sad and solemn afternoon to honor the lives of our brave astronaut \nheroes: the seven crew members of the Space Shuttle Columbia who were \nlost Saturday morning on their return from a 16-day scientific mission \nin outer space.\n  As we honor the memory of the Columbia crew, Shuttle Commander Rick \nHusband, Pilot William McCool, Payload Commander Michael Anderson, \nMission Specialist Kalpana Chawla, Mission Specialist David Brown, \nMission Specialist Laurel Clark, and Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon, I \nsend my heartfelt sympathy to their families and loved ones.\n  This is a national and international tragedy that has brought people \nand nations around the globe together in grief and remembrance. The men \nand women onboard the Columbia epitomized the best and brightest our \ncountry has to offer, and the participation of other nations in the \nshuttle program illustrates the collaboration and interconnection \nbetween America and other nations in the peaceful exploration of space \nand progress of scientific inquiry. The Columbia crew, like most of the \nmen and women in our space program, came to NASA as successful and \nrespected leaders from their respective professions. As scientists, \ndoctors, surgeons, aviators, and military officers, they sought to \nshare their expertise in the service of our Nation and mankind. In the \ndecades since Sputnik and John Glenn's orbital mission of the earth in \nthe Friendship 7, people around the world have been fascinated with \npossibilities of space exploration. The shuttle program opened the \nreality of space exploration to astronauts from many nations and caught \nthe interest of young people around the world.\n  Colonel Ramon, Israel's first astronaut and one of his nation's \npremier air force pilots, captured the imagination of the Israeli \npeople. His participation in the shuttle program stirred a great sense \nof pride and hope in a nation that has endured so much conflict and \nviolence over the past two years. Dr. Kalpana Chawla, the first Indian-\nborn woman to go into space, is a national heroine in India and a great \ninspiration to young people in both that land of her birth and her \nadopted home, especially young women and girls who saw Dr. Chawla as a \nrole model for the possibilities and opportunities available to them.\n  As we mourn the loss of these brave individuals, men and women who \nwillingly assumed the risk of space travel in their dedication to \nscience and the expansion of human knowledge to new frontiers, we are \nreminded of the human spirit for exploration and discovery. Indeed, the \nquintessential trait of the American national character is the sense of \nadventure and curiosity that led pioneers and homesteaders westward, \nimpelled men and women in Europe and Asia to emigrate to a new, vast, \nand unknown Nation with only the promise of opportunity and prosperity, \nand embraced President Kennedy's challenge to put a man on the moon.\n  America has been peopled by men and women driven by this spirit, and \nit is a quality we greatly admire and respect in our leaders and fellow \ncitizens. The crew of the Columbia fully understood that there are many \ndangers associated with space flight, but looked beyond them while \nseeking to bring forth wisdom and reason from the vast unknown through \nspace exploration and research. The crew understood that the \nexperiments they were conducting on a wide array of medical and \nscientific subjects held the promise of major scientific advancements \nand benefit to mankind.\n  In the coming weeks and months, we must investigate what caused this \ntragedy and ensure that manned space flight is safe for our men and \nwomen who dedicate their lives to space exploration. As we scour the \nearth for answers to this tragedy, we must not lose sight of the \nheavens, or allow our fascination with exploring, discovering, or \ndreaming to wane. For by reaffirming our resolve to explore the wonders \nand mysteries of the universe, we honor the memory of the Columbia's \ncrew, and the memory of all those astronauts who lost their lives in \nour Nation's endeavor to understand outer space.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time under \nthe quorum calls be equally divided; in addition, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the previous quorum calls be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I join my colleagues in expressing our \ngratefulness to the seven heroes who were lost on the Space Shuttle \nColumbia Saturday as they completed a mission of science to benefit the \nworld.\n  I also share my thoughts and prayers with the families they've left \nbehind.\n  Over the past few days, we have seen an outpouring of support from \npeople all over the world for these seven remarkable individuals, and \nthe work they carried out so selflessly.\n  From formal memorial services--like the one held in Houston today--to \nmore spontaneous tributes throughout America, Israel, India and other \nnations, people around the world have shared their words of loss and \nappreciation.\n  Frankly, there is little I can add to the chorus of eloquent voices \nwe have heard over the past few days.\n  But what I can do--and what I am honored to do on behalf of the \npeople I represent--is to share with the Senate how two members of this \namazing crew touched the lives of many in my home State of Washington.\n  Columbia pilot William McCool was a Commander in the United States \nNavy. He served two tours at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in \nWashington State.\n  Commander McCool was an EA-6B pilot serving in both the Tactical \nElectronic Warfare Squadron 133 and the Tactical Electronic Warfare \nSquadron 132.\n  His colleague, Columbia Payload Commander Michael Anderson, was a\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\nLieutenant Colonel in the United States Air Force. Colonel Anderson had \nlong ties to the Spokane area in Washington State.\n  Both of these astronauts touched lives in Washington State. Both were \naccomplished pilots. Both were pillars in their communities. Both were \nstrong family members.\n  On Saturday afternoon, I called the Commander of the Naval Air \nStation Whidbey Island. Over the years, I have had an opportunity to \nwork with the fine crews at NAS Whidbey Island. I have shared both good \ntimes and bad times with them. When I called on Saturday just a few \nhours after the disaster, I knew the air crews and the families would \nbe struggling with Commander McCool's death.\n  I spoke with Captain Steven Black. I had expected to hear stories of \nWillie McCool's service at NAS Whidbey earlier in his distinguished \ncareer. I heard that--and so much more--as Captain Black told me about \nthis man who was so revered by his fellow Naval airmen at Whidbey.\n  Willie was a role model to young flyers at Whidbey. They all followed \nhis career and his many accomplishments in the Air Force and as an \nastronaut with NASA.\n  Captain Black told me about his recent E-mails with Commander McCool.\n  Just 2 days before, Commander McCool took the time to E-mail his \nfriends and colleagues at Whidbey. Whidbey Island had an effect on \nWillie McCool. And Willie McCool had an impact on NAS Whidbey Island \nthat lives on in the mission and the talents of the Naval personnel \nserving there.\n  As Captain Black told a reporter,\n\n       Willie flew the skies of Washington state. He was a \n     talented pilot. He was very enthusiastic about his work. He \n     had a contagious sense of awe and wonder at the science \n     behind the flying he loved.\n\n  And Commander McCool touched lives in communities beyond NAS Whidbey.\n  One of those communities is Anacortes, WA, where he and his family \nlived and continue to own a home. Anacortes is north of Oak Harbor and \nNAS Whidbey. It is a small town that took immense pride in having \nCommander McCool as a neighbor, a parent, and a fellow outdoorsman. \nCommander McCool's appreciation for Anacortes and the local community \nwas with him on the Columbia mission.\n  He took with him a Douglas Fir Cone from the Little Cranberry Lake \narea. That cone represented the seeds of a future generation.\n  Commander McCool's commitment and service to future generations is \nnow represented on the sign outside of Fidalgo Elementary School. That \nsign says, ``Fidalgo salutes a legacy of a good friend, Commander \nWilliam McCool.''\n  Let me now turn to another Columbia hero with ties to Washington \nState, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Anderson.\n  On Sunday morning, parishioners of the Morning Star Missionary \nBaptist Church in Spokane gathered to worship and pay tribute to him. \nMichael Anderson and his family are long time members of the \ncongregation.\n  Speaking of Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, Reverend Freeman Simmons \noffered words of comfort to friends of the Anderson family.\n  Reverend Freedom said,\n\n       He belonged to more than his family, more than his race, \n     more than his different affiliations. He belonged to this \n     age.\n\n  Michael Anderson was born in New York State. He and his family came \nto Spokane, WA, during his father's Air Force service at Fairchild Air \nForce Base. He graduated from Cheney High School and came across the \nCascades to attend the University of Washington. At UW, Anderson earned \ndegrees in both physics and astronomy. He went on to a career in the \nAir Force as pilot and was selected to join NASA and the space program \nin 1994.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Anderson was one of the veterans aboard Columbia. \nHe previously spent 211 hours in space on the 89th shuttle mission in \n1998 to the Russian space station MIR. On that mission, Anderson \ntraveled 3.6 million miles in 138 orbits around the Earth aboard the \nshuttle Endeavor.\n  Aboard the Columbia, Payload Commander Anderson was responsible for \nthe incredible science being conducted during the mission. His mission \nwas to manage 79 experiments on behalf of several space agencies and \nschool children in many countries.\n  Michael Anderson considered Spokane his hometown, and Spokane is \nproud of his service. Today, all across Spokane, the community has \nposted its respect and admiration for our lost astronauts. One sign on \nDivision Street reads, ``NASA we mourn with you.'' Another reads, \n``Remember our Astronauts.''\n  Lieutenant Colonel Anderson's many contributions to space and science \nwill live as a lasting tribute to an accomplished and heroic American. \nLet me mention just one.\n  Following Michael's successful 1998 shuttle mission, he returned to \nWashington State and the Spokane area. In May 1998, he want back to his \nalma mater, Cheney High School. He shared his experiences with students \nand he returned a school pennant which he had taken with him into space \non that first mission.\n  One of the teachers described his appearance at a school assembly \nsaying:\n\n       His message to the kids was so upbeat and so positive. ``It \n     doesn't matter what your dream is. If you are willing to \n     chart the course, if you are willing to do what it takes, you \n     can achieve your dreams.'' When that assembly was over, no \n     one wanted to leave. They all wanted to stay and talk to \n     Mike.\n\n  Both of these men left families. These men were spouses, fathers, \ncommunity leaders, role models in service to our country. They will be \nmissed by their families and a grateful nation. We will stand with the \nfamilies as they grieve. We will be with them as the Nation seeks \nanswers to the Columbia tragedy, and we will join them in honoring \ntheir loved ones as space exploration and discovery go forward. Willie \nMcCool, Michael Anderson, and all of our Columbia astronauts gave so \nmuch of their lives in service and exploration. Our task now is to \nensure their spirit continues to deliver the wonders of space that they \nexplored on our behalf.\n  I continue with the words from Willie McCool in an e-mail message to \nhis colleagues at NAS Whidbey. Commander McCool spoke of seeing the Sun \nrise and set on the Earth from space and wrote:\n\n       The colors are stunning.\n       In a single view, I see--looking out at the edge of the \n     earth:\n       red at the horizon line,\n       blending to orange and yellow,\n       followed by a thin white line,\n       then light blue,\n       gradually turning to dark blue\n       and various gradually darker shades of grey\n       then black and a million stars above.\n       It's breathtaking.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished senior \nSenator from Virginia and I be recognized for a time not to exceed 20 \nminutes to engage in a colloquy, and that it be charged against the \ntime of the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I join with my colleague, Senator Warner, \non this sad day, not just for America but for the world. It is a day on \nwhich we commemorate and honor the lives of the seven courageous \nastronauts. We are joined together in honoring the lives of these \ncourageous individuals who dedicated their lives and decided to use \ntheir talents to reach high; to reach for high ideals, and who assumed \nthe risks of these dangers in a very noble effort to improve our \nquality of life here on Earth.\n  This is a day of admiration. It is a day of inspiration for us and \nfor the NASA people who care so much about this tragedy, the loss of \nthese heroes. We all watched in horror as they were trying to come back \ninto our atmosphere. The tragic disaster was more than just a loss for \nus in the United States, but it was a loss for the entire world \ncommunity--whose diversity, ingenuity, and skill are reflected in the \nmembers of this historic crew.\n  Our hearts ache for the grieving but amazingly brave families of \nthese heroes who perished in this catastrophic failure. As we go \nthrough the list of those on the shuttle we see Rick Husband, \nCommander; Pilot William McCool; Michael Anderson; CDR Kalpana Chawla, \nMission Specialist Laurel Clark; Mission Specialist Ilan Ramon of \nIsrael; and David M. Brown, Mission Specialist 1 and Navy captain from \nArlington, VA, a Virginia resident, born and raised in Virginia, he\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\nwent to college at the College of William and Mary after attending \nYorktown High School, and was graduated from Eastern Virginia Medical \nSchool in Norfolk, VA.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with all these families. But for my \ncolleagues to get to know the character of these families, where they \ncame from, it is important that I share with you my conversation with \nDavid's brother Doug. David's brother was the only family member who \nwas waiting for him when he was to land in Florida.\n  It is a family of achievers. His father--it would have been very \ndifficult for him to get down there because his father is in a \nwheelchair. His father contracted polio at the age of 5. It never \ndeterred him. He became a judge. He campaigned, somehow, door to door, \nand then was appointed as a circuit court judge, where he served \nhonorably and expertly for 20 years, watching a great deal of growth \nand transformation in Northern Virginia.\n  David's brother Doug, with whom I spoke today, is a hero and \ncharacter in his own sense. He went to West Virginia University. I \nsaid: Why did you leave Virginia to go to West Virginia? And he said \nthey have a great target shooting program there. He himself was a two-\ntime All-American. It is a family of achievers.\n  Doug talked about family, not just his family but the NASA family; \nabout this crew and how this flight was delayed time after time; one \ntime because they were sending up another mission to fix the Hubble. \nAnother time there was a delay because of repair of the fuel lines. So \nthe family became closer. By the time they were actually able to launch \nand go off on their mission, they had become very close.\n  We talked about various things. I asked him a question about what \ncould we do to help? Is there anything we can do to comfort you or to \ncomfort your family? What he said is that NASA and the Navy Casualty \nAssistance Crews were great. Everything possible was being done for \nthem. He talked about how NASA had such noble goals, trying to expand \nthe knowledge of mankind, and said they are the best of mankind.\n  Doug said his brother David understood that everyone was taking \nrisks. We talked about how Navy pilots and test pilots over the years \nhave lost their lives, some trying to land on a pitching aircraft \ncarrier. He said those folks are heroes as well, and they don't get the \nattention these individuals received.\n  I asked Doug how his recent conversations with David. Doug said that \nhe recently asked David: Well, what if you don't get back? What should \nI say?\n  He said his brother told him the program must go on. Not in a \ncareless way, but it needs to move forward. He believed if there was \nany error and he couldn't get back, it most likely would be a human \nerror, but that he would not hold that against whomever it was involved \nin that error because he knew everyone was trying to do the best job \nthey could.\n  He talked about NASA, about how they cared about, for example, \nspecifically, one of the culprits or suspected culprits in this \ntragedy, which was that piece of foam that hit the left wing.\n  His brother--and he communicated with him by e-mail when he was up in \nspace--had actually taken photographs of that wing because they were \nconcerned about it.\n  I said: Did those photographs get back?\n  He said: No, they didn't send those photographs back. But that will \nbe part of the investigation, at least his oral description of the \nsituation.\n  I said: As we are trying to figure this out and trying to learn from \nit, what would he say?\n  He said: Gosh, you have to understand, George--he said George, not \nSenator Allen. We are on a friendly basis. He said: You have to \nunderstand my brother David was a football player. He was an offensive \nlineman at Yorktown High School. He said: In these sort of things, they \nuse a football analogy. You don't get stopped dead in your tracks. When \nyou get tackled, you get up and you keep trying to score.\n  And Doug, his brother, said they used to make fun of David, that no \none ever paid any attention to an offensive lineman. They were trying \nto rub it in. No one knew of his football prowess.\n  David retorted that no one else had Katie Couric cheering for him \nlike she did at Yorktown High School.\n  Today, David, everyone is cheering for you. We are aching for your \nwonderful family and your friends. We know the noble mission that you \nhave been on, and others will be on in the future, will continue as you \ndesired.\n  We will reconstruct the facts. We are determined to get up. We are \ndetermined to learn. We will not quit. We will keep fighting. In fact, \nwe will keep improving, we will keep innovating, and we will keep \nadvancing.\n  David Brown was a hero, and these surviving families are heroic \nindividuals as well. As we go forward, we will learn. But we also will \npray to God that we continue to be blessed, in this country and the \nworld, with people of such courage and especially people of such great \ncharacter.\n  I would like to yield to the distinguished senior Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, may I say to my good friend, the junior \nSenator, that he delivered his remarks with great empathy and feeling. \nI wish to congratulate him. I have come to know him as a man who has \nintense feelings for people; and as a former Governor the many times he \nhad to respond to catastrophes and loss of life in our State, he \ncertainly has learned how to speak for the families and the survivors, \nand to speak with admiration about those who made the sacrifice. I \nthank the Senator for the privilege of serving with him.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, it is interesting; as the two of us \napproached the floor, a reporter paused in a very courteous way to ask \nme some questions. He is doing a study on the demographics of the \nSenate, and in particular on the number of Senators who have had an \nopportunity to serve in uniform. I expressed an opinion that I have \nexpressed many times to a similar request. I find that, while it has \nits advantages, there is certainly no disadvantage to those who have \nnot had the opportunity to serve in uniform. I think we all learn very \nquickly how to address the responsibilities we have with respect to the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  But in the few steps that I took walking to the Chamber, I say to my \ncolleague, I did reflect momentarily on two brief periods that I was \nprivileged to serve in uniform at the very end of World War II when I \ndid not see combat as did the spouse of the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer of the Senate, our former colleague, Senator Dole, in no way \nhave I ever put myself in the category of Senators Dole, Inouye, \nStevens, Hollings, and many others since then who served in Vietnam \nwith such great distinction on the battlefield. But I did come to know \nmany of my colleagues. Then I served briefly in the Korean war as a \nground communications officer in the first wing. But I got to know \naviators very well in that capacity. I recall that one of our tentmates \ndid not return, and also our commanding officer lost his life. I was \npart of the detail that went out to retrieve him from a mountainside.\n  I empathize, as do the other men and women of the Armed Forces, for \nthe loss of those astronauts who achieved their status through training \nin the U.S. military. What a privilege it is for all of us who had the \nopportunity to serve, to serve with others, and to share in their \neveryday happenings and glory--and sometimes in the status of their \ndeath--that we do here, brothers and sisters in the Senate today.\n\n  A number of our colleagues had the opportunity to go down to the \nservices. I had to remain here. But I join with my colleagues in our \nreverent and humble way of expressing our deepest sympathies to the \nfamilies, to the survivors, to the fellow enlisted military officers \nwho served with these individuals throughout their careers, and to the \nNation. The whole Nation is grieving for their deaths.\n  It is a marvelous thing to see Americans come together from all walks \nof life and to join in prayers and in other ways--so often in quiet \nways--to express our feelings over this tragic loss to our Nation, and \nindeed to the world, because the world is largely dependent on those \nnations that have trained those going into space with particular \nmissions. We lost the very brave and\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\nextraordinary military officer from our strong ally, Israel.\n  While our Nation grieves for the deaths of the seven pioneers in \nspace, for their friends and families, and for the States those brave \nsouls called home, we join in mourning with all States in the Union. \nAnd yet we celebrate in a way their entire lives. We in Virginia are \nunited in our solemn remembrance of one of those astronauts, CPT David \nBrown, whose parents, Dorothy and Paul, live in Washington, VA. My \ndistinguished colleague spoke of his wonderful conversation with his \nbrother today.\n  In the United States of America, we are a nation of pioneers--blazing \ntrails from the 16th and 17th centuries to build ourselves a new \nnation, venturing west in the 18th and 19th centuries to fulfill our \nmanifest destiny; and today in the 20th and 21st centuries leaving the \nouter bounds of our own atmosphere to learn more about this planet and \nothers, and to share that knowledge with the world.\n  Shuttle launches and landings have become routine over the last \nseveral decades, yielding a false sense of security. We now recognize \nhow false it is--for we are shaken to our very core.\n  Brilliant were the remarks delivered today by our President--and \nthose who gathered with him at the memorial service. President Bush is \nwell known to my colleague as a fellow Governor. They served together. \nHow often the Senator from Virginia told me about the moments they \nshared when both of them were Governors. But he--not unlike my dear \nfriend, the Senator from Virginia--has a remarkable way to step into a \nperiod of mourning and bring strength to the families who remain, and \nto the Nation. I certainly commend our President.\n  Over 100 times our brave astronauts have challenged the laws of \ngravity--I love that phrase; I wrote it myself--the laws of gravity \npropelling themselves, their shuttles, and their payloads hundreds of \nmiles from the Earth's surface. Their work has yielded a great deal of \nscientific advancement--especially medical advances--credited with \nenhancing the quality of life not only of ourselves but, indeed, the \nworld.\n  Space research, technology, and exploration are major contributors to \nenhancing our national security, to improving our standard of living, \nand broadening our scientific knowledge--and to carry on the pioneering \ntraditions of our Nation. NASA has been the driving force for these \nmany accomplishments.\n  May I say the current Administrator of NASA is a member of our Senate \nfamily. In many ways, he worked with this institution. He went on to \nbecome Secretary of the Navy, an office that I was once privileged to \nhold. Our thoughts and prayers are with him. I think thus far he has \nshown strong leadership in addressing this tragedy, proceeding \nimmediately to try to unearth the facts and to procure the knowledge \nfrom all sources, wherever they may be, to try to find the answers for \nthis tragedy.\n\n  We are a nation of risk-takers. But with exploration comes inherent \nrisks. We have continually tempted fate through superior science and \nwith the most talented men and women in their fields--astronauts who \nare the best and the brightest--those who fulfill their dreams and, I \nthink more importantly, who have instilled in generations of young \npeople their commitments and their dreams to perhaps become astronauts \nor dreams to perhaps one day wear the uniforms of the Army, the Navy, \nthe Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, and the Air Force.\n  Last night I was privileged to attend a public meeting of the Council \non Foreign Relations and of the four members of the chiefs of the \nservices and/or their designated persons, who spoke brilliantly. In the \ncross questions, they addressed their pride in those men in uniform who \nachieved the status of astronaut--most particularly, at least two of \nthem knew personally two of those who were lost on this mission.\n  I was so proud of the way they spoke and talked with resolve as to \nhow we press on in space, and how generations upon generations will be \ncoming behind to take their places, not unlike the men and women of the \nArmed Forces who throughout the world today are standing watch over our \nfreedom, most particularly in the stressful situations of the Korean \nPeninsula and, indeed, the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan. How proud we \nare of the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  The Columbia crew trained for their mission for years and in an \ninstant our Nation has lost seven brave brothers and sisters;\n  Commander Rick Douglas Husband, U.S. Air Force Colonel, father of one \ndaughter and one son; hometown, Amarillo, TX;\n  Pilot William C. McCool, U.S. Navy Commander, father of three sons; \nhometown, San Diego, CA:\n  Kalpana Chawla, Ph.D. in aerospace engineering, hometown Karnau, \nIndia;\n  Michael P. Anderson, lieutenant colonel, U.S. Air Force, father of \ntwo daughters; hometown, Spokane, WA;\n  Laurel Blair Salton Clark, commander, U.S. Navy, mother of one son; \nhometown, Racine, WI;\n  Ilan Ramon, colonel, Isreli Air Force;\n  And David M. Brown, captain, U.S. Navy; hometown, Washington, VA.\n  I am proud to stand here today on behalf of all Virginians to honor \nhis memory and celebrate his life.\n  How proud Virginia, his parents, his friends, and his family are of \nthis distinguished man: CPT David Brown. In his last words from space, \nCPT Brown wrote an e-mail to his parents in Virginia. My colleague \nreferred to an e-mail he wrote to his brother. This is an e-mail he \nwrote to his parents:\n\n       If I'd been born in space, I would desire to visit the \n     beautiful Earth more than I ever yearned to visit space. It's \n     a wonderful planet.\n\n  Quiet, confident, heroic, adventuresome, dedicated to the welfare of \nothers, and always seeing the best in our world: CPT Brown.\n  My colleague enumerated the details of his family and his education, \nbut I do wish to recount one story. His parents were not surprised by \nhis choice. Paul and Dorothy Brown watched their son grow up in the \nWestover section of Arlington with a clear sense of adventure. He flew \nwith a friend in a small plane at age 7. And while at William and Mary, \nhe worked two jobs just to gain the dollars for his flying lessons.\n  In a speech to students last September, CPT Brown predicted that at \nsome point a shuttle flight would end with the loss of crew and \naircraft. But he encouraged the young people to have ``a big vision, \naccept the risks and be persistent in pursuit of [your] goals.''\n  Last Christmas, CPT Brown had a conversation with his brother Doug, \nwho asked what would happen if something went wrong in space. He simply \nsaid: ``Well, this program will go on.'' And the remainder of that \nconversation my dear colleague put in the Record.\n  We are a nation of patriots. Not only must we remember these brave \nmen and women of the Columbia, but all men, all women in uniform, who \nprotect this great Nation. And I suppose since 9/11 each of you in this \nChamber, like I, stop quietly when you see the uniform of a fireman, a \npoliceman, or a medical worker, or those who form the vast \ninfrastructure in this country and take risks day and night so we can \nenjoy the highest quality of life of any nation in this world.\n  I say to our Armed Forces on deployment around the world, who have \nbeen dispatched for the cause of protecting freedom, and to our police \nand firefighters, you are in our thoughts and in our prayers every day. \nOurs is a grateful Nation for the risks you and your families--and I \nunderline families--take.\n  Today we must mourn our loss: the crew of the Columbia. Tomorrow we \nwill continue their work. I emphasize that. Our President said that. \nTomorrow we will continue their work, their search for knowledge, and \ntheir exploration of new frontiers.\n  We will remember them with reverence, just as we remember the \nsettlers at Jamestown in 1607, and the expedition of Lewis and Clark in \n1803. We will remember them, just as we remember our lost soldiers, \nsailors, and airmen, who have given their lives--generations of lives--\nto protect our freedoms. And we will remember them, just as we will \nremember the others who have fallen in space, who dared to dance among \nthe stars. We remember them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, before the minority assistant leader \narrives and I do final closing business, I want to commend the senior \nSenator from Virginia, my mentor, my ally, my good friend, for his \noutstanding statements, and for his experiences throughout his life--in \nmany wars, in many tragedies--and through it all with his experience, \nas he always has the right things to say. He crafts those words \nhimself. And he is proud of them.\n  He is an artist. He is an artist not only on canvas but also an \nartist with the gift of language, of sentiments, and of love and care \nfor his fellow human beings. And he has been a hero himself, in many \nwars--in time of war and in time of peace--a leader in the civilian \nsector, and one who I, every single day, in every single moment that I \nam with him, learn something good and beneficial to improve myself.\n  So I thank my colleague, my dear friend, Senator Warner, for those \nwonderful remarks that I think mean a great deal to the family of \nCaptain Brown and to all the families, but also to the spirit of \ninnovation, of that gung-ho spirit as far as the military is concerned, \nbut also understanding the historic nature from the very beginnings of \nthe cradle of liberty in Jamestown, on through the Lewis and Clark \nexpeditions, and others throughout mankind.\n  He is really a wonderful Virginia gentleman. Some call him ``The \nSquire.'' I call him a living hero. I thank the Senator for his \ncomments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I am deeply moved. A \nhero I am not, my dear fellow. I served twice in active duty for brief \nperiods, and I benefited greatly in that service.\n  I try today, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, to return \nto the men and women of the Armed Forces more than what I received by \nway of training and other benefits from serving in the military. My \ntours of active duty are inconsequential compared to the glorious \ncareers of the persons who we honor today and, indeed, all others \nreally that I have served with and see on the far-flung battlefields of \nthe world as I travel through their posts, and will do soon again, to \ndo what I can to benefit their lives, their welfare, their safety, and \nthat of their families.\n  Mr. WARNER. But I think, my dear friend, we should note that we have \npresent in the Chamber today the visiting Chaplain who comes from the \nState of Virginia. I think it is a matter of consequence that he is \nhere today in the time that you and I speak. And he, too, expresses, as \nhe did in the opening prayer, what is in his heart today, as he is in \nthis Chamber, participating and listening to our speeches. So we are \nfortunate. We thank the guest Chaplain.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I share my colleague's comments in relation \nto the guest Chaplain, Dr. William Carl. It is a pleasure for us all he \nis here.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I often speak about the many \ninspirational or impressive feats accomplished by South Dakotans. I am \nparticularly pleased by the thousands of men and women from South \nDakota who serve our Nation in one of the Armed Forces. But today, I \nwant to call attention to someone who has risen above and beyond most \nothers. I'm speaking of CDR Charles J. ``Jerry'' Logan of the U.S. \nNavy.\n  Commander Logan was born in De Smet, SD. He also lived in Leola and \nBelle Fourche, SD. The commander is a graduate of Belle Fourche High \nSchool and the South Dakota School of Mines in Rapid City. He is the \nonly son of Charles and Margaret Logan's eight children. Most of the \nLogan family continues to reside in South Dakota. The commander is \nmarried to Teresa Logan, the daughter of Norman, who also served in the \nNavy, and Gay Jacobs.\n  Last November Commander Logan was bestowed the special honor of \ntaking command of the USS Bremerton. This is his first command post. \nThe Bremerton is one of several nuclear attack submarines assigned to \nthe Pacific Fleet. Command of a nuclear submarine is obviously and \nenormous responsibility. Only a select few are ever charged with such a \ntask.\n  Commander Logan took command of the Bremerton at a Change of Command \nceremony in San Diego. Over 100 friends and relatives attended, and I \nam pleased to say many came from South Dakota--including Commander \nLogan's parents, all seven of his sisters, and many other relatives. I \nunderstand the presiding officer at the ceremony, Captain McAneny, was \nquite moved by the large contingent from South Dakota who traveled to \nshow their support for Commander Logan.\n  I can certainly understand why the entire Logan and Jacobs families \nare proud of Commander Logan. I, too am proud of Jerry Logan, as I am \nproud of all those from South Dakota and throughout the Nation who are \nserving their country in the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join the Nation in grieving the \ntragic loss of the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia, which went down \nduring its return to Earth after 16 days in space.\n  My heart especially goes out to the families of the seven astronauts \non board the Columbia; Rick Husband, the mission commander, William \nMcCool, the shuttle pilot, and the five crew-members, David Brown, \nMichael Anderson, Laurel Clark, Kalpana Chawla, and Ilan Ramon.\n  Ever since President Kennedy announced, on May 25, 1961, that the \nUnited States land an American safely on the Moon by the end of the \n1960s, our Nation has been committed to reaching for the stars.\n  President Kennedy said, ``We choose to go to the moon . . . not \nbecause [it is] easy, but because [it is] hard.''\n  Thus begun America's space program, a program which has compelled \nsome our Nation's brightest and bravest souls to risk their lives in \nthe name of progress; to travel into the frontiers of space in order to \nadvance human life here on Earth.\n  The space program has seen its share of tragedy. In the prespace \ntravel days of 1950s, daredevil pilots, such as form Senator John \nGlenn, risked it all to help us develop jet engine and rocket \npropulsion technologies, and to learn about the outer-reachers of our \nstratosphere. Dozens died in the process. They sacrificed their lives \nto make the space program possible.\n  Many of us are old enough to remember January 27, 1967, the day \nApollo 1 exploded during a launch-pad test, killing all three \nastronauts on board, Virgil Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee. I \npersonally remember the numbness I felt when hearing the news, and \nlater watching the tragedy replayed on television.\n  But the space program went forward; 18 months later, on July 20, \n1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took man's first steps on the \nMoon.\n  All of a sudden, our boundaries seemed limitless.\n  In 1982, the space shuttle program became operational, and trips to \nspace began seeming commonplace.\n  But once again, on January 28, 1986, our Nation mourned the loss of \nshuttle astronauts Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald \nMcNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe, who \nwere lost the Challenger shuttle exploded during take-off.\n  President Reagan's words spoke for an entire Nation when he said: \n``We've grown used to the idea space, and perhaps we forget that we've \nonly just begun. We are still pioneers.''\n  With those words, the space shuttle program went forward, and there \nhave been dozens of shuttle launches over the past 15 years, reaping \nuntold rewards for humanity in terms of increasing our understanding of \nphysics, biology, and of the physical universe in which we live.\n  Now we are in the shadow of another tragedy. Some are questioning \nwhether or not manned space flights ought to continue. Some say risks \nto the lives of the astronauts outweigh the gains we can make in terms \nof scientific progress.\n  I say we listen to the families of those lost on Space Shuttle \nColumbia. They are united in their feelings that their loved ones died \ndoing what they loved most, that these heroes understood the risks, but \nwere undeterred because they also understood the potential for gain.\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\n  These families are united in their belief that the space program must \ngo on.\n  I believe that if it does not, than the lives of these seven \nastronauts would have been lost in vain.\n  Tragedies like these are a direct result of America's restless desire \nfor progress, to go further, fly faster, learn more, and advance.\n  Robert Kennedy once said: ``It is from acts of courage that human \nhistory is shaped.''\n  These seven brave astronauts knew the risks. They were not deterred. \nThey were emboldened. They gave their lives that humanity could take \nyet another leap forward into the vast unknown of future knowledge.\n  They are, and always will be, national heroes.\n  Reading through articles from Sunday's New York Times, I could not \nhelp but be struck by the diversity of the crew. Once upon a time, all \nNASA astronauts were white men from the military. But over the past few \ndecades, NASA has been recruiting astronauts based on their skills, \ntheir excellence, and of course, their courage and commitment. That has \nmeant a more diverse astronaut pool.\n  The crew of the Columbia were a wonderful example of this diversity, \nmen and women, black and white, immigrant and native-born, as well as a \ncrew-member from Israel, Ilan Ramon.\n  The crew of the Columbia offer us a reminder that there are not \nboundaries in space, and that humans are one race.\n  Together, we will overcome this tragedy. And together, we will \ncontinue to look toward the stars and beyond.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record seven articles from \nSunday's New York Times, each of which offers insights into the lives \nand personal accomplishments of each of the astronauts lost in \nSaturday's tragedy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 2003]\n\nLoss of the Shuttle: The Astronauts; the Columbia Space Shuttle's Crew \n                      of 6 Americans and 1 Israeli\n\n                            (By Pam Belluck)\n\n       Seven astronauts, six Americans and an Israeli, died aboard \n     the shuttle Columbia yesterday. Of the crew of five men and \n     two women, four had never flown in space before.\n\n\n      Col. Rick D. Husband--a Lifelong Dream of Being an Astronaut\n\n       It took Rick D. Husband four tries to convince NASA to let \n     him become an astronaut. The 45-year-old Air Force colonel \n     from Amarillo, Tex., had yearned to fly in outer space since \n     he was a child. ``It's been pretty much a lifelong dream and \n     just a thrill to be able to get to actually live it,'' \n     Colonel Husband told The Associated Press just before the \n     Jan. 16 launching of the space shuttle Columbia.\n       Finally, Colonel Husband, a former test pilot who learned \n     to fly when he was 18 and had more than 3,800 hours of flight \n     time in more than 40 types of aircraft, was chosen for the \n     NASA space program in 1994.\n       But it would take five more years of training and \n     preparation before he would ride his first rocket into space. \n     During that 10-day mission in 1999, Colonel Husband was the \n     pilot of the space shuttle Discovery in the first mission by \n     a shuttle crew to dock with the international space station.\n       After that he became chief of safety for NASA's astronaut \n     office, and despite having only one space flight under his \n     belt Colonel Husband was chosen to be the commander of the \n     Columbia mission.\n       His mother, Jane Husband, said he prepared intensely, \n     capitalizing on every minute, even an unexpected six-month \n     delay when repairs forced the shuttle to be grounded last \n     July.\n       ``At Christmas, he was still studying, and I said, `Oh, \n     gosh,' '' Mrs. Husband told the Ledger of Lakeland, Fla., \n     just after the launching of the shuttle. ``He said, `I have \n     to make sure everything is in my head perfect.' They're all \n     like that. They have to be mentally prepared.''\n       Greg Ojakangas, a NASA consultant and professor of physics \n     at Drury University in Springfield, MO., because friendly \n     with Colonel Husband during the 1994 NASA selection process, \n     when Dr. Ojakangas was not picked to be an astronaut.\n       ``He finally made it,'' Dr. Ojakangas said. ``It was a tale \n     of perseverance.''\n       Dr. Ojakangas said Colonel Husband was a religious man \n     devoted to his family, whose only regret about joining the \n     space program was that it kept him so busy.\n       ``When I asked him how he was liking it,'' Dr. Ojakangas \n     said, ``I remember him talking about how he wished he has \n     more time at home.''\n       Colonel Husband, had a wife, Evelyn; a daughter, Laura, 8; \n     and a son, Matthew, 3. A baritone who sang in a barbershop \n     quartet while in school, Colonel Husband still sang in church \n     choirs. And he loved water skiing and biking.\n       Colonel Husband's mother and uncle watched the shuttle \n     launching in Florida last month, feeling some of the \n     astronaut's excitement as the spacecraft took off.\n       ``It was almost as if the creator arranged it,'' his uncle, \n     George Drank, told The Ledger. ``The flood lights were on the \n     shuttle. Then the sun started coming over the horizon. As it \n     ascended into heaven, the sun was behind it, and it made a \n     big dark streak across the sky. I looked back at his mother \n     and brother and tears were streaming.''\n       Evelyn Husband said: ``I wasn't nervous about what he was \n     doing because he worked so long and hard for it. But when \n     that started lifting off, Mama started crying. It's different \n     when your son is on it.''\n       When asked before the flight about being selected mission \n     commander while being relatively new to the space program, \n     Colonel Husband seemed modest and poised.\n       ``I think,'' he said, ``a lot of it has to do with being at \n     the right place at the right time, for starters.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Times Feb. 2, 2003]\n\nLoss of the Shuttle: The Astronauts; the Columbia Space Shuttle's Crew \n                      of 6 Americans and 1 Israeli\n\n                           (By Jodi Wilgoren)\n\n       Seven astronauts, six Americans and an Israeli, died aboard \n     the shuttle Columbia yesterday.

She had penetrated the air as a flight surgeon \n     aboard the Marine Attack Squadron of the Year. Space was the \n     logical next frontier.\n       ``She was never one of these people to say, `O.K., I found \n     what I want to do,' it was always `What the next challenge?' \n     '' said Dr. Clark's younger brother, Daniel Salton. ``She was \n     one of these people who just had goals, just saw the goal, \n     the end result, and knew how much work it would take to get \n     there and was willing to do it.''\n       Dr. Clark, 41, a Navy commander who was one of two women \n     among the seven astronauts aboard the space shuttle Columbia, \n     was always scuba diving or mountain biking, hiking or rock \n     climbing or parachuting. She grew up in Racine, Wisc., the \n     eldest of four children, married a fellow Navy officer, \n     Jonathan Clark, who later joined her in working at NASA, and \n     had an 8-year-old son, Iain.\n       In an e-mail message sent from the space shuttle a few days \n     ago, Dr. Clark marveled at the view of Wind Point, a \n     peninsula jutting into Lake Michigan a few miles from her \n     childhood home, and wondered whether the photographs she had \n     taken would turn out.\n       ``Hello from above our magnificent planet earth,'' Dr. \n     Clark wrote to a group of close friends and relatives. ``The \n     perspective is truly awe-inspiring. Even the stars have a \n     special brightness. I have seen my `friend' Orion several \n     times.\n       An animal lover who was always the child to sleep with the \n     family cat, Laurel Blair Salton graduated from Racine's \n     William Horlick High School in 1979 and majored in zoology at \n     the University of Wisconsin, in Madison, intending to be a \n     veterinarian. Instead, she attended the university's medical \n     school, where she was part of a tight-knit group of six \n     friends who saved up their vacation time and spent the last \n     three weeks before graduation in 1987 sailing a 42-foot boat \n     through the British Virgin Islands.\n       After nearly a decade in the Navy, with postings in \n     Pensacola, Fla, Holy Loch, Scotland, and Yuma, Ariz, a friend \n     suggested that Dr. Clark take the NASA test. Like many \n     others, she was not accepted on the first round. She later \n     became part of a class known as the Sardines, because it had \n     more than 40 astronaut candidates, the most in history, Ms. \n     Salton said.\n       At NASA, Dr. Clark was nicknamed ``Floral, ``because of the \n     vibrant colors that she wore when not in uniform.\n       Mr. Salton said he never worried about the safety of the \n     shuttle--until two weeks ago when he joined his mother, \n     siblings and several of Dr. Clark's friends at the launching.\n       ``I was just an emotional wreck when she was in space, when \n     you actually see that rocket group,'' he recalled. ``Visions \n     of the Challenger go through your head and you pray that its \n     not going to happen. Once they're up in space, big sigh of \n     relief, O.K. the dangerous part is over. I never ever \n     considered that something could happen on the way down.''\n       While in space, Dr. Clark was part of several life-science \n     experiments. In an interview from space published on Friday \n     in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, she spoke of watching the \n     sunsets.\n       ``There's a flash--the whole payload bay turns this rosy \n     pink,'' she said. ``It only lasts about 15 seconds and then \n     it's gone. It's very ethereal and extremely beautiful.''\n       Always a lover of her Scottish heritage, Dr. Clark had \n     chosen as her wake-up song aboard the shuttle a bagpipe \n     version of ``Amazing Grace,'' similar to one played at her \n     wedding.\n       It will also be played at her funeral.\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 2003]\n\nLoss of the Shuttle: The Astronauts; the Columbia Space Shuttle's Crew \n                      of 6 Americans and 1 Israeli\n\n                          (By Warren E.

Ilan Ramon was a soft-spoken combat pilot conscious of \n     the importance of symbols and history, and the role he played \n     in both. In the days and weeks leading to the Columbia's \n     mission, and as the shuttle carried out its 16 days of \n     science experiments, much of the attention focused on Colonel \n     Ramon.\n       The son and grandson of Holocaust survivors, Colonel Ramon, \n     48, was the first citizen of his country to go into space. \n     The accomplishment, he said in an interview in mid-January, \n     was not his alone.\n       ``Every time you are the first, it is meaningful,'' he \n     said. ``I am told my flight is meaningful to a lot of Jewish \n     people around the world. Being the first Israeli astronaut, I \n     feel I am representing all Jews and all Israelis.''\n       On the shuttle, where he presided over an Israeli project \n     to collect images of dust storms to gauge their impact on \n     climate, Colonel Ramon carried a special keepsake.\n       It was a small Torah scroll used at the bar mitzvah of the \n     project's principal investigator, Dr. Joachim Joseph, almost \n     60 years ago while he was in a Nazi concentration camp. The \n     elderly rabbi performing the ceremony, who died soon \n     afterward in the camp, gave the Torah to the boy and told him \n     to tell people what had happened there.\n       Dr. Joseph said Colonel Ramon saw the Torah when visiting \n     his home and was so moved by the story that he asked to take \n     it into space as a tribute.\n       Before the launching, most of the attention paid to the \n     mission centered on security and efforts to keep the shuttle \n     and its crew safe from any terrorist attack. Officials at \n     NASA acknowledged that the presence of an Israeli astronaut \n     had only intensified the heightened security they had imposed \n     since Sept. 11, 2001.\n       But Colonel Ramon and his crewmates said they were not \n     unduly concerned about their safety, and they concentrated on \n     keeping up their training for their much-delayed research \n     mission, Colonel Ramon, who spent more than four years \n     preparing for the flight, saw it repeatedly postponed by \n     higher-priority missions and problems that periodically \n     grounded the shuttle fleet.\n       ``I have a lot of patience,'' he said with a smile before \n     the launching, ``but now I'm ready to go.''\n       Ilan Ramon was born on June 20, 1954, in a Tel Aviv suburb \n     and, after graduating from high school in 1972, attended the \n     Israel Air force Flight School. He became a fighter pilot and \n     logged more than 4,000 hours in various combat aircraft. He \n     fought in the Yom Kippur war of 1973 and in the Lebanon \n     conflict in 1982.\n       He received a bachelor of science degree in electronics and \n     computer engineering from the University of Tel Aviv in 1987, \n     and in 1994 was promoted to colonel and assigned to head the \n     air force's weapons development and acquisition division.\n       Colonel Ramon was selected as an astronaut candidate in \n     1997 as a result of a science agreement two years earlier \n     between President Bill Clinton and Shimon Peres, then the \n     Israeli foreign minister. He and his wife, Rona, moved to \n     Houston in 1998 so he could begin training at the Johnson \n     Space Center.

Mr. \n     Seath, who has taught aerodynamics at the University of Texas \n     of Arlington since 1965, would be hard pressed to think of a \n     student who on first meeting seemed less likely to go into \n     space than Kalpana Chawla. It was not that she lacked \n     brilliance. ``She was a very good student, quite excellent,'' \n     Mr. Seath said in a telephone interview. ``She was in my \n     aerodynamics class, and she performed exceedingly well. She \n     was very bright.''\n       What she did not have was the brash attitude most aspiring \n     astronauts displayed.\n       ``She was quiet and modest,'' Mr. Seath said. ``When I \n     heard she had been accepted into the program to become a \n     astronaut I was thrilled but also surprised.'' She just did \n     not seem to fit the type, he said.\n       But Dr. Chawla, 41, never lacked determination, those who \n     knew her said. From her childhood in Karnal, a small-town \n     about 80 miles north of New Delhi, she nursed a lifelong \n     dream to go into space. She early on set her sights on an \n     American education that would take her up into the air.\n       ``I was interested in aerospace and flying, and the U.S. is \n     really the best place in the world for flying,'' she told the \n     University of Texas at Arlington magazine in 1998.\n       Dr. Chawla was a brilliant student, always in the top five \n     of her class, those who knew her said. After getting an \n     engineering degree from Punjab Engineering College in 1982, \n     she moved to the United States, where she attended the \n     University of Texas at Arlington, then got a doctorate in \n     aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado. Along \n     the way she became a citizen of the United States.\n       In 1994, NASA selected her and 19 other people from a group \n     of 4,000 other applicants to its astronaut program. On Nov. \n     19, 1997, she became the first Indian-born woman in space. \n     She was assigned to the shuttle Columbia as a mission \n     specialist and prime robotic arm operator.\n       The flight was not without mishaps. As robotic arm operator \n     she was unable to retrieve the 3,000 pound Spartan satellite, \n     which spun away after the shuttle released it, and astronauts \n     had to go out on a space walk three days later to retrieve \n     it. The mistake shook her confidence, and she feared her \n     space career was over. But her concern was misplaced.\n       ``Some of the senior people, the very senior astronauts, \n     shook my hand and said, `K.C., you did a great job. Don't let \n     anyone tell you different,' ``Dr. Chawla told the University \n     of Texas at Arlington Magazine. A NASA inquiry later \n     determined that the shuttle crew had made a series of errors \n     that caused the satellite to malfunction.\n       In New Delhi, relatives of Dr. Chawla gathered to hear news \n     and mourn together.\n       ``Whenever you are involved in such tasks, one should be \n     prepared for such things,'' said Anjay Chawla, Dr. Chawla's \n     brother, his voice choking as he spoke to reporters. ``If it \n     could happen to others it could happen to you as well. This \n     time it happened to us.''\n       R. S. Bhatia, head of the Washington office of the Indian \n     Space Research Organization, India's answer to NASA, said Dr. \n     Chawla had become a symbol of India's greatness, even though \n     she was no longer a citizen.\n       ``After her first flight, she became a national hero,'' Mr. \n     Bhatia said. ``She is an American citizen, but she is ours \n     too.

He went on to join the circus while studying \n     biology at the College of William and Mary. He was an \n     acrobat, unicyclist and stilt walker.\n       ``I always let him dream,'' said his mother, Dot.\n       He attended Eastern Virginia Medical School and signed up \n     with the Navy afterwards.\n       He was sent to a military hospital in Alaska, and then \n     served on an aircraft carrier. In 1988, Dr. Brown was \n     selected for pilot training, a rarity for Navy doctors. He \n     graduated No. 1 in his naval aviation class.\n       He flew F-18 Hornet jet fighters, A-6E Intruder aircraft \n     and the high performance T-38 Talon, known as the white \n     rocket. He joined the Navy test pilot school in 1995 and was \n     chosen for the astronaut program the next year. It was his \n     third try. His credentials in biology and medicine helped \n     land him a spot on the Columbia mission, which focused on \n     scientific research.\n       Dr. Brown was hooked on space, friends said. He had a \n     telescope in his living room, aimed at the moon. Some nights, \n     he would jump in his single-engine plane and fly the 50 miles \n     from Houston, where he lived, to Galveston to attend \n     astronomy club meetings.\n       ``As we were flying through the night, Dave would point out \n     all the stars and nebula,'' said Dwight Holland, an Air Force \n     pilot and friend. ``He loved it.''\n       Solidly built with wholesome looks, Dr. Brown had never \n     been married. His closest companion was his 14-year-old dog, \n     Duggins, who died two days before the shuttle lifted off.\n       His parents live on a mountaintop in rural Virginia. \n     Yesterday, they shared the last e-mail they received from \n     him.\n       ``My most moving moment was reading a letter that Ilan \n     Ramon brought from a Holocaust survivor whose seven-year-old \n     daughter died,'' Dr. Brown wrote. ``I was stunned\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\n     such a beautiful planet could harbor such bad things.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 2003]\n\nLoss of the Shuttle: The Astronauts; the Columbia Space Shuttle's Crew \n                      of 6 Americans and 1 Israeli\n\n                           (By Timothy Egan)\n\n       Seven astronauts, six Americans and an Israeli, died aboard \n     the shuttle Columbia yesterday.

Col. Michael P. Anderson of the Air Force, the \n     black astronaut who grew up in their town and died on the \n     space shuttle Columbia today. ``These kids, some of them have \n     no hope, and their eyes would light up when they saw this \n     picture,'' said Mr. Watkins, who taught young Michael \n     Anderson in the Sunday school at Morning Star Baptist Church \n     in Spokane.\n       ``This picture said it all--he's black, he's an astronaut--\n     it was a huge motivator,'' Mr. Watkins said in an interview.\n       Born on Christmas Day 1959 in Plattsburgh, N.Y., the son of \n     an Air Force serviceman, Colonel Anderson dreamed of the \n     cosmos, and space flight, from the time he was a boy and got \n     his first toy airplane at age 3.\n       He was a fan of Star Trek, and early on, he memorized the \n     names of most of the American astronauts. He watched the Moon \n     landing when he was a 9-year-old, and the excitement never \n     left him, he said later.\n       He never doubted he would be an astronaut. ``I can't \n     remember ever thinking that I couldn't do it,'' Colonel \n     Anderson said in an interview with the University of \n     Washington alumni newsletter in 1998. ``I never had any \n     serious doubts about it. It was just a matter of when.''\n       But on the eve of his last flight, Colonel Anderson did \n     talk about the risk of space flight.\n       ``There's always that unknown,'' he said to reporters just \n     before the Columbia lifted off on Jan. 16.\n       Colonel Anderson's parents, Bobbie and Barbara Anderson, \n     live in Spokane. The family moved to the area about 30 years \n     ago, friends said, because Bobbie Anderson was assigned to \n     the Fairchild Air Force Base about 25 miles from Spokane. \n     Michael Anderson went to school in Cheney, a farm town next \n     to the base.\n       Today, inside Cheney High School is a plaque and picture of \n     Colonel Anderson, the astronaut who never wavered in his \n     dreams.\n       ``Michael's always been an amazingly strong, focused guy,'' \n     said the Rev. Freeman Simon, who has known the family for \n     about 25 years, and attended the same church with them. ``He \n     is strange in one respect: he was the guy who always seemed \n     to know what he wanted, and could translate his thinking into \n     action.''\n       After Cheney High School, Colonel Anderson got a bachelor \n     of science degree in physics and astronomy at the University \n     of Washington, in Seattle. He earned a master's degree in \n     physics in 1990 at Creighton University.\n       In 1994, while stationed at Plattsburgh Air Force Base, he \n     was chosen for the space shuttle program, one of 19 \n     candidates selected that year from among 2,962 applicants.\n       He was on the Shuttle-Mir docking mission in 1998, when the \n     crew transferred more than 9,000 pounds of scientific \n     equipment and other hardware from the Endeavour to the Mir.\n       He was married to the former Sandra Lynn Hawkins.\n       While Colonel Anderson was a role model in Spokane as one \n     of the few black astronauts, he would have stood out even if \n     he had never gone to space, friends said.\n       ``If you know what the character of an eagle is like, that \n     is Michael Anderson,'' said Mr. Freeman. ``He was an eagle \n     among chickens.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 2003]\n\nLoss of the Shuttle: The Astronauts; the Columbia Space Shuttle's Crew \n                      of 6 Americans and 1 Israeli\n\n                            (By Alan Feuer)\n\n       Seven astronauts, six Americans and an Israeli, died aboard \n     the shuttle Columbia yesterday.

McCool of the Navy, the pilot of the \n     space shuttle Columbia, took off on Jan. 16, he carried a \n     piece of his hometown with him: a spirit towel for the \n     Coronado Mustangs, his high school football team in Lubbock, \n     Tex. Commander McCool, 41, had always been a football fan. He \n     told The Associated Press in an interview that he was rooting \n     for the Oakland Raiders in last Sunday's Super Bowl, having \n     grown up in San Diego.\n       He was an athlete--a runner, swimmer and a back-country \n     camper--and played the guitar and chess. He was even known to \n     play chess via e-mail with crew members of the international \n     space station.\n       He was also something of a cutup, those who knew him said.\n       ``Willie had one of the best senses of humor of any kid \n     you'd ever seen,'' said Ed Jarman, who taught Commander \n     McCool's high school chemistry class. ``He could rig up the \n     most comical ways of explaining scientific principles.''\n       Mr. Jarman said Commander McCool was highly dependable. \n     ``If I needed trash picked up on the school grounds, I'd make \n     him a committee of one.''\n       He had always been interested in joining in the Navy, Mr. \n     Jarman said; his father was a chief petty officer in the \n     Navy.\n       Commander McCool graduated second in his 1983 class at the \n     Naval Academy, where he ran with the cross-country track \n     team.\n       The commander of his mission, Rick D. Husband, was also \n     from Lubbock, and the town was in mourning yesterday.\n       The Columbia mission was Commander McCool's first trip into \n     space. He was an experienced test pilot, one of the Navy's \n     elite airmen, and had logged more than 2,800 flight hours.\n       Commander McCool was chosen by NASA for its astronaut \n     program in 1996 and completed two years of training. He was \n     scheduled for a shuttle mission in June 2001, but it was \n     delayed.\n       Asked then by The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal if the \n     scratched mission troubled him, he was optimistic.\n       ``From a rookie point of view, the delays are probably \n     good,'' he said. ``I feel like going through the training \n     flow essentially a second time a little less like a rookie \n     and a little bit more like a veteran.''\n       In the same interview he said one of the hardest parts of \n     his mission would be working on a split-duty around-the-clock \n     schedule: half of the shuttle crew members worked, while the \n     other half slept.\n       ``I think it's going to be very difficult,'' he said. \n     ``That's why we're focusing now in advance on doing \n     everything very efficiently on time. We hope we can do \n     whatever measures are necessary to get us into bed.''\n       Commander McCool was married and had three sons.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, America and the world watched with equal \nmeasures of shock and sadness on the morning of February 1, as the \nShuttle Columbia was lost and seven heroes perished in the skies over \nTexas.\n  At this most somber of times, we pray for the souls of the seven \nastronauts, as well as the families of those who gave their lives to \nadvance humankind. We also extend our most profound sympathies to all \nIsraelis as they mourn their fallen countryman, the first Israeli \nastronaut. Their boundless joy has turned to the deepest sorrow, and we \nshare in their terrible loss.\n  Today, we remember Rick D. Husband, commander; William C. McCool, \npilot; Michael P. Anderson, payload commander; David M. Brown, mission \nspecialist; Kalpana Chawla, mission specialist; Laura Blair Salton \nClark, mission specialist; and Ilan Ramon, payload specialist. Their \nnames are no longer of the pedestrian Earth, they now belong to the \nages, forever etched in the halls of history.\n  We can scarcely comprehend the dangers which they accepted daily as \nthe price for making a difference in the world. For most of us, we \ncould not imagine a life so punctuated by peril. For them, they could \nnot imagine life in any other form, and it is we who are the \nbeneficiaries of their courage.\n  For those who exist on the vanguard of human endeavor, we reserve our \nhighest regard and greatest respect. For it is they who set new \nstandards by challenging old limits. It is they who embrace the \nultimate risk in exchange for mapping the realm of possibility. We can \nno more place ourselves in their minds and hearts than we can imagine \nwhat it is like to stand on a street corner in a city we have never \nseen. We occupy a different space in the world. But we know and can \nappreciate the fruits of their extraordinary labor, and that is \nprobably all they would ever ask of us.\n  The Space Shuttle Columbia, on mission STS-107, was dedicated to \nresearch in the space, life, and physical sciences. The seven \nastronauts worked around the clock, for 16 days, to carry out studies \nin the areas of astronaut health and safety, advanced technology \ndevelopment, and Earth and space sciences. It is true they carried with \nthem experiments designed to expand the store of human knowledge. But \nthey also carried with them the pride of the United States and Israel, \nand the hopes of the people of our two great nations for a brighter and \nbetter tomorrow.\n  Our hearts are now heavy, but our pride and our hope are not \ndiminished, far from it. Indeed, the spirit represented by Columbia \ncannot be vanquished by such crude and earthly instruments as physics \nor fire. Rather, the spirit embodied by her and her\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\ncrew is of a higher, infinitely more durable plane, where the finest of \nhuman ideals and pursuits never die, but only grow stronger with the \npassing of the days.\n  In moving forward, we must now ascertain what went wrong, and take \nevery conceivable step to ensure it is never repeated for the sake of \nthose who, in the years ahead, will once more ride into the breach of \nspace. As President Bush has said, ``The cause in which they died will \ncontinue. Mankind is led into the darkness beyond our world by the \ninspiration of discovery and the longing to understand. Our journey \ninto space will go on.'' Perhaps that is best way for us to honor the \nmemory of those seven astronauts who never returned from Columbia.\n  Robert F. Kennedy once said, ``There are those who look at things the \nway they are, and ask why . . . I dream of things that never were, and \nask why not?'' That is the credo by which the seven astronauts of \nColumbia lived their lives, and their legacy will be remembered as long \nas greatness is revered.\n  Again, I join with my colleagues and all of America in expressing my \ndeepest appreciation, and my most sincere condolences to the families. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with them. May God grant them strength and \ncomfort as He welcomes home the crew of Columbia.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to mourn \nthe loss of a fellow Wisconsinite, a wife, mother, daughter, sister, \nand friend. This extraordinary woman, Laurel Clark of Racine, WI, was a \nphysician, a Navy Commander, and an astronaut who was flying her first \nspace mission aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia. When that craft broke \napart over the blue Texas sky on Saturday morning, we lost this \nincredible woman and her six crew mates. I extend my deepest sympathy \nto Dr. Clark's husband and son and to her family and friends.\n  Dr. Clark, the oldest of four children, was born in Iowa and grew up \nin Racine, WI. She graduated from William Horlick High School in 1979 \nand went on to attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she \nstudied zoology and was an active member of Gamma Phi Beta Sorority. \nShe earned her undergraduate degree in 1983, and her medical degree, \nalso from the University of Wisconsin, in 1987.\n  Dr. Clark joined the U.S. Navy after medical school and became a \ndiving doctor, participating a number of submarine missions. She was \nselected to train as an astronaut in 1996, and she and her husband \nrelocated to Houston, TX, home of the Johnson Space Center.\n  Dr. Clark's first shuttle mission was postponed several times, and \nafter years of training and anticipation, she and her crewmates lifted \noff from Cape Canaveral on January 16 for a 16-day microgravity \nresearch mission. Aboard the Columbia, Dr. Clark was a mission \nspecialist who conducted numerous medical experiments, often using \nherself as a test subject.\n  An e-mail message that Dr. Clark sent to her brother from space noted \nthat she enjoyed looking down on her home planet and seeing familiar \nsights such as Wind Point on Lake Michigan.\n  Dr. Clark's professional journey took her from the depths of the \nEarth's oceans to the vast reaches of outer space. She truly reached \nfor the stars and made incredible contributions to our country. Dr. \nLaurel Clark and her crewmates were tragically taken from us too soon, \nand we will always treasure her legacy of scientific exploration and \ndiscovery and her commitment to her family, friends, and country.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the men and \nwomen who lost their lives on the space shuttle Columbia and offer my \ncondolences to their families and to the entire NASA community. Like \nall Americans, they are in my thoughts and prayers during this \ndifficult time.\n  Early Saturday morning, the crew of the Columbia was preparing to \nreenter the Earth's atmosphere after a 16-day mission to conduct \nscientific experiments. Five of the seven astronauts were on their \nfirst space flight. By all accounts, the mission had been a success, \nand some of the astronauts jokingly complained to mission controllers \nabout having to come home. The crew included Dr. Kalpana Chawla, a \nmechanical engineer and Indian immigrant, William McCool, a Navy test \npilot, Dr. David Brown, a Navy physician, COL Ilan Ramon, an Israeli \nfighter pilot, Laurel Clark, a Navy flight surgeon, and two veterans of \nthe space program, Mission Commander Rick Husband and Payload Commander \nMichael Anderson. Fourteen minutes into reentry, as the shuttle passed \nthrough the upper atmosphere and reached temperatures as hot as 2,000 \ndegrees, it broke apart above northern Texas, taking these seven \nremarkable individuals down with it.\n  This was a world tragedy as much as it was an American tragedy. The \ncrew of the Columbia reflected our diverse planet as much as it did a \ncross section of America. Dr. Chawla was a hero in her native India, as \nwas COL Ramon in Israel. Both were on their first space flight. \nMillions of people around the world reacted in horror as they watched \nfootage of the Columbia streaking across the Texas sky. They share in \nour deep sense of grief.\n  I am confident we will complete an exhaustive investigation to \ndetermine what went wrong. All questions need to be answered before we \nsend our best and brightest back into space. However, I firmly believe \nthat we must press on. We must continue the exploration of space. I \nhave always supported the space program because I believe it is in the \nbest interests of mankind to unlock the mysteries of life on earth and \nbeyond. The shuttle missions have helped us understand global warming, \nweather patterns, and the effects of weightlessness on the human body, \naided in the understanding of disease, and exponentially increased our \nunderstanding of the universe. It would be impossible to quantify the \nknowledge we have gained from sending men and women into space.\n  Space flight brings out the best in us. It challenges us to think \nbig, to strive for greatness, and to work together to achieve the most \nimportant goals. There is no doubt in my mind that we should continue \nthese missions and prepare the next generation of astronauts for the \nchallenges that lay ahead. To be sure, there is great risk. However, if \nit weren't difficult, if it didn't promise to improve the quality of \nour lives and our understanding of the world, then it wouldn't be worth \ndoing. Yesterday the families of the Columbia 7 issued a statement \nexpressing that sentiment: ``Although we grieve deeply, as do the \nfamilies of Apollo 1 and Challenger before us, the bold exploration of \nspace must go on.''\n  This tragedy has touched each and every one of us. These selfless \nheroes were dedicated to a cause greater then themselves. They were \npassionate about space flight, passionate about their mission, and were \ncommitted to making life better for all of us. They will be missed, and \nthey will never be forgotten.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to include a few words for \nthe Record about the horrible tragedy that our Nation suffered on \nSaturday morning. Our Nation grieves for the brave astronauts that lost \ntheir lives on the Space Shuttle Columbia. My thoughts, and the \nthoughts of all North Dakotans, are with the families and friends of \nthe seven crew members who died in the skies over Texas and Louisiana.\n  Rick Husband, Michael Anderson, Laurel Clark, David Brown, William \nMcCool, Kalpana Chawla, Ilan Ramon. These men and women came from \naround the country and around the world to risk their lives, and \nultimately give their lives, for human space flight and all that it can \noffer. Mr. Ramon was a colonel in the Israeli Air Force. Dr. Chawla was \nan American born in India. The others came together from across the \nUnited States. Their mission was one of cooperation, research, and \ndiscovery. In these troubled times when we talk of war every day, their \nmission was, significantly, a mission of peace.\n  I have always said that, when done right, space exploration can be of \ntremendous benefit to those of us on the ground. The cutting edge \nresearch that NASA conducts in space, including the research performed \nby these seven brave individuals on Columbia, simply could not happen \non the surface of the Earth. Now, we are reminded not only of how \ndifficult and how important this research is, but also just how \ndangerous it is.\n  In my State, we understand this first hand. In North Dakota, we are \nproud to\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\nsay that we have more astronauts per capita than any other State. James \nBuchli, Tony England, and Richard Hieb all hail from North Dakota. One \nof them, Mr. Hieb, flew on Columbia back in 1994.\n  In North Dakota, we are grieving over the loss of the seven members \nof Columbia's last mission. But, I am confident that human space flight \nwill continue even in the wake of this disaster. Across this country, \nand especially at NASA, there is a ``can-do'' attitude that will allow \nus to forge ahead. It is this spirit that will allow us to move forward \nwith resilience after this horrible tragedy.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I wish to \ndiscuss the national tragedy that occurred on Saturday morning and to \npay tribute to the seven brave men and women who lost their lives in \nthe space shuttle Columbia disaster.\n  Just like people around the country, I was beginning my day on \nSaturday and tuning into the news programs when I learned that NASA had \nlost contact with the Shuttle Columbia. I was riveted to the \ndevelopments as they unfolded on television and was devastated when our \nPresident addressed the Nation, announcing what we all suspected at \nthat point, ``The Columbia is lost; There are no survivors.''\n  My heart and prayers go out to the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia \nand their families. While space travel has in some ways become routine \nto the American public, this tragedy is a vivid reminder of the \ninherent risks these brave men and women undertake to pursue the \nboundaries of space and science. On this day, and in the future, they \ndeserve to be remembered for the lives they lived and I hope we will do \nthat.\n  In the days that have followed the tragedy, we have all become \nfamiliar with the backgrounds of the Columbia astronauts. They were men \nand women of such accomplishment and capability that it begins to make \nthe extraordinary seem ordinary, but such a characterization is not \nfair to them. Our astronaut corps continues to attract the best of the \nbest, and to require an unparalleled standard of achievement and \nexcellence. For many shuttle astronauts, the opportunity to participate \nin a shuttle mission is the dream of a lifetime and for all of them, it \nis the culmination of a lifetime of hard work.\n  I remember my excitement as a child, clipping articles about the \nMercury missions and hanging them on the bulletin board in my bedroom. \nToday, Idaho's school children do the same with articles about the \nInternational Space Station and the missions of our space shuttle \nfleet. Many kids follow the progress of various NASA missions in their \nclassrooms. NASA considers this educational outreach a critical, core \nmission and a major purpose for its existence as an agency. In fact, in \na recent meeting I had with NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe, he spent \nmuch of our time together discussing the ways that NASA is working to \nexcite students about math and science. This is vital work. It must \ncontinue.\n  Although Congress and NASA are now getting on with the business of \ninvestigating what went wrong, nothing should deter us from the \nimportant missions of our national space program. I join with my \ncolleagues today in saluting the Columbia astronauts and those at NASA \nwho make it possible for us to explore our universe.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the lives \nof the seven astronauts who gave their lives Saturday when the \nspacecraft Columbia was lost as it returned to Earth. The names of \nthose manning the shuttle will be ingrained in our minds and in our \nhearts: CDR Rick Husband, CDR William McCool, LTC Michael Anderson, CDR \nLaurel Clark, CAPT David Brown, Dr. Kalpana Chawla, and COL Ilan Ramon, \nof the Israeli Air Force.\n  The crew of the Columbia shared a love of flying and a sense of \nadventure that spurred each to strive for excellence and reach for \nspace.\n  CDR Rick Husband knew from the time he was 4 years old and watched \nhis first shuttle launch that he wanted to be an astronaut.\n  He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Force and attended \npilot training at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma. He later served as \na test pilot for all five models of the F-15. Commander Husband logged \nmore than 3,800 hours of flight time in more than 40 types of aircraft.\n  Commander Husband studied mechanical engineering at Fresno State \nUniversity in California through an extension program at nearby Edwards \nAir Force Base. On the flight, Commander Husband carried a Fresno State \nBulldogs sweatshirt, as a memento. He graduated with a master's degree \nin 1990. Four years later, NASA selected Husband as an astronaut \ncandidate.\n  He leaves behind his wife, and his two children.\n  Born in San Diego, CA, CDR William McCool was the son of a Navy and \nMarine aviator who built model airplanes as a youngster.\n  Commander McCool studied aerospace engineering at the U.S. Naval \nAcademy, and was elected captain of the cross-country running team his \nsenior year. He graduated second in his class from the Naval Academy.\n  Commander McCool received a master's degree in computer science from \nthe University of Maryland in 1985 and a master's in aeronautical \nengineering at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1992.\n  He attended flight school in Pensacola, FL, and worked as a test \npilot at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in southern Maryland.\n  Commander McCool leaves behind a wife and two children.\n  LTC Michael Anderson always dreamed of space flight and once said \nthat he could not remember a time when he did not want to be an \nastronaut.\n  He graduated from the University of Washington in 1981 with a degree \nin physics and astronomy and, following in his father's footsteps, was \ncommissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Force.\n  While stationed at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska in 1990, \nAnderson earned a master's degree in physics from Omaha's Creighton \nUniversity.\n  In 1994, he was selected to join NASA as a potential future \nastronaut. In January 1998, he made his first flight, aboard the space \nshuttle Endeavour, traveling 3.6 million miles during 138 orbits of the \nEarth to reach the Mir space station.\n  LTC Michael Anderson leaves behind his wife and two daughters.\n  CDR Laurel Clark always excelled at school, and her classmates \nremember her for her fun-loving and adventurous spirit.\n  After Commander Clark graduated from the University of Wisconsin-\nMadison, she joined the Navy to pay her way through medical school, but \nstayed with the Navy for the series of adventures it offered her in her \ncareer.\n  While in the Navy, Commander Clark became a submarine medical \nofficer, dove with Navy SEALS in Scotland, and earned her flight \nsurgeon's wings before finally applying to NASA for astronaut training.\n  While orbiting the Earth, Commander Clark remarked on the beauty of \nwatching sunsets from space.\n  She leaves behind her husband and her son.\n  CAPT David Brown loved to fly kites as a child, and would gaze at the \nstars with friends from a backyard telescope.\n  Captain Brown grew up in Arlington, VA, and earned a bachelor's \ndegree in biology from the College of William and Mary, where he worked \ntwo jobs so he could take flying lessons.\n  He then earned a medical degree from Eastern Virginia Medical School \nin Norfolk, before joining the Navy.\n  Captain Brown served as a flight surgeon in the Navy and joined NASA \nin 1996.\n  His family and friends remember him as a person who ``grabbed life,'' \nsaying that he could and did accomplish anything he set out to do.\n  Dr. Kalpana Chawla fell in love with the idea of flying as a young \ngirl in India.\n  She graduated from the Tagore Bal Niketan School in her small \nhometown of Karnal and then got a bachelor's degree in aeronautical \nengineering from Punjab Engineering College.\n  She left India for the United States, earning a master's degree from \nthe University of Texas and a doctorate in aerospace engineering from \nthe University of Colorado.\n  Dr. Chawla then worked as a scientist at the NASA Ames research \nlaboratory in California before joining the astronaut program in 1995.\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\n  Dr. Chawla was a member of the West Valley Flying Club in Palo Alto \nwho loved doing aerial acrobatics over the Bay Area.\n  She leaves behind her husband.\n  COL Ilan Ramon was a bona fide combat hero in Israel, flying missions \nin the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and the Lebanon war in 1982.\n  In recent days, he lifted the spirits of his country, becoming a \nnational hero as the first Israeli in space.\n  As a pilot, Colonel Ramon clocked more than 4,000 hours in combat \naircraft, and was an F-16 squadron commander.\n  Aboard the Columbia, one of Ramon's scientific experiments involved \ntracking sandstorms in the Sahara Desert, and studying their impact on \nclimate and environment.\n  He leaves behind his wife and four children.\n  Each of the astronauts knew the risks involved in space flight. But \nthey took those risks willingly in order to follow their dreams, \nknowing that their mission was a noble one of science and discovery.\n  What remains for us, as a nation, is to determine the cause of this \ntragedy, make adjustments so that it will not happen again, and \ncontinue the exploration of space.\n  NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe has already assigned several internal \nunits to investigate the loss of the Columbia, including a ``Mishap \nResponse Team'' and a ``Contingency Action Team.''\n  In addition, Administrator O'Keefe announced the formation of an \nindependent board led by Harold W. Gehman, who cochaired the probe of \nthe October 2000 terrorist attack on the USS Cole in Yemen.\n  I think that the way NASA has acted in the past few days is a marked \nimprovement to the way the investigation into the 1986 Challenger \nexplosion was handled.\n  Information has been disseminated quickly, which gives me hope that a \nfair and prompt investigation will yield the causes for the loss of the \nColumbia.\n  The space program must continue. The American legacy is filled with \nstories of exploration, and the desire to push new frontiers to the \nlimit.\n  There is so much to learn from space. This tragedy will not stifle \nthe desire to acquire all the potential knowledge we could gain as a \ncountry, and as a planet, from exploration beyond Earth.\n  The risks, however, will always be present. In a way, space \nexploration means continually breaking new ground, and taking those \nrisks.\n  The hardest part of these losses, is the human loss. The astronauts \naboard the Columbia were men and women at their prime. They put their \nhearts and souls into this mission, were the best and brightest of \ntheir peers, and still this catastrophe befell them.\n  My heart goes out to the families that the crew of the Space Shuttle \nColumbia left behind. As we search for the reasons this tragedy \noccurred, it cannot be forgotten that each member was a son or \ndaughter, a mother or father, a brother or sister, a dear friend. The \nthoughts and prayers of the American people, and of the world, are with \nthem as they endure the pain of this loss.\n  The crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia embodied the human desire to \nexplore, to reach, and to dream. Their courage, idealism, and \nenthusiasm for discovery are hallmarks of the American spirit which \nshould be remembered and celebrated, even as we grieve their loss.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, twice now we have witnessed the \nhorror of vapor trails separating in the sky.\n  Twice now we have gazed in shock at photographs of the optimistic \nfaces of seven young heroes, captured as they stood at the brink of one \nof mankind's greatest adventures.\n  Twice now we have endured the loss of a space shuttle and its valiant \ncrew: First, Challenger on January 28, 1986, at the start of a landmark \nvoyage dedicated to teaching a new generation about space. Now, 17 \nyears and 4 days later, Columbia on February 1, 2003, at the conclusion \nof a successful scientific mission.\n  Both incidents remind us that space exploration is fraught with risk, \nbut also with limitless possibility. Even as we mourn the loss of \nColumbia's crew of seven brave heroes, including the first astronaut \nfrom Israel, we must rededicate ourselves to continuing to pursue \nknowledge of the heavens and the benefits we derive from our research.\n  We in Florida feel the losses most intensely. My State is home to the \nKennedy Space Center and thousands of the dedicated professionals who \nwork for NASA as well as its contractors. Floridians consider ourselves \npart of the special family that makes up the space program. We launched \nthe Columbia on its 16-day mission, and we were ready to welcome her \ncrew home.\n  Now, Floridians are firm in our belief that, just as we did in the \n1980s, we must fully explore the causes of Saturday's disaster. We must \nidentify what went wrong and fix it. We must ensure the safety of the \nremaining three orbiters and future astronauts.\n  But then we recommit ourselves to returning to space, to resuming \nlaunches, to continuing to build the International Space Station, and \nto forging ahead with missions to Mars and other planets.\n  We are already hearing cautious voices calling for spacecraft to be \npiloted by robots, or even insisting that no new money be spent on \nspace. I say that is wrong. On May 25, 1961, when President John F. \nKennedy declared it a national goal to land a man on the Moon, he did \nso with these words: ``If we are to go only half way, or reduce our \nsights in the face of difficulty, in my judgment it would be better not \nto go at all.''\n  In the spirit of John Glenn, Neil Armstrong, and our other space \npioneers, astronauts must once again be sent soaring through the \nEarth's atmosphere to explore and discover.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1864-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ALLEN.

Mr. President, last week the Violence Policy Center \nreleased a report entitled ``Just Like Bird Hunting: The Threat to \nCivil Aviation From .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.'' This report discusses \nthe range and power of the .50 caliber sniper rifle and its ammunition, \nand highlights the potential threat this weapon poses to airports and \naircraft. The idea that terrorists can legally obtain these weapons \nshould shake us up and force us to act immediately.\n  The .50 caliber sniper rifle is among the most powerful weapons \nlegally available. According to the VPC's report, a .50 caliber sniper \nrifle is capable of accurately hitting a target over a thousand yards \naway and the ammunition available for the .50 caliber includes armor-\npiercing, incendiary and explosive bullets. The report also cites the \nU.S. Army's manual on urban combat which states that .50 caliber sniper \nrifles are designed to attack bulk fuel tanks and other high-value \ntargets from a distance, using ``their ability to break through all but \nthe thickest shielding material.''\n  One of the most disturbing parts of the report comes from the leading \nmanufacturer of .50 caliber sniper rifles, Barrett Firearms. According \nto the VPC report, a brochure advertising the .50 caliber sniper rifle \nstates, ``The cost-effectiveness of the Model 82A1 cannot be \noveremphasized when a round of ammunition purchased for less than \n10USD--U.S. Dollars--can be used to destroy or disable a modern jet \naircraft.''\n  I believe the easy availability and the increased popularity of the \n.50 caliber sniper rifle poses a danger to homeland security, as well \nas airline safety. That's why last year I cosponsored Senator \nFeinstein's Military Sniper Weapon Regulation Act. This bill would \nchange the way .50 caliber guns are regulated by placing them under the \nrequirements of the National Firearms Act. This would subject these \nweapons to the same regimen of registration and background checks as \nother weapons of war, such as machine guns. This is a necessary step to \nassuring the safety of Americans.\n  The .50 caliber sniper rifle is among the most powerful, and least \nregulated, firearms legally available. Tighter regulation is needed. If \nSenator Feinstein's bill is reintroduced, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1865-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1865-S1866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF DR. F. MARIAN BISHOP\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to a \nwonderful Utah doctor, F. Marian Bishop, Ph.D., M.S.P.H, who has \ndedicated her life to the practice of family medicine. Her shining \nexample of service and dedication to the health and well being of \npeople across America is truly extraordinary.\n  Dr. Bishop was recently named the recipient of the John G. Walsh \nAward by the American Academy of Family Physicians, AFP, because of her \ndedicated, long-term commitment to furthering the development of family \npractice. This award is one of the highest honors presented by the \nAcademy.\n  In addition, Dr. Bishop has also received the United States Public \nHealth Service Director's Award from the National Health Service Corps \nin 1990; the 2001 Women Who Make A Difference Award from the \nInternational Women's Forum; and in 2000 the Society of Teachers of \nFamily Medicine, STFM, Foundation created the F. Marian Bishop Scholars \nprogram to benefit future students.\n  Dr. Bishop is currently a professor and chairman emeritus of the \nDepartment of Family and Preventative Medicine at the University of \nUtah. The knowledge and enthusiasm she has shared with countless \nstudents have been felt by many and have helped provide the impetus for \nmany future family practitioners.\n  Dr. Bishop is a tireless advocate for the development of family \npractice and has served in many positions to further promote this \nwonderful field of medicine. She has assumed leadership positions for \nthe Department of Health and\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\nHuman Services in several areas including: peer review; Area Health \nEducation Centers; title VII health professions; and the External \nAdvisory Panel for Primary Care. She was instrumental in developing the \nCommittee for the Departments of Family Medicine Grant Reviews and \nchaired the National Advisory Council on Health Professions Education. \nShe is currently serving as the vice president for the Council on \nGraduate Medical Education for the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration.\n  She has also served in many capacities in Utah State government \nincluding as: a member of the Utah Task Force on Rural Health Policy \nDevelopment, chairwoman of the Rural Medical Financial Assistance \nCommittee, and a member of the Preventive Health Care Services \nTechnical Advisory Group for the Utah Health Policy Commission.\n  I am also particularly grateful for the service Dr. Bishop has given \nme as a member of my Utah Women's Advisory Committee. She has been a \nvaluable asset on this committee providing me with input and excellent \nideas concerning women's health issues.\n  Dr. Bishop can also add author to her long list of accomplishments. \nShe has published several important articles in such prestigious \npublications as: the British Journal of Medical Education, the Journal \nof Practical Nursing, the Journal of Community Health, and the Textbook \nof Family Practice. She is currently serving as the chairwoman for the \nAmerican Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n  Sadly, Dr. Bishop is now battling her own personal health crisis. I \nsincerely hope she is able to draw upon the strength and courage she \nimparted to the many people she touched throughout her medical and \nteaching career to ease her own pain and suffering. The service she has \nso unselfishly given to students, patients, and the medical community \nis exemplary and the contributions she made to the field of family \npractice will be felt for years to come. I am grateful for the \nopportunity today to honor this wonderful doctor, mother, and woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1866-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HONORING CINDY DWYER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask that the following statement \nfrom our former colleague, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, be printed \nin the Record. Senator Kerrey is providing this statement concerning a \nformer member of his Senate staff who is presently serving as my \nscheduler.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We Americans have been taught to believe our share of \n     myths. Myths are not lies; they are, like George Washington's \n     decision to tell the truth about a fallen cherry tree, \n     stories with a purpose. The purpose, however, is not always \n     benign. Malignant myths have their roots in the soil of \n     despair. They are told by those who do not believe in the \n     possibility of human beings being motivated by the desire to \n     do good.\n       Among the most destructive of cynical myths is that people \n     who work for politicians are old corrupt hacks who only care \n     about keeping their bosses in power. Cindy Dwyer is living \n     evidence that the cynics are wrong, and what is most \n     wonderful about Washington, DC, is that her story is not \n     unique.\n       Cindy was 20 years old and a junior in college when she \n     volunteered for a Senate campaign in South Dakota. Her \n     candidate won and she went back to school. When she finished, \n     her candidate, now a Senator, called to offer her a job. \n     Cindy rolled the dice and said yes.\n       In the Senator's office she met and became friends with a \n     legislative assistant by the name of Tom Daschle. She stayed \n     for a few years and then moved back to South Dakota to teach \n     kindergarten. Not long after settling back into private life \n     her legislative assistant friend called to say he was running \n     for Congress. He offered her a job in his campaign. Tom \n     Daschle won that race and Cindy raced back to DC where she \n     served as his scheduler. When Tom made a successful run for \n     Senate in 1986, she moved over to his Senate office to become \n     his press secretary.\n       And that is where I come into her story. In late 1987 I \n     decided I would become a candidate for U.S. Senate. I had \n     learned enough to know that my most important hire would be \n     the person who did my scheduling and I learned that Cindy \n     just might be willing to join our campaign. Fortunately for \n     me and unfortunately for my opponent Cindy said yes. And, \n     when the campaign was over I asked her to move to Washington \n     one more time.\n       For the 12 years I served Nebraskans in the Senate she \n     managed my most valuable commodity: my time. She helped me do \n     my job much better than I could have without her. She \n     extended my reach, increased the scope of my vision, and \n     broadened the number of volunteer partners at home. She never \n     failed to return a phone call. She could say no and make it \n     sound like yes. She wouldn't leave the office until my plane \n     was safely on the ground. If her salary were calculated by \n     the hour, she would have been among the lowest paid people in \n     the American workforce.\n       But Cindy, like most of the other young people in \n     Washington, does not do what she does in order to reap \n     financial rewards. She does what she does because she loves \n     our country, wants to make it a better place, seeks to \n     increase citizen confidence that our Government is ``of, by \n     and for the people,'' and thinks her greatest accomplishments \n     were when she used the power of the office for the good of \n     just one person in trouble.\n       It seems a perfect ending to a heroic story that Cindy went \n     to work for Senator Tim Johnson and helped him win one of the \n     most difficult campaigns in 2002. So it is that she will \n     spend her last day doing the same thing she did on her first: \n     working for the people of South Dakota. It is just as perfect \n     that in many ways Cindy's nearly 28 years of service in \n     Congress were spent doing many of the same things she did \n     when she taught preschool and kindergarten. Members of \n     Congress were behaving like children long before \n     psychiatrists recommended that we get in tough with our inner \n     child.\n       Cindy Dwyer always stayed in touch with her inner teacher. \n     She mentored every young staffer who had the good fortune to \n     fall under her authority. She never hoarded her good advice \n     or good wishes. She took delight when others learned from her \n     and succeeded because of it. Most importantly Cindy gave \n     delight to anyone who spoke with her on the phone. For no \n     gift can match the jolt of good news from her joyful voice \n     shouting out: ``How are you doing?''\n       The answer, is that thanks to Cindy we are doing just \n     fine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1866-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1866-S1867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IN RECOGNITION OF THE EFFORTS OF THE DELAWARE MENTORING COUNCIL\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the good \nwork of the Delaware Mentoring Council and to celebrate the efforts of \nmentors across our great country. With the designation of January as \nNational Mentoring Month, we focus national attention on the need for \nmentors, as well as how each of us--individuals, businesses, schools \nand community groups--can work together to increase the number of \nmentors and assure brighter futures for our young people.\n  Mentors serve as role models, advocates, friends, and advisors. \nNumerous studies document that mentors help young people augment social \nskills, enhance emotional well-being, improve cognitive skills, and \nplan for the future. For some children, having a caring adult mentor to \nturn to for guidance and encouragement can make the crucial difference \nbetween success and failure in life.\n  Delaware has been showing communities across the country the power of \nmentoring for quite a while. Mentoring has become an integral part of \nour school system in Delaware and is one of the keys to improving \nacademic achievement among at-risk students.\n  As Governor, I helped recruit thousands of mentors as part of a \nstatewide effort and was actively involved in recruiting individuals, \nchurches, service clubs, students, and corporations to help in \nmentoring Delaware's at-risk children. I first experienced the joy of \nmentoring in 1997 when I became a mentor to Darryl Burton, a fifth \ngrader at Wilmington's Warner Elementary School. More than 5 years \nlater, we now meet at Delcastle High School, where he is a freshman, \nevery week during the school year. I know from personal experience that \nthere are few things more rewarding than making a difference in the \nlife of a child. Literally hundreds of mentors have said to me of their \nmentoring experience over the past 6 years, ``I know I'm helping the \nyoung person that I mentor, but I get even more out of it than they \ndo.''\n  We are making great strides in the First State in helping thousands \nof additional students realize their full potential, along with \nDelaware's rigorous academic standards. The Delaware Mentoring Council \nis, in large part, leading the way. We must continue to work to level \nthe playing field and give every child the tools they need to succeed \nin school and in life.\n  I am proud to be part of Delaware's army of mentors. We know that \nthere are thousands of other students in our schools who would benefit \ngreatly from\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\nhaving another positive role model in their lives, so I urge others to \njoin us. For a child living in the shadows of life, an hour of our time \ncan make a lifetime of difference for that child and for each of \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1867-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY 2002 FOOTBALL PROGRAM\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, we rise today to ask the Senate to \njoin us in recognizing the accomplishments of the 2002 Football Program \nat Boise State University (BSU), in our home State of Idaho. Senator \nLarry Craig, Congressman Mike Simpson, Congressman C.L. ``Butch'' \nOtter, and I wish to honor the players, Head Coach Dan Hawkins, his \nentire staff, the administrators of BSU, the Bronco Athletic \nAssociation, and the thousands of BSU fans for the outstanding season. \nThe Broncos of BSU have excelled in both academics and sportsmanship. \nThe team is a source of pride for the university, the city of Boise, \nand the entire State of Idaho.\n  The Broncos began the season with optimism and commitment; their hard \nwork was rewarded by the following accomplishments:\n  2002 Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Champions; 8 wins and no \nlosses in the WAC; an overall record of 12 wins and only 1 loss; the \nhighest overall margin of victory in the history of the WAC of 37.2 \npoints per game; Humanitarian Bowl Champions with a 34 to 16 win over \nIowa State University; #1 team in the Nation in team scoring; #1 team \nin the Nation in total offense; #1 team in the Nation in passing \nefficiency; #17 team in the Nation in scoring defense; ranked #15 in \nthe Nation in the AP Poll; ranked #12 in the Nation in the ESPN/USA \nToday Coaches Poll, and Second longest current winning streak in the \ncountry, second only to National Champion Ohio State University.\n  Through service, the BSU Broncos have taken the energy they generate \non the field and spread it throughout the Boise community. Mentoring \nchildren, hosting youth football camps, and visiting the Ronald \nMcDonald House are just a few examples of how the BSU Football Program \nbenefits Idaho.\n  We recognize the extraordinary progress and development of the BSU \nfootball program and look to its success as an example of what can be \naccomplished with leadership, commitment, determination, and, most \nimportantly, teamwork.\n  We congratulate the football program of Boise State University for \nthe achievements made and look forward to future success and a strong \ndefense of its conference title.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1867-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1867-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1867-4", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1867-S1868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BUDGET MESSAGE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004--PM 8\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January \n30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986, received on \nFebruary 3, 2003; to the Committees on Appropriations; and the Budget:\n\n\n                  THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The budget for 2004 meets the challenges posed by three national \npriorities: winning the war against terrorism, securing the homeland, \nand generating long-term economic growth. It restrains the growth in \nfederal spending and addresses the long-term fiscal challenges \npresented by Medicare and Social Security's unfunded promises. This \nyear's budget also helps America meet its goals both at home and \noverseas.\n  We remain at war with an enemy that seeks to use murder, stealth, and \nfear against all free nations. Yet our response has been resolute. The \npeople of Afghanistan have been freed from the oppressive regime that \nsponsors the terrorists who planned and carried out the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. We are hunting down the terrorist leaders and their \ncollaborators, one by one. And we continue to disrupt their plots, shut \ndown their financing, and deny them safe haven.\n  We have moved to secure the nation's safety. Just 10 days ago, the \nnew Department of Homeland Security began operations in the biggest \nreorganization of the Federal Government in a half-century. The \ncabinet-level department unifies the work of 22 programs and agencies \nand will move quickly to better protect Americans from threats here at \nhome. We also have moved to defend America's interests abroad, and to \nconfront danger wherever it emerges. Working with our allies and \npartners, we will face down regimes that govern by fear and deception, \nand we will devote the necessary resources to protect ourselves and our \nfriends against the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n  We are strengthening our economy by allowing American families to \nkeep more of their own money and encouraging businesses to save, spend, \nand grow. While the economy is growing, it is not growing fast enough. \nToo many Americans who want to work can't find a job, and too many \nAmerican families are falling behind.\n  The growth and jobs plan I outlined earlier this year will provide \ncritical momentum to our economic recovery. For every American paying \nincome taxes, I propose speeding up the tax cuts already approved by \nthe Congress, because Americans need that relief today. And for \nAmerica's 84 million investors, and those who will become investors, I \npropose eliminating the double taxation of stock dividends. Double \ntaxation is unfair and bad for our economy.\n  Government cannot manage or control the economy. But government can \nremove the barriers blocking stronger economic growth. My plan will \ngive Americans more tools to achieve that growth.\n  A recession and a war we did not choose have led to the return of \ndeficits. My administration firmly believes in controlling the deficit \nand reducing it as the economy strengthens and our national security \ninterests are met. Compared to the overall federal budget and the $10.5 \ntrillion national economy, our budget gap is small by historical \nstandards. By protecting our vital national security interests and \npromoting economic growth, we will meet the challenges and concerns of \nthe American people. We will not let them down.\n  I will also insist on spending discipline in Washington, D.C., so we \ncan meet our priorities. We must prepare for the future costs of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. My budget takes the first steps toward \nmodernizing Medicare and includes prescription drug coverage.\n  We will continue to focus on getting results from federal spending. A \nfederal program's measure of success is not its size, but the value it \ndelivers. And my budget will focus on this goal in a new and important \nway. If federal programs cannot show results, they should be \noverhauled, or retired.\n  And while human compassion cannot be summarized in dollars and cents, \nthis budget addresses the many challenges our society faces: bridging \nthe gap for low-income families, so they can buy affordable homes; \nhelping communities of faith pull the addicted from the grip of drugs; \nlifting children out of poverty and hopelessness by creating good \nschools and offering them caring adult mentors; and easing the pain and \nhardship of the global epidemic of AIDS.\n  Some of the challenges we face will endure for many years and require \ngreat resources. As we look down that path, we will not always get to \nchoose which battles we fight. It is, however, our duty to fight them. \nHistory may not remember every single way we contributed to this \nnation's betterment, but it will remember if we failed to try. The \ncourage to take on challenges, and the enterprise with which we have \nsucceeded in meeting them, have always distinguished America. This same \ncourage and enterprise will help America\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\nmeet these challenges, and prevail once again.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to provide for the expeditious completion of the \nacquistion of land owned by the State of Wyoming within the boundaries \nof Grand Teton National Park, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today to \nauthorize the exchange of State lands inside Grand Teton National Park.\n  Grand Teton National Park was established by Congress on February 29, \n1929, to protect the natural resources of the Teton range and recognize \nthe Jackson area's unique beauty. On March 15, 1943, President Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt established the Jackson Hole National Monument \nadjacent to the park. Congress expanded the Park on September 14, 1950, \nby including a portion of the lands from the Jackson Hold National \nMonument. The park currently encompasses approximately 310,000 acres of \nwilderness and has some of the most amazing mountain scenery anywhere \nin our country. This park has become an extremely important element of \nthe National Park system, drawing almost 2.7 million visitors in 1999.\n  When Wyoming became a State in 1890, sections of land were set aside \nfor school revenue purposes. All income from these lands--rents, \ngrazing fees, sales or other sources--is placed in a special trust fund \nfor the benefit of students in the State. The establishment of these \nsections predates the creation of most national parks or monuments \nwithin our State boundaries, creating several State inholdings on \nfederal land. The legislation I am introducing today would allow the \nFederal Government to remove the State school trust lands from Grand \nTeton National Park and allow the State to capture fair value for this \nproperty to benefit Wyoming school children.\n  This bill, entitled the ``Grand Teton National Park Land Exchange \nAct,'' identifies approximately 1406 acres of State lands and mineral \ninterests within the boundaries of Grand Teton National Park for \nexchange for Federal assets. These federal assets could include mineral \nroyalties, appropriated dollars, Federal lands or combination of any of \nthese elements.\n  The bill also identifies an appraisal process for the State and \nFederal Government to determine a fair value of the State property \nlocated within the park boundaries. After the bill is signed into law, \nthe land would be valued by one of the following methods: 1. the \nInterior Secretary and Governor would mutually agree on a qualified \nappraiser to conduct the appraisal of the State lands in the park; 2. \nIf there is no agreement about the appraiser, the Interior Secretary \nand Governor would each designate a qualified appraiser. The two \ndesignated appraisers would select a third appraiser to perform the \nappraisal with the advice and assistance of the designated appraisers.\n  If the Interior Secretary and Governor cannot agree on the \nevaluations of the State lands 180 days after the date of enactment, \nthe Governor may petition the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to determine \nthe final value. One-hundred-eighty days after the State land value is \ndetermined, the Interior Secretary, in consultation with the Governor, \nshall exchange Federal assets of equal value for the state lands.\n  The management of our public lands and natural resources is often \ncomplicated and requires the coordination of many individuals to \naccomplish desired objectives. When western folks discuss federal land \nissues, we do not often have an opportunity to identify proposals that \ncapture this type of consensus and enjoy the support from a wide array \nof interests; however, this land exchange offers just such a unique \nprospect.\n\n[[Page S1873]]\n\n  This legislation is needed to improve the management of Grand Teton \nNational Park, by protecting the future of these unique lands against \ndevelopment pressures and allow the State of Wyoming to access their \nassets to address public school funding needs.\n  This bill enjoys the support of many different groups including the \nNational Park Service, the Wyoming Governor, State officials, as well \nas folks from the local community. During the 107th Congress the Senate \npassed this exact same legislation three separate times unanimously. \nUnfortunately, due to complications unrelated to the bill was not able \nto be sent to the President for signature and enactment. It is my hope \nthat the Senate, and the Congress, will seize this opportunity to \nimprove upon efforts to provide services to the American public.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the procedures that apply to consideration of \ninterstate class actions to assure fairer outcomes for class members \nand defendants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Class \nAction Fairness Act of 2003, a bill that will help curb class action \nlawsuit abuse. For the last several Congresses, Senators Kohl, Hatch \nand others have joined me in introducing this important measure. Over \nthe years, we have held several hearings on the numerous abuses of the \nclass action system and the urgent need for reform. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee marked up and reported a similar class action bill \nin the 106th Congress, and in the 107th Congress the Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on class action abuse. This bi-partisan bill \nhas garnered increasing support over the years, and I look forward to \neven greater support in this Congress.\n  Abuses of the class action system abound. Specifically, class action \ncases have proven to be an easy way for attorneys to make millions of \ndollars while the plaintiff class members receive little or nothing of \nvalue. We all are familiar with the many class action lawsuits where \nplaintiffs were awarded nothing or coupons of limited value, while the \nlawyers got all the money in attorney's fees. Everyone of us has found \nourselves to have been a potential member of a plaintiff class in a \nclass action lawsuit, and for those of us who are not lawyers, it has \nbeen impossible to know what our rights are or whether we are being \nserved the attorneys we never hired in the first place.\n  In addition, most class action lawsuits are being filed in state \ncourts, even though these are usually the cases that involve the most \nmoney, have nationwide implications, and implicate citizens from all 50 \nStates. Lawyers often game the system so they can bring lawsuits in \nState courts, which are more likely to certify class actions without \nadequately considering whether a class action would be fair to all \nclass members. In some instances, class lawyers manipulate pleadings to \navoid removal of the lawsuit to the federal courts. To do this, lawyers \nmay claim that their clients suffered under $75,000 in damages so that \nthe Federal threshold isn't triggered, even though their clients may \nhave suffered an even greater injury. Class lawyers also sometimes \ndefeat the complete diversity requirement by ensuring that at least one \nnamed class member is from the same state as a defendant, even if every \nother class member is from a different state.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act of 2003 will go a long way toward \nending some of these abuses. This modest bill carefully fixes the more \negregious problems with the class action system, while preserving class \naction lawsuits as an important tool which brings representation to the \nunrepresented.\n  First, our bill requires that notice of proposed settlements in all \nclass actions, as well as all class notices, must be in clear, easily \nunderstood English and must include all material settlement terms, \nincluding amount and source of attorneys' fees. The notices most \nplaintiffs receive are written in small print and confusing legal \njargon. In fact, a lawyer testified before my Subcommittee that even he \ncould not understand the notice he received as a plaintiff in a class \naction lawsuit. Since plaintiffs are giving up their right to sue, it \nis imperative that they understand what they are doing and the \nramifications of their actions.\n\n  Second, our bill requires that State attorneys general be notified of \nany proposed class settlement that would affect residents of their \nStates. The notice would give a State attorney general the opportunity \nto object if the settlement terms are unfair to consumers.\n  Third, our bill disallows bounty payments to lead plaintiffs so \nlawyers looking for victims can't promise them unwarranted payoffs to \nbe their excuse\n\n[[Page S1874]]\n\nfor filing suit. It also prevents settlements that discriminate based \non geography, so that one plaintiff doesn't receive more money just \nbecause he lives near the courthouse.\n  Fourth, our bill requires that courts scrutinize settlements where \nthe plaintiffs get only coupons or non-cash awards, and the lawyers get \nmoney. The courts are required to make a written finding that the \nsettlement is fair and reasonable for class members. A court will still \nbe able to find that a non-cash settlement, like in the case of \ninjunctive relief banning some type of bad conduct, is fair and \nreasonable. But courts would be able to throw out sham settlements \nwhere the lawyers get big paychecks but the plaintiffs get nothing but \ncoupons.\n  Finally, our bill allows more class action lawsuits to be removed \nfrom state court to federal court, either by a defendant or an unnamed \nclass member. A class action would qualify for federal jurisdiction if \nthe total damages exceed $2,000,000 and parties include citizens from \nmultiple States. Currently, class lawyers can avoid removal if \nindividual claims are for $75,000 or less, even if hundreds of millions \nof dollars in total are at stake, or if just one class member is from \nthe same State as a defendant. But if a case really belongs in state \ncourt because it's a State-law question or the substantial majority of \nclass members and defendants are in-State, the case will stay in state \ncourt.\n  We need class action reform badly. Both plaintiffs and defendants are \ncalling for change in this area. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2003 \nis a good, modest bill that will help curb the many problems that have \nplagued the class action system.\n  This bill will remove the conflict of interest that lawyers face in \nclass action lawsuits, and will ensure the fair settlement of these \ncases. This bill will preserve the process, but put a stop to the more \negregious abuses. I urge all my colleagues to join Senators Kohl, \nHatch, Carper, Specter, Chafee, Lugar, Miller and I in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Class action lawsuits are an important and valuable \n     part of the legal system when they permit the fair and \n     efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties \n     by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action \n     against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.\n       (2) Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the \n     class action device that have--\n       (A) harmed class members with legitimate claims and \n     defendants that have acted responsibly;\n       (B) adversely affected interstate commerce; and\n       (C) undermined public respect for our judicial system.\n       (3) Class members often receive little or no benefit from \n     class actions, and are sometimes harmed, such as where--\n       (A) counsel are awarded large fees, while leaving class \n     members with coupons or other awards of little or no value;\n       (B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at \n     the expense of other class members; and\n       (C) confusing notices are published that prevent class \n     members from being able to fully understand and effectively \n     exercise their rights.\n       (4) Abuses in class actions undermine the national judicial \n     system, the free flow of interstate commerce, and the concept \n     of diversity jurisdiction as intended by the framers of the \n     United States Constitution, in that State and local courts \n     are--\n       (A) keeping cases of national importance out of Federal \n     court;\n       (B) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against \n     out-of-State defendants; and\n       (C) making judgments that impose their view of the law on \n     other States and bind the rights of the residents of those \n     States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members \n     with legitimate claims;\n       (2) restore the intent of the framers of the United States \n     Constitution by providing for Federal court consideration of \n     interstate cases of national importance under diversity \n     jurisdiction; and\n       (3) benefit society by encouraging innovation and lowering \n     consumer prices.\n\n      SEC. 3.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply to any civil \n     action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Grassley and Kohl, S. 274, the ``Class Action \nFairness Act of 2003.''\n  Over the past decade, it has become clear that abuses of the class \naction system have reached epidemic levels. In recent years, it has \nbecome equally clear that the ultimate victims of this epidemic are \npoorly-represented class members and individual consumers throughout \nthe Nation. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2003 represents a modest, \nmeasured effort to remedy the plague of abuses, inconsistencies, and \ninefficiencies that infest our current system of class action \nlitigation.\n  It is essential that we address the abuses that are running rampant \nin our current class action litigation system. Frequently, plaintiff \nclass members are not adequately informed of their rights or of the \nterms and practical implications of a proposed settlement. Too often \njudges approve settlements that primarily benefit the class counsel, \nrather than the class members. There are numerous examples of \nsettlements where class members receive little or nothing, while \nattorneys receive millions of dollars in fees. Multiple class\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\naction suits asserting the same claims on behalf of the same plaintiffs \nare routinely filed in different State courts, causing judicial \ninefficiencies and encouraging collusive settlement behavior. And State \ncourts are more frequently certifying national classes leading to \nrulings that infringe upon or conflict with the established laws and \npolicies of other states.\n  Despite the mountains of evidence demonstrating the drastically \nincreasing harms caused by class action abuses, I am sure that some \nwill attempt to deny the existence of any problem at all. Others will \ntry to confuse the issue with spurious claims that proposed reforms \nwould somehow disadvantage victims with legitimate claims or further \nworsen class action abuses. Others may even contend that past \nlegislative reforms have contributed to recent financial debacles and \nthat the proposed reforms will encourage more. Such claims are nothing \nmore than red herrings intended to divert the debate from the real \nissues.\n  In this regard let me emphasize a few points regarding S. 274. First, \nthis bill does not seek to eliminate State court class action \nlitigation. Class action suits brought in State courts have proven in \nmany contexts to be an effective and desirable tool for protecting \ncivil and consumer rights. Nor do the reforms we will discuss today in \nany way diminish the rights or practical ability of victims to band \ntogether to pursue their claims against large corporations. In fact, we \nhave included several consumer protection provisions in our legislation \nthat I feel strongly will substantially improve plaintiffs' chances of \nachieving a fair result in any settlement proposal.\n  There are three key components to S. 274. First, the bill implements \nconsumer protections against abusive settlements by: No. 1. requiring \nsimplified notices that explain to class members the terms of proposed \nclass action settlements and their rights with respect to the proposed \nsettlement in ``plain English''; No. 2. enhancing judicial scrutiny of \ncoupon settlements; No. 3. providing a standard for judicial approval \nof settlements that would result in a net monetary loss to plaintiffs; \nNo. 4. prohibiting ``bounties'' to class representatives; and No. 5. \nprohibiting settlements that favor class members based upon geographic \nproximity to the courthouse.\n  Second, the bill requires that notice of class action settlements be \nsent to appropriate State and Federal authorities to provide them with \nsufficient information to determine whether the settlement is in the \nbest interest of the citizens they represent.\n  Finally, the bill amends the diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction \nstatute to allow large interstate class actions to be adjudicated in \nFederal court by granting jurisdiction in class actions where there is \n``minimal diversity'' and the aggregate amount in controversy among all \nclass members exceeds $2 million.\n  Although some critics have argued that this amendment to diversity \njurisdiction somehow violates the principles of federalism or is \ninconsistent with the Constitution, I fully agree with Mr. Walter \nDellinger, former Solicitor General, who testified at our Judiciary \nCommittee hearing last fall, that it is ``difficult to understand any \nobjection to the goal of bringing to the federal court cases of genuine \nnational importance that fall clearly within the jurisdiction conferred \non those courts by Article III of the Constitution.''\n  Last, I would like to express my appreciation to the many individuals \nwho have shared with me the details of their experiences with class \naction litigation. In particular, I am grateful to those victims of \nvarious abuses of the current system who have come forward and told \ntheir stories in the hope that something positive might come out of \ntheir terrible experiences.\n  Among those who have come forward is Irene Taylor of Tyler, TX, who \nwas bilked out of approximately $20,000 in a telemarketing scam that \ndefrauded senior citizens out of more than $200 million. In a class \naction brought in Madison County, IL, the attorneys purportedly \nrepresenting Mrs. Taylor negotiated a proposed settlement which will \nexclude her from any recovery whatsoever.\n  Martha Preston of Baraboo, WI, provides another excellent example. \nMs. Preston was involved in the famous BancBoston case, brought in \nAlabama State court, which involved the bank's failure to post interest \nto mortgage escrow accounts in a prompt manner. Although Ms. Preston \ndid receive a settlement of about $4, approximately $95 was deducted \nfrom her account to help pay the class counsel's legal fees of $8.5 \nmillion. Notably, Ms. Preston testified before my committee 5 years ago \nasking us to stop these abusive class action lawsuits, but it appears \nthat, at least thus far, her plea has not been heard.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this modest effort to reform the \nabuses in the current system, abuses that are actually hurting those \nthe system is supposed to help.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 275. A bill to amend the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996, \nand to establish the United States Boxing Administration; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am joined by my colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, in introducing the Professional Boxing Amendments Act \nof 2003. This legislation is designed to strengthen existing Federal \nboxing laws by making uniform certain health and safety standards, \nestablish a centralized medical registry to be used by local \ncommissions to protect boxers, reduce arbitrary practices of \nsanctioning organizations, and provide uniformity in ranking criteria \nand contractual guidelines. This legislation also would establish a \nFederal regulatory entity to oversee professional boxing and set \nuniform standards for certain aspects of the sport.\n  Since 1996, Congress has acted to improve the sport of boxing by \npassing two laws, the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996, and the \nMuhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act of 2000. These laws were intended to \nestablish uniform standards to improve the health and safety of boxers, \nand to better protect them from the sometimes coercive, exploitative, \nand unethical business practices of promoters, managers, and \nsanctioning organizations.\n  While the Professional Boxing Safety Act, as amended by the Muhammad \nAli Act, has had some positive effects on the sport, I am concerned by \nthe repeated failure of some State and tribal boxing commissions to \ncomply with the law, and the lack of enforcement of the law by both \nFederal and State law enforcement officials. Corruption remains endemic \nin professional boxing, and the sport continues to be beset with a \nvariety of problems, some beyond the scope of the current system of \nlocal regulation.\n  Therefore, the bill we are introducing today would further strengthen \nFederal boxing laws, and also create a Federal regulatory entity, the \n``United States Boxing Administration'', USBA, to oversee the sport. \nThe USBA would be headed by an Administrator, appointed by the \nPresident, with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  The primary functions of the USBA would be to protect the health, \nsafety, and general interests of boxers. More specifically, the USBA \nwould, among other things: administer Federal boxing laws and \ncoordinate with other federal regulatory agencies to ensure that these \nlaws are enforced; oversee all professional boxing matches in the \nUnited States; and work with the boxing industry and local commissions \nto improve the status and standards of the sport. The USBA would \nlicense boxers, promoters, managers, and sanctioning organizations, and \nrevoke or suspend such licenses if the USBA believes that such action \nis in the public interest. No longer would a boxer be able to forum-\nshop for a state with a weak commission if he or she is undeserving of \na license.\n  Under this legislative proposal, the fines collected and licensing \nfees imposed by the USBA would be used to fund a percentage of its \nactivities. The USBA also would maintain a centralized database of \nmedical and statistical information pertaining to boxers in the United \nStates that would be used confidentially by local commissions in making \nlicensing decisions.\n  Let me be clear. The USBA would not be intended to micro-manage \nboxing by interfering with the daily operations of local boxing \ncommissions. Instead, the USBA would work in consultation with local \ncommissions, and the USBA Administrator would only exercise his/her\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\nauthority should reasonable grounds exist for intervention.\n  The problems that plague the sport of professional boxing compromise \nthe safety of boxers and undermine the credibility of the sport in the \neyes of the public. I believe this bill provides a realistic approach \nto curbing these problems, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nconstruct an education and administrative center at the Bear River \nMigratory Bird Refuge in Box Elder County, Utah; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bear River \nMigratory Bird Refuge Visitor Center Act.\n  Long a haven for migratory birds, the Bear River marshes provide \nmillions of birds with habitat and food. In 1928, in response to a \nseries of devastating outbreaks of avian botulism, which killed \nthousands of birds along the river, Congress established the Bear River \nMigratory Bird Refuge. It serves to provide habitat for waterfowl, \nprotect waterfowl from botulism outbreaks, and provide recreational and \neducation opportunities to the public.\n  In 1983, floods breached the refuge dikes, destroyed the visitor \ncenter, and contaminated the rich wildlife habitat. Thanks to the great \nefforts of Al Trout, the refuge manager, refuge employees, and numerous \nvolunteers, an increasing number of both waterfowl and humans are \nvisiting the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge each year. Today, the \nBear River Refuge encompasses 74,000 acres and has provided refuge for \nover 220 recorded waterfowl species. However, a new visitor center for \nthe refuge has yet to be built. As such, rich educational opportunities \nassociated with visitor center programs and exhibits are not available \nto the public. Aware of the benefits of such a center, a number of \nlocal communities, the Friends of Bear River Bird Refuge, and other \nnonprofit organizations have raised over $1.5 million for the project.\n  This legislation would authorize $11 million to be used for the \nconstruction of an Education Center and Administrative Facility. Such a \nfacility would both generate much needed public awareness of our \nnational wildlife refuge system and significantly enhance the visiting \npublic's refuge experience. A visitor center at the Bear River \nMigratory bird Refuge will result in a more meaningful, educational, \nand accessible experience for the visiting public.\n  I believe that this legislation is an exciting opportunity to \nshowcase the many wildlife and natural treasures that Utah's Bear River \nMigratory Bird Refuge contains. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation this session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 278. A bill to make certain adjustments to the boundaries of the \nMount Naomi Wilderness Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mount Naomi \nWilderness Boundary Adjustment Act.\n  Included in the Utah Wilderness Act of 1984, the Mount Naomi \nWilderness is one of Utah's largest wilderness areas at over 44,000 \nacres. It is a very scenic area and contains some of the best examples \nof alpine terrain in the intermountain west. There are large \npopulations of moose, elk, and deer. It is an area truly worthy of its \ndesignation.\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\n  Unfortunately the boundaries were drawn in such a way as to have some \nunintended consequences. Running through the wilderness is a utility \ncorridor, containing a major electricity transmission line. This power \nline serves the residents of Logan and the whole south end of Cache \nValley. Because of restrictions in the Wilderness Act of 1964, \nmaintaining and repairing the power line will be very difficult in the \nfuture.\n  Also impacted by Mount Naomi's boundaries is one of Utah's most \npopular hiking and mountain biking trails: the Bonneville Shoreline \nTrail. The Bonneville Shoreline Trail, when completed will be over 250 \nmiles in length. Starting in Nephi and heading north into Idaho, the \ntrail will follow the shoreline of ancient Lake Bonneville. The \nalignment of the trail is planned to go through a small part of the \nMount Naomi Wilderness. While hikers and equestrian users would be \npermitted to use this section of the trail, mountain bikers would be \nprohibited. The city of Logan has tried to work to change the alignment \nto adjacent private property to no avail.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would redraw the boundaries of \nthe Mount Naomi Wilderness. The acreage of this wilderness area would \nnot change, thirty-one current acres would be excluded and thirty-one \nnew acres would be added. The newly added lands will be managed \npursuant to the Utah Wilderness Act of 1984. The boundaries will now \nbetter reflect the topography of Mount Naomi and the inconsistent uses \nwill be removed from the wilderness.\n  This legislation was originally offered in the 107th Congress by \nformer Representative Jim Hansen. It passed the House of \nRepresentatives but was never acted upon by the Senate. The city of \nLogan, Cache County, and the United States Forest Service all are \nsupportive of this legislation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass \nthis legislation this session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 281. A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to make certain amendments with respect to Indian tribes, to \nprovide for training and technical assistance to Native Americans who \nare interested in commercial vehicle driving careers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Inouye in reintroducing the ``Indian Tribal Surface \nTransportation Improvement Act of 2003'', a bill to reform and improve \nIndian Reservation Road, IRR, program.\n  In the past two Congresses the Committee on Indian Affairs has held \nhearings on the problems with the IRR program and this bill provides \nmuch-needed clarifications to better meet the transportation needs in \nNative communities.\n  Involving as it does transportation and related issues, this bill \nincludes an initiative I proposed last session to support commercial \nvehicle driving training programs at tribal colleges and universities.\n  Although reservation roads comprise just 2.63 percent of the Federal \nhighway system, less than 1 percent of Federal aid has been allocated \nto Indian roads. This bill would allow the already-authorized funds for \nIndians to reach the intended beneficiaries.\n  As with any community, Indian reservations need efficient and \neffective road financing and construction to develop healthy economies \nand raise the standard of living.\n  It is no secret that when entrepreneurs, Indian or non-Indian, \ncalculate whether to invest in a community they first look to see if \nthe basic building blocks exist within the community: roads, highways, \nelectricity, potable water, and other amenities.\n  Unfortunately, despite recent successes some Indian tribes have had \nwith gaming, energy and natural resource development, most Indian \ntribes still suffer from poor infrastructure that thwarts investment \nand economic growth.\n  Building on the successes of the Indian Self Determination and \nEducation Assistance Act, this bill authorizes the Federal Lands \nHighway Administration to create a 12-tribe pilot program to contract \ndirectly for roads funding.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 281\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Education Sciences Act of 2002 to require \nthe Statistics Commissioner to collect information from coeducational \nsecondary schools on such schools' athletic programs; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``High School \nSports Information Collection Act of 2003''. This legislation directs \nthe Commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics to \ncollect data from our Nation's high schools regarding the participation \nof America's adolescents in athletics. Passage of this legislation \nwould allow the Department of Education's Office on Civil Rights to \nbetter assess whether high schools are meeting the requirements under \nTitle IX passed as part of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.\n  The existence of an information gap regarding high school athletic \nparticipation was highlighted by a 2001 by the General Accounting \nOffice which was unable to respond to a Congressional request about \nparticipation in athletics, including schools' decisions to add or \ndiscontinue sports team in high schools, colleges and universities. \nHowever, ``because of limited readily available information and the \ndifficulty of collecting comparable information'' the GAO instead could \nonly answer the inquiry about changes in four-year intercollegiate \nsports.\n  The legislation is simple. It directs the Commissioner to collect \ninformation regarding participation in athletics broken down by gender, \nteams, race and ethnicity; overall budgets and expenditures, including \nitems like travel expenses, equipment and uniforms and their \nreplacement schedules; the numbers of coaches, full and part-time; and \nscheduling issues like participation in post-season opportunities and \nsuccesses by team. These data are already reported, in most cases, to \nthe state Departments of Education and would therefore not pose any \nadditional burden on the high schools.\n  The simple straightforwardness of this legislation goes a long way \ntoward ensuring that our high schools are complying with civil rights \nlaw as established under Title IX without creating a new paperwork \nrequirement on our schools. After all when considering whether high \nschools are in compliance with this critical civil rights law, it is \nnecessary to know what is actually happening in the schools.\n  There can be no doubt Title IX has played a role in increasing \nwomen's athletic opportunities. However, many argue that the \nimplementation of this law has reduced opportunity for others. While I \nstrongly disagree with such an assessment, I do believe that it is \ncritical that policy makers, parents, coaches, and athletic directors \nalike have access to precise and timely data to inform the debate and \nensure that decisions are based on an accurate picture of interest and \nparticipation. Precise information on the participation\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\nlevels in high school would assist the enforcement of Title IX on the \nhigh school level.\n  Participation in athletics renders physical benefits as well as \nimportant psychological benefits. Studies have shown that values \nlearned from sports participation, such as teamwork, leadership, \ndiscipline, and pride in accomplishment, are important lessons for \neveryone and are especially beneficial as more women participate in \nbusiness management and ownership positions in ever higher numbers. \nCertainly it is no coincidence that 80 percent of female managers of \nFortune 500 companies have a background in athletics. There are \npalpable gains generated by participation in athletics, gains which \nshould be as accessible for females as they have been for males for \ndecades.\n  This legislation compliments current law and in fact would allow us \nto ensure that the law is being enforced better than we can today. The \ndata regarding the participation of high school students in athletics \nhas been lacking for too long and passage of this legislation would \nhelp athletic programs ensure that they are offering equal opportunity \nfor all athletes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 283. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for \ncharitable purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm joined by Senators Kerry and \nSnowe in re-introducing the Public Good IRA Rollover Act, legislation \nto allow taxpayers to make tax-free distributions from their individual \nretirement accounts, IRAs, for gifts to charity.\n  It is more important than ever to provide support to our nation's \ncharitable organizations. Our struggling economy is placing an enormous \nfinancial strain on many charities, severely curtailing their funding \nat a time when the need for their services is greatest.\n  I have heard from charities that people frequently ask them about \nusing their IRAs to make charitable donations. However, many donors \ndecide not to make a gift from their IRAs after they are told about the \npotential tax consequences under current law. Our IRA charitable \nrollover legislation would eliminate this concern. This single change \nto the Tax Code could put billions of additional dollars from a new \nsource to work for the public good. A Salvation Army official once said \nthat providing for IRA charitable rollovers ``would be the single most \nimportant piece of legislation in the history of public charitable \nsupport in this country.''\n  Over the years, a number of legislative proposals have been discussed \nin Congress to increase charitable giving. In his Fiscal Year 2004 \nbudget, President Bush has proposed a substantial package of tax \nincentives to encourage charitable giving, including a proposal to \nallow individuals to make certain tax-free charitable IRA distributions \nafter age 65.\n  The President's charitable IRA proposal has a lot of merit, but the \nPublic Good IRA Rollover Act is superior in an important respect: by \nallowing tax-free life-income gifts from an IRA. Life-income gifts \ninvolve the donation of assets to a charity, where the giver retains an \nincome stream from those assets for a defined period. Life-income gifts \nare an important tool for charities to raise much needed funds, and \nwould receive a substantial boost if they could be made from IRAs, but \nthey are wholly ignored in the Administration's proposal. Under our \nproposed Public Good IRA Rollover Act, individuals would be allowed to \nmake tax-free charitable life-income gifts at the age of 59\\1/2\\. \nSimilar provisions were added to a major charitable tax incentive bill \nreported by the Senate Finance Committee last year, but were not \nultimately enacted.\n  As the Finance Committee begins anew to consider a charitable giving \ntax incentive package in the near future, I urge them to adopt once \nagain the IRA charitable rollover approach used in the Public Good IRA \nRollover Act, instead of the approach recently outlined in the \nPresident's budget.\n  The benefits of our approach are two-fold. First, the life-income \ngift provision in our legislation would stimulate additional charitable \ngiving. In addition, people who make life-income gifts often become \nmore involved with charities. They serve as volunteers, urge their \nfriends and colleagues to make charitable gifts and frequently set up \nadditional provisions for charity in their life-time giving plans and \nat death. Second, this approach comes at no extra cost to the \ngovernment when compared to other major charitable IRA rollover \nproposals.\n  So I urge my colleagues to consider the Public Good IRA Rollover Act, \nas we undertake efforts in the Senate to craft a charitable giving tax \nincentives bill. As I mentioned at the outset, in these trying times we \nought to do everything we can to encourage charitable giving. Let us \nremember the old adage that ``we make a living by what we get, but we \nmake a life by what we give.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 284. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na special rule for members of the uniformed services and the Foreign \nService in determining the exclusion of gain from the sale of a \nprincipal residence; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor the Military Home \nOwners Equity Act of 2003, S. 284. This is important legislation which \nI have been privileged to introduce in the Senate during previous \nCongresses. This legislation would allow members of the Uniformed \nServices, who are away on extended active duty, to qualify for the same \ntax relief on the profit generated when they sell their main residence \nas other Americans. I am pleased to announce that Secretary of State \nColin Powell fully supports this legislation and this legislation \nenjoys overwhelming support by the senior uniformed leadership, the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, as well as the Office of Management and Budget \nDirector Mitch Daniels, the 31-member associations of the Military \nCoalition, the American Foreign Service Association, and the American \nBar Association.\n  The average American participates in our Nation's growth through home \nownership. Appreciation in the value of a home allows everyday \nAmericans to participate in our country's prosperity. Fortunately, the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 recognized this and provided this break to \nlessen the amount of tax most Americans will pay on the profit they \nmake when they sell their homes. Unfortunately, the 1997 home sale \nprovision unintentionally discourages home ownership among members of \nthe Uniformed and Foreign Services.\n  This bill will not create a new tax benefit; it merely modifies \ncurrent law to include the time members of the Uniformed Services are \naway from home on active duty when calculating the number of years the \nhomeowners has lived in their primary residence. In short, this bill is \nnarrowly tailored to remedy a specific dilemma.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 delivered sweeping tax relief to \nmillions of Americans through a wide variety of important tax changes \nthat affect individuals, families, investors and businesses. It was \nalso one of the most complex tax laws enacted in recent history.\n  As with any complex legislation, there are winners and losers. But in \nthis instance, there are unintended losers: members of the Uniformed \nand Foreign Services.\n  The 1997 act gives taxpayers who sell their principal residence a \nmuch-needed tax break. Prior to the 1997 act, taxpayers received a one-\ntime exclusion on the profit they made when they sold their principal \nresidence, but the taxpayer had to be at least 55 years old and live in \nthe residence for 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale. This provision \nprimarily benefitted elderly taxpayers, while not providing any relief \nto younger taxpayers and their families.\n  Fortunately, the 1997 act addressed this issue. Under this law, \ntaxpayers who sell their principal residence on or after May 7, 1997, \nare not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit from the sale, joint \nfilers are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit they make from \nselling their principal residence. The taxpayers must meet two \nrequirements to qualify for this tax relief. The taxpayer must one, own \nthe home for at least 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale, and two, \nlive in the home as their main home for at least 2 years of the last 5 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\n  I applaud the bipartisan cooperation that resulted in this much-\nneeded form of tax relief. The home sales provision sounds great, and \nit is. Unfortunately,the second part of this eligibility test \nunintentionally and unfairly prohibits many of the women and men who \nserve this country overseas from qualifying for this beneficial tax \nrelief.\n  Constant travel across the United States and abroad is inherent in \nthe Uniformed and Foreign Services. Nonetheless, some members of these \nServices choose to purchase a home in a certain locale, even though \nthey will not live there much of the time. Under the new law, if they \ndo not have a spouse who resides in the house during their absence, \nthey will not qualify for the full benefit of the new home sales \nprovision, because no one ``lives'' in the home for the required period \nof time. The law is prejudiced against families that serve our Nation \nabroad. They would not qualify for the home sales exclusion because \nneither spouse ``live'' in the house for enough time to qualify for the \nexclusion.\n  This bill simply remedies an inequality in the 1997 law. The bill \namends the Internal Revenue Code so that members of the Uniformed and \nForeign Services will be considered to be using their house as their \nmain residence for any period that they are assigned overseas in the \nexecution of their duties. In short, they will be deemed to be using \ntheir house as their main home, even if they are stationed in Bosnia, \nthe Persian Gulf, in the ``no man's land,'' commonly called the DMZ \nbetween North and South Korea, or anywhere else they are assigned.\n  In the wake of September 11, our Armed Forces are now deployed to an \nunprecedented number of locations. They are away from their primary \nhomes, protecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold so \ndear. We cannot afford to discourage military service by penalizing \nmilitary personnel with higher taxes merely because they are doing \ntheir job. Military service entails sacrifice, such as long periods of \ntime away from friends and family and the constant threat of \nmobilization into hostile territory. We must not use the tax code to \nheap additional burdens upon our women and men in uniform.\n  In my view, the way to decrease the likelihood of further \ninequalities in the tax code, intentional or otherwise, is to adopt a \nfairer, flatter tax system that is far less complicated than our \ncurrent system. But, in the meantime, we must insure the Tax Code is as \nfair and equitable as possible.\n  The Taxpayers' Relief Act of 1997 was designed to provide sweeping \ntax relief to all Americans, including those who serve this country \nabroad. Yes, it is true that there are winners and losers in any tax \ncode, but, this inequity was unintended. Enacting this narrowly \ntailored remedy to grant equal tax relief to the members of our \nUniformed and Foreign Services restores fairness and consistency to our \nincreasingly complex Tax Code.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 284\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the integration and consolidation of \nalcohol and substance abuse programs and services provided by Indian \ntribal governments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Inouye in re-introducing legislation to assist Indian tribes to \nfight the scourge of alcohol, drug and associated mental health \nproblems in their communities.\n  Native Americans continue to be plagued by chronic alcohol and drug \naddictions which destroy their bodies and souls and inevitably require \nmental health treatment as well.\n  There are a good number of Federal agencies involved in treating \nthese problems and, through no fault of their own, agency efforts are \noften un-coordinated and ineffective as a result.\n  Relying on models that are proven winners, the ``Native American \nAlcohol and Substance Abuse Program Consolidation Act of 2003'' \nauthorizes Indian tribes and tribal consortia to string together these \ndisparate programs and services and bring them together in one \ncomprehensive and coordinated package.\n  In addition to achieving economies of scale in these Federal \nservices, the bill would also encourage the use of automated clinical \ninformation systems and bring to bear state-of-the-art diagnostic and \ntreatment tools\n  The two main themes of this bill, better use of resources combined \nwith technological innovations have proven successful in other areas \nlike Indian job training.\n  Just this week, Health and Human Services Secretary Thompson launched \na new effort aimed at combating chronic health problems in minority \ncommunities.\n  Substance abuse and diabetes are included in Secretary Thompson's \neffort and this bill would go a long way in assisting Federal and \ntribal governments in that battle.\n  The mechanics of this bill are also consistent with the broad \ncontours of the President's Management Agenda, increasing the \neffectiveness of Federal services without increasing the budget.\n  For these reasons, I am hopeful the bill will be well received by the \nAdministration and the tribes so that it can be considered speedily in \nthe weeks ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \ninitiative and ask unanimous consent to have the text of the bill \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 285\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise and extend the Birth Defects Prevention Act \nof 1998; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Birth Defects \nand Developmental Disabilities Prevention Act. It is a pleasure to \nwork, once again, on this important issue with Senators Dodd, Frist and \nKennedy.\n  My interest in birth defects prevention began while I was Governor. \nAs Governor I had secured dollars to fund the neonate care units at our \nhospitals in Missouri. These remarkable institutions and the dedicated \nmen and women who serve there do a tremendous job of saving low birth \nweight babies and babies with severe birth defects.\n  As I visited those hospitals and held those tiny babies, the doctors \nand nurses who staffed these units asked me, ``Why don't we do \nsomething to reduce the incidents of birth defects and the problems \nthat bring the tiniest of infants to these very high-tech, specialized \ncare units.''\n  Since I became a Senator I have been working with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and with the March of Dimes to deal with this \nserious and compelling health problem facing America.\n  Many people are not aware that birth defects affect over 3 percent of \nall births in America, and they are the leading cause of infant death. \nThis year alone, an estimated 150,000 babies will be born with a birth \ndefect. Among the babies who survive, birth defects often result in \nlifelong disability. Medical care, special education, and may other \nservices are often required into adulthood, costing families thousands \nof dollars each year.\n  In 1998, Congress finally passed a bill I had sponsored for 3 \nprevious sessions, the Birth Defects Prevention Act, which created a \nfederal birth defects prevention and surveillance strategy. That was \nfollowed by the Children's Health Act of 2000, which established the \nNational Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at CDC. \nWith these two important pieces of legislation Congress recognized that \nbirth defects and developmental disabilities are major threats to \nchildren's health.\n  The Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities Prevention Act \nrevises and extends the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1998. This bill \nis straightforward and has the support of the March of Dimes, Spina \nBifida Association of America, the Autism Society of America, and the \nCoalition for Children's health among others. It: (1) Reauthorizes the \nNational Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities for 5 \nyears; (2) makes several technical amendments to ensure that the full \nscope of activities conducted by the center are included in statute; \n(3) authorizes CDC to collect data from educational records that are \nnecessary to conduct surveillance on developmental disabilities--\nincluding autism--while\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nprotecting the privacy of individuals and their families; (4) \nauthorizes CDC to support a National Spina Bifida Program to promote \nprevention and enhance the quality of life of those living with Spina \nBifida; (5) authorizes CDC to conduct research and programs on the \nprevention of secondary conditions and the promotion of health and \nwellness in individuals living with disabilities; and (6) finally, the \nbill transfers certain members of the Advisory Committee to the \nDirector of the National Center for Environmental Health who have \nexpertise in birth defects, developmental disabilities and disabilities \nand health to the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental \nDisabilities.\n  We have come a long way in the past 5 years toward preventing certain \nbirth defects and developmental disabilities, but we face many \nchallenges ahead. There is still much work to be done to improve the \nhealth of all Americans by preventing birth defects and developmental \ndisabilities in children, promoting optimal child development and \nensuring health and wellness among children and adults living with \ndisabilities.\n  Today, with the introduction of this bill we have the opportunity to \nrenew our commitment to birth defects prevention and to improve the \nquality of life of those living with disabilities. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure and enhance the well-being of our \nNation's children.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Bond in \nreintroducing the Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities \nPrevention Act of 2003. This bill reauthorizes the National Center on \nBirth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, NCBDD, at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention to promote optimal fetal, infant, and \nchild development and prevent birth defects and childhood developmental \ndisabilities.\n  Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the United \nStates, accounting for more than 20 percent of all infant deaths. Of \nthe 150,000 babies born with a birth defect in the United States each \nyear, 8,000 will die during their first year of life. In addition, \nbirth defects are the fifth-leading cause of years of potential life \nlost and contribute substantially to childhood morbidity and long-term \ndisability.\n  Congress passed the Birth Defects Prevention Act in 1998, a bill to \nassist States in developing, implementing, or expanding community-based \nbirth defects tracking systems, programs to prevent birth defects, and \nactivities to improve access to health services for children with birth \ndefects. The authorization for this important legislation expires at \nthe end of this year, and the legislation we are introducing today will \nstrengthen those important programs.\n  In order to educate health professionals and the general public, this \nlegislation requires NCBDD to provide information on the incidence and \nprevalence of individuals living with birth defects and disabilities, \nany health disparities, experienced by such individuals, and \nrecommendations for improving the health and wellness and quality of \nlife of such individuals. The Clearinghouse will also contain a summary \nof recommendations from all birth defects research conferences \nsponsored by the agency including conferences related to spina bifida.\n  This legislation also clarifies advisory committees, already in \nexistence, that have expertise in birth defects, developmental \ndisabilities, and disabilities and health will be transferred to the \nNational Center on Birth Defects.\n  This piece of legislation also supports a National Spina Bifida \nProgram to prevent and reduce suffering from the nation's most common \npermanently disabling birth defect.\n  I ask that this piece of important legislation be reauthorized. I \nwant to thank my colleagues, Senator Bond and others, for the \nintroduction of this initial piece of legislation in 1998 and for their \ncontinued initiatives on birth defects and developmental disabilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Warner, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 287. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat a deduction equal to fair market value shall be allowed for \ncharitable contributions of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly \ncompositions created by the donor; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Bennett to \nintroduce the ``Artist-Museum Partnership Act of 2003.'' Our bipartisan \nlegislation will enable our country to keep cherished art works in the \nUnited States and to preserve them in our public institutions, while \nerasing an inequity in our tax code that currently serves as a \ndisincentive for artists to donate their works to museums and \nlibraries. This is the same bill we introduced the past two Congresses. \nIt was also included in the Senate-passed version of the President's \n2001 tax cut bill and in the Finance Committee's version of the Charity \nAid, Recovery, and Empowerment, CARE, Act. I would like to thank \nSenators Bingaman, Cochran, Daschle, Durbin, Graham of Florida, \nKennedy, Lieberman, Lincoln, and Warner for cosponsoring this \nbipartisan bill.\n  Our bill is sensible and straightforward. It would allow artists, \nwriters, and composers who donate works to museums and libraries to \ntake a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the work. This \nis something that collectors who make similar donations are already \nable to do. If we as a Nation want to ensure that art works created by \nliving artists are available to the public in the future, for study or \nfor pleasure, this is something that artists should be allowed to do as \nwell. Under current law, artists who donate self-created works are only \nable to deduct the cost of supplies such as canvas, pen, paper and ink, \nwhich does not even come close to their true value. This is unfair to \nartists and it hurts museums and libraries, large and small, that are \ndedicated to preserving works for posterity.\n  In my State of Vermont, we are incredibly proud of the great works \nproduced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live and work in \nthe Green Mountain State. Displaying their creations in museums and \nlibraries helps develop a sense of pride among Vermonters and \nstrengthens a bond with Vermont, its landscape, its beauty and its \ncultural heritage. Anyone who has contemplated a painting in a museum \nor examined an original manuscript or composition, and has gained a \ngreater understanding of both the artist and the subject as a result, \nknows the tremendous value of these works. I would like to see more of \nthem, not fewer, preserved in Vermont and across the country.\n  Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a \ndeduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work, but Congress \nchanged the law with respect to artists in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. \nSince then, fewer and fewer artists have donated their works to museums \nand cultural institutions. The sharp decline in donations to the \nLibrary of Congress clearly illustrates this point. Until 1969, the \nLibrary of Congress received 15 to 20 large gifts of manuscripts from \nauthors each year. In the four years following the elimination of the \ndeduction, the Library received only one such gift. Instead, many of \nthese works have been sold to private collectors and are no longer \navailable to the general public.\n  For example, prior to the enactment of the 1969 law, Igor Stravinsky \nplanned to donate his papers to the Music Division of the Library of \nCongress. But after the law passed, his papers were sold instead to a \nprivate foundation in Switzerland. We can no longer afford this massive \nloss to our cultural heritage. These losses are an unintended \nconsequence of the tax bill that should now be corrected.\n  More than 30 years ago, Congress changed the law for artists in \nresponse to the perception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of \nthe law by inflating the market value of self-created works. Since that \ntime, however, the government has cut down significantly on the abuse \nof fair market value determinations. Under this legislation, artists \nwho donate their own paintings, manuscripts, compositions, or scholarly \ncompositions, would be subject to the same new rules that all taxpayer/\ncollectors who donate such works must now follow. This includes \nproviding relevant information as to\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\nthe value of the gift, providing appraisals by qualified appraisers, \nand, in some cases, subjecting them to review by the Internal Revenue \nService's Art Advisory Panel.\n  In addition, donated works must be accepted by museums and libraries, \nwhich often have strict criteria in place for works they intend to \ndisplay. The institution must certify that it intends to put the work \nto a use that is related to the institution's tax exempt status. For \nexample, a painting contributed to an educational institution must be \nused by that organization for educational purposes. It could not be \nsold by the institution for profit. Similarly, a work could not be \ndonated to a hospital or other charitable institution that did not \nintend to use the work in a manner related to the function constituting \nthe donee's exemption under Section 501 of the tax code. Finally, the \nfair market value of the work could only be deducted from the portion \nof the artist's income that has come from the sale of similar works, or \nrelated activities.\n  This bill would also correct another disparity in the tax treatment \nof self-created works, how the same work is treated before and after an \nartist's death. While living artists may only deduct the material costs \nof donations, donations of those same works after death are deductible \nfrom estate taxes at the fair market value of the work. In addition, \nwhen an artist dies, works that are part of his or her estate are taxed \non the fair market value.\n  Last Congress, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that our \nbill would cost $50 million over 10 years. This is a moderate price to \npay for our education and the preservation of our cultural heritage.\n  I want to thank my colleagues again for cosponsoring this bipartisan \nlegislation. The time has come for us to correct an unintended \nconsequence of the 1969 law and encourage rather than discourage the \ndonations of art works by their creators. This bill could, and I \nbelieve would, make a critical difference in an artist's decision to \ndonate his or her work, rather than sell it to a private party, where \nit may become lost to the public forever.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am proud to join the Senator from \nVermont today to introduce the Artist-Museum Partnership Act. He and I \nhave introduced this legislation in the past, and we hope that our \ncolleagues will see this bill for what it is: a reasonable solution to \nan unintentional inequity in our tax code.\n  This legislation would allow living artists to deduct the fair-market \nvalue of their art work when they contribute their work to museums or \nother public institutions. As the tax code is currently written, art \ncollectors are able to deduct the fair market value of any piece of art \nthey donate to a museum. However, if the artist who created that same \npiece of work were to donate it, he or she would only be able to deduct \nthe material cost of the work, which may be nothing more than a canvas, \na tube of paint, and a wooden frame. Thus, there exists a disincentive \nfor artists to donate their work to museums. The solution is simple: \ntreat collectors and artists the same way. This bill would do just \nthat.\n  Certainly, this bill would benefit artists, but more importantly, the \nbeneficiaries would be the museums that would receive the art work and \nthe general public who would be able to view it in a timely manner. \nThis change in the tax code would increase the number of original \npieces donated to public institutions, giving scholars greater access \nto an artist's work during the lifetime of that artist, as well as \nprovide for an increase in the public display of such work.\n  I would like to thank Senator Leahy for his work on this bill. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this common-sense legislation. The fiscal \nimpact of the Artist-Museum Partnership Act on the Federal budget would \nbe minimal, but the benefit to our nation's cultural and artistic \nheritage cannot be overstated. This minor correction to the tax code is \nlong overdue, and the Senate should act on this legislation to remedy \nthe problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 288. A bill to encourage contracting by Indians and Indian tribes \nfor the management of Federal land, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as I did last session, I am again \npleased to introduce the ``Indian Tribal Contracting and Federal Lands \nManagement Demonstration Project Act'' to expand the highly-successful \nIndian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 and to \nbring Native knowledge, values and sensitivity to the management of our \nFederal lands.\n  I want to emphasize that this initiative is a starting point for a \nbroader discussion about whether Federal law sufficiently protects \nsacred Indian places that are located on Federal lands.\n  Americans react viscerally when lands and sites held sacred are \nthreatened. Whether the site in question is the Little Bighorn \nBattlefield in Montana; the American Cemetery at Omaha Beach in \nNormandy, France; or religious and ceremonial sites held dear by Native \npeople.\n  Twenty-five years ago Congress passed the American Indian Religious \nFreedom Act which declared that it is ``the policy of the United States \nto protect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of \nfreedom to believe, express and exercise the traditional religions of \nthe American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians, including but \nnot limited to access to sites, use and possession of sacred objects, \nand the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites.''\n  A series of hearings held by the Committee on Indian Affairs over the \npast two years revealed that the AIRFA policy remains aspirational and \nthe goals of that Act have not been realized.\n  The clashes between economic and cultural interests will also sharpen \nas our nation's needs for economic activities, such as logging, \nenergy and mining, increases.\n\n  In 1970, President Nixon's Special Message to Congress on Indian \nAffairs changed forever Federal Indian law and policy. The President \nalso signed into law legislation transferring the sacred Blue Lake \nlands back to the Pueblo of Taos. These two events set the stage for \nboth the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act, 1975, \nas well as the AIRFA, 1978.\n  The legislation I am re-introducing today will build on these \nprecedents by setting up a Demonstration Project to expand \nopportunities for Native contracting on Federal lands. One goal of this \nbill is to bring to bear the knowledge and sensitivity of Native people \nto activities that are currently being carried out by Federal agencies.\n  Under the bill, the Secretary of the Interior would select up to 12 \ntribes or tribal organizations per year to provide archaeological, \nanthropological, ethnographic and cultural surveys and analysis; land \nmanagement planning; and activities related to the identification, \nmaintenance, or protection of lands considered to have religious, \nceremonial or cultural significance to Indian tribes.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 288\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Contracting and \n     Federal Land Management Demonstration Project Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to expand the provisions of the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et \n     seq.) to increase Indian employment and income through \n     greater contracting opportunities with the Federal \n     Government;\n       (2) to encourage contracting by Indians and Indian tribes \n     with respect to management of Federal land--\n       (A) to realize the benefit of Indian knowledge and \n     expertise with respect to the land; and\n       (B) to promote innovative management strategies on Federal \n     land that will result in greater sensitivity toward, and \n     respect for, religious beliefs and sacred sites of Indians \n     and Indian tribes;\n       (3) to better accommodate access to and ceremonial use of \n     Indian sacred land by Indian religious practitioners; and\n       (4) to prevent significant damage to Indian sacred land.\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\n     SEC. 3. TRIBAL PROCUREMENT CONTRACTING AND RESERVATION \n                   DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       Section 7 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n     Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(d) Tribal Procurement Contracting and Reservation \n     Development.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), on request by \n     and application of an Indian tribe to provide certain \n     services or deliverables that the Secretary of the Interior \n     would otherwise procure from a private-sector entity \n     (referred to in this subsection as an `applicant tribe'), and \n     absent a request made by 1 or more Indian tribes that would \n     receive a direct benefit from those services or deliverables \n     to enter into contracts for those services or deliverables in \n     accordance with section 102 (referred to in this subsection \n     as a `beneficiary tribe'), the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall enter into contracts for those services or deliverables \n     with the applicant tribe in accordance with section 102.\n       ``(2) Assurances.--An applicant tribe shall provide the \n     Secretary of the Interior with assurances that the principal \n     beneficiary tribes that receive the services and deliverables \n     for which the applicant tribe has entered into a contract \n     with the Secretary of the Interior remain the Indian tribes \n     originally intended to benefit from the services or \n     deliverables.\n       ``(3) Rights and privileges.--For the purpose of this \n     subsection, an applicant tribe shall enjoy, at a minimum, the \n     same rights and privileges under this Act as would a \n     beneficiary tribe if the beneficiary tribe exercised rights \n     to enter into a contract relating to services or deliverables \n     in accordance with section 102.\n       ``(4) Notice of desire to contract.--If a beneficiary tribe \n     seeks to enter into a contract with the Secretary of the \n     Interior for services or deliverables being provided by an \n     applicant tribe--\n       ``(A) the beneficiary tribe shall immediately provide \n     notice of the desire to enter into a contract for those \n     services and deliverables to the applicant tribe and the \n     Secretary; and\n       ``(B) not later than the date that is 180 days after the \n     date on which the applicant tribe and the Secretary of the \n     Interior receive the notice, the contract between the \n     applicant tribe and the Secretary of the Interior for the \n     services or deliverables shall terminate.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991 to identify a route that passes through the \nStates of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas as a high priority \ncorridor on the National Highway System; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will enhance the future economic vitality of communities in Otero, \nLincoln, Torrance, Guadalupe, and Quay Counties. The purpose of this \nlegislation is to focus attention on the need to upgrade U.S. Highway \n54 to four lanes. I believe improving the transportation infrastructure \nwill help attract good jobs to South, Central, and Eastern New Mexico.\n  I am honored to have my good friend and colleague, Senator Roberts, \nas the lead cosponsor of the bill. I am also pleased to have Senators \nInhofe, Hutchison, Domenici and Brownback as original cosponsors.\n  In addition, Representatives Udall, NM, Moran, Lucas, Thornberry, \nPearce, and Reyes are introducing this bill today on the House side.\n  Our bill designates U.S. Highway 54 from the border with Mexico at El \nPaso, TX, through New Mexico, and Oklahoma to Wichita, KS, as the \nSouthwest Passage Initiative for Regional and Interstate \nTransportation, or SPIRIT, corridor. Congress has already included \nHighway 54 as part of the National Highway System. This bill adds the \nSPIRIT Corridor in Congress's list of High Priority Corridors on the \nNational Highway System.\n  About half of the 700-mile-long SPIRIT corridor is in New Mexico and \nanother 200 miles of it are in Kansas. Our goal with this designation \nis to promote the development of this route into a full four-lane \ndivided highway. When completed, the route will link rural areas in the \nfour States to major market centers.\n  I continue to believe strongly in the importance of highway \ninfrastructure for economic development in my State. Even in this age \nof the new economy and high-speed digital communications, roads \ncontinue to link our communities together and to carry the commercial \ngoods and products our citizens need. Safe and efficient highways are \nespecially important to citizens in the rural parts of New Mexico.\n  It is well known that regions with four-lane highways more readily \nattract out-of-State visitors and new jobs. Truck drivers and the \ntraveling public prefer the safety of a four-lane divided highway.\n  In New Mexico, US 54 is a fairly level route, bypassing New Mexico's \nmajor mountain ranges. The route also traverses some of New Mexico's \nmost dramatic scenery, including two of the State's popular Scenic \nByways. One is the Mesalands Scenic Byway in Guadalupe, San Miguel and \nQuay Counties, incorporating the beautiful tablelands known as El Llano \nEstacado. The other is the state's newest byway, La Frontera de Llano, \nwhich follows highway 39 from Logan to Abbott in Harding County, \nincluding the spectacular Canadian River Canyon and the Kiowa National \nGrasslands.\n  The SPIRIT corridor passes through Alamogordo, home of the New Mexico \nMuseum of Space History and gateway to the stunning White Sands \nNational Monument.\n  Highway 54 is also important to our nation from the perspective of \nnational security. The route directly serves Fort Bliss, the White \nSands Missile Range, and Holloman Air Force Base. It also passes \nthrough the Nation's breadbasket as well as some of the Nation's most \nimportant oil and gas fields.\n  The route of the SPIRIT corridor starts at Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico, \nhome of one the largest concentrations of manufacturing in the border \nregion. As a result of increased trade under NAFTA, commercial border \ntraffic is now much higher at the border crossings in El Paso, Texas, \nand Santa Teresa, New Mexico. In New Mexico, truck traffic from the \nborder has risen to over 1000 per day and is expected to triple in the \nnext twenty years.\n  The SPIRIT corridor is perfectly situated to serve international \ntrade and promote economic development along its entire route. The \nroute provides direct connections to four major Interstate Highways: I-\n10, I-35, I-40, and I-70. SPIRIT is also the shortest route between \nChicago and El Paso, shaving 137 miles off the major alternative.\n  Though much of US 54 is currently only two lanes, traffic has been \nrising dramatically along the entire route since NAFTA was implemented. \nIn New Mexico, total daily traffic levels are nearing 10,000 and are \nprojected to rise to 30,000, with trucks making up 35 percent of the \ntotal. In Oklahoma, traffic levels are up to 6,500 per day--40 percent \nof which are commercial trucks. These traffic statistics clearly \nreflect the SPIRIT corridor's attraction to commercial and passenger \ndrivers.\n  New Mexicans recognize the importance of efficient roads to economic \ndevelopment and safety. I have long supported my state's efforts to \ncomplete the four-lane upgrade of US 54. The State Highway and \nTransportation Department now rates the project a high priority for New \nMexico. The four-lane upgrade of the first 56-mile segment from the \nTexas border to Alamogordo was completed last year. Two more sections \nin New Mexico remain to be upgraded: 163 miles from Tularosa, north \nthrough Carrizozo, Corona, and\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\nVaughn, to Santa Rosa and 50 miles from Tucumcari to the Texas border \nnear Nara Visa in Quay County. The cost to four-lane these two segments \nis estimated at $420 million. I am committed to working to help secure \nthe funding required to complete New Mexico's four-lane upgrade as soon \nas possible. I am pleased the other States are also moving quickly to \nfour-lane their portion of the route. I hope designating SPIRIT as a \nHigh Priority Corridor on the National Highway System will help spur \nthe completion of this project.\n  Once the SPIRIT corridor is designated, New Mexico will have four \nhigh-priority corridors on the National Highway System. The other three \nare the Ports-to-Plains corridor, the Camino Real Corridor, and the \nEast West Transamerica Corridor. These four trade corridors, as well as \nour close proximity to the border, strongly underscore the vital role \nNew Mexico plays in our nation's interstate and international \ntransportation network.\n  The SPIRIT project has broad grassroots support. Most of the cities, \ncounties, and chambers of commerce all the way from Wichita to El Paso \nhave passed resolutions of support for the four-lane upgrade of US 54 \nalong the entire corridor.\n  I do believe the four-lane upgrade of Highway 54 is vital to the \ncontinued economic development for all of the communities along the \nSPIRIT corridor in New Mexico.\n  I again thank Senators Roberts, Inhofe, Hutchison, Domenici and \nBrownback for cosponsoring the bill, and I hope all Senators will join \nus in support of this important legislation. It is my hope that our \nbill can pass quickly this year or be included when the Senate \nconsiders the reauthorization of the six-year transportation bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. I ask unanimous consent that letters and resolutions of support \nfrom Otero County, Lincoln County, and Alamogordo in New Mexico, and \nfrom the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation and the \nSecretary of Transportation of Kansas be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 290\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senator, 703 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: We endorse your efforts to improve \n     US 54 in the States of Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, and \n     Kansas. Designation of US 54 as a high priority corridor on \n     the National Highway System will aid in on-going and future \n     improvements to this significant trade corridor.\n       Governor Keating, Congressman Lucas, Senator Inhofe, and \n     Senator Nickles have recognized the importance of US 54 in \n     the movement of goods and people in this four state region. \n     Beginning in 1995, US 54 was designated as a ``Transportation \n     Improvement Corridor'' in our first Statewide Intermodal \n     Transportation Plan. These Transportation Improvement \n     Corridors were so designated primarily due to current and \n     future congestion and were planned to be four-lane \n     facilities. US 54 certainly carries enough traffic, \n     especially trucks, for this designation. It has continued as \n     a Transportation Improvement Corridor in the latest Statewide \n     Intermodal Transportation Plan.\n       We have followed through on this designation by committing \n     significant state and federal funding to improving US 54 to a \n     four-lane facility. We have used Capital Improvement Funds \n     (state bonds) combined with federal funds in the amount of \n     $70 million to purchase right-of-way, move utilities, and \n     construct a four-lane facility from the Texas state-line \n     northeastward 34 miles to north of Optima, Oklahoma. Future \n     plans include only purchasing right-of-way from this point \n     northeastward 21 miles to the Kansas stateline and \n     constructing a four-lane facility to Hooker, Oklahoma. \n     However, due to decreases in both state and federal funding, \n     four-laning US 54 from Hooker northeastward 15 miles to the \n     Kansas stateline is uncertain. Your efforts in securing \n     funding for US 54 would greatly aid in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gary M.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na charitable deduction for certain expenses incurred in support of \nNative Alaskan subsistence whaling; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, during his State of the Union speech \nthis week, President Bush emphasized the importance of local and \ncharitable initiatives that help define the character of the many \ncommunities that make up the mosaic of our country. I have come to the \nfloor today to discuss a community tradition that is unique to many of \nAlaska's remote villages and which should be recognized and supported \nby the Federal Government.\n  Subsistance whaling is vital to the survival of several Alaska Native \ncommunities. In many of our remote villages, the whale hunt is a \ntradition that has been carried on over many millennia. As part of that \ntradition, it is the custom that the captain of the hunt make all \nprovisions for the meals, wages and equipment costs associated with the \nhunt.\n  After the hunt, the Captain is repaid in whale meat and muktuk, which \nis blubber and skin. However, as part of the tradition, the Captain \ndonates a substantial portion of the whale to his village in order to \nhelp the community survive the harsh winter.\n  While the International Whaling Commission, IWC, has banned \ncommercial whaling, it has specifically recognized the cultural \nsignificance of whaling to the Alaska Native community and has allowed \nthem to continue the seasonal hunt. The IWC recognizes that the \ntraditional whale hunt is not carried on for financial gain. Although \nthe hunt generates no financial gain to the whaling captain, the \ncaptain incurs real expenses.\n  Since the whaling captain is not engaged in a business, he is not \npermitted to deduct the costs he incurs from his taxes. In order to \nmaintain the traditional hunt and to offset some of the costs incurred \nby the Captain, I am today introducing legislation that would allow the \ncaptain to claim a charitable deduction of up to $10,000 to help defray \nthe costs associated with providing this community service.\n  I want to point out that if the Captain incurred all of these \nexpenses and then donated the whale meat to a local charitable \norganization, the Captain would almost certainly be able to deduct the \ncosts he incurred in outfitting the boat for the charitable purpose. \nHowever, the cultural significance of the Captain's sharing the whale \nwith the community would be lost. Moreover, since there is no \ncommercial market for whale meat because of the international whaling \nbank, there is no way to set the value of such a charitable \ncontribution.\n  This is a very modest proposal and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to eliminate the sunset for the determination of the \nFederal medical assistance percentage for Alaska under the Medicare, \nMedicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I speak today on behalf of Alaska's \nmost vulnerable individuals, our children, the disabled, and the \nelderly poor. Since its enactment in 1965, the Medicaid program has \nhelped States provide low-income and disabled individuals with access \nto vital health care services. In 1997, Congress allowed States to take \non certain health-related responsibilities for children. The Denali Kid \nCare program, a Medicaid expansion, has been very successful in \nproviding health services for Alaskan children. Unfortunately, under \ncurrent law many Alaskans who rely on this program could lose some or \nall of their Medicaid coverage. This is because Alaska's Federal \nMedical Assistance percentage, FMAP, adjustment, a correction to the \nMedicaid formula due to the high cost of health care in Alaska, will \nexpire within the next 2 fiscal years. An FMAP correction is necessary \nfor Alaska because this ``one-size-fits-all'' formula does not account \nfor variations in cost-of-living, and does not consider Alaska's higher \nfederally mandated poverty level.\n  First of all, the FMAP formula was developed in 1946, 13 years before \nAlaska was admitted to the Union. This archaic formula is used to \ncalculate the Federal share of Medicaid costs for each State. The \ncalculations are based on the per capita income of individual States \nrelative to the national per capita income. In this way, States with \nhigher per capita incomes end up paying a higher percentage of their \nMedicaid costs. This formula appears to work well for States near the \nnational norms for most economic indicators. It most certainly does not \nwork in the State of Alaska, however, where these economic indicators \nappear more frequently as statistical exceptions and outlyers.\n  The problem is fairly simple: it just costs more to do business in \nAlaska, and this includes health care. A national per capita income \nthreshold is not a fair indicator unless it takes into account the cost \nof living in that area. The cost-of-living adjustment for Federal \nemployees in Alaska suggests that it costs 25 percent more to live in \nAlaska than in the lower 48, and Federal employee salaries are adjusted \naccordingly. A dollar simply does not buy the same thing in Alaska that \nit does in the lower 48.\n  This is especially true for health care costs. Estimates suggest \nthat, on average, it costs up to 71 percent more to deliver health care \nservices in Alaska. American Hospital Association data shows that \nAlaska has the highest average expense per hospital admission of any \nState in the Nation. But let's talk real numbers again. If you were to \nbe admitted to a hospital in Oregon, on average the cost would be \n$6,649.00; in Alaska the same average hospital stay costs almost \ndouble, $10,859.00. There are also higher costs associated with limited \nroad access and necessary air ambulance service for rural and isolated \ncommunities, but the Medicaid FMAP formula does not consider any of \nthese additional costs.\n\n  In addition to the higher cost of services in Alaska, the Federal \nGovernment sets the poverty level 20 percent higher in Alaska than in \nany of the lower 48 States. This means 1 out of every 5 Alaskans is \neligible for Medicaid. The problem is that this is essentially an \nunfunded Federal mandate because the FMAP formula, again, does not \nchange to reflect this additional requirement. The higher demand for \nservices that results from the higher poverty level dilutes our \nresources. The Medicaid FMAP formula was developed before Alaska became \na State and does NOT provide the funds to cover all of those who are \neligible.\n  However, in 1997 and again in 2000, Congress recognized that the \nMedicaid FMAP formula was unfair for Alaska and enacted an adjustment \nto the formula. Due in part to this more equitable funding and a \ncareful re-allocation of resources, Alaska now: has the lowest age-\nadjusted death rate for breast cancer in the Nation; has one of the \nlowest infant mortality rates in the Nation; and has one of the lowest \npercentages of low birth weight babies in the Nation.\n  These are encouraging statistics, but more can and must be done to \nimprove access to quality health care. All disabled and low-income \nAmericans, including Alaskans, have been assured access to quality \nmedical care. Alaska has proven it can deliver this quality care, but \nonly with the necessary adjustment to the FMAP formula that recognizes \nthe reality of Alaska's needs.\n  This issue is timely because the Congress has the opportunity to \nallow the State of Alaska to plan for the future. Planning is the \nessence of good management, and when it comes to health care, we must \nallow States to plan for future needs. In short, the Federal Government \nmust remember its commitment to Alaskans, and allow my State a benefit \nthat all other states have, assurance that money for vital Medicaid \nservices will not just dry up and disappear.\n  Alaskans do not seek charity, we seek equity. The Congress has \nsupported this request twice before, and I ask for an additional \nextension to honor Federal commitments to my state. The legislation \nthat I am introducing today will permanently adjust the Medicaid \nformula for Alaska. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will support \nthis vital legislation that will preserve my State's ability to provide \nhealth insurance to the most vulnerable Alaskans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 295. A bill to amend the Denali Commission Act of 1998 to \nestablish the Denali transportation system in the State of Alaska; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to establish \nthe Denali Transportation System.\n  This bill in intended to help create in the same beneficial \ntransportation system in Alaska as exists for every other State in the \nUnion. It is patterned after a similar effort adopted years ago for the \nAppalachian region, which has demonstrated beyond any doubt that \ntransportation investment is wise investment.\n  The bill authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to establish a \nprogram to fund the costs of construction of the Denali Transportation \nSystem, at a level of $450 million per year from Fiscal Year 2004 \nthrough Fiscal Year 2009. As new roads are constructed, they will \nbecome part of the National Highway System.\n  As my colleagues are aware, Alaska's ability to develop a strong \neconomy for the benefit of the State and the nation is deeply impaired \nby the lack of transportation. This affects all aspects of life in the \n49th State, from the delivery of fuel and essential services to \nindividuals and families in our many remote villages, to our ability to \ndevelop Alaska's abundance of valuable natural resources. Only our \nmajor cities have modern roadways, and many of those remain isolated.\n  No State, or its citizens, can prosper without adequate \ntransportation systems. In much of the country, such systems have been \nin place since before\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\nthe American Revolution, and have been constantly changing, adapting \nand being upgraded ever since. In much of Alaska, in contrast, \nresidents are still forced to travel between communities by boat, or on \nfrozen rivers, just as they did when the Territory of Alaska was first \npurchased from Imperial Russia. In this day, and age, such a situation \nis completely unacceptable. It is a lasting mark of neglect, and it is \npast time to rectify it.\n  The Denali Transportation System will provide far greater benefits \nthan costs. As we enter an era where gigantic natural changes are \noccurring in the Arctic environment, and ice-free maritime \ntransportation through the Arctic Ocean is expected to become a reality \nwithin decades, it is critical that we begin to prepare ourselves for \nthose changes. Adequate transportation connections to, and within, \nAmerica's only Arctic State are imperative.\n  As we debate a Federal budget during a time when the economy is \nstruggling, let us not forget that the key to long-term prosperity is \nwise investment. Investing in Alaska is investing wisely. We have \nincomparable resources and vigorous citizens. It is time we have the \ntransportation system that will allow those assets to be used as they \nshould.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimously consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 295\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Defense to report to \nCongress regarding the requirements applicable to the inscription of \nveterans' names on the memorial wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Fairness to All \nFallen Vietnam War Service Members Act of 2003. Almost forty years ago, \nour country started sending a generation of young men off to fight in \nVietnam. Over 58,000 American soldiers gave their lives to their \ncountry in and around the lands, skies, and seas of Vietnam.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is based on language which I \npreviously introduced toward the end of the 107th Congress.\n  The ultimate sacrifices many of these men have made are honored on \nthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall here in Washington, D.C. There are, \nhowever, names that are missing from the wall, names that rightfully \nshould be there with their fallen fellow Americans. It is now time to \ncorrect that omission.\n  On the morning of June 3, 1969, the United States Destroyer, USS \nFrank E. Evans, was cut in half during a training exercise by the \nAustralian aircraft carrier, Melbourne. The front half of the destroyer \nsank in three minutes claiming the lives of seventy-four men.\n  While these men were not lost due to enemy fire, they were involved \nin serious combat only days before this tragedy. At the time of the \naccident, the USS Frank E. Evans was taking part in Operation Sea \nSpirit in the South China Sea which involved over 40 ships from \nSoutheast Asia Treaty Organization Nations. These brave men were \ninstrumental in forwarding American objectives in Vietnam.\n  The fact is these men died while serving their country and are due \nthe rights and honors they deserve, including being listed on the \nVietnam Memorial Wall.\n  Two of my fellow Coloradans, Brian Crowson and Del A. Francis were on \nboard that fateful morning and survived this horrible accident. Sadly, \n74 of their fellow sailors were not as fortunate.\n  At a time when we rightly honor heroes across our country, should we \nnot also take the necessary step to ensure that our past heroes are \nalso honored?\n  This legislation directs the Secretary of Defense to determine an \nappropriate manner to recognize and honor Vietnam Veterans who died in \nservice to our Nation but whose names were excluded from the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial Wall. It further asks for input from government \nagencies and organizations that originally constructed the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial Wall regarding the feasibility of adding additional \nnames. Finally, the bill asks for appropriate alternative options for \nrecognizing these veterans should it be deemed that there is no \nlogistical way to add these names.\n  As a veteran of the Korean War, I personally understand the ultimate \nsacrifice many of our brave men and women have made for the price of \nfreedom. This recognition should not be taken lightly.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues here in the Senate as \nwell as the USS Frank E. Evans Association so that we can pass this \nlong overdue legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 296\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness to All Fallen \n     Vietnam War Service Members Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Public Law 96-297 (94 Stat. 827) authorized the Vietnam \n     Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc., (the ``Memorial Fund'') to \n     construct a memorial ``in honor and recognition of the men \n     and women of the Armed Forces of the United States who served \n     in the Vietnam war''.\n       (2) The Memorial Fund determined that the most fitting \n     tribute to those who served in the Vietnam war would be to \n     permanently inscribe the names of the members of the Armed \n     Forces who died during the Vietnam war, or who remained \n     missing at the conclusion of the war, on a memorial wall.\n       (3) The Memorial Fund relied on the Department of Defense \n     to compile the list of individuals whose names would be \n     inscribed on the memorial wall and the criteria for inclusion \n     on such list.\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\n       (4) The Memorial Fund established procedures under which \n     mistakes and omissions in the inscription of names on the \n     memorial wall could be corrected.\n       (5) Under such procedures, the Department of Defense \n     established eligibility requirements that must be met before \n     the Memorial Fund will make arrangements for the name of a \n     veteran to be inscribed on the memorial wall.\n       (6) The Department of Defense determines the eligibility \n     requirements and has periodically modified such requirements.\n       (7) As of February 1981, in order for the name of a veteran \n     to be eligible for inscription on the memorial wall, the \n     veteran must have--\n       (A) died in Vietnam between November 1, 1955, and December \n     31, 1960;\n       (B) died in a specified geographic combat zone on or after \n     January 1, 1961;\n       (C) died as a result of physical wounds sustained in such \n     combat zone; or\n       (D) died while participating in, or providing direct \n     support to, a combat mission immediately en route to or \n     returning from such combat zone.\n       (8) Public Law 106-214 (114 Stat. 335) authorizes the \n     American Battle Monuments Commission to provide for the \n     placement of a plaque within the Vietnam Veterans Memorial \n     ``to honor those Vietnam veterans who died after their \n     service in the Vietnam war, but as a direct result of that \n     service, and whose names are not otherwise eligible for \n     placement on the memorial wall''.\n       (9) The names of a number of veterans who died during the \n     Vietnam war are not eligible for inscription on the memorial \n     wall or the plaque.\n       (10) Examples of such names include the names of the 74 \n     servicemembers who died aboard the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans (DD-\n     174) on June 3, 1969, while the ship was briefly outside the \n     combat zone participating in a training exercise.\n\n     SEC. 3. STUDY AND REPORT.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a study \n     that--\n       (1) identifies the veterans (as defined in section 101(2) \n     of title 38, United States Code) who died on or after \n     November 1, 1955, as a direct or indirect result of military \n     operations in southeast Asia and whose names are not eligible \n     for inscription on the memorial wall of the Vietnam Veterans \n     Memorial;\n       (2) evaluates the feasibility and equitability of revising \n     the eligibility requirements applicable to the inscription of \n     names on the memorial wall to be more inclusive of such \n     veterans; and\n       (3) evaluates the feasibility and equitability of creating \n     an appropriate alternative means of recognition for such \n     veterans.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to Congress a report based on the study conducted under \n     subsection (a). The report shall include--\n       (1) the reasons (organized by category) that the names of \n     the veterans identified under subsection (a)(1) are not \n     eligible for inscription on the memorial wall under current \n     eligibility requirements, and the number of veterans affected \n     in each category;\n       (2) a list of the alternative eligibility requirements \n     considered under subsection (a)(2);\n       (3) a list of the alternative means of recognition \n     considered under subsection (a)(3); and\n       (4) the conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary of \n     Defense with regard to the feasibility and equitability of \n     each alternative considered.\n       (c) Consultations.--In conducting the study under \n     subsection (a) and preparing the report under subsection (b), \n     the Secretary of Defense shall consult with--\n       (1) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;\n       (2) the Secretary of the Interior;\n       (3) the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc.;\n       (4) the American Battle Monuments Commission;\n       (5) the Vietnam Women's Memorial, Inc.; and\n       (6) the National Capital Planning Commission.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 297. A bill to provide reforms and resources to the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs to improve the Federal acknowledgement process, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Inouye in introducing the ``Federal Acknowledgment Process \nReform Act of 2003''.\n  Since 1997 I have offered changes to the Federal Acknowledgment \nProcess, FAP, which is the process by which Indian groups are \n``recognized'' by the United States as tribes.\n  Recognition of a tribal group as a tribe brings with it the \nprivileges, immunities and rights accorded to Indian tribes.\n  In recent years, the FAP has been described as ``broken'', ``too \nlengthy'', ``too costly'', ``without integrity'', ``not transparent'' \nand ``inconsistently applied'' to name but a few.\n  For petitioners that have waited literally generations for a final \nanswer on their application, the process is too lengthy.\n  For petitioners of modest means driven to seek the financial support \nof ``a backer'', the process is too costly.\n  For interested parties who feel compelled to file Freedom of \nInformation Act requests to secure information, the process is not \ntransparent.\n  And for the uninitiated and those not familiar with the governing \nlegal regime, the regulations do appear to be inconsistently applied.\n  The FAP has not been with us forever. In 1978, the Department of \nInterior established regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations, 25 \nCFR Part 83, to ``establish a departmental procedure and policy for \nacknowledging that certain American Indian groups exist as tribes.''\n  Since this administrative procedure was set up in 1978, over 270 \ngroups have petitioned under the regulations, with 18 groups being \nawarded acknowledgment as a tribe, and 19 groups having been denied.\n  This means that nearly 230 groups are still waiting to hear on their \npetitions.\n  For those who think the Branch of Acknowledgment and Research, BAR, \nis a serial grantor of recognition: just last week the Golden Hill \nPaugussett group in Connecticut was preliminarily denied \nacknowledgment.\n  The delays petitioners face have led to understandable frustration: \nthe Indian Affairs Committee has received testimony from groups where \nthe individuals that originally filed the petition have passed away, \nand the struggle is carried on by their children, and even \ngrandchildren.\n  Some petitioners have become so tired of waiting that they have sued \nthe Secretary of Interior and some courts have forced the BAR to \nproduce decisions by dates-certain.\n  Unfortunately this ``queue jumping'' has created adverse incentives, \nas more groups file lawsuits.\n  The kinks in the process have also caused understandable frustration \non the part of other, non-Indian groups. These frustrations have led to \nvoluminous Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, requests, and even \nlawsuits, as these groups have tried to secure information or seek a \nbetter understanding of the regulations.\n  As you might expect, once the lawsuits get started, paper starts \nchurning. The BAR staff testified to the Indian Affairs Committee that \ntheir anthropologists, genealogists and historians spend 40 percent of \ntheir time just making photo-copies in response to FOIA requests.\n  The bill I am introducing today will resolve many of the problems I \nhave described. It will do this first by introducing discipline into \nthe process. Under this bill would-be-petitioners must include enough \ninformation in their ``letter of intent'' so that the BAR and other \ninterested parties have a better idea of the context of the group. \nObtaining more information will better assist the Secretary of Interior \nin providing notices to the group and interested parties; and the bill \nrequires that such notices go out within 90 days, insuring timeliness.\n  Secondly, this bill will provide more resources to petitioners and \ninterested parties, based on the needs of the group or party, something \non which all observers of the process seem to be in agreement.\n  Third, this bill will provide more resources to the Department of \nInterior, another point on which there seems to be wide agreement.\n  I do not propose to merely throw more money at this problem. Instead, \nthe bill establishes a research pilot project that will draw upon \nindependent research institutions and consultation with the Smithsonian \nto expand the research capacity of the BAR.\n  The bill will also provide a resource to the Assistant Secretary that \nis sorely needed: an independent research and advisory board that can \nbe called on by the Assistant Secretary to act as a peer reviewer and a \nsecond source upon which the Assistant Secretary can base his \ndetermination on a petition.\n  This board will consist of certified professionals and will be \navailable to the Assistant Secretary: 1. at his discretion, if the \nAssistant Secretary and BAR disagree regarding whether particular \ncriterion have been met in a petition; and 2. to provide outside peer\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\nreview and a second opinion on a proposed final determination.\n  The board will give the Assistant Secretary greater assurance in the \nsoundness of his determination, and will provide a more solid \nfoundation for any later appellate review.\n  Finally, this bill will provide the certainty of a statutory basis \nfor the acknowledgment criteria that have been used by the BAR since \n1978.\n  There appears to be widespread acceptance of the substantive validity \nof the criteria, but questions have been raised regarding whether those \ncriteria should be codified. This bill answers that question \ndefinitively.\n  This bill addresses the criticisms of the FAP by increasing the \ntransparency, consistency and integrity of the process, and at the same \ntime removes some of the bureaucratic hurdles that have caused the \nprocess to be too costly and time-consuming.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important measure and ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 297\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Acknowledgment \n     Process Reform Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide tax relief and assistance for the families \nof the heroes of the Space Shuttle Columbia, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Saturday, February 1 was a sad day for \nAmerica, and a sad day for the world. In the blink of an eye, we lost \nthe cream of our astronaut corps when the Space Shuttle Columbia \ndisintegrated upon re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.\n  Our Nation and the world mourns the loss of these heroes: Lt. Col. \nMichael P. Anderson, U.S. Navy Capt. David Brown, U.S. Navy Commander \nLaurel Clark, Dr. Kalpana Chawla, U.S. Air Force Col. Rick Husband, \nNaval Commander William McCool, and Israeli Air Force Colonel Ilan \nRamon. The loved ones they left behind mourn the loss of fathers and \nmothers, sons and daughters, sisters, brothers, and friends.\n  We have a duty to those who lost their lives for the advancement of \nscience and increasing our knowledge of the world we live in: a duty \nfirst to find out what went wrong and make sure it never goes wrong \nagain, a duty to take up where they left off and continue exploring the \nunknowns of the universe, and just as importantly, a duty to help take \ncare of the loved ones they left behind.\n  After the horrible day of terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, \nCongress paid tribute to the lives lost in those attacks, and in the \nbombing in Oklahoma City and the anthrax attacks, by expanding certain \ntax benefits previously only available to soldiers who had been killed \nin combat zones. The benefits include income tax relief, an exclusion \nof death benefit payments, estate tax relief and a streamlining of the \nrules governing the distribution of funds by charitable organizations.\n  I believe the families of the heroes of the Columbia Shuttle mission, \nand families of astronauts that may be lost in the future, deserve no \nless.\n  Military or civilian employees of the U.S. who die as a result of \nterrorist or military activity outside the U.S., victims of the \nterrorist attacks of 9/11, of the Oklahoma City bombing and of the \npost-9/11 anthrax attacks, are generally exempt from income tax for the \nyear of death and the year prior to death. For those that have little \nincome tax liability, a minimum tax relief benefit of $10,000 is \nprovided.\n  Current law exempts from income tax certain death benefits paid by \nthe U.S. government to soldiers killed in the line of duty. The law \nalso generally excludes from income payments made by an employer to the \nfamilies of the victims of the terrorist attack of 9/11, Oklahoma City \nand the anthrax attacks. The exclusion does not apply to amounts that \nwould have been payable if the individual had died for a reason other \nthan the attack.\n  Current law also provides a reduction in Federal estate tax for \nsoldiers who are killed in action while serving in a combat zone, or as \na result of wounds, disease or injury suffered while serving in the \ncombat zone. Comparable benefits are also provided to the victims of 9/\n11, Oklahoma City and the anthrax attacks. The amount of benefit is \nequal to 125 percent of the 2001 State death tax credit amount, which \neffectively establishes a 20 percent estate tax bracket for those who \nqualify for this benefit.\n  And finally, we have a streamlined process for the distribution of \ncharitable donations to the families of the victims of 9/11, Oklahoma \nCity and the anthrax attacks. The key element of this process allows \norganizations that make payments in good faith using a reasonable and \nobjective formula which is consistently applied not to make a specific \nassessment of need prior to distributing funds so long as the payments \nserve a charitable class.\n  My legislation, the Assistance for Families of Space Shuttle Heroes \nAct, makes all of the above benefits available to the families of the \nfallen Columbia crew, as well as to other astronauts that may be killed \nin the line of duty in future years.\n  The seven members of the Columbia crew were true heroes. They are \ndeeply missed by their family and friends. Through their dedication to \nspace exploration, they lived their lives to the fullest and made long-\nlasting contributions to the nation and to the world.

A bill to modify the boundaries for a certain empowerment \nzone designation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp reverse the devastating population decline and economic distress \nthat has plagued individuals and businesses in Maine's northernmost \ncounty. Aroostook County. What the bill does is simple, it will bring \nall of Aroostook County under the Empowerment Zone program.\n  To fully grasp the importance of this legislation, it is necessary to \nunderstand the unique situation facing the residents of Aroostook \nCounty. ``The County'', as it is called by Mainers, is a vast and \nremote region of Maine known for its expansive forest tracts and rugged \nterrain. As the northernmost county, it shares more of its border with \nCanada than its neighboring Maine counties, and has the distinction of \nbeing the largest county east of the Mississippi River. Its geographic \nisolation is even more acute when considering that the county's \nrelatively small population of 76,000 people are scattered throughout \n6,672 square miles of rural countryside. There are 208 townships in \nAroostook County, however, well over half of the territory remains \nunorganized as forestland or wilderness.\n  Anyone traveling in Aroostook County can appreciate what these \nnumbers cannot fully convey. Visiting many remote communities in \nAroostook County by car requires navigating long distances on isolated \nroads, often in wintery conditions. Access by public ground \ntransportation is nonexistent, and air travel is accessible only in the \nCounty's two largest towns, each of which has less than 10,000 people.\n  As profound as this geographic isolation may seem, it is the economic \nisolation and out-migration that has had the most devastating impact on \nthe region. The economy of northern Maine has a historical dependence \nupon its natural resources, particularly forestry and agriculture. \nWhile these industries served the region well in previous decades, and \ncontinue to form the underpinnings of the local economy, many of these \nsectors have experienced decline and can no longer provide the number \nand type of quality jobs that residents need. The decline in the \nregion's economy was further punctuated by the closure of Loring Air \nForce Base in Limestone in 1994. The Maine State Planning Office \nestimated that the base closure resulted in the loss of 3,494 jobs \ndirectly related to the base and another 1,751 in associated industry \nsectors, for a total loss of $106.9 million annual payroll dollars.\n  While officials in the region have put forward a Herculian effort to \nredevelop the region, with nearly 1,000 new jobs at the Loring Commerce \nCenter alone--Aroostook County is still experiencing a significant \n``job deficit'', and as a result continues to lose population at an \nalarming rate. Since its peak in 1960, northern Maine's population has \ndeclined by 30 percent to its current level of 76,330. Unfortunately, \nthe Main State Planning Offset predicts that Aroostook County will \ncontinue losing population as more workers leave the area to seek \nopportunities and higher wages in southern Maine and the rest of New \nEngland.\n  In January 2002, a portion of Aroostook County was one of two regions \nthat received Empowerment Zone status from the USDA for out-migration. \nThe entire county experienced an out-migration of 15 percent from \n86,936 in 1990 to 76,330 in 2000. Moreover, a shocking 40 percent of 15 \nto 29-year olds left during the last decade.\n  The current zone boundaries were chosen based on the criteria that \nEmpowerment Zones be no larger than 1,000 square miles, contain no more \nthan 3 non-contiguous parcels, and have no more than three developable \nsites greater than 2,000 acres in aggregate. The lines drawn for the \nAroostook County Empowerment Zone were considered to be the most \ninclusive and reasonable given the constraints of the program. However, \nsome of the most distressed communities that have lost substantial \npopulation are not in the Empowerment Zone, and economic factors for \nthese communities are the same as those areas within the Empowerment \nZone.\n  The legislation I am introducing would provide economic development \nopportunities to all reaches of Aroostook County by extending \nEmpowerment Zone status to the entire county. This inclusive approach \nrecognizes that the economic decline and population\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\nout-migration are issues that entire region must confront, and, as \nevidenced by their successful Round III EZ application, they are \nattempting to confront. I believe the challenges faced by Aroostook \nCounty are significant, but not insurmountable. This legislation would \nmake great strides in improving the communities and business in \nnorthern Maine, and I urge my colleagues to join me to support this \nimportant bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Olympia Snowe, in introducing legislation that will modify the \nborders of the Aroostook County Empowerment Zone to include the entire \nCounty so that the benefits of Empowerment Zone designation can be \nfully realized in northern Maine.\n  The Department of Agriculture's Empowerment Zone program addresses a \ncomprehensive range of community challenges, including many that have \ntraditionally received little federal assistance, reflecting the fact \nthat rural problems do not come in standardized packages but can vary \nwidely from one place to another. The Empowerment Zone program \nrepresents a long-term partnership between the federal government and \nrural communities, ten years in most cases, so that communities have \nenough time to implement projects to build the capacity to sustain \ntheir development beyond the term of the partnership. An Empowerment \nZone designation gives designated regions potential access to millions \nof dollars in federal grants for social services and community \nredevelopment as well as tax and regulatory relief over a ten-year \nperiod.\n  Aroostook County is the largest county east of the Mississippi River. \nYet, despite the impressive character and work ethic of its citizens, \nthe County has fallen on hard times. The 2000 Census indicated a 15 \npercent loss in population since 1990. Loring Air Force Base, which was \nclosed in 1994, also caused an immediate out-migration of 8,500 people \nand a further out-migration of families and businesses that depended on \nLoring for their customer base.\n  Unfair trade practices have also struck a blow to the County's \neconomy. Aroostook shares more border miles with Canada than most \nnorthern states. It is bordered for approximately 280 miles to the \nwest, north and east by Canada. Canadian farmers and businesses have \nbeen extremely competitive in Aroostook business markets; as a result, \nfarmers have experienced a loss in sales which has caused a drop in the \npotato acreage planted, additional job loss, and still more people \nmigrating from Aroostook County. Aroostook's economic situation has \nbeen further worsened by the strong value of the Canadian dollar in \nrelation to the U.S. dollar and the restrictive personal exemption duty \nlimits that Canada imposes on its citizens when they make shopping \ntrips to U.S. businesses on the border.\n  In response to these developments, the Northern Maine Development \nCommission and other economic development organizations, the private \nbusiness sector, and community leaders in Aroostook have joined forces \nto stabilize, diversity, and grow the area's economy. They have \nattracted some new industries and jobs. As a native of Aroostook \nCounty, I can attest to the strong community support that will ensure a \nsuccessful partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  Designating this region of the United States as an Empowerment Zone \nis vital to its future economic prosperity. However, the restriction \nthat the Empowerment Zone be limited to 1,000 square miles prevents all \nof Aroostook's small rural communities from benefiting from this \ntremendous program. Aroostook covers some 6,672 square miles but has a \npopulation of only 74,000. Including all of the County in the \nEmpowerment Zone will guarantee that parts of the County will not be \nleft behind as economic prosperity returns to the area. It does little \ngood to have a company move from one community to another within the \nCounty simply to take advantage of EZ benefits.\n  America's greatest success can only be achieved when everyone has the \nopportunity to enjoy the fruits of a strong economy. It is only fair \nthat all of Aroostook County's population be given the opportunity to \nfully benefit from the Empowerment Zone Program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 300. A bill to award a congressional gold medal to Jackie Robinson \n(posthumously), in recognition of his many contributions to the Nation, \nand to express the sense of Congress that there should be a national \nday in recognition of Jackie Robinson; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to join today with my good \nfriend Senator McCain to introduce our bill to award Jackie Robinson \nthe Congressional Gold Medal. Bestowing upon Jackie Robinson this great \nhonor recognizes not only his stunning athletic accomplishments but \nalso his profound contribution to the advancement of civil rights in \nthe United States.\n  Jackie Roosevelt Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, in Cairo, GA \nand was the youngest of 5 children. Robinson attended the University of \nCalifornia at Los Angeles where he lettered in football, basketball, \nbaseball, and track, and he was widely regarded as the finest all-\naround athlete at that time. After a three-year stint in the U.S. Army, \nJackie Robinson began playing professional baseball, at first in the \nAmerican Negro League. Then in 1947, in a historic move that ended \ndecades of discrimination against blacks in baseball, Jackie Robinson \nbecame the first African-American to sign a Major League Baseball \ncontract. That same year he won the National League's Rookie of the \nYear Award. In 1949, he was voted the National League's Most Valuable \nPlayer by the Baseball Writers Association, and in 1962, he was elected \nto the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  Jackie Robinson's signing to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 is so \nsignificant because it came before the United States military was \ndesegregated, before the civil rights marches in the South, and before \nthe historic ruling in Brown v. The Board of Education, and it engaged \nthe American people in a constructive conversation about race. Off the \nfield Jackie Robinson was a business leader, a civil rights leader, and \na human rights leader. As one of the most popular people in America, in \none poll in 1947 he finished ahead of President Harry Truman, General \nDwight Eisenhower, General Douglas MacArthur, and Bob Hope, finishing \nonly behind Bing Crosby, Jackie Robinson encouraged the fair treatment \nof all people. His ideas and principles influenced some of America's \ngreatest politicians, including John F. Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower.\n  Jackie Robinson was more than a sports hero he was an American hero. \nAnd it is time for Congress to recognize his heroic contributions. On \nJanuary 31, 2003 on what would have been Jackie Robinson's 84th \nbirthday, a seminar entitled ``Red Sox Tribute to Jackie Robinson'' was \nheld at Fenway Park in Boston. During that tribute Larry Lucchino, \nPresident and CEO of the Boston Red Sox, aptly summed up Jackie \nRobinson's off-field contributions to American society. He said, \n``Martin Luther King once said that he could not do what he was doing \nunless Jackie Robinson had done what he did.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in honoring this great American by \ncosponsoring our bill to award him the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 300\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Jackie Roosevelt Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, \n     in Cairo, Georgia, and was the youngest of 5 children.\n       (2) Jackie Robinson attended the University of California \n     Los Angeles where he starred in football, basketball, \n     baseball, and track. His remarkable skills earned him a \n     reputation as the best athlete in America.\n       (3) In 1947, Jackie Robinson was signed by the Brooklyn \n     Dodgers and became the first black player to play in Major \n     League Baseball. His signing is considered one of the most \n     significant moments in the history of professional sports in \n     America. For his remarkable performance on the field in his\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\n     first season, he won the National League's Rookie of the Year \n     Award.\n       (4) In 1949, Jackie Robinson was voted the National \n     League's Most Valuable Player by the Baseball Writers \n     Association of America.\n       (5) In 1962, Jackie Robinson was elected to the Baseball \n     Hall of Fame.\n       (6) Although the achievements of Jackie Robinson began with \n     athletics, they widened to have a profound influence on civil \n     and human rights in America.\n       (7) The signing of Jackie Robinson as the first black \n     player in Major League Baseball occurred before the United \n     States military was desegregated by President Harry Truman, \n     before the civil rights marches took place in the South, and \n     before the Supreme Court issued its historic ruling in Brown \n     v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).\n       (8) The American public came to regard Jackie Robinson as a \n     person of exceptional fortitude, integrity, and athletic \n     ability so rapidly that, by the end of 1947, he finished \n     ahead of President Harry Truman, General Dwight Eisenhower, \n     General Douglas MacArthur, and Bob Hope in a national poll \n     for the most popular person in America, finishing only behind \n     Bing Crosby.\n       (9) Jackie Robinson was named vice president of Chock Full \n     O' Nuts in 1957 and later co-founded the Freedom National \n     Bank of Harlem.\n       (10) Leading by example, Jackie Robinson influenced many of \n     the greatest political leaders in America.\n       (11) Jackie Robinson worked tirelessly with a number of \n     religious and civic organizations to better the lives of all \n     Americans.\n       (12) The life and principles of Jackie Robinson are the \n     basis of the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which keeps his \n     memory alive by providing children of low-income families \n     with leadership and educational opportunities.\n       (13) The legacy and personal achievements of Jackie \n     Robinson, as an athlete, a business leader, and a citizen, \n     have had a lasting and positive influence on the advancement \n     of civil rights in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized \n     to present, on behalf of Congress, to the family of Jackie \n     Robinson, a gold medal of appropriate design in recognition \n     of the many contributions of Jackie Robinson to the Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a \n     gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, \n     to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the \n     Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the \n     gold medal struck under section 2 at a price sufficient to \n     cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, \n     dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS AS NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck under this Act are national medals for \n     purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) there should be designated a national day for the \n     purpose of recognizing the accomplishments of Jackie \n     Robinson; and\n       (2) the President should issue a proclamation calling on \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1910-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS--MONDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2003\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 41--HONORING THE MISSION OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE \n                                COLUMBIA\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayho, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Campbell, Ms. \nCantwell, Ms. Carper, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Corzine, \nMr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, \nMr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Graham of Florida, \nMr. Graham of South Carolinae, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Miller, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \nMr. Nickles, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \nSantorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \nSmith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, \nMr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Wyden) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate commemorates with deep sorrow and \n     regret the fate of the Columbia space shuttle mission and \n     when it adjourns today, it do so as a further mark of respect \n     to the astronauts who lost their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1910-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1910-S1911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 42--TO REFER S. 279, ENTITLED ``A BILL FOR THE RELIEF \n      OF THE HEIRS OF CLARK M.

PELHAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 43\n\n       Whereas Daniel W. Pelham became an employee of the Senate \n     of the United States on March 25, 1968, and since that date \n     has ably and faithfully upheld the high standards and \n     traditions of the staff of the Senate of the United States \n     for a period that included nineteen Congresses;\n       Whereas Daniel W. Pelham, through his diligence and \n     loyalty, has risen to the position of Senior Offices Services \n     Administrator within the Office of the Secretary of the \n     Senate;\n       Whereas Daniel W. Pelham has faithfully discharged the \n     difficult duties and responsibilities of his position as \n     Senior Offices Services Administrator with great efficiency, \n     devotion, and dedication;\n       Whereas he has earned the respect, affection, and esteem of \n     the United States Senate; and\n       Whereas Daniel W. Pelham will retire from the Senate of the \n     United States on February 4, 2003, after nearly thirty-five \n     years of employment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States commends \n     Daniel W. Pelham for his exemplary service to the Senate and \n     the Nation, and wishes to express its deep appreciation and \n     gratitude for his long, faithful, and outstanding service.\n       Sec. 2. That the Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a \n     copy of this resolution to Daniel W. Pelham.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 44--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING FEBRUARY 2, 2003, \n                 AS ``NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Murkowski, \nMr. Biden, and Mr. Reed) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 44\n\n       Whereas the American School Counselor Association has \n     declared the week beginning February 2, 2003, as ``National \n     School Counseling Week'';\n       Whereas the Senate has recognized the importance of school \n     counseling through the\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\n     inclusion of elementary and secondary school counseling \n     programs in the reauthorization of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       Whereas school counselors have long advocated that the \n     American education system must leave no child behind and must \n     provide opportunities for every student;\n       Whereas personal and social growth results in increased \n     academic achievement;\n       Whereas school counselors help develop well-rounded \n     students by guiding them through their academic, personal, \n     social, and career development;\n       Whereas school counselors were instrumental in helping \n     students, teachers, and parents deal with the trauma of \n     terrorism inflicted on the United States on September 11, \n     2001, and its aftermath;\n       Whereas students face myriad challenges every day, \n     including peer pressure, depression, and school violence;\n       Whereas school counselors are usually the only \n     professionals in a school building that are trained in both \n     education and mental health;\n       Whereas the roles and responsibilities of school counselors \n     are often misunderstood, and the school counselor position is \n     often among the first to be eliminated in order to meet \n     budgetary constraints;\n       Whereas the national average ratio of students to school \n     counselors of 561 to 1 is more than double the 250 to 1 ratio \n     recommended by the American School Counselor Association, the \n     American Counseling Association, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychological Association, and \n     other organizations; and\n       Whereas the celebration of ``National School Counseling \n     Week'' would increase awareness of the important and \n     necessary role school counselors play in the lives of the \n     Nation's students: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should designate the week beginning \n     February 2, 2003, as ``National School Counseling Week''.\n       (b) Proclamation.--The Senate requests the President to \n     issue a proclamation--\n       (1) designating the week beginning February 2, 2003, as \n     ``National School Counseling Week''; and\n       (2) calling on the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe the week with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities that promote awareness of the role \n     school counselors perform within the school and the community \n     at large to prepare students for fulfilling lives as \n     contributing members of society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/04/senate-section/article/S1911-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI: Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that a hearing has been \nscheduled before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to \nconsider the nomination of Joseph T.

PELHAM\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 43, which was \nintroduced earlier today by Majority Leader Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 43) to commend Daniel W. Pelham.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, only four of the Senate's current members \nwere serving on March 25, 1968, when Daniel Pelham first came to work \non the Senate side of Capitol Hill. Mr. Pelham--or Danny, as he is \nknown throughout the Senate community--has seen 237 senators come and \ngo during his time here.\n  Now, after nearly 35 years on the job, Danny has decided that it is \ntime for him to move on to other activities.\n  A native of Wilmington, NC, Danny Pelham quickly demonstrated his \ntalents as an effective, loyal, and hardworking employee. In 1975, he \nmoved from the staff of the Senate Restaurant to the Office of the \nSecretary of the Senate. A series of well-deserved promotions followed \nuntil he reached his current position as Senior Office Services \nAdministrator.\n  One of his colleagues recently explained that ``by virtue of his \nlongevity and institutional knowledge, Pelham is indispensable to the \nstaff who rely on him for all manner of tasks.'' Another person will \nmove into Danny's job, but no one will fully replace him.\n  In his off-hours, Danny officiates at high school and recreational \nleague basketball games. Several years ago, he received the Cardinal \nBasketball Association Commissioner's Award for excellence in \nofficiating. In the years ahead, he plans to do more officiating and a \nfair amount of traveling.\n  We know, for certain, that Danny Pelham will settle into another \nhighly rewarding activity--that of spending enjoyable hours with his \ngrandson Corey. We wish Danny and his wife Phyllis many happy years \nahead.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe\n\n[[Page S1912]]\n\ntable, and any statements regarding the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 43) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 43\n\n       Whereas Daniel W.
