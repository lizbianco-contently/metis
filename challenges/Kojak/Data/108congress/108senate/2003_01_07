Today is an awesome time of dedication for the \nSenators-elect who will make an unreserved commitment to You, our \nbeloved Nation, and our cherished Constitution. Give them a vision of \ntheir potential greatness as leaders; make them riverbeds for the flow \nof Your wisdom. Thank You for the families that nurtured them, the \nmentors who help them realize their talents and the power of Your \ngifts, and the loved ones who now stand by them to uphold and sustain \nthem. May the vows they are about to take engender in them true \nhumility. Save them from the seduction of power, political \naggrandizement, and the bogus might of manipulation. With only You to \nplease, set them free to speak truth, honed by study and prayer, to \ndiscern what is right and do it regardless of who gets the credit, to \nbe distinguished for their integrity. All of the Senators and Officers \nof the Senate join with these new Senators once again in putting You \nand their families first, the good of the Nation second, consensus \naround truth, third; party loyalties, fourth; and, last of all, \npersonal success. The time for greatness is now; the place for \ngreatness is here; and the secret of greatness is in constant \ndependence on Your guidance and strength!

Mr. President, 35 of our colleagues have just sworn the \noath of a United States Senator. I wish to congratulate all 35 of our \ncolleagues, the 11 new Members and the 24 returning to this Chamber. I \nalso want to welcome back to the Senate the rest of our esteemed \ncolleagues, the former Members and the many friends that we have with \nus today, and family members--all who have joined us on what is truly a \nhistoric day as we convene the 108th Congress.\n  The very special tradition that we have just witnessed dates back to \nthat first Congress in 1789, when that oath was a very simple one \nsentence, the oath being:\n\n       I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of \n     the United States.\n  Those words in the version that we just heard recited--when you come \ndown to the essence--are a truly sacred bond that we all share in this \nbody, regardless of what status, what State, what party, or what rank \nand what creed we represent.\n  Indeed, it is my hope that in this Congress we will be defined by \nachievement as well as a cooperative spirit.\n  At this point in time, our Nation faces truly historic challenges--\nwinning the war against terror, boosting economic growth, job creation, \naddressing multiple health care challenges that now have become crises, \nand ensuring our agenda is inclusive of all Americans.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues both on our side of the \naisle and on the other side of the aisle--in particular with my \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle--to ensure that we \nsucceed. I am convinced that we will find, based on our own principles, \ncommon ground to bridge this aisle between us.\n  As majority leader of the Senate, I pledge to serve this body, to \nserve the people of Tennessee, and to serve the American people to the \nbest of my ability. I will remain guided by those same timeless \nprinciples of our founding documents. And, above all, I hope to enable \nthis body to continue to contribute to the greatness of all Americans.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I have little doubt that we will be led well, and we will be led \nfairly. I look forward to working with him, as I know my whole caucus \ndoes as well.\n  I also congratulate our 35 returning colleagues--those 11 new Members \nand 24 Senators who are returning. There can be no more awesome \nresponsibility than to sit at these historic desks--especially as we \nbegin the 108th Congress.\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\n  Let me also thank my colleagues for their support, for their \nencouragement, and for the friendship they have given me these many \nmonths and years. At this time in particular in my life, I am \nextraordinarily grateful for that. I wish to express that in the most \nheartfelt way.\n  The 107th Congress was filled with history--filled in the way we \nelected a President, the way we governed as a 50-50 Senate, and in the \nway we addressed so many issues. I have no doubt that the momentous \ndecisions made during the 107th Congress will be recorded and reported \nand analyzed and considered for generations to come. We begin a new \nCongress and a new day with a new spirit and a new mood for the \nrecognition of new responsibilities and a new opportunity to write \nhistory.\n  Just yesterday, as I was coming back from South Dakota, an older \nwoman stopped me in the airport. She pulled me at my arm. And she said: \nSenator Daschle, do your best. Do your best, and remember that history \nis in your hands.\n  I think that is our charge--to do our best, to recognize that history \nis now in our hands, and that as we face the challenges and the \nresponsibilities as Senators in the 108th Congress, I hope we can look \nback with satisfaction, with pride and with a realization that, indeed, \nwe did our best.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 23, an unemployment insurance \nextension bill introduced today by Senators Fitzgerald, Clinton, and \nothers; further, that the bill be read the third time and passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \none amendment in order which would provide benefits for those who have \npreviously exhausted their Federal unemployment benefits--approximately \n1 million Americans and over 150,000 New Yorkers--that there be a time \nlimitation on the amendment of 30 minutes for debate, equally divided \nin the usual form, and that no other amendments or motions be in order \nto the bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, a number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have been very aggressively working \non this legislation for, indeed, several months and most intensively \nover the last several days. I believe we have reached a bipartisan \nagreement to allow us to pass the bill today so that the House will \nconsider it and in order for it to become public law this week.\n  As most of my colleagues in the Senate Chamber know, if this bill is \nnot passed by Thursday and signed by the President of the United \nStates, there will be tremendous dislocation among the American people. \nWith that, I urge that we proceed with the underlying unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Is there objection to the initial \nrequest?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thank \nthe majority leader for bringing this very important matter to the \nfloor so early in our session. I also thank my colleague from Oklahoma, \nSenator Nickles, for working with me and others over the last week to \ntry to reach consensus. While I do not object at all to this final \nbill--in fact, I am a lead Democratic sponsor--I would point out that \npassage of this bill, as important as it is, will leave many, many \npeople without any means of support, and I think that we must turn our \nattention to these people who have exhausted their benefits. I look \nforward to working with the majority and minority leader in doing so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nsimply also commend those responsible for bringing the resolution to \nthis point. We could have accomplished this in the last Congress, but \nwe were unable to complete our work. I remind my colleagues that by \nsimply passing this resolution we are leaving out over 1 million people \nwho have absolutely no recourse and have no assistance whatsoever \nbecause their benefits have expired. We are leaving them out. This will \nonly address those who are about to see their benefits expire--about \none-half of the 1 million people who otherwise would be eligible for \nthese benefits.\n  To simply say we are doing half means that we are doing half the job. \nWe are leaving half on the table. We are leaving 1 million people with \nabsolutely no recourse in their efforts to try to bring about any \nquality of life in these difficult times.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reconsider. We will continue to offer this \nwith the hope that we can find some resolution, that we can include all \n2 million unemployed workers, and that we do so as quickly as is \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I \nunderstand it, if we do not accept the unanimous consent request \nproposed by the Senator from New York, we will leave 1 million \nAmericans without unemployment compensation benefits at a time they \ndesperately need it. I also understand her amendment simply calls for \n30 minutes of debate and a vote. I think it would be appropriate to \nvote.\n  If the majority leader can give us some indication as to when we will \ndeal with the issue of these 1 million people who will be without \nbenefits, I think it might help us as we try to respond and decide on \nthis issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, while the Senators who had expressed their concerns \nmay be correct, I believe we should commend those who have worked so \nhard to get this bill here, and our majority leader for bringing it up \ntoday because, while we wait to do some more, if more is needed, we \nwill leave all of the unemployed without any new benefits. That is the \nissue. To do it today is to do it the way it is proposed. To debate it, \nor send it back to committee for refinement, means none of them will \nget benefits--not only those who have run out of benefits, but there \nwill be no extension and no money.\n  I believe it is good that we comment, but it is better that we \nproceed and get the bill done.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to our taking a recess, we begged the \nadministration to do something to allow us to pass unemployment \nbenefits for the people we knew would be out of unemployment benefits. \nWe in Nevada now have thousands of people who need those benefits. I \nheard my friend from New York say there are 150,000 people who need \nthem in her State. I believe that is the figure she used. But \nregardless, there are thousands and thousands of people all over this \ncountry, adding up to a million, who need these benefits.\n  We on this side of the aisle believe we should do everything. I have \nto respectfully say to my friend, the majority leader, and his \ncolleagues, the reason they are not going to allow us to vote is we \nwould win the vote. We would win if we were allowed to vote to include \nall 2 million people who are desperately in need of these unemployment \nchecks. We would win the vote.\n  I do not believe we should adjourn today until this matter is \nresolved. We want a vote. The people of America want a vote. The people \nwe are leaving out are the ones who are in most need. There is no \nquestion the people we would help by passing this resolution need the \nhelp, but the million people are those who are chronically unemployed \nand are in desperate need of help.\n  We should not adjourn today until we are allowed to have a vote on \nthis most\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nimportant resolution with the amendment that has been offered by the \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is \nimportant that we take care of these individuals who will be left out \nwithout the amendment by Senator Clinton. The issue is, unemployment \nbenefits not only help these individuals who have lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own--whether it is the Boeing Company in a \ndownturn or other people impacted by 9/11 who have lost their jobs and \nneed these unemployment benefits--but more importantly, unemployment \nbenefits are also an economic stimulus. Economists have said every $1 \nspent on unemployment insurance generates $2.15 of economic stimulus.\n  I can think of no better package for us to support in a bipartisan \nfashion than putting more dollars into our local economies that are \nhurting. I know our State, with one of the highest unemployment rates \nin the country, has an economic forecast that says the next 6 months \nwill not get any better. So if not today, I say to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, when will we realize this is an economic \nstimulus package that we must support.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, my understanding is this unemployment \nextension mirrors the unemployment extension we did in the last session \nof Congress. We extended benefits for 13 weeks.\n  There are some for which the 26 weeks plus the 13 weeks have expired. \nI assume the million people we are talking about are those people in \nplaces where there is not high unemployment, who do not qualify for an \nadditional 13 weeks above the 13 weeks that have already been extended.\n  As you know, under this bill, as under the prior bill, in States \nwhere there are high rates of unemployment, people do get 26 weeks, the \n13 plus 13. So what you are talking about is a million people, in \nplaces where there are lower rates of unemployment, not getting an \nadditional 13 weeks on top of the 13 weeks they now get on top of the \n26 weeks which the original unemployment act provided.\n  So when we talk about people being left out, what we are talking \nabout is a change in what the original extension is. I am not too sure \nthat is being left out. Those are people who went through their 26 \nweeks, went through their 13 weeks, and have still not been able to \nfind a job but are not in States with high unemployment.\n  So what we are doing is extending last year's unemployment benefits \nto this year. I think that is a fair way to start. It is a way to get \nthings done. If you want to change unemployment extension and turn it \ninto 26 weeks, we can have that debate. But to suggest we are leaving \npeople out, I am not too sure that is really what is factually \nhappening in this situation.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response to the question by the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, it is clear we are not solving the problem today. \nBecause of the reality of scheduling, and in part because of what \nhappened in the last Congress, we are faced with the reality that if we \ndo not act today, there are going to be as many as 750,000 people who \nwill have a disruption in benefits as of Thursday. I believe the House \nis going out tomorrow.\n  We have a compromise on both sides of the aisle we have been working \non that was agreed to--worked on by Senators Clinton, Fitzgerald, \nNickles, Specter, Cantwell, and a range of people.\n  I understand what we are doing today, if this is accepted by \nunanimous consent, is taking care of the 750,000 people who will be \nable to continue to receive their benefits. I know there is a lot more \nto do.\n  I am not sure it is necessary to go over everything that is in the \nbill. Basically, what the compromise does is extend unemployment \nbenefits from December 28--which was while we were all out on \nvacation--up until June 1, 2003, which is an additional 5 months of \ncoverage. That is what we would be agreeing to today, well recognizing \nthere are other issues in addition to this that we are going to have to \ndo as we go forward on this issue.\n  The compromise, I should also add, since some of the details were \nbrought up, also provides coverage allowing benefits to be phased out \nrather than just shut off immediately when the program ends.\n  President Bush has made it very clear that the extension of \nunemployment benefits is a top priority. On both sides of the aisle, we \nhave tried to come together. Given the circumstances of having been on \nour recent holiday, I would like to see us respond in a timely manner, \nmeaning now, through the unanimous consent request, recognizing there \nis more work to do as we go forward.\n  The President, as we speak, or in the last hours, has addressed other \nparts of reemployment. At the end of the day, people want the checks, \nbut what they really want are the jobs. There are other ways we will \ncontinue to address that in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues, very soon, to take the regular order--I will \nnot call for it at this point--so we can take this first important step \nvery significant to the American people, many of whom are not going to \nsee their checks unless we act, and act today.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of extending the \ntemporary extended unemployment compensation program.\n  In March of last year, Congress enacted the ``Job Creation and Worker \nAssistance Act of 2002.'' This Act created a temporary program to \nprovide additional unemployment benefits to workers in every State.\n  Specifically, this program provided up to 13 weeks of federally \nfunded employment benefits for workers who become unemployed and \nexhaust their regular State unemployment benefits. In addition, the \nprogram provided up to 13 weeks of additional benefits in high \nunemployment States--that's a maximum of 26 weeks.\n  When this extended benefit program was originally enacted last year, \nit was scheduled to expire at the end of 2002.\n  Unfortunately, the economy has not performed as well as we all hoped \nand the unemployment rate in many States continued to rise throughout \nlast year.\n  As my colleagues may recall, the Senate agreed to a unanimous consent \nrequest last year to extend the deadline. Unfortunately, the 107th \nCongress adjourned before reaching a final agreement on the extension.\n  So, we are here again today seeking unanimous consent to extend the \ntemporary extended unemployment compensation program.\n  This agreement which has been cosponsored by Senators Fitzgerald, \nSpecter, Collins, Gregg, Nickles, and Clinton would provide a 5-month \nextension of the program through the end of May. This agreement has \nbeen reached in consultation with the House Leadership.\n  I believe a 5-month extension is an appropriate timeframe to see how \nthe economy will perform this year, as well as give Congress the \nopportunity to consider further economic stimulus legislation.\n  Our goal should be make sure that everyone who wants a job gets a \npaycheck, instead of just an unemployment check.\n  I also believe it is important to point out that although the program \nexpired last week, if we can get this measure through the House and \nonto the President's desk by Thursday, no one will miss a check.\n  Unemployment benefits are the bridges that help people get from one \njob to another. These benefits are not huge, but they're certainly \nbetter than nothing for those who are out of work and desperately \nlooking for jobs. People have to put food on the table. They have to \nheat their homes. They have to buy their kids clothes, shoes and school \nsupplies. Their needs are immediate, and they need immediate relief.\n  While Congress is approving unemployment benefits, we need to do \neverything in our power to create jobs. I don't mean just any jobs, but \nquality opportunities that pay enough income to sustain families and \nbuild careers. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the \nPresident on creating jobs. Americans are the world's greatest \nworkforce. Folks need and deserve\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\nto use their abilities and skills to the fullest.\n  According to the Department of Labor, more than 780,000 individuals \nwere collecting extended benefits in mid-December. If we act now to \nextend this program, workers who qualified before December 28th will be \nable to continue receiving their weekly benefit check without \ninterruption.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today \nas cosponsor of the measure that will extend unemployment insurance \nbenefits. We have a long bipartisan tradition of extending unemployment \nbenefits during periods of prolonged joblessness. We have this policy \nbecause it is the right thing to do for people and for the economy. \nBefore I present the case for why extended unemployment benefits are \nneeded--a case which by now almost everyone agrees with--I want to \nremind my colleagues why we are at this point today.\n  Led by the late Senator Wellstone, several of my colleagues and I, \nbegan this discussion last September. At that point it appeared clear \nthat this economy was still in a weak, `jobless recovery.' Yet, the \nadministration failed to understand the basic economic reality, and \nconsequently refused to support an extension of benefits. During the \nnext 2 months the economy remained weak and more jobs were lost. My \ncolleagues and I returned to the Senate floor repeatedly, attempting to \npass a reasonable extension of unemployment insurance benefits. We \nasked for unanimous consent eight times, each time pointing out the \nweak economy, the lack of job creation, the growing number of Americans \nwho had exhausted their benefits, and the upcoming cliff that more \nAmericans were facing, should Congress fail to act. All this while the \nPresident remained silent.\n  Finally, at the eleventh hour of the last Congress, on November 14, \nwe came to an agreement within the Senate. And I would like to thank \nSenators Clinton, Cantwell and Nickles for their leadership in reaching \nthat compromise. That compromise was needed in order to prevent almost \n1 million Americans who should have received benefits from having their \nbenefits terminated. But even that compromise, which passed the Senate \nby unanimous consent, failed to elicit the support of the President. \nAnd without his urging the House failed to act.\n  Now finally, today we are passing this compromise again. Actually we \nare passing a slightly improved version which will last for five \nmonths, providing individuals with the opportunity to begin receiving \nextended benefits until June 1st, and allowing all of those who begin \nto receive their benefits to receive the full 13 weeks, in the event \nthat they are unable to find a job. And it is my understanding that if \nthe House acts on this tomorrow, and the President signs this measure \nby Thursday, that everyone who should receive a benefit will continue \nto do so.\n  However, even with passage of this measure, there is still \nsignificant work that needs to be done. This legislation, despite the \nvaliant efforts of some of my colleagues, fails to provide benefits to \nthose who have already exhausted their benefits and are still unable to \nfind a job. There are an estimated 1 million Americans who are in such \na position. They are in such a position because the economy has \ncontinued to remain weak and is failing to create jobs.\n  The latest unemployment report showed unemployment at an 8 year high \nof six percent. We have 2.17 million fewer private sector jobs today \nthan when President Bush took office. We lost 48,000 private sector \njobs last month alone.\n  As a result of the lack of jobs, there are over 1.7 million Americans \nwho have been unemployed and looking for work for more than 26 weeks. \nThere are 150,000 more long-term unemployed than in September and over \n1 million more than when President Bush took office. Over 20 percent of \nthose who are unemployed have been so for more than 26 weeks, a greater \npercentage than at any point in the past eight years.\n  The premise of the unemployment insurance system is that you give \npeople some short-term support, the labor market picks up, and they can \ngo back and find a job. Today, they cannot find jobs. In fact, not only \ncan they not find them, more people are losing their jobs. So the labor \nmarket is contracting, not expanding. Extending benefits in this \nsituation is the proper economic policy. Fed Chairman Greenspan, before \nthe Joint Economic Committee this past November stated: ``I have always \nargued that in periods like that the economic restraints on the \nunemployment insurance system almost surely ought to the eased.''\n  This easing ought to include extending benefits to those who have \nalready exhausted all of their benefits. I can not understand why \nanyone is objecting to extending benefits to these individuals. It is \nnot because we lack the resources to extend benefits. Extending \nbenefits to these individuals is projected to cost around $7.5 billion. \nOur unemployment insurance trust funds, specifically designed to meet \nthis kind of situation, are in strong financial condition with \napproximately $24 billion. Those moneys have been paid into the trust \nfund over a period of time. The whole system was structured to have \nthese trust funds build up in good times, and then to utilize them in \nbad times.\n  We will spend much time debating the wisdom of various economic \nstimulus plans over the coming months, but one thing that everyone \nshould be able to agree on is the stimulative effects of extending \nunemployment insurance benefits. As the Baltimore Sun wrote in an \neditorial on January 3, 2003, ``Few dispute the clear returns from \ndirecting short-term relief to those who lose their jobs as a result of \nthe fiscal turbulence. Giving money to people who need it to pay their \nbills ensures that it will be spent and multiply as it ripples through \nthe economy.''\n  In closing, I would like to thank all of those who have worked so \nhard to pass the measure that we passed today. As a result many \nAmericans will receive the benefits that they deserve and our economy \nwill receive some of the stimulus that it needs. And I will continue to \nwork to extend benefits to the 1 million Americans who have exhausted \ntheir unemployment insurance coverage.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Act. On December 28, 2002, the Federal \nGovernment played Scrooge to nearly 800,000 Americans. We left town, \nand we left a lot of people holding no money for the new year. Because \nthe House of Representatives failed to pass an extension of \nunemployment benefits, 780,000 unemployed Americans--including 10,000 \nunemployed Marylanders--had their benefits abruptly cut off just a few \ndays after Christmas.\n  Yet the story gets even worse. One million Americans have already \nexhausted both Federal and state aid without finding a new job, and 2 \nmillion are expected to run out of state benefits in the next five \nmonths. We must act now to help these working Americans who have been \nhardest hit by the economic downturn.\n  That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Emergency Unemployment \nCompensation Act. This bill will give immediate assistance to those who \nneed it most and it will put money back into the economy to keep it \ngoing. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act will help nearly \n2.85 million Americans who are facing the highest unemployment rate \nsince the recession during the first Bush Administration. It will \nrestore benefits for those who were unfairly cut off in December and it \nwill help those who will lose their benefits in the next five months. \nIt will provide relief for approximately 30,000 people in my own state \nof Maryland who still have not been able to find a job.\n  Extending UI not only helps those who are hardest hit by bad economic \ntimes, it also helps turn the economy around. A good economic stimulus \nputs money in the hands of the people who will spend it. That is \nprecisely what the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act does. \nWorkers who have lost their jobs because of September 11th or the \neconomic downturn will spend this money. They will spend it on \nnecessities, like rent and food, to keep the economy going. This bill \nwill inject $7.25 billion into the economy as an immediate stimulus. I \nbelieve this will do more to help the people and stimulate the economy \nthan the across the board tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\n  I am so pleased that the Senate is ready to pass this bill. But this \nmeasure doesn't go far enough. As long term unemployment balloons due \nto the weak economy, we can't forget about the 1 million Americans who \nhave already exhausted both Federal and state unemployment benefits and \nhave still not found a job. These people have no income, and now they \nhave no safety net. I urge my colleagues to provide an additional 13 \nweeks of extended unemployment benefits for these Americans.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate to \npass the extension of the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation, \nTEUC, Program.\n  In November, the Senate acted unanimously to extend the TEUC program \nthrough the end of March by passing a bill that I cosponsored along \nwith Senators Clinton, Cantwell, Specter, Sarbanes, Kennedy, and \nDurbin. However, the House and Senate were unable to reach a compromise \nthat would have allowed President Bush to sign the extension into law. \nThis is our last chance to act before there is an interruption in the \nreceipt of benefits pursuant to the TEUC program.\n  November 2002, the nationwide unemployment level shot up to 6.0 \npercent from 5.7 percent in October. The law authorizing the TEUC \nprogram expired on December 28, 2002. If we do not act now to extend \nthis program, as many as 800,000 workers who are receiving temporary \nbenefits will not receive their full 13 weeks of extended unemployment \nbenefits. 1.6 million workers will exhaust their regular unemployment \nbenefits between December 28, 2002 and the end of May 2003 if we fail \nto act. If we act today to extend this important program, we will \nensure that these workers will receive their next unemployment check.\n  The unemployment situation in my home State of Illinois is critical. \nIt would be particularly adversely affected if we do not act. In \nNovember 2002, Illinois had a 6.7-percent unemployment rate, tying \nMississippi with the third highest unemployment rate in the country \nbehind Alaska and Oregon. Illinois' rate was substantially higher than \nthe nationwide 6.0-percent unemployment rate. Over the 3-month period \nfrom September through November 2002, the average unemployment rate in \nIllinois was 6.6 percent, which is significantly higher than the \nnational average of 5.8 percent over the same period. In November, \nthere were 416,200 unemployed persons in Illinois.\n  I have introduced legislation that would extend the provisions of the \nTemporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 to allow \nindividuals receiving benefits to continue collecting them until they \nexpire in full. This bill is retroactive, and permits people who \notherwise would have had their TEUC benefits cut off on December 28 to \nreceive the full 13 weeks of TEUC benefits. Furthermore, this \nlegislation would make individuals who have exhausted their regular 26 \nweeks of unemployment insurance eligible for a 13-week extension, and \nwould allow these individuals to apply for such extensions through the \nend of May. Under my bill, even those who enrolled in the TEUC program \njust prior to the expiration of the program would be eligible to \nreceive full 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits.\n  This bill is a more generous extension of the TEUC program than the \nextension that the Senate approved last November. It provides for 5-\nmonth extension of the temporary unemployment insurance program, which \nis more than the 3 months of benefits provided by the extension that \nthe Senate passed last year. Passing this legislation will help \nmillions of families nationwide, easing the burden that these families \nmight otherwise experience if their unemployment insurance were to have \nexpired on December 28, 2002. It will help unemployed Americans feed \ntheir families and pay their bills while giving them an additional 5 \nmonths to find new jobs.\n  I would like to thank the Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nhave helped to negotiate this bipartisan compromise bill that will \nextend unemployment insurance benefits to the millions of Americans who \nneed them.\n  President Bush has called upon us to quickly pass legislation that \nwill extend the TEUC program, a program whose benefits fell off a cliff \non December 28, 2002. I urge may colleagues in the Senate to support \nthis necessary legislation. I also urge the House of Representatives to \ntake up and pass this bill in an expeditious manner so that President \nBush can sign the measure into law by this Thursday and prevent any \ninterruption in the receipt of temporary unemployment insurance \nbenefits.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I fully appreciate the suggestion made by \nthe distinguished Republican leader, the majority leader. Clearly, we \nhave to resolve what we can resolve. I know a good deal of effort has \nbeen put forth in getting us to this point. But that does not \nacknowledge the urgency with which we have to address all of those \npeople who are not considered in this resolution.\n  The Senator mentioned the fact that our Republican colleagues in the \nHouse have chosen to recess tomorrow. You do not have the luxury of \nrecessing if you are unemployed. You do not have the luxury of \nrecessing if there is no other option for you but to seek unemployment \ncompensation.\n  I hope, as Senator Reid has suggested, that we continue to find a way \nthis afternoon to address this second group of people who need \nhelp, this 750,000 to 1 million people who are not covered in this \nresolution. I think he is right. I don't think we ought to leave until \nwe get the job done this afternoon. There is no reason why we can't \ncomplete our work on both groups today, and I urge my colleagues to \nstay until we get the job done.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to my friend and colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Go ahead.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have to talk about what is doable. If \npeople want to revisit what we did last year, I am happy to do that. We \npassed temporary Federal unemployment compensation extension last March \nor April. We passed that. It was a benefit. It passed overwhelmingly in \nthe Congress. It expired on December 28. Several people said we need to \nextend that. Last year some people wanted to double the program from a \n13-week Federal program to 26 weeks. This Senator, along with others, \nobjected to that. The cost of that program or expansion was about $17- \nor $18 billion. I objected to it several times. I will object to it \ntoday.\n  What I did agree to and what this Senate passed last year was a \nsimple extension of present law. We agreed, Senator Clinton and myself, \nSenator Fitzgerald, Senator Specter, Senator Cantwell--by unanimous \nvote, the Senate agreed to a 3-month extension of the present program. \nThat passed the Senate. It did not pass the House. The cost of that \nprogram was about $4.9 billion. The House had passed a program that \ncost a little less than $1 billion. I tried to work out the differences \nbetween the House and the Senate late in the legislative session. I was \nnot successful. Some of us have been working, frankly, for some period \nof time trying to get something done now.\n  We have a letter from the Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao. I ask \nunanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.\n\n\n                                           Secretary of Labor,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: Although the economy is showing some \n     positive signs, we believe that a short extension of \n     Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) benefits \n     is needed to give many unemployed workers continued access to \n     the necessities of life while they look for new jobs. As the \n     108th Congress convenes, we urge you to quickly pass an \n     extension of the TEUC program retroactive to December 28, \n     2002. The only way for states to continue paying TEUC \n     benefits without disruption is if a bill is presented to the \n     President for signature no later than Thursday, January 9, \n     2003.\n       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to have a \n     member of your staff contact Mr. Anthony Bedell, Senior \n     Legislative\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\n     Officer, Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental \n     Affairs, who will coordinate a departmental response. Mr. \n     Bedell can be reached at (202) 693-4600.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Elaine L. Chao.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. The essence of the letter says the only way for States \nto continue paying temporary unemployment compensation benefits without \ndisruption is if a bill is presented to the President for signature no \nlater than Thursday, January 9, the day after tomorrow.\n  We had to resolve the differences between the House and the Senate. \nThe Senate passed a $4.9 billion bill; the House passed a $1 billion \nbill. We have worked with our colleagues in the House. I think we have \nbeen successful. I believe we have been successful in getting them to \naccept a straight extension of present law.\n  We were originally talking 3 months. After negotiations with the \nHouse, I consulted with my colleague and friend from New York and said, \nlet's make it a 5-month extension. So we extended the program all the \nway through May, and then the phaseout would occur. So there would not \nbe a shutoff date as there was December 28, a much better transition. \nIt was my understanding that colleagues had agreed upon this 5-month \nextension. The cost of this proposal is estimated to be $7.2, $7.3 \nbillion on a 2002 scoring base. It might go up if benefits go up on the \ncalendar year. It might even be a little bit more than that.\n  That is a significant change that I believe we have the House \nconcurring with to pass. We will not pass and they will not concur with \na doubling of the program to 26 weeks. I will not agree with it, and I \ndon't believe my House colleagues will, either.\n  If we are going to provide unemployment compensation extension \nbenefits so it would be a seamless transition, so those people who are \npresently receiving Federal temporary unemployment compensation, if \nthey are in this 13-week window, one week or 10, that they could \ncontinue to receive benefits without missing a week, we need to pass \nit. We need to pass it today. It needs to go to the House, and it needs \nto go to the President by Thursday for his signature. The only way that \nwill happen will be by unanimous consent.\n  I believe the only bill that will pass will be basically a clean \nextension of present law, and I believe the proposal we have before us \nis deserving of all of our support, just as the bill we passed last \nNovember, maybe October, we passed by unanimous consent a 3-month \nextension, this is a unanimous consent extension for 5 months with a \nphaseout.\n  I urge my colleagues not to object to the majority leader's unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me just see if we can resolve this issue. We have \ntwo questions. One is the substantive question about who ought to be \nincluded in the unemployment compensation package. We believe all of \nthose who ought to benefit ought to be provided the coverage in this \nresolution. Our Republican colleagues say that half of those ought to \nbenefit. The other question is whether we ought to be able to have a \nprocedural vote, whether we ought to have an opportunity to vote on the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New York.\n  I again ask consent that we have the one vote on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New York and then obviously whatever the \nSenate may decide on that amendment would give us an opportunity to \ncome to closure on the resolution itself.\n  I see no reason why the Senate should be denied that opportunity on \nan issue this important on the very first day of the session. I ask \nunanimous consent that that amendment be allowed a vote at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I respond to the comments by the Senator \nfrom South Dakota by saying the Senator from Oklahoma laid out clearly \nwhy a vote and adoption of such an amendment would be devastating. It \nwould be devastating for the million people we want to cover with the \nunanimous consent request we have proposed. The House will not accept \nit. I am not too sure, even if we did pass it here and send it over to \nthe House, the House would not accept it. We will be in conference and \nthe opportunity for us to pass an unemployment extension by Thursday \nwill be lost. I think it is important for us to pass a bill which, I \nremind everybody in the Chamber, passed when the Senator from South \nDakota was the majority leader and the Senator from Montana was the \nhead of the Finance Committee. They passed this unemployment extension.\n  All we are saying is, let's continue the unemployment extension that \nyou proposed and you passed in the last session of Congress. All of a \nsudden your handiwork is no longer sufficient today. I don't know what \nhappened between what you did then and what we did today. I don't know \nwhat possibly changed the dynamic that would now cause what we are \nproposing to be insufficient, when what you did was sufficient.\n  The fact is, this is exactly what you passed under your leadership \nand what we should do today. We should stop playing politics out of the \nbox with this very important issue to over 1 million people in this \ncountry and get the job done.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania has made a \nnumber of errors in his comment. Let me clarify. We passed the \nresolution that we passed in the last session of Congress over the \nobjections of many of those on our side, all of those on our side who \nfelt this very amendment should have been included then. We were told \nback then we would revisit this issue immediately upon coming back.\n  Well, we are doing that. But we had a clear understanding that there \nwould be an occasion for us to have a debate and have the amendment we \nhave suggested by the Senator from New York. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, I hope this body will never be dictated to by the House of \nRepresentatives. We are the Senate of the United States. As the Senate \nof the United States, I don't want the House telling us what to do. We \nought to do what is right. We ought to be the ones to dictate what our \nposition is, not the House.\n  I would hope we could accommodate the need to address this resolution \nand the need to address the resolution offered by the Senator from New \nYork. I will suggest a new approach. I would ask unanimous consent that \nwe send two resolutions to the House, the resolution before us and the \nresolution offered by the Senator from New York. I make that request at \nthis time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the present business? Is the \nrequest by the Senator from Tennessee the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The original unanimous consent request of the \nmajority leader is before the body.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a \ncouple of points. One, the Senator from Pennsylvania says, ``what's \nchanged?'' A lot has changed. The unemployment rate is higher than it \nwas last March. That is a significant change. Second, the nature of \nunemployment in America regrettably is becoming more long term. \nEconomists debate why that is happening; nevertheless, it is a fact. It \nis becoming more long term. Some of it is Rust Belt jobs not being \nreplaced. A lot of it is in the service industries, whether in \ntechnology and financial; but it is becoming more long term.\n  These people are having a hard time with the change in the nature of \nour economy and finding jobs. I think, frankly, the request by the \nSenator from New York is more than reasonable, that at least we should \nhave an opportunity to vote on that; or we can take up the suggestion \nby the Senator from South Dakota, that we have two different options.\n  I might also add that this is stimulative. The Senator from \nWashington pointed out, quite correctly, that economists say for every \ndollar spent on unemployment, $2.15 is recirculated into the economy. \nEssentially, a lot of the discussion at the beginning of this year is \nstimulus--how are we going to\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\nstimulate the economy? I think that at least helping people who don't \nhave jobs gain a little bit of benefits is a good idea because it \nstimulates the economy. I further add that there will be a lot of \ndiscussion over the next weeks and months about the President's \nstimulus plan, which includes tremendous tax breaks, whether it is \ndividends or income-tax breaks for these people who have jobs and \nincome.\n  What about the people who don't have jobs, the people who don't have \nincome? If we are going to ``stimulate'' the economy by giving tax \nbreaks, the very least we can do is help people who are unemployed in \nan economy whose very nature means there is longer unemployment.\n  People who do not have income don't pay income tax. I suggest that we \nfind a way to have a vote on the amendment of the Senator from New \nYork. Senators can vote against it. If Senators do not want to be \n``dictated'' to by the House, they can vote their conscience and do \nwhat they think is right. If Senators believe the House trumps this \nbody, they can vote against the amendment. They have that option. But \nat the very least, I believe that we, as responsible Senators--I heard \na couple of great speeches not long ago about defending the \nConstitution of the United States and doing what is right. Clearly, \ndoing what is right is helping people who need some help. That is what \nis right. That is why we are here.\n  I understand it is a little inconvenient, and I don't denigrate that \nbecause of the receptions and the parties that are going on here. I \ndon't think the Constitution had that in mind when the Framers wrote \nthe provisions in that document, the oath of office which we took to \nsupport and defend our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the leaders will provide some time \nfor debate. The majority leader has made a unanimous consent request. \nSenators are reserving the right to object. They have no right to yield \nto other Senators when they are reserving the right to object. Let's \nhave an orderly procedure here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will reserve the right to object.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object, and I \nwill not object. I think there is a lot of good debate points being \nraised. But I hope we don't start this session the way we ended much of \nlast year, which was getting in great debates about big topics and at \nthe end of the day not passing anything. I think that is really where \nwe ended, and we fouled up on a lot of bills last year--big bills. \nThere were significant bills that we would work for weeks and months on \nand we didn't get them done.\n  We have a chance to do something here. I think everybody is agreed \nthat there is more that could be done. That would be good, but we don't \nhave that agreement. We can start this session off with doing something \nor nothing. I hope at some point in time we can get to the point of \ndoing something.\n  We have a reasonable proposal that is agreed to by the basic \nprinciples in this proposal at least. Let's pass that. Let's start this \nsession off with getting something that is going to be helpful for \npeople. It may not be perfect for everybody, and that is obvious, but \nwe can get something done here. It will be significant and it will be \nimportant and helpful. I hope we can move that forward and get this \ncleared through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in my unanimous consent request, I wanted \nto close what has become some debate here and basically say that we \nhave an opportunity--and I believe an obligation--to finish up the \nbusiness that we didn't finish in the last Congress, on which we have \nan opportunity to take the next very important step, which will affect \nthe lives of 750,000 people after next Thursday, which doesn't have \nanything to do with the House or the Senate. Thursday is the deadline \nfor these checks. If they don't go out, it affects 750,000 people. The \n5 months' extension that is being proposed here also affects the lives \nof about 2\\1/2\\ million other people who will be enrolling over that \nperiod. Because we worked so hard on both sides of the aisle over so \nmany months and weeks--and over the last several days--I didn't \nrecognize that we would get to a point now where we would have so many \nreservations of the right to object. We are talking about Thursday, \nchecks not going out, a dislocation affecting 750,000 people, an \nadditional 2\\1/2\\ million, if we don't address this today. With that, I \nwill call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order has been called for. Is \nthere objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is a unanimous consent \nrequest made by the majority leader. The Senator can object.\n  Mr. BYRD. Parliamentary inquiry: Is the resolution before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is to have the measure sent to the \ndesk and passed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Then the resolution is not before the Senate. There is \nnothing before the Senate that can be amended at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. A request has been \nmade that it be granted so it can be brought for a vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. The request is an all-encompassing request. It doesn't give \nthe Senate a chance to amend the resolution? That is what I am trying \nto find out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is correct.\n  The majority leader has asked for regular order. Senators may not \nreserve the right to object when the regular order has been called for. \nThey either must object or permit the request to be granted. Is there \nobjection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I make a further unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. He made a request, but he sent something to the desk, \ndidn't he?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has made a unanimous \nconsent request and he retains the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, he does. I understand that. I had hoped to suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, but he does retain the floor. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I may speak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I ask to speak for a \nminute following the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair believes that objection is heard. Is \nthere objection to the majority leader's request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The majority leader has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am obviously disappointed with this \nobjection for the reasons that I have set out. There are 750,000 people \nand their dependents who depend on these distributions, as well as \nanother 2\\1/2\\ million people. We had been told this had been cleared \non both sides after a lot of hard work. I am obviously disappointed, \nbecause this is the first move out for me, after it had been cleared on \nboth sides, but I guess that is what I can come to expect. I do hope \nthat my colleagues will rethink today's objection and allow us, for the \nreasons I have said, to have this cleared later today.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I renew my original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object--and I will not object the \nobjection I raised earlier within the caucus has been discussed at \nlength and it is\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\nclear to me that the Democratic leadership, Senator Daschle through the \nmembership, will continue to fight for the million people who are not \ncovered by this resolution, but we cannot turn our backs on the 2.8 \nmillion who need this check on Thursday.\n  I will not object to this unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 23) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/07/senate-section/article/S15-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois for not objecting to this resolution. He and my \ncolleagues feel very strongly, as is evidenced by the debate this \nafternoon. We will not give up, we will not relent, we will not allow \nthose million Americans who have no coverage not getting the \nconsideration they deserve in the Senate. We will continue to offer \namendments.\n  I put my colleagues on notice: On this legislation and on any other \noccasion that we have the opportunity to avail ourselves of an \namendment, we will do so, because this deserves a vote. It deserves \ndebate. It deserves passage. It is shameful we are leaving out these \nmillion people today. There is absolutely no excuse, especially when \nthe President of the United States today is in Chicago talking about \nmore tax cuts for those at the very top. That is wrong.\n  It is an illustration of the extraordinary difference in philosophy \nabout how we stimulate the economy. This is not only good for the \neconomy, it is good for 1 million people left out as a result of the \nactions today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. On the Democratic side we have a number of Senators who \nhave asked for a specific time. I ask unanimous consent on our side, \nand on an alternating basis if, in fact, there are Republicans who wish \nto speak, that Senator Boxer first be recognized for 5 minutes, Senator \nSchumer for 5 minutes, Senator Stabenow for 5 minutes, Senator Dorgan \nfor 5 minutes, Senator Reid of Rhode Island for 5 minutes, Senator \nMurray for 5 minutes. That is a total, I believe, of 35 minutes, \nleaving 55 minutes for other Senators on this side of the aisle who \nwish to speak. The normal procedure is to alternate back and forth on \nthe time evenly divided between now and 5 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my assistant Democratic leader for \nthe time.\n  During the brief debate we had before we voted to extend these \nunemployment benefits, the Senator from Pennsylvania asked, What is \nwrong with you people? What has changed, that you really want to \nprotect now these 1 million people, when several months ago you did not \nspeak as loudly for their inclusion?\n  I state for the record what has happened in this period of time. As \nwe go out and about our States, as I think we all did during this \nbreak, we find high anxiety among the people--high anxiety because of \nthis economy. We are seeing more foreclosures than ever. Two million \njobs have been lost in the private sector. On top of that we are seeing \nbudget deficits that we have not seen in many years.\n\n  My friend who is now presiding, my esteemed colleague, understands \nthis anxiety. We have teamed up to work on giving a jump-start to the \nhigh-tech sector with a bill on wireless fidelity, which I believe is \ngoing to really help this economy. He understands that.\n  We have a sense of urgency about that bill because we know we can \nturn things around. In my State we have a horrible situation in the \nnorthern areas because of what I would call a depression, really, in \nthe high-tech sector. Some of it was to be expected; we went through \nthis huge period of growth. We have some settling down there. But \nnonetheless, it is a problem. We have thousands of people in northern \nCalifornia who are suffering through no fault of their own. These \npeople, who are intelligent, educated, and excellent workers, are out \non the street. They are running out of benefits, and some of them have \nrun out already. That is why we on this side of the aisle believe those \nmillion people should not be left out of the equation.\n  I have a State of 35 million people. In terms of its economy, it \nwould be the sixth largest economy in the world. The fact is, the good \npeople in that State need help. Why we on this side of the aisle were \nso upset and why we kept objecting or reserving the right to object is \nwe wanted to make sure the people's voices were heard. That is what the \nSenate ought to be, a place where the voice of the people is heard.\n  We have a situation where our States are worse off. They cannot come \nin and help because they are financially strapped because of the \nrecession. So people are turning to us. Today we took care of some \npeople. I am very proud we did that, but we have left out in the cold a \nmillion people. I will not be satisfied, speaking as one Senator, until \nwe have taken care of all those who are in need.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania also made a comment that just some of \nthe States have problems. This is not true. These million people reside \nin all of the States. In my own State, the pockets of real trouble are \nin the north of the State right now; the south of the State is doing \nbetter. But individuals all over this country need help.\n  In summary, I say the Democrats are back. We are ready to go to work. \nWe will stay. We will stay late into the night. But we are going to \noffer, all through this day and all through the coming days, a \nunanimous consent request saying we need to take care of those million \npeople, those long-term unemployed people whose checks have already run \nout, who do not know where they are going to get the money to pay the \nrent, who don't know if they will get evicted, who don't know if they \ncan take care of their children.\n  There is a new term of art that has come about. It is called ``food \ninsecurity.'' Food insecurity--that is a delicate way of saying people \nare hungry.\n  We are seeing food insecurity. We are seeing housing insecurity. We \nare seeing joblessness. Can we turn it around? Of course we could turn \nit around.\n  I have seen the President's plan. In my personal opinion, having \nlooked at where the benefits go, it is a bonanza to the wealthiest in \nthe country, and it is a bust for the middle class. It is a budget \ndeficit disaster. But he has a plan out there. It is a huge plan, and \nwe are going to work to make it better, to get the benefits to those \nwho need them. But if you want to talk about stimulus, talk about the \nmillion people who have no money to put bread on the table.\n  In closing, let's help those million people. I intend to stay here \nall this week and next and into future weeks to make sure we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have been here throughout this debate. I \nhave not been involved in this issue prior to this point, as many have. \nBut it has been an interesting and rather surprising sequence of events \nhere on this first day, this sort of ceremonial day, in which we get \ninto this kind of head-to-head arrangement. It is surprising.\n  I do understand why this issue was brought to the floor. That is \nbecause there is a time element. We heard a letter from the Secretary \nof Labor indicating that in order to get a continuation of the \nunemployment benefits of those who are still eligible, we have to do it \nby Thursday. So I think that is a pretty compelling issue. In order to \nget that done, we obviously also have to do something that has been \nagreed to, apparently, by the House as well.\n  So it is surprising to me that we have this effort made within the \nSenate, and also with House leadership, to try to do something within \nthis time that is imperative we do, yet we come to the floor and \napparently the very people who helped make the agreement now\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\nare proposing an amendment which would kill the bill. Certainly it \nwould not make it available in the time that is necessary.\n  There is no reason for anybody to argue with the fact that there are \nthose out there who need some additional help. This bill is not a total \nremedy. I think everyone admits that. We have to come back and do some \nother things. But this was argued last year. We could not get it done. \nWe should have gotten it done last year and didn't. Now we have an \nopportunity to do something today to get it to the President, to get it \nthrough the House before they adjourn--apparently today.\n  It really sounds as if the process is such that it is pretty \ncompelling that we do what seems to be available, and that is to pass a \nbill which would extend unemployment benefits to, apparently, up to 2 \nmillion people whose benefits otherwise would expire at the end of this \nweek. If there are others who are eligible who still need some help--\nand there obviously are--then we can do that. We can come back and do \nthat. But to sacrifice what we can do today to argue about something \nthat we do not agree on yet and can do tomorrow does not seem to make \ngood sense.\n  I hate to think it is a political issue, bringing up now the \nPresident's economic package. It really is not a part of this debate. \nThe President has said all along that he wants to have the unemployment \nrelief extended. So it is a puzzle to me. I hope we can now move \nforward. We have passed the bill. I say that is the greatest thing we \ncould have done today. Certainly we needed to do that. We can come back \nand take a look at these other issues and everyone can get their \nopportunity to express their political issues and, I think, seek to \nseparate us from the other side. I hate to think that is the case, but \nit seems to be. And it is too bad.\n  The notion that some of us do not want to do anything is not \naccurate. How we do it is what we are talking about. We have been \nthrough it before.\n  I am glad we are able to move forward. I think we ought to get in our \nminds a way to work on the issues that remain to be worked on and do \nthat in the appropriate time. But I am reluctant to think we want to \ncontinue to confront one another today and to talk about all the bad \nthings we can think of. That is not quite what is involved with this \nfirst session of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, there is no question that today is a day \nfor family, a day for congratulations. I congratulate all my colleagues \nwho were just sworn in. I know it is a very exciting day. I remember \nbeing in this position 2 years ago. It is a very special day.\n  But in addition to celebrating family in the Senate today, we are \nvery concerned about those families who find themselves in the \ndifficult position of having no income coming in because of \nunemployment, through no cause of their own.\n  They want to work. But because of the changing economy, the structure \nof the economy, or because of a variety of other reasons, they have \nfound themselves unemployed. Certainly in Michigan we find that the \nchanging economic structure has occurred for many people. Many of us \nhave been asking that we remember them. We asked during the holidays \nthat we remember those whose unemployment benefits would be ending \nduring the holidays and that we take action before we left last year. \nThat did not happen. We are back today.\n  I commend the new leadership for their willingness to come forward \nwith this issue of unemployment compensation. However, what we have \nseen today is a willingness to only do half the job. How can we say to \na million people, and to their families, on a day when we celebrate \nfamilies, that they don't count? We are told that the House of \nRepresentatives would not support solving this problem completely or \naddressing it completely--that they would only support addressing half \nof it.\n  We have said let us support solving the problem. And we did in fact \npass a resolution to move forward solving half the problem.\n  But our leader, Senator Daschle, also proposed that we add a separate \nresolution to complete the job to help those 1 million individuals who \nalso find themselves in a situation of needing to extend their \nunemployment benefits. Yet we were told no again. We have been told no \nso many times on this floor as it relates to helping unemployed \nworkers. It is very regrettable that today, one more time, we were told \nno. I think, more specifically, families were told no. Those who have \nlost their jobs were told no. One million people were told no.\n  We celebrate today people coming into new commissions, new jobs, and \nwith great pride, as they should. We know the ability to work and to be \nable to provide an income and care for your family is one of the basics \nof our society and our economy. We know that there are Americans today \nwho find themselves in a difficult situation of searching for work, of \nbeing unemployed, and asking that their Government support their \nfamilies as they move forward to find new employment so that they can \ncare for their families in the way they would like to provide for them. \nUnfortunately, I believe today a tone was set by choosing not to \naddress this problem completely at a time when we are seeing, \nunfortunately, one more time, an economic plan rolled out to help those \nwho have been helped so many times who are at the very top of the \nincome bracket in our country.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I have heard many economists, \nincluding Alan Greenspan, say that by extending unemployment benefits--\nand by putting dollars into people's pockets so they can pay their \nbills, buy the shoes for their children, and be able to continue \nproviding groceries for their families and paying other bills which \nthey have--we actually stimulate the economy. We create demand. When \nthere is money in people's pockets, they are spending it. We know \nsomeone who is unemployed is going to be spending it because they have \nto. The money coming in is not being saved. It is being spent on \nclothes, food, the electric bills, the car payment, the mortgage \npayment, and so on.\n  We know that is a short-term economic stimulus--certainly at a time \nwhen we are debating economic stimulus.\n  What we have been asking for today is something that is not only fair \nand right to address--all of those who find themselves in a situation \nof being unemployed, not leave 1 million people out of the solution--\nbut we are also asking, as we talk about economic stimulus, that we in \nfact provide the kind of stimulus that puts money back into the economy \nand helping those who need to spend it to care for their families, to \npay their bills, to be able to remain independent in their homes, and \nto be able to know that they are a part of the economic equation, and \nwhen we talk economic stimulus, that they are not left out.\n  While I am pleased we were able to pass the resolution, I am very \ndisappointed that this very first time we were not able to address or \neven bring forward in a separate resolution the ability to address 1 \nmillion people today who are looking to us, at a time of celebration, \nand asking us to remember them; to ask on their behalf so they, too, \ncan have the ability to care for their families. I hope we will, as \nquickly as possible, finish the job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I first ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSchumer be placed as the next Democrat to be recognized in the order of \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, let me remind not only my colleagues, but the American \npeople, why we are forced today, at the eleventh hour, to make a very \ncruel choice between helping some Americans and abandoning other \nAmericans. It is because all through last fall, the Republican House of \nRepresentatives refused to take up and vote upon unemployment benefits \nin a meaningful way that would lead to successful passage. The \nPresident did not involve himself on this issue until the unemployment \nrate reached 6 percent. He fired his economic team, and they discovered \nthere really were Americans who desperately need help.\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\n  Today we were forced to make those choices that you see sometimes in \nthe movies about who gets to stay in the life boat. It was a completely \nunnecessary choice.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma talked about one proposal costing $4 \nbillion and another proposal costing $1 billion. The House wanted $1 \nbillion.\n  There is a surplus today in the unemployment insurance trust fund of \n$24 billion. There is absolutely no fiscal reason we could not provide \nthese benefits to 1 million Americans who have exhausted their \nunemployment benefits. We heard from colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle that they are categorically opposed to giving any extension \nof benefits beyond a certain time. This not only defies logic and \ndefies the fiscal status of the trust fund but also defies history.\n  In the early 1990s, this Government extended unemployment \ncompensation a total of five times--three times under President George \nHerbert Walker Bush because unemployment continued to rise for the 15th \nmonth after the so-called end of the recession. There are cases in \nwhich individuals were able to collect unemployment benefits for a \ntotal of 52 weeks because they qualified for these extensions.\n  Why is this so important? Because people are desperate. They had good \njobs. They lost those jobs. They are looking for comparable work. They \ncannot find it. The record of this economy under this President is \ndismal. Family incomes have fallen for the first time in 8 years. \nPoverty is increasing. Families at all income levels are losing their \nhealth insurance left and right. Gross domestic product is growing, but \nit is growing too feebly to generate the jobs these people need.\n  Since the President took office, 2.2 million private payroll jobs \nhave been lost. We are losing jobs. We are not gaining jobs. We are \nasking them to find jobs; we are setting them on a task that is \nextraordinarily difficult.\n  So what can we do in the interim?\n  We can at least give them unemployment compensation, extended, if \nnecessary. It is the fair thing to do. It is the wise thing to do. The \nPresident, in his economic speech in Chicago, talked about some special \n$3,000 benefit for those people who are unemployed. Let's do the \nmathematics. That $3,000 represents probably a fraction of the \nunemployment insurance someone would collect if we voted for these \nbenefits. That is not a good deal for the people of America--a $3,000, \none-time payment, some type of scheme in which they can use it either \nto pay their household costs or go to training versus receiving, on a \nregular basis, unemployment compensation as they look for work.\n  The reality, as my colleague from Montana pointed out, is that \nunemployment is different today than it was even 10 years ago in the \nrecession of the early 1990s. It is different because the economy has \nchanged.\n  The State which the Presiding Officer and I represent used to be a \nmanufacturing center, not just to the United States but to the world. \nThat is changing. As I go about our State talking to people, the \nunemployed are 50-year-old, former mid-level management people who used \nto work for a company. They did not get fired. They did not get laid \noff. The company went away, went out of business, moved its operations \nto Mexico, moved its operations to Singapore. And then you ask this \nperson, with a mortgage, college tuitions--and the health care benefits \nwhich they used to get at work are now his responsibility or her \nresponsibility--to go look for a job with comparable pay? They are not \nhiring people like that. They are looking for the 35-year-old, with a \ncomputer degree, who will work cheaper, who does not have those \nresponsibilities of a family, of a mortgage.\n  That is the reality out there. That is what we are fighting about \ntoday, not the number ``1 million,'' but a million Americans, \nstruggling to find work, trying to find work. They need help. And we \nturn our back on them today. I heard my colleague, the Senator from \nOklahoma, say he would never bring up extension of these benefits to \npeople who have exhausted their benefits already. I heard the majority \nleader sort of talk about: Well, we want to deal with this issue, but \nlet's get this issue done first.\n  The message is pretty clear to me and should be clear to the American \npublic: We are walking away today from a million people. We should not \ndo that.\n  This seems to me to be so clear and so obvious that I am, in fact, \namazed and shocked at what we did. The money is there. This is a \nbenefit for people who are looking for work. Once they find work, the \nbenefit expires. We are talking about stimulating the economy. What is \nmore stimulating than giving people money to pay for their household \ngoods as they look for work?\n  I am more than disappointed. But we were forced today, because of the \ninattention of the administration and the House, at the last minute, to \nchoose between denying benefits to all unemployed Americans or \nabandoning about a million--a cruel, unnecessary choice. We can do \nbetter. We should do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If nobody yields time, time will be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, this is the first day of the 108th \nCongress. I remember the former Senator from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum, \nused to refer to these days as the first day of school, coming back \nafter the recess. Of course, it is a time of celebration as new \nSenators gather. This one is particular in that it is a time of a new \nmajority leader. I rise to express my confidence in and give my \ncongratulations to Senator Frist of Tennessee in his assuming the \nposition as majority leader. He will prove to be an outstanding leader. \nThe Senate and the people of the United States will be well served by \nhis stewardship.\n  However, I wish to take this opportunity to make a few comments about \nthe previous majority leader, Senator Lott of Mississippi. Senator Lott \nhas been very much in the news of the last few weeks. He ultimately \nmade what I consider to be the right decision in stepping aside so that \nthe challenges raised to him would not get in the way of the business \nof the Senate or of the country. The caricature of Senator Lott that \nappeared in much of the national media did not match in any way the man \nthat I know and love.\n  I rise to comment briefly on the contribution Senator Lott has made \nto this institution and to the Nation and take the opportunity of the \nshifting of power to pay tribute to Senator Lott and the work he has \ndone.\n  There are many things in his career that we could point to. This is \nnot his funeral so I won't run through a list. But there is one in \nparticular that stands out in my mind, which I will share with those \nwho may be watching, that demonstrates the kind of leader Trent Lott \nwas. I refer to the experience many of us described as the most \nsignificant of our careers, and that was the historic moment when the \nSenate sat in judgment as a trial for the impeachment of the President \nof the United States. For only the second time in our history, a \nPresident had been impeached by the House of Representatives, and we \nwere required\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\nunder the Constitution to hold a trial to determine whether the \nPresident should be convicted of those crimes of which he was \nimpeached.\n  Many in the press, many uninformed, asked: Why is the Senate wasting \nits time dealing with this challenge?\n  The Constitution left us with no choice. Once the House of \nRepresentatives had voted impeachment, the Senate was required under \nthe Constitution to hold a trial, with the Chief Justice of the United \nStates presiding. It was a historic time, and many of my colleagues \ncommented that this was the most significant vote they would ever cast \nin their political careers.\n  We met in the old Senate Chamber to discuss what we should do. That \nwas a historic meeting, off the record, if you will, because it was not \nhere with an official reporter taking down every word. But it was an \nopportunity for Senators to speak freely and openly. In very solemn and \nsomber proceedings, we discussed what we should do. I am not violating \nany confidences because it has been reported in the press that the \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, spoke on behalf of the Democrats \nas we addressed that issue. He made this point. I can't remember his \nexact words, but these were the words that are in my mind.\n  Referring to the case before us, he said: This case is toxic. It has \nbesmirched the Presidency, and it has soiled the House of \nRepresentatives. And it is about to do the same thing to us.\n  I believe his analysis was correct, that the case of President \nClinton and his actions did indeed besmirch the Presidency, degrade the \nPresidency, and I think the way it ultimately played out in the House \nof Representatives stained that body and left bitterness that is still \nproducing bitter fruit. Senator Byrd warned this case, this toxic case, \nwas about to affect the Senate.\n  The majority leader, who had to handle such a case, was Trent Lott of \nMississippi. I was at his side in many of his meetings. I watched from \nafar in many of the other things he did. Senator Lott handled that \nhistoric challenge with as much sensitivity, finesse, wisdom and, yes, \ngrace as it would be possible to do.\n  When it was over, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle met in the well of \nthe Senate, embraced each other, and said: We did it.\n  Yes, they did. And they did it together. But the primary \nresponsibility was on the shoulders of Senator Lott. He made Senator \nByrd's prophecy not come true. Instead of staining the Senate, instead \nof soiling the Senate the way that case soiled the Presidency and the \nHouse, it was in many ways the Senate's finest hour. The case was \nhandled with dignity. The case was handled with dispatch. And the case \nwas handled with a minimum of bad feelings on both sides.\n  There are some outside the Senate who attacked Senator Lott and said: \nYou should have had a full-blown trial. You should have let this drag \non for 6 weeks, even 6 months. And at the end of that period of time, \nmaybe, just maybe, you would have had a conviction.\n  Senator Lott understood that the dignity of this body and the unity \nof the country required the kind of handling of that case that he gave \nus.\n  History will look back on the stewardship of Trent Lott as majority \nleader of the United States with great approval and kindness. This is a \nman of extraordinary skills who handled himself in an extraordinary \nway, and all of us who sat in the Senate through that experience \nbenefited by his leadership.\n  Now he is moving on to other assignments. As I congratulate Senator \nFrist on his ascension to the majority leadership, I also congratulate \nSenator Lott on the prospect of a continued career of contribution, \nperhaps in the policy area more than in the process area. He has \ndemonstrated that he can master the legislative process as well as \nanyone on the planet. I expect he will now demonstrate that he can make \ncontributions of equal significance in the policy area.\n  On a personal note, while he is many years my junior in this business \nof politics, he has acted as my mentor and my teacher. I can think of \nmany times when I have been tangled up in the minutia and arcane nature \nof the way this body works, where I had nowhere else to go to get \nmyself untangled and set straight. I called Senator Lott and, with \ncalmness and clarity, he said, why don't we do this and, suddenly, the \nGordian knot was cut and I emerged ready to go forward in my career \nbecause of his wisdom and his guidance.\n\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Frist. I was happy to vote for him when \nthe opportunity came. I am looking forward to working with Senator \nFrist as he demonstrates his ability to lead this body. I have every \nconfidence that that will be a tremendous period in the Senate's \nhistory, but, at the same time, I wanted to rise and make it clear that \nas we embrace Senator Frist's leadership we should recognize and pay \ntribute to the contribution made to this body and ultimately to the \ncountry by Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/07/senate-section/article/S18-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18-S20]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I congratulate all of my new \ncolleagues who were sworn in today, and all of those who won \nreelection--but particularly those who are here for the first time, and \nmy good friend from New Jersey who is here for the second time, with a \nhiatus. I congratulate the new leadership on the Republican side, along \nwith Majority Leader Frist. We look forward to working together for the \ngood of our country.\n  Today, I stand here feeling, I guess I would say, boxed in because we \non this side of the aisle who feel that the unemployment package was \nnot adequate are faced with the choice of taking half a loaf or none. \nOf course, when you are in a legislative body, you tend to take that \nhalf loaf. We will do it today--or we have done it already today. But \nwhen it comes to people out of work, when it comes to the pain in the \neyes of fathers and mothers, young men and women who talk about missing \nor losing a job, knocking on doors and not being able to find one, half \na loaf is not very adequate.\n  I find it confounding that the other side did not allow the amendment \nmy colleague from New York proffered. We only asked for a half hour of \ndebate, so it cannot be that it would take up much time. We certainly \ndo not believe that they didn't want to help the unemployed. So the \nonly logical answer is dollars. They thought it might be too expensive. \nTo me--the main point I want to make this afternoon is this--the \ncontrast of our President speaking in Chicago and putting forward a \n$600 billion plan of relief, mostly on the tax side--and the vast \nmajority of that plan goes to the very highest income levels. I read \nsomewhere that 42 percent goes to 1 percent; 1 percent of the highest \nincome get 42 percent of the relief. One percent is 311,000. So there \nis $600 billion to go to tax relief, mainly for the most well off, and \nthere is not a billion dollars to include a million people--150,000 New \nYorkers--to give them the unemployment benefits they now do not have.\n  How many Americans would support that? Our job is to juxtapose those \ntwo issues. I hope the media will do that. These are not two separate \nissues because we have not heard a single reason that we cannot take \nthe larger bill. They say our colleagues in the House will object. Then \nlet the American people look at them and say to them, if you can afford \nand you are going to support $600 billion in tax relief, largely to \nextremely wealthy, high-income individuals and families, why can't you \nsupport a billion dollars for the unemployed?\n  If the election we just held were on that issue, what do you think \nwould have happened? My guess is that the results would have been quite \ndifferent. Frankly, our colleagues in the House and some on the other \nside of the aisle don't like to see this issue contrasted. The tax \nrelief--huge amounts of it--is going to the upper income spectrums and \nthe stingiest, the parsimonious attitude when it comes to the \nunemployed. It is not that we cannot afford it, because I offer to my \ncolleagues, let's do $599 billion of tax relief and do this billion \ndollars. Hardly anyone would notice, except those million people who \nare out of work and desperately looking for work.\n  So I hope we will have another opportunity to work this amendment \nforward. I worry that we can make a lot of speeches on the floor of the \nSenate, but, yes, they will say, bring it up as\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\npart of the stimulus package, we will pass it in the Senate. But it \nwill die in conference, and then there is nothing we can do \nlegislatively.\n  So while I didn't agree with my colleague from Illinois for objecting \nbecause we are in such a box--I thought we should not object and try to \npersuade them--I sympathize with his anger and with his frustration \nthat we could not spend a half hour to talk about some money for people \nwho are out of work, or our colleagues here would have withdrawn the \nbill and hurt the 2.8 million who will benefit, and justifiably so.\n  The issue of money for the jobless doesn't change America. \nUnfortunately, it is not the most important issue we face. Getting a \ngood education and good health care and more jobs for people is far \nmore important than a stopgap measure. Until we are able to do that--so \nfar we have not--we have to help those who need help. These are not \npeople sitting on their duffs trying to get a check. They are people \nwho are knocking on doors every day. When a notice goes out that one \ncompany is hiring, you see hundreds and even thousands in my city and \nelsewhere throughout my State lined up around the block.\n  People desperately want work. The best thing we can do is give them \njobs by stimulating the economy in a real way. But until we do, it is \nour fundamental and solemn and important responsibility to at least let \nthem live a life of dignity, maintain the payment on the home, feed the \nchild, put a coat on the spouse's back. That is all we were trying to \ndo today. It is unfortunate that we were put in such a box and we were \ntold take half a loaf or none. When it comes to unemployment, we should \nnot have to deal with half a loaf.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I regret what happened in the Senate \ntoday. We passed some legislation that will offer some assistance to \nsome who are unemployed in this country, but we left 1 million people \nwho should have received the help of Members of the Senate, from the \nCongress, and from the President, without the kind of help they need. A \nlot of folks in this country don't have people clogging the hallways of \nthe Capitol lobbying on their behalf--certainly not the people who are \nwithout means, at the lower end of the economic ladder; they have not \nhired people in the hallways of the Capitol to represent their \ninterests. They rely on us to do that. There are so many families in \nthis country who know things that Members of the Senate do not know. \nThey know about a second shift, they know about a second job, they know \nabout a second mortgage, and they know about buying a secondhand car. \nThey know firsthand that they are the first in this country during an \neconomic downturn to be called into an office and be told, by the way, \nyou are being laid off, you are losing your job.\n  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans have had \nto go home to tell their families that, through no fault of theirs, \nthey were given a notice that their job was gone. They are no longer \nemployed. It is a devastating thing for families to experience that. In \nmost cases, during an economic downturn, the Congress has moved very \nquickly to say, yes, you lost your job, but it wasn't through your \nfault, it wasn't something you did, and we want to help you, we want to \nextend a helping hand during this rough spell in the American economy. \nCongress has always done that--that is, until last year when we tried \nand tried in the Senate to pass legislation to extend that helping hand \nand extend unemployment benefits, and now again today when we made the \neffort once again.\n\n  It is terribly disappointing that today the President is in Chicago \nannouncing his tax proposal. At a time when we are experiencing very \nsubstantial budget deficits, the President is proposing a tax cut of \n$675 billion over the next 10 years. That is $65 billion, $70 billion a \nyear for 10 years in tax cuts, and then we are told: But there is not \nenough money really to fund that rather small amount needed to help \nthose who are unemployed, who have lost their jobs. I do not understand \nthat.\n  It is interesting to me, and also a little perplexing, that we are \ntold the budget deficits are just a result of the economy; it is just \nbecause the economy turned sour. A year and three-quarters ago, we had \na debate in the Chamber of the Senate about a new fiscal policy. We \nwere told we ought to embrace the idea of very large tax cuts for the \nlong term.\n  Some of us stood up at these desks and said: Wait a second, it is \npretty hard to see very far down the road. Shouldn't we worry perhaps \nsome unforeseen consequences could run this economy into the ditch and \ncause very serious problems? Not to worry, they said. We have all that \ncovered. We have contingency plans. So just pass this big tax cut of \nours. The Congress did--not with my vote, but they did pass that large \ntax cut.\n  Within months, we discovered our economy was in a recession. Months \nlater, on September 11, we were attacked by terrorists. And then there \nwere corporate scandals almost unprecedented in this country's history. \nThe tech bubble burst in the stock market. All of a sudden, very large \nFederal budget surpluses turned into very large Federal budget \ndeficits, and now we are in a fix. Now we have competing needs, one of \nwhich is the item we discussed today: The need during an economic \ndownturn to reach out a hand and help those who need help, to help \nthose who have lost their job, by extending unemployment benefits.\n  Another competing interest and need was announced today by President \nBush, saying what we really need at a time of unprecedented budget \ndeficits--as far as the eye can see--is more tax cuts, $675 billion in \nadditional tax cuts.\n  Interestingly enough, in terms of priorities, they say no to the \npeople who have lost their jobs and need their unemployment extended, \nbut they say yes in public policy, in this tax proposal, that we ought \nto tax people who work: Let's tax work and let's exempt investment. \nWhat kind of a value system is that?\n  There are many ways of making money. Some of them are to go to work, \nwork hard, and get a paycheck. No one is proposing eliminating the tax \non the paycheck, are they? So they say: Let's tax work.\n  Another way to make money is to collect substantial dividends from \nstockholdings and stock purchases, and the President is saying: Let's \nexempt that; we should not tax that at all.\n  I do not understand the value system: Let's tax work but exempt \ninvestment. Guess what that says. That says to the American people who \nare working--who, in my judgment, are the people who make this economic \nengine work well--we are going to tax you, but the folks who just sit \nback and collect their dividends--incidentally, the folks at the top of \nthe income earning ladder--we are going to exempt you. Not with my vote \nwe are not. Yet in terms of priorities on the very day the President \nsays let's have a $675 billion tax cut, let's keep taxing work and \nexempt from taxation investment, he and our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle say: We cannot afford that small amount of money to \nextend unemployment benefits to those at the bottom of the economic \nladder, those who have had to come home with shattered dreams to tell \ntheir family: I have lost my job. What a devastating situation that is. \nThese are people who want to work, who did work and, through no fault \nof their own but through a bad economy, lost their ability to work.\n\n  The best tradition in this country has always been for this Congress, \nduring an economic downturn, for sound reasons, including trying to \nprovide some stimulus to the economy, to say to those who have lost \ntheir jobs: We want to help you. It helps this country to help you. We \nare there now to give you some help during a tough time for you and \nyour family.\n  I regret very much that today we were not able to do that for 1 \nmillion Americans who look to Capitol Hill and this capital city for us \nto make the right decision at the right time.\n  Today, regrettably, the majority in the Senate failed. There will be \nanother day, and my hope is we will see a different decision, a better \ndecision for those folks at the bottom of the economic ladder who want \nto work, who did work but lost their jobs, and\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\nfor whom no one is clogging the hallways of Congress lobbying on their \nbehalf. If this were a big economic interest, you can bet this Capitol \nwould be full of people, well paid, with dark suits, ready to make the \ncase for their economic interest.\n  There are a lot of folks out there today who are going to gather \naround their supper table and talk about their lot in life during an \neconomic downturn and talk about where they looked for a job today, \ntalk about the job they used to have, and talk about the hopes they had \nthat we would help them during this tough period. They today will be \nmighty disappointed.\n  My hope is in a week or in a month, perhaps we can persuade our \ncolleagues that today's decision was the wrong choice for our country \nand certainly the wrong choice for a lot of American families relying \non the Congress to make the right decision today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe Senator from North Dakota who has, once again, eloquently put this \nissue into a much larger context, a context that concerns the economic \nand tax policies of our country.\n  Today I have introduced a bill to help those who have exhausted their \nunemployment benefits, the nearly 1 million Americans we have heard \nspoken about from so many of my colleagues from Washington to North \nDakota to Rhode Island, who have just run out of time and run out of \nmoney. They were eligible for the programs that each State administers, \nas it should be, because in many of our States we have had an increase \nin unemployment over the last year.\n  We now have a 6 to 6.5-percent unemployment rate in many parts of the \ncountry. In New York City, which is still dealing with the aftermath of \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we have an 8-percent \nunemployment rate. Many of these people who lost their jobs have been \nworking all their lives. When something happened--a layoff, a \nbankruptcy, a terrorist attack--and many of them have spent month after \nmonth looking for work and not finding it. In an economy such as we \nhave now, which is not producing jobs, many people for the first time \never, especially given what we enjoyed during the 1990s, are finding it \nimpossible, not just to find a job that paid what they were used to \nreceiving through their job, but paying anything.\n  I recently had a number of such New Yorkers to my office in New York \nCity shortly before the December 28 cutoff of unemployment benefits. I \nwish they could be here in the Chamber.\n  I wish that all of my colleagues could speak with the man who had \nworked on the Windows of the World restaurant at the top of the World \nTrade Center for more than 20 years, a manual laborer but a good \nhearted, decent American who, year after year, showed up, did what he \nwas supposed to do, and luckily for him and his family was not at work \non the morning of September 11, but unluckily for him and his four \nchildren, he no longer has any work. He has gone from place to place.\n\n  I wish my colleagues could meet the woman from Queens who was widowed \nwhen her husband died 3 years ago, had worked in the same business for \nmany years, and now has lost her job and no longer has unemployment \nbenefits. What are we supposed to tell these people?\n  We ended welfare as we knew it because we did not want anyone to be \ndependent, to produce generational dependency, and I supported that. \nThere is not any better social program than a job. But when we do not \nproduce jobs in the economy for decent, hard-working Americans, what do \nwe expect to happen?\n  Some of the things that are happening: In many States, after being in \ndecline for years, welfare rolls are climbing. In many States, \nhomelessness is increasing, and it is homelessness of families with \nchildren. Bankruptcies are growing. Individuals who are chronically \nunemployed are going on Social Security disability in order to have \nsome kind of income, one of the fastest growing programs in our \ncountry.\n  When we first started talking about extending unemployment benefits--\nI introduced a bill last July--we did not get to first base. We did not \neven get out of the dugout. We would raise it time and again. My \nwonderful friend, our late colleague, Senator Wellstone from Minnesota, \nused to be at that desk. He would never be in the chair but would be \npacing about. Before his tragic accident, every day he came to the \nfloor asking that we extend unemployment benefits.\n  We often harkened back to the situation during the recession of the \nearly 1990s when unemployment benefits were extended five times and \nsigned into law by the first President Bush, as well as President \nClinton. Finally, the Senate passed a measure.\n  I appreciated greatly working with my colleague, Senator Nickles from \nOklahoma, to get that done last year. We could not get it through the \nHouse. We did not have the support of the administration. But today, we \nhave done the right thing, at least half the right thing. I am very \ngrateful for that. I thank the President for his support. I thank the \nRepublican leadership in the House for their support, but I mostly \nthank my colleagues and our new majority leader, Senator Frist, for \nmaking sure this was the first order of business for this 108th \nCongress.\n  What we did today to help the nearly 800,000 Americans who watched \ntheir unemployment benefits disappear at the stroke of midnight on \nSaturday, December 28, to make sure the program will be there for those \nwho are unfortunately coming on to the unemployment rolls was \nimportant, but it was not enough. We have to do more. We have to \nrecognize the people who have exhausted their benefits, who are working \nas hard as they can to get work, who are found throughout our country, \nin every walk of life, doing every kind of job with every sort of \nchallenge one could imagine. But what are we going to say to them?\n  We have a big task ahead of us to try to get our economy growing \nagain, create jobs, move our Nation in the right direction. This new \nproblem in the 21st century--new in the wake of the economic boom of \nthe 1990s, that we have tens of thousands of Americans who want to work \nbut cannot find a job--will have to be addressed.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to discuss a bill I am introducing.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in listening to my friend from New York \ntalk about homeland security and the work we will be doing, she agreed \nto cochair the A 9/11 caucus. I invite other Members of this body to \nget interested. We found out cell phones worked pretty well during 9/\n11. Communications worked fairly good. There were some weak points, but \nthose are being addressed. When we talk about 9/11 and wireless \ncommunications, there will be several of those issues that will come up \nin this Congress. We welcome the input of our colleagues as those \nissues move along.\n  Today we did take care of part of the unemployment compensation \nproblem, extending it to workers involuntarily and who became \ninvoluntarily unemployed during 9/11 or as a result of 9/11. There is \nnot one in this body who was not sympathetic to their cause. However, I \nhave another segment of the American economy that is hurting just as \nbadly. I will talk a little, by the way, today about the situation \ncalled drought. It is expanding throughout not only the upper Midwest \nbut through the western part of Kansas, Nebraska, Dakotas, Montana, and \nColorado, and extending down into New Mexico and the panhandle of \nOklahoma.\n  There are always islands and spots that get enough moisture. In this \nmorning's newspaper, the Billings Gazette in my hometown of Billings, \nMT, it was reported the water contents in the lower Yellowstone Basin \nsnow pack rank the third lowest on record. It is only 63 percent of \naverage. That one year at 63 percent average does not give cause for \nalarm. However, when\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\nyou look at the sixth year of these situations, you get alarmed.\n  Last Friday, I drove to Sheridan, MT. I have never seen in the Big \nHorns, in the range west and northwest of Sheridan, WY, a snow pack \nthat is as small as it is for this time of the year. The same is true \nin the Bear Tooth, but further west it is better. In the area important \nto irrigators and water users in my State, those snow packs are very \nlow.\n  Agriculture in those droughted areas is just hanging on. If not \nrelief this year, then we do not have to worry about them next year. \nThey will be unemployed, too, and for reasons beyond their control. It \nis beyond anyone's control. Yet they do not qualify for unemployment \nbenefits that we have approved today. A disaster package is being \nworked on. There are some folks averse to that.\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate and in the administration \ncontinue to cite the farm bill as a solution for drought-stricken \nAmerican agriculture. This bill is not retroactive, folks. It does not \naccount for the losses incurred in 2001 and 2002. I remember the debate \non that farm bill. The amount of money going to the Department of \nAgriculture sounded huge, spending almost $74.4 billion a year with the \nUSDA. But they ignored that 27 percent of that figure was dedicated to \nfarm programs and no money dedicated for disaster. Regarding the rest \nof the money, the American taxpayer should be overwhelmingly thanked \nfor their generosity by those who perhaps cannot speak for themselves. \nThat is, the working poor, women, infants and children, and food \nstamps. Mr. President, 63 percent of that humongous figure that people \nthought would go to production agriculture does not even go near \nproduction agriculture.\n  We thank the American taxpayer for making sure that, yes, there are \nfood and nutrition programs dedicated to those seeing tough times in \nother sectors the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program, school \nlunches and breakfasts, food stamps, WIC, a program administered by the \ncounties, to make sure young women, and usually young, single women, \nknow something about nutrition, and of course the programs that feed \nthem and their infants.\n  There are other programs under the umbrella of the USDA not directly \nto the producer, such as a nonagricultural loan and grant program to \ncommunities and individuals. How about this, folks? A historic barn \npreservation; or studies of animal welfare to see if mice should be \nused in scientific research. All this is from the huge pot of money \nthat made every headline, in every newspaper across the Nation as \nexcess spending for production agriculture.\n\n  So we thank the American taxpayer for funding those programs. We are \ntrying to work on a bill, to be introduced before this week is out, for \ndrought assistance. We cannot fight a natural hazard. If there were a \nway I could do it, I would. But we need just plain old rain and we need \nit before the spring thaw sets in.\n  So we passed the unemployment benefits today. What I am saying is \nthere are other wants and needs in this country, too, and they have to \ndo with the security and the safety of a good, strong agricultural food \nprogram. Once the legislation is introduced, the debate will begin, and \nit will be an interesting debate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I spoke earlier today on unemployment \ncompensation, and I am not going to repeat those statements. I think it \nis really unfortunate that some people maybe want to play politics with \nthis issue. I don't know. I am concerned. I am pleased we were able to \npass a bill that will help a lot of Americans. I had resisted in the \npast and will continue to resist efforts to double the Federal program \nfrom 13 weeks to 26 weeks for every State. This is a Federally financed \nprogram--financed entirely by the Federal Government. In other words, \npeople who participate in this program have already exhausted State \nbenefits which are 26 weeks. Last year in March or April we passed a \nFederal program for 13 weeks of benefits. Some people are saying that \n13 weeks should be 26 weeks. In other words, an unemployed person would \nbe able to receive 1 full year of unemployment compensation benefits \nregardless of whether or not they are in the high unemployment State. I \ndisagree with that. If you continue to expand unemployment benefits for \na longer duration, in some cases you are going to expand unemployment. \nIt will create disincentives for people to go to work.\n  I believe a fact of interest is that 70 percent of people receiving \nunemployed benefits are living in a household with an employed worker.\n  I just mention these facts not really to debate it but just to say \nthere is a real concern trying to turn a Federal program which is to be \ntemporary into a permanent program and to take a temporary program of \n13 weeks for all States and make that 26 weeks. That is very expensive. \nI have strong reservations about it. I opposed that several times last \nyear for months and will continue to do so if persons try to pass that \nproposal.\n  I might also mention there are several other expansions of \nunemployment compensation in the bill that was promoted last year. I \nbrought that to individuals' attention who were sponsoring it because I \nthink it had fatal flaws. I think, more importantly, rather than just \ntrying to figure out ways in which we could expand unemployment, we \nshould be figuring out ways to expand employment. How can we grow the \neconomy? How can we expand jobs? How can we create more jobs, and not \nreward people for not working but reward them for working? Let's create \ngreater incentives for work.\n  The President's speech today in Chicago outlined a growth package. I \ncompliment him for it. It is different. In many cases, it is very good \ntax policy. I really hope when we work on tax issues that will work for \nthings that are good tax policy. There are a lot of things under the \npresent code that need to be changed and that need to be corrected that \nare wrong and that are real disincentives to grow, build or expand--one \nof which is double taxation of dividends.\n  I used to run a corporation. Why in the world would a corporation or \nsomebody who runs a corporation want to pay dividends? The corporation \nhas to pay a 35-percent tax on the earnings. And dividends come out \nafter tax. So you have already paid a 35-percent rate. Then they are \npaid out to individuals. They also have to pay tax. The individual in \nall likelihood would be at a 27-percent rate, or a 30-percent rate, or \na 38-percent rate. So you had the 37 percent plus the 35 percent. You \nare already at a 73-percent tax rate. If a corporation makes $100, $73 \nof the $100 goes to taxation. That is not very good use of resources \nfrom a corporate manager's position. It is not very encouraging of \ninvestment. A lot of us would like to eliminate that unfair penalty of \ndouble taxation.\n  The President proposed that today. There are different ways of doing \nit. He proposed one. I compliment him for it. I also believe the \nPresident had a provision to allow greater use of what we call \nexpensing--allowing individuals--I believe in this case small \ncompanies--to expense items, I believe up to $75,000.\n  I used to run a small business. I have run a corporation. As I say, I \nhave also run a small business. But if you allow small business to \nexpense, they are going to be able to recoup the investment they make \nthat year. They make the investment that year, they expense it, and \nthey recoup that investment. That would greatly increase their \nincentives to make another investment. I think that is very positive \nfor job creation, maybe the most positive as far as getting jobs for \nthe dollars that we are talking about.\n  So I am pleased the President has that in his proposal. I hope this \nCongress will aggressively pursue expensing and/or accelerated \ndepreciation or more realistic depreciation schedules over the life of \nthese properties.\n  Far too many properties, under current tax laws and current \nregulations, require depreciation over a long period\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\nof time, much longer, in some cases, than the actual lives of the \nproperty. That discourages investment. So I encourage our colleagues, \nif we want to create jobs, let's work on accelerating depreciation or \nallow people to expense items or at least allow a shorter depreciation \ncycle for a lot of goods and services.\n  One example is software. A year ago, I believe, or 2 years ago, the \ndepreciable life of software was 5 years. It was the same thing for \ncomputers and equipment. But we all know software is obsolete in a \ncouple years, and hardware, for the most part, is probably obsolete in \n2 or 3 years, certainly not 5 years. So allowing for a more realistic \ndepreciation schedule makes sense.\n  Another example is improvements that you would make for apartments \nand homes if you are in the rental business. Right now, you have to \ndepreciate these improvements over 39 years. If you have an apartment \ncomplex, and you want to make some investments to upgrade that \napartment, you should be able to depreciate those improvements over a \nmuch shorter period of time than 39 years. It should be more like 15 \nyears, maybe even 10 years. If we made that change, a lot of people \nwould make those investments. A lot of jobs would be created in the \nprocess.\n  The President's proposal also says that we should have acceleration \nof the tax cuts that are already on the books. I agree with him \nwholeheartedly. Tax cuts, some of which are now scheduled for 2004, \nsome of which are scheduled for 2006, in my opinion, should be made \nimmediate, January 1, 2003.\n  If we want to have any positive economic impact from them, it does \nnot do a lot of good knowing that they are going to come in a couple of \nyears. Let's make them immediate. I know some people want to play class \nwarfare and say: Wait a minute, that is a tax cut for the wealthy. If \nwe did it immediately, the maximum tax rate would be 35 percent. When \nPresident Clinton was elected, the maximum tax rate was 31 percent. So \nit is still almost 20 percent higher than it was when President Clinton \nwas elected. Now, 35 percent--why should the Federal Government be \nentitled to take over a third of what an individual makes? I believe 35 \npercent is a little over a third.\n  So why is that such a bad deal? We have to look at taxation policy, \nwhat is right, what is fair. Should the Federal Government be entitled \nto automatically take that amount?\n  I talk about marginal tax rates a lot because high marginal tax rates \ninhibit individuals, investors, entrepreneurs, small businesspeople, \nfarmers, and ranchers from building and expanding if they have to work \nfor the Government the majority of the time.\n\n  I used to be self-employed. Self-employed individuals pay the highest \nmarginal tax rates of anybody. And guess what they create: about 70 or \n80 percent of the jobs in America. You do not have to be very wealthy \nbefore you find out you are working as much for Uncle Sam as for \nyourself.\n  I will give you an example. A self-employed individual who has a \ntaxable income of $30,000 is in a 20-percent marginal Federal income-\ntax bracket. I believe any additional dollar they make above $27,000, \n$28,000 is taxed at a 27-percent rate. That individual also has to pay \nwhat are commonly called FICA taxes, Social Security, and Medicare tax. \nThat tax totals 15.3 percent. If you add 15.3 percent, plus the 27 \npercent, you get to 42.3 percent. So any additional dollar of income \nprofits that the painter makes--I used to be a janitor--or a janitor \nmakes, or someone who has some type of business, any profit they make \nabove that $30,000, the Federal Government gets 42.3 percent of it.\n  If they are working in most States, they end up paying a State income \ntax. There are a few States that do not have an income tax. Most States \nhave an income tax of 6 or 7 percent.\n  If you add 7 percent on top of the 42.3 percent, you are already \nright at 50 percent in taxes on any additional dollar of income \ngenerated from their work. That is a real disincentive to build, grow, \nor expand. I have been there. I was there with a janitorial service, so \nit did not take me very long to realize, wait a minute, why should this \nbusiness grow if we are going to be working more for the Government \nthan we work for ourselves?\n  The President, talking about trying to accelerate the existing tax \ncuts that are on the books, is exactly right. It is a small reduction \nin marginal rates. Even at that, the rates are still much higher for \nupper income people, far higher than they were during the Clinton \nadministration.\n  The President has also proposed making the child tax credit effective \nimmediately. Several years ago, we passed, as part of the 1997 bill, a \n$500 tax credit per child. I was one of the sponsors of that. We passed \nthat. That became law. That was good. In 2001, President Bush's first \ntax bill, we passed another $500 tax credit per child, but we phased it \nin over several years. In the first year, we gave a $100 tax credit. \nThere is still $400 that becomes effective in the outyears.\n  What the President has proposed is, let's make that effective this \nyear. I have heard some say: Wait a minute. The President's proposal \ndoesn't do anything for people making $35,000 or $40,000 a year.\n  That is not true. If they have one child, it is $400. If they have \nthree children, that is $1,200 more per year they get to keep.\n  So I urge my colleagues to look at the President's proposal because I \nthink it is a positive change. Let's make that $1,000 tax credit per \nchild effective this year, not $600, as is present law. Let's make it \n$1,000 this year. That will help families. That will help individuals \nwho have children as dependents.\n  The President, as well, has also proposed making the marriage penalty \nelimination, that is now spread out over several years, effective \nimmediately. The net impact of this is a great positive change for \nmarried couples, particularly married couples who have incomes in the \nrange from $30,000 to $40,000 to $50,000, $55,000. They will be the \nbiggest beneficiaries of this proposal because the changes that we made \nin 2001 in the Tax Code say that really what we should do, for \na married couple, is double the 15-percent bracket for an individual.\n\n  I believe the figures are something like, an individual pays 15 \npercent on their taxable income up to about $27,750. But a couple pays \n15 percent up to an income of about $46,400. So an individual pays 15 \npercent up to $27,750, but a couple pays--or another way of saying that \nis, anything above $27,750, an individual pays 27 percent, anything \nabove $46,400, a couple has to pay 27 percent. So if they were taxed as \nindividuals, they could have a combined income of $55,500 before they \nwould go into the 27-percent tax bracket. What we did in eliminating \nthe marriage penalty relief was, over some period of time, double that \nindividual 15-percent bracket. So the couple would not have to pay 27 \npercent until they had income above $55,500. Right now, they pay about \n$10,000 or $12,000 of that at the 27-percent bracket instead of the 15-\npercent bracket. The net result is, you are talking about $1,200 in \nsavings, tax savings for couples who have taxable incomes of $40,000 to \n$50,000. That is a pretty good change. If they have a couple kids, they \nget another $400 tax credit per child. So if you have four kids and a \ntaxable income of $54,000, the way I am thinking, that is $1,600 and \n$1,200, so $2,800. It is a pretty significant reduction and savings for \na married couple with four kids with a taxable income of $50,000 or \n$60,000. And it happens to apply to a lot of middle-income Americans.\n  So I compliment the President for his combination of changes where he \nwants to grow the economy. It helps married families. It helps families \nwith kids. It helps taxpayers. And it helps eliminate a well-known \ndouble taxation in the Tax Code, the double taxation of dividends that \nare really at exorbitant rates, which discourages investment, which \ndiscourages corporate ownership, which discourages equity, and \nencourages debt, which is not a very good policy--present law.\n  The President says, let's correct it. I think he is right in doing \nso. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see if we can't \nwork in a bipartisan fashion to put together a real package that will \nhelp grow jobs this year.\n  I think that should be our challenge, not to say, here is the \nDemocrat package, here is the Republican package. I say let's work \ntogether as we have\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\ndone historically in the Finance Committee to see if we can't pass \nsomething good for America, good for American taxpayers and good for \nAmerican families and good for our economy.\n  We should have our economy grow. Revenues declined last year by 7 \npercent. Somebody said, why is there a deficit? There is a deficit \nbecause of the tax cut?\n  The deficit is not because of the tax cut. It is because there has \nbeen a real recession. Revenues have declined because the stock market \nstarted declining dramatically in March of 2000. The Nasdaq index was \nat 5,000. It is around 1,500, 1,600 now. So you see there has been a \nreal decline in markets. That has caused a real decline in revenues to \nthe Government.\n  We need to do some positive things that will increase equity values \nand increase ownership in America's companies, that will create jobs, \nthat will create real growth in the economy. The President has outlined \na constructive package. I look forward to working with the President \nand my colleagues to enact a positive package for America this year.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to spend a few minutes this \nafternoon commenting on the debate that is before the Senate, our \nchallenge to shape an unemployment compensation package or relief \npackage that will help workers and do what is right by them.\n  Before I do, I wish to take a moment to thank many people, many \nfriends, many family members who are gathered in Washington and at home \nin Louisiana and around the country for their support, their prayers, \nand their help in the recent election cycle. I am back in the Senate at \nwork in large part because of so many wonderful people who went beyond \nthe call of duty, beyond what is expected and believed in what our \ncampaign represented and what we spoke about and what I spoke about--\nputting the interests of Louisiana first as it comes to representing \nthat great State in this body, speaking about the issues people all \nover the Nation are concerned about, primarily the economy, keeping \ntheir families, their homes, their hearth together, protecting the \nNation from the threat of terrorism, and shoring up our defenses \nagainst the great challenges before the Nation.\n  I said many times over those months that it was important for us to \nspeak the truth, that what Washington needed was leaders, not labels; \nthat while we were proud of our parties respectively, we should not \nfollow them blindly but should try to, as our new leader from Tennessee \nspoke this morning, put the country first. I hope his words and agenda \nand the words and agendas that come out of the Senate, fashioned by the \nmen and women now in this body, will put the country first, will think \nabout the fathers and mothers, the children, the workers who make up \nAmerica, who are attempting as a nation, together, unified, black and \nwhite, Hispanic, Asian, and many other nationalities from all over the \nworld, to speak with one voice to help lead this world in a challenging \ntime.\n  I thank particularly my husband and two children, the many members of \nmy family, my parents, brothers and sisters and cousins. I joke often \nin Louisiana that one of the reasons I win is because if my family just \nvotes for me, that is so many votes I always have a little advantage \nover my opponent. But truly, their votes, their work, and their prayers \nwere noted in my heart today.\n  I couldn't think of a better way to thank the people of Louisiana and \nthe Nation than to actually be on the floor of the Senate speaking \nabout an issue important to them and taking a few minutes out of the \nfestivities, as we all celebrate our return, our victories, large and \nsmall, to the Senate and to Washington, new assignments, et cetera, to \nspend a moment speaking about the unemployment insurance program and \nthe desperate need of people in this country.\n  We have not seen unemployment rates this high in so many years. We \nhave not seen a downturn in the economy such as this in so many years. \nI rise to speak for a moment about the great need, as we fashion a \nstimulus package, as we fashion an aid package, not a charity package, \nnot a handout package, but a hand up package, a package not to people \nwho are undeserving, a package not to people who don't work, a package \nnot to people who don't want to work, but a stimulus package that \nhonors the strength of America, the fact that people are working not \njust one job in many cases but two and three jobs, in this time of \nuncertainty, moving from job to job, people doing whatever it takes to \nkeep that mortgage paid, to keep their car notes paid, to invest in the \ntools and resources they need to keep their families together and keep \ntheir net worth growing, not decreasing.\n\n  That has been a challenge for average Americans. It has been a \nchallenge for everyone, as many people have seen their retirements \nshrink, not through any fault of their own. Every one realizes there is \nrisk associated with investment. But I am sure the workers from Enron \nand WorldCom and others affected all over our country would have reason \nto stand on the floor of the Senate, if they could get here, and say, \nlisten, some of this was out of my control or my ability to manage or \nregulate.\n  Some of it was done, as we know, fraudulently and without respect for \nthe law. Frankly, maybe Congress didn't have as tight reins on some of \nthese situations as we should have. So there are Americans who are \nangry and anxious and frustrated. I most certainly appreciate that. \nHaving just come off a long and grueling campaign, I heard from many of \nthese workers in Louisiana.\n  Here we are, the first day, trying to fashion a package. I have \nlistened to people talking about the program. I want to explain the \nunemployment insurance program. First, there is $26 billion in the \ntrust fund. It is a program, an enterprise established for the purposes \nof helping Americans when they need help. It is not a welfare or a \ncharity program. There are certain times when welfare is good. And all \nthe time, charity is good. But we are not talking about charity. We are \ntalking about money that workers from their pockets put into a trust \nfund that grows with interest so when the economy turns down, they can, \nif the Members of Congress say it is OK, pull that money down, put it \nin their pocket, pay their car note, which makes the car dealer happy, \npay their house note, which makes the banker happy, pay their loan to \nthe credit card companies, which makes them happy, pay their money to \nthe credit union that keeps the credit unions going, pay the grocery \nstore, pay the gas bill, pay the cleaners to keep the small businesses \ngoing. Does anybody think these unemployment checks go in the bank just \nsitting there waiting to be invested?\n  I hope not, because people who have worked hard at a $50,000, \n$60,000, $70,000 job, who went to school sometimes late at night to get \ntheir skills, studied after putting their children to bed, way into the \nnight, and worked hard to get those skills, now look to Washington to \nhelp.\n  We have people on this floor who talk about this as if it is a \ncharity program. These people are due, number one, the money they put \nin the trust fund. Number two, it is not their fault that unemployment \nis 6, 7, or 8 percent. It is our fault, if it is anybody's fault, \nbecause we are not managing the situation well enough--not that it can \nbe perfectly done, but it hasn't happened yet. It most certainly is not \nthe fault of the workers who have been laid off. They came not to ask \nfor money that belongs to somebody else, but to ask us to give them \ntheir money so they can get through this hard time.\n  We have to listen to House Republican leaders tell us that there is \nnot enough money in the trust fund, when there is $26 billion in the \ntrust fund, and we are arguing about whether we want something that \ncosts $1 billion or $4 billion. And if we weren't spending the \nunemployment trust fund now, when would we spend it?\n  So for the 1.6 million full-time workers in Louisiana, for the \n303,000 part-\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\ntime workers in Louisiana, for the 1.085 million workers in Louisiana \nwho work on an hourly wage, and for the 42,000 workers in Louisiana who \nwork at the minimum wage, $5.15--I will repeat that--$5.15--because \nthis President and the Republican leadership refuse to increase the \nminimum wage, so these workers are working at $5.15 an hour because \nthis President refuses to raise the minimum wage, or to support a raise \nin the minimum wage--we are going to tell these people that while there \nis $26 billion in the trust fund, we choose not to ``expand'' the \nprogram.\n  Let me register my strongest objection to that, and let me on behalf \nof the 4.5 million people in my State register their strong objection \nto that and say how disappointed they are that this administration and \nthe House Republican leadership refuse to give them the money they put \nin the fund so when times went bad they would have it to keep paying \ntheir house note, so they didn't lose all the equity they have spent \nthe last 20 years of their lives working for.\n  Let me also object to the sentiment expressed too often on this floor \nthat we have to give people an incentive to work. I don't know too many \npeople who don't want to work. I really don't. Whether they work for a \npaycheck or stay at home raising seven children, or nine children, or \nfour children, they work very hard. I don't know too many Americans who \ndon't want to work because with work comes dignity, with work comes \nself-satisfaction, with work comes thinking that you are doing \nsomething to help yourself and your family and your country. I know \nthat a job or a small business is what most people aspire \noverwhelmingly to. But when that small business or that job slips out \nof their hands, not because they didn't do a great job or because they \ndon't enjoy working, but because the company and because the policies \nthat we are managing have come short, and we hand them that pink slip \nand we say, go for it, you have 13 weeks to find another job--a job \nhaving the same benefits and salary--and when it runs out, we might \nconsider giving you another 13 weeks, we have to look people in the eye \nand say I am sorry, there is no more help--when there is $26 billion \nsitting in this account.\n  So I wanted to register my strongest objection to leaving out a \nportion of these workers and to say for the workers in my State that I \nam going to be here now for 6 years fighting for them, talking for \nthem. I hope I can do it adequately to meet how worthy they are. I am \ngoing to do my very best to represent them in as forceful and effective \nway possible on this and many other issues.\n\n  Let me close with giving a few concrete suggestions. If we are going \nto have a stimulus package, let's be truthful and honest about the \nportions of it that will actually stimulate the economy and those that \nmight stimulate our conference next election time. I ask the \nadministration to relook at their package. Why don't we have the \npayroll tax holiday? The payroll tax holiday has been judged by \nconservative and liberal think tanks to be one of the most effective, \nimmediate stimuli we can provide for the Nation. The money doesn't have \nto come out of the Social Security trust fund. It can come out of the \ngeneral fund, based on payroll taxes. It is fair to every worker--the \nvery wealthy, the middle income, and the poor. It rewards the idea of \nwork. It is immediate and it is $1,500 per family. That $1,500 could be \nused immediately in this economy to give people confidence and to prime \nthe pump, if you will.\n  The Social Security offset--again, putting money into the hands of \nworkers, retirees, people who have worked hard now, instead of getting \nboth their full retirement checks--teachers in many instances are \noffset by their Social Security benefits--what good does that do if we \ncan provide both, which we have the money to do, which is less \nexpensive than this package, and give them both of those checks.\n  Those people are in a time of their life when they are spending that \nmoney--not saving it, but spending it to live. That primes the pump in \nthis Nation, as well as everything we can do to give depreciation for \nreal estate, which would help in investments, and accelerating tax \nreductions for small business owners. But anything outside of that is \nactually nothing but stimulating some other special interests for other \npurposes, other than, in my opinion, strengthening this economy. That \nis wrong.\n  I hope Congress and this Senate will work hard to fashion a stimulus \npackage that is truly stimulative, affordable, financially responsible, \nand something that really helps all people, and not just those at the \nvery top, but those who count on us to do our part to help them do what \nthey are trying to do for their families and their communities.\n  Mr. President, I am here giving my strongest support for moving \nforward with the unemployment compensation benefits, but very \ndisappointed--extremely disappointed--that over a third to a half of \nworkers in this Nation have been left out, and to say that we should \ninclude everyone, and we should focus on making the program better and \nmore effective so that it is more helpful. I will tell you $182 a week, \nor $250 a week--the average payment in Louisiana--doesn't go far. You \ncannot even pay a grocery bill for a family with three or four children \nwith $200 a week. I don't know where you get gas money, rent money, or \nmortgage payments on top of that. So this Congress has a lot to do when \nit comes to reforming, reshaping, revitalizing, and redesigning the \nunemployment insurance program for this Nation. I hope to be a part of \nthat. But for today, extending that benefit--at least for all the \nworkers who deserve it--again, it is not our money; it is theirs. They \nworked hard for it. There is $26 billion in the trust fund and we \nshould give it to them.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I am happy we were able to get an \nextension of unemployment compensation earlier today so there is a \nseamless flow of checks from December 28 through the period of our new \nlegislation. If we had not completed it today, and hopefully in the \nHouse tomorrow and with the President's signature on Thursday, there \nwould have been a lapse of those checks. We could have gone back and \nmade up the difference but there still would have been a period of time \nthat unemployed people would not get checks. I know there was a lot of \nconcern on the other side of the aisle that we were trying to pass this \ntoo quickly. I am glad they backed down and allowed us to move ahead.\n  During the debate that took the form of reserving the right to \nobject, there were a number of statements made about what they wanted \nto do. I take the opportunity to clarify the record of what my \nDemocratic colleagues were really talking about. A number of colleagues \nhave made the statement that the unemployment extension we passed \nearlier today leaves out a million workers.\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\n  Under the regular State unemployment program--and this is under \nlongstanding law--workers are entitled to as much as 26 weeks of \nunemployment benefits. Under the temporary federally funded \nunemployment program that Congress passed last March, which we are \ncontinuing now, those who exhaust their State regular unemployment \nbenefits can receive up to 13 weeks of additional benefits. In \naddition, the program we passed last March provided up to 13 weeks of \nyet more benefits in extremely high unemployment States. In those high \nunemployment States, that means a maximum of 26 weeks of Federal \nbenefits on top of the usual 26 weeks of State benefits. I repeat, \nworkers in every State can collect 39 weeks of benefits--26 weeks \nState, plus 13 weeks Federal. And workers in high unemployment States \ncan collect 52 weeks of benefits--26 weeks of State benefits and 13 \nweeks Federal, plus an additional 13 weeks for unemployed people in the \nhigh unemployment States.\n  As we discussed, the bill we passed earlier today would allow more \nthan 2 million workers to collect extended benefits through May of this \nyear. According to some of my Democratic colleagues, that is not \nenough. They want to let workers who have collected 26 weeks of regular \nState benefits plus 13 weeks of federally funded benefits collect an \nadditional 13 weeks of benefits, for a total of 52 weeks of benefits \nfor everyone, every place, regardless of the unemployment rate of a \nparticular State. In other words, the agreement we reached last March \nto provide up to 9 months of benefits in every State, and 12 months of \nbenefits in high unemployment States, is no longer good enough as \nindicated by the debate of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nearlier this afternoon. They want 12 months of benefits for everyone in \nevery State regardless of whether unemployment is going up or going \ndown.\n  They claim extending last year's agreement leaves out a million \nworkers. I respectfully disagree. Their proposal goes well beyond \nanything Congress has ever done. It provides 12 months of federally \nfunded benefits to all workers in every State. While the national \nunemployment rate is higher than it was at this time last year, the \nunemployment rate in 20 States is now lower than it was a year ago.\n  Under current law, no one can receive more in federally funded \nbenefits than they received in State benefits. In other words, those \nwho collect 26 weeks of State benefits could also collect 26 weeks of \nfederally funded benefits; but in those States that might have only 20 \nweeks of State benefits, then there would only be 20 weeks of federally \nfunded benefits under current law. So there is a link between what we \ngive in Federal benefits and State benefits. This link is designed to \ngive States the ability to honor their unemployment program.\n  Although we have not seen the latest version, the Democratic proposal \nwould break this link. By breaking the link, it would pay federally \nfunded benefits without regard to the 26 week level of State \nbenefits. This represents a very historic and unprecedented expansion \nof the unemployment program.\n\n  While we may need to revisit the issue of unemployment benefits later \nthis year, it seems to me that we should carefully review this proposal \nbefore final action. In the meantime, we have had an opportunity to \nmake sure that there is a seamless flow of checks from December 28, \nnow, to those 750,000 unemployed people who would otherwise have had a \nlapse in receiving unemployment compensation, plus probably 2.5 million \npeople connected with those respective families. And, for people on the \nother side of the aisle who think they have legitimacy and want to \ndiscuss these additional issues, the institution of the Senate is very \nprone towards hearing any idea that Senators want presented, having an \nenvironment or a forum for the presentation of that. So we probably \nwill be forced to, and maybe ought to, review what the Democrats \npropose today. But we should not do it in an environment as we had \ntoday. If it had been adopted today, I am sure the House of \nRepresentatives would not have accepted it and, obviously, if we had \ngone to conference to work out the differences, no bill would have been \npresented to the President of the United States by Thursday--for his \nsignature in time, then, to keep a seamless flow of unemployment \nchecks.\n  So I am glad we were able to work this out. Obviously, as chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, I have to be open to discussion of any \nissues dealing with unemployment. I look forward to those discussions \nbut in an environment that does not stall the flow of checks for people \nwho are deserving of them, and that is those people who would have \notherwise been cut off on December 28.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will again suggest the absence of a \nquorum, but I ask the time be evenly charged against each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I now suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to have a vote in a short time. \nIt is going to be a vote on adjourning the Senate. That is what the \nvote will be.\n  But in substance it is more than that. We have had a number of \nSenators here who have requested a vote on adjournment. The reason they \nhave done that is because they believe they should be able to have a \nvote on unemployment benefits for the people who are not covered in the \nlegislation we just passed. So let there be no mistake, even though \nthis procedurally is a vote on adjourning the Senate, the substantive \naspect of this vote is that people who vote to adjourn the Senate today \nat approximately 5 o'clock will be voting to not allow about 1 million \npeople to have unemployment benefits.\n  That is what this is about. I have told my friend, my counterpart, \nthat there are a number of people who believed a vote was \ninappropriate. There are people who have worked on both sides of the \naisle not to have a vote today. But there are a number of people who \nbelieve the vote is important. I want to make sure, before that vote \noccurs at 5 o'clock, that people know what the purpose of the vote is.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend from \nNevada, the motion to adjourn will have absolutely nothing to do with \nunemployment benefits. It is simply, in the judgment of this Senator, \nan ill-advised attempt to disrupt what is typically a ceremonial day. \nWe have Members of the Senate who were sworn in today--some of them \nbrand new, some of them for the second and third and fourth and fifth \nterms--who have family in town. They are scattered all about the \nCapitol and off the Capitol with receptions for their friends.\n  There is nothing, I would say, that the other side could do today on \nthis issue that they could not do on Thursday on this issue. If they \nwant to make a point on the subject, certainly that is always possible \nin the Senate, the Senate being the Senate.\n  But this is going to be extremely disruptive to the Members and their \nfamilies. I am told by floor staff there is nothing we can do to \nprevent this vote, and so we will have it. But hopefully we will have \nit with enough notice to give our colleagues, who are scattered around \ntown with their families and friends, an opportunity to come back and \ncast a completely unnecessary vote, which has nothing to do with \nanything other than whether or not we adjourn tonight.\n  Make no mistake about it, this is a meaningless vote. It is simply a \nprocedural vote that we normally would not take at the end of the day. \nNo effort to describe it otherwise would be sufficient to convince \nanyone that this is anything more than simply a motion to adjourn.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, my best wishes today go to the Salt \nRiver Project on the celebration of its centennial of service to the \ncommunities of central Arizona.\n  When the Salt River Project, or SRP, was created on February 7, 1903, \nArizona was still a territory and the people who had settled its \ncentral desert valleys had just endured a period of devastating \ndroughts. They knew the future of their farms, businesses, and families \ndepended on securing a reliable supply of water. If they failed, they \nwere sure to witness the continued withering of their farms and \nlivelihoods.\n  With commitment, they banded together to form the Salt River Valley \nWater Users Association, later to become SRP. With courage, they \nmortgaged their lands as debt collateral for a federal loan that was \ngranted under terms of the National Reclamation Act of 1902. And the \nresult eight years later was the completion of a great monolithic stone \ndam that was named after the President, Theodore Roosevelt. It would be \nthe first of other dams and water works built through partnership with \nSRP and federal and local governments to ensure the economic vitality \nof my native state.\n  Without Roosevelt Dam, Arizona's early communities could not have \ngrown. Similarly, growth would not have continued without SRP's \ndevelopment and management of early hydropower resources and later \nleadership and partnership in constructing extensive generation and \ntransmission systems to fuel Arizona's economy.\n  In the past century, SRP has become Arizona's largest water supplier \nand the third largest public power provider in the nation. It has \ngained a reputation as a utility with a record for service, safety, and \ncommitment to the environment and human services. As SRP celebrates its \ncentennial, it deserves recognition for its past achievements and for \nthe important role it will continue to play in Arizona's advancement in \nthe 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/07/senate-section/article/S26-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO GOVERNOR FELIX CAMACHO AND LT.

Mr. President, in 1998, the Senate passed the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act, which I strongly \nsupported. This landmark legislation set the Internal Revenue Service, \nIRS, on a new course, one that most Members of this body would agree is \nthe right one. Today, the IRS is much more focused on customer service \nand education to achieve compliance with the Nation's tax laws.\n  It takes more than a new law, however, to change the way an agency \nfulfills its mission. It takes talented people committed to those \nreforms in order to turn the words in the statute into reality. We all \nknow the role that former Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti played in \nrestructuring the agency, and I commend him again for his invaluable \nservice to the IRS and the Nation.\n  Today, I rise to recognize one of Mr. Rossotti's key aides, Jerry \nSongy, who is retiring after 34 years of dedication to agency. In early \n1998, Jerry was selected to lead an organizational modernization effort \nthat was intended to transform the IRS into a more customer-focused \norganization. Jerry's contributions to this business-process \nreengineering effort have greatly improved the delivery of products and \nservices to all of America's taxpayers, and small businesses and the \nself-employed taxpayers in particular.\n  In addition to serving as Executive Director, Modernization Design, \nJerry was instrumental in the design of the Small Business/Self-\nEmployed, SB/SE, operating division, which serves approximately 45 \nmillion small businesses and self-employed taxpayers. He was also a \ndriving force in the creation of the Taxpayer Education and \nCommunication, TEC, section and has led the SB/SE division in its \noutreach and education efforts to small business and self-employed \ntaxpayers. As the former Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I had the pleasure of working \nwith Jerry in that capacity.\n  Through his efforts, the IRS has created innovative web site \napplications, multilingual CDs, and a series of web cast programs to \nassist taxpayers with their tax filing and payment responsibilities. \nThe IRS has partnered with tax practitioner and payroll organizations, \ntrade and professional organizations, educational institutions, and \ncorporate America on joint tax education initiatives. In short, our \nconstituents are seeing the tangible benefits of Jerry's hard work on \nbehalf of small enterprises across the nation.\n  Jerry was born and raised in New Orleans, LA and graduated from \nLoyola University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting. He \nhas two sons, three grandchildren, and will be joined in retirement by \nhis wife, Lea, who also has had a distinguished career with the IRS.\n  On behalf of the 45 million small businesses and self-employed \ntaxpayers throughout the country that have benefitted from his hard \nwork and dedication, I commend Jerry Songy for his exemplary \ncontributions to public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/07/senate-section/article/S26-5", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S26-S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BONNIE NICKOL\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nBonnie Nickol of Little Rock, Arkansas, who has committed herself to \nhelping working families in Arkansas through the Arkansas Single Parent \nScholarship Fund.\n  Bonnie's first involvement with the scholarship fund came in 1997. \nThe fund's director, Ralph Nesson, knowing of Bonnie's interest in \neducation, introduced her to several of the people who benefit from \nthis statewide network of scholarship programs that help single parents \nget the education they need to better provide for their families. \nBonnie was touched by the efforts\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\nof these women and men to raise children, hold steady jobs, and attend \ncollege--and she resolved to help.\n  And help she did. Upon learning that the Pulaski County Single Parent \nScholarship Fund was able to offer only about 10 scholarships per year, \nand that many deserving single parents were being turned away due to a \nlack of funds and resources. Bonnie joined the board of directors and \ncommitted herself to expanding the program. From 1998 until 2002, \nBonnie chaired the fund's board of directors. Under her leadership, the \nfund began to grow dramatically. In 1998, the fund awarded 16 \nscholarships worth a total of $8,000. By 2002, the fund was awarding 98 \nscholarships worth more than $63,000. That's an increase of 600 percent \nin just four years. On top of that, the amount of each scholarship \nawarded increased by $150, meaning that every recipient is now enjoying \na more generous benefit than ever before. The Single Parent Scholarship \nFund has also raised its profile by pursuing corporate and foundation \ngrants and through private fund-raising events.\n  In addition to increasing the fund's size, Bonnie has spearheaded the \neffort to provide enhanced support services to scholarship recipients. \nAmong these services are volunteer mentors and loaned computers to help \nensure student success. In addition, Bonnie made a point of forging \npersonal relationships with many of the scholarship recipients, meeting \nwith each of them once per semester to encourage them and seek \nfeedback; coordinating the selection process to ensure that \nscholarships are awarded in a fair, timely, and efficient manner; and \ncontinually working to improve service available to recipients.\n  These efforts are paying real dividends for the fund in terms of \nsuccess. Since January 1998, an astonishing 94 percent of scholarship \nrecipients have either graduated or are still in school working toward \ntheir degrees. Fifty-eight parents have graduated since 1998. That's a \ntremendous record of success, for which Bonnie and all of the other \nvolunteers with the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund can be \njustifiable proud.\n  Bonnie Nickol will retire from the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship \nFund this year, and while her leadership will be sorely missed, others \nwho share Bonnie's vision and commitment will most certainly follow. In \nthe meantime, she continues to provide her valuable leadership and \nvolunteer energy for a number of groups in Arkansas, including New \nFutures for Youth, the Jewish Federation of Arkansas, and the Artspace \nArtists Cooperative. But of all her contributions, her most impressive \nmay be the work that she's done with the Arkansas Single Parent \nScholarship Fund, work that has made it possible for dozens of single \nparents in Arkansas to get their degrees and improve their job \nprospects for the future. I salute Bonnie's efforts, and I hope that \nothers will look to her as an example of how one person can lend their \ntime, talents, and energy to make a difference in his or her community \nand in the lives of others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/07/senate-section/article/S27-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO FALLEN FIREFIGHTERS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on November 25, 2002, Oregonians \nwere reminded once again what the whole nation witnessed on September \n11, 2001, that the men and women who run into burning buildings when \neveryone else is running out, are true heroes.\n  For it was on November 25, 2002, when Randy Carpenter, Jeffrey Common \nand Chuck Hanners, all members of the Coos Bay Fire Department, gave \ntheir lives while protecting others, when the roof of a warehouse \ncollapsed during a fire.\n  Randy Carpenter was a thirteen year veteran of the Coos Bay Fire \nDepartment. He was a mentor to many young firefighters, and was \nrespected as a man of integrity and professionalism. Along with \nfighting fires, Randy built houses and taught emergency medical aid \nclasses. He was a loving father to two daughters.\n  Like his father, Jeffrey Common was a volunteer member of the Coos \nBay Fire Department. He worked in the tugboat business and was the \ndevoted father of three young children.\n  Chuck Hanners was also a volunteer member of the Coos Bay Fire \nDepartment. He served as the manager of a retail sporting goods \ndepartment, but always carried a scanner in his back pocket so he could \nrush to a fire whenever help was needed. He left behind a wife and six \nchildren.\n  At a very moving memorial service, which was attended by over 7,000 \ncommunity members and delegations of firefighters from across Oregon \nand the Pacific Northwest, Chuck's 17-year-old son, Daniel, read from \nthe Firefighter's Prayer. The last line of this prayer says, ``If \naccording to fate, I am to lose my life, please bless with your hand my \nchildren and my wife.''\n  I join with countless other Oregonians in extending my prayers and \ncondolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of these three \ncourageous Oregonians. While I was not privileged to know Randy, Jeff, \nand Chuck, I know of the pride they took in serving as a first \nresponder, and I know that in giving themselves for others, they made \nthemselves special, not just to us, but to God. The Bible tells us that \n``Greater love than this has no man than to lay down his life for his \nfriends.'' Because God is love, we know He was there with them when \nthey died, and that He is with them still.\n  One of America's most beautiful monuments to courage and unselfish \nservice is the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, MD. \nFlags at this Memorial were flown at half-staff in honor of Randy, Jeff \nand Chuck. And their names will also be added to a plaque at the \nmonument, which stands near an eternal flame that represents the spirit \nof the firefighter, past, present, and future.\n  The holiday season was a tough one for many in Coos Bay, but I hope \nthat community members can take solace in the fact that they are \nfortunate to live in a community and we are all fortunate to live in a \ncountry that produces individuals like Randy, Jeff, and Chuck, \nindividuals who are willing every day to risk their life so others \nmight be safe. May God Bless the men and women of the Coos Bay Fire \nDepartment, and all fire department across the country, and may God \nBless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/07/senate-section/article/S27-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/07/senate-section/article/S27-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/07/senate-section/article/S27-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S27-S34]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1.

Mr. President, officially, the Congress that ended in \nDecember was the 107th Congress. But history will almost surely record \nit as the September 11th Congress. From the moment the first plane hit \nthe first tower until the last moments of the lameduck session, helping \nAmerica recover from that horrific day, bringing its plotters to \njustice and making changes to protect America from future terrorist \nattacks dominated the Senate's agenda.\n  We continued that work--even as we confronted unprecedented \nchallenges in the Senate: anthrax, the rise of new threats to our \nNation, and the loss of our friend and colleague, Paul Wellstone.\n  Through tragic and historic events, the 107th Senate under Democratic \ncontrol produced a number of important legislative accomplishments: \naviation security and counterterrorism legislation; the toughest \ncorporate accountability law since the SEC was created in 1934; the \nmost far-reaching campaign finance reforms since Watergate; the most \nsignificant overhaul of Federal education policies since 1965; and a \nnew farm bill to replace the failed Freedom to Farm Act.\n  However, other important legislation fell victim to special-interest \narm-twisting, and the other party's unwillingness to compromise on \ntheir proposals, or even consider ours. We saw that on proposals to \ndedicate greater resources to homeland security, a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, and a real, enforceable patients' bill of \nrights.\n  The proposals we are introducing today recognize that the American \npeople have real concerns about their security, and that Republicans \nand the Bush administration have not done enough to address those \nconcerns.\n  But they also recognize that security means more than national \nsecurity, and homeland security. It means economic security, retirement \nsecurity, and the security of knowing that our children are getting a \ngood education, and that, if you get sick, health care is available and \naffordable. It means giving people who work fulltime the security of \nknowing they can earn a decent wage--whether they work on a farm, in a \nfactory, or at a fast-food restaurant. It is the security of knowing \nthat our air is safe to breathe and our water is safe to drink, that \nAmerica is living up to its commitment to civil rights, and that we are \nkeeping our promises to our veterans.\n  Democrats are committed to tackling terrorism abroad, and making our \ncountry more secure.\n  One of our first priorities will be to make Americans safer by \nenhancing protections for our ports, borders, food and water supplies, \nand chemical and nuclear plants.\n  We are introducing a bill to commit real resources to doing all of \nthose things, and to hiring more police and first responders and \nproviding them the tools and training to do the difficult jobs we are \nnow asking them to do.\n  We also recognize that national strength also depends on economic \nstrength, and in the last 2 years, America's economy has weakened. In \nthe coming weeks, we will put forward our ideas for how best to \nstimulate the economy in the short term.\n  But, in the long term, one of the most important things we can do is \ngive people greater confidence that their private pensions will be \nthere for them. That is why another of our leadership bills is one to \nstrengthen pension protections, expand pension coverage, and crack down \non rogue corporations.\n  It has been said that almost every problem any society faces can be \nsolved with two things: good health, and a good education--and we have \nbills in each of those areas.\n  The Right Start for Children Act makes Head Start fully available for \n4- and 5-year-olds, and increases availability for infants and \ntoddlers. It will help improve childcare quality, make childcare more \naffordable for 1 million additional children, and strengthen child \nnutrition programs to reduce child hunger.\n  The Educational Excellence for All Learners Act builds on that \nfoundation by improving education every step of the way--from \nkindergarten, to college, to lifelong learning. It makes sure that we \nmatch the real reforms we passed last year with the real resources they \ndemand. It will help us recruit, hire, and train qualified teachers, \nbuild new schools, and make college and job training more affordable \nand more available.\n  President Bush pledged to leave no child behind, and then proposed \nmore than a billion dollars of education cuts. We are proposing to put \nour money where the Republicans' mouths are--and help secure a good \nstart, a good education, and good prospects for all Americans.\n  When it comes to health care, it was an outrage that 40 million \nAmericans were uninsured 2 years ago. In the past year, over 1 million \nmore Americans have lost health insurance. And those who are lucky \nenough to have health insurance are seeing their premiums skyrocket.\n  With the Health Care Coverage Expansion and Quality Improvement Act, \nwe hope to reduce the number of uninsured by making health care \ncoverage more available to small businesses, parents of children \neligible for\n\n[[Page S39]]\n\nCHIP and Medicaid, pregnant women, and others.\n\n  We also want to improve the quality of care people receive by \novercoming Republican resistance to a real, enforceable, patients' bill \nof rights.\n  We will also insist that mental illness be treated like any other \nillness--something that will not only honor Paul Wellstone's legacy, \nbut also help millions of families.\n  We are also committed to passing a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare, and lowering the price of prescription drugs for all \nAmericans. Last year, we passed a bill to lower the price of generic \ndrugs, but the House refused to take it up. And we had 52 Senators \nsupport our Medicare prescription drug benefit--but it was blocked on a \nprocedural motion.\n  The high cost of prescription drugs--combined with the increasing \nneed for such drugs--is destroying the life savings--and threatening \nthe dignity--of millions of older Americans. And that is simply \nunacceptable.\n  A couple of months ago in elections all across the country, and in \nwords spoken here in the Senate, we have seen that when it comes to \nprotecting equal rights, we still have a lot of work to do in changing \nhearts, minds, and laws.\n  That is why we are introducing The Equal Rights and Equal Dignity for \nAmericans Act. This bill will enforce employment nondiscrimination, \nfund the election-reform measures we passed last year, outlaw hate \ncrimes, and take other steps to see that as a nation, we live up to the \npromise of equal rights.\n  I hope those Republicans who have recently expressed their support \nfor civil rights will join us in expressing their support for this \nlegislation. I also hope they will join us in supporting our bill to \ncombat drug and gun violence, to crack down on new crimes like identity \ntheft, and to protect against and prevent crimes against children and \nseniors.\n  We also need to ensure greater dignity for our minimum wage workers, \nour farmers, and our veterans. The purchasing power of the minimum wage \nis now the lowest it has been in more than 30 years. And a full-time \nminimum wage income won't get you over the poverty line. If we can \nafford over a trillion dollars in tax cuts for those at the top of the \nincome scale, we can afford a dollar fifty more an hour for those at \nthe bottom.\n  We need to help our rural economy, and help those impacted by a \ndrought and other natural disasters that are being called among the \ncostliest for agricultural producers in our Nation's history.\n  And we need to maintain our commitment to those currently serving, \nand keep our promises to our veterans. One way we do that is by \nallowing our wounded veterans to receive both their full disability and \nretirement benefits. Another way is by addressing the current crisis in \nveterans' health care. With each of these proposals--we stand with the \nleading veterans organizations, and for those who served our country.\n  Finally, we are committed to stopping what is adding up to an all-out \nassault on our environment. By unilaterally abandoning the Kyoto \nprocess, the Bush administration took us out of position to lead the \nworld on the issue of climate change. The Global Climate Security Act \nwill help America reassert our position of world leadership on this \nvital issue of world health.\n  Each of these things is relevant, not revolutionary. If they seem \nfamiliar, it is because most of what is in them has been introduced \nbefore.\n  But they are not law, despite the support of the American people and, \nin some cases, a bipartisan majority of Senators.\n  They have been opposed by an extreme few, and their special interest \nsupporters. And while those bills have languished, we have seen the \nrise of more threats to our country; more people have lost their jobs \nand their health care; and more of our national challenges have gone \nunmet.\n  These are our priorities. In the last couple of days, the President \nhas made clear his priorities--more tax cuts for those who need them \nleast.\n  The President's plan won't help middle income families. It won't \ncontribute to economic growth; it won't make our homeland more secure; \nit won't expand educational opportunity for the young, or strengthen \nhealth care for the elderly.\n  Instead--by putting us deeper into deficit and debt--it makes all of \nthese things, and all of our other goals, harder to achieve.\n  Our bills will help us create an America that is stronger, safer, and \nbetter for all Americans--and I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 24.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat dividend and interest income of individuals not be taxed at rates \nin excess of the maximum capital gains rate; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a package of \nthree bills I hope will be the starting point for a long overdue \ndiscussion on reducing taxes on investment income, particularly \ndividends. The first bill would completely eliminate taxes on \ndividends. The second bill would reduce the tax on dividends to the \ncapital gains rate. The third bill would lower the tax to the capital \ngains rate on dividends and interest income. These bills would not only \nstimulate the economy, but also correct long-term problems with the tax \ncode.\n   The economy is currently on the way to recovery but faces \nsignificant bottlenecks along the way. Following a mild recession, we \nare experiencing moderate growth. Many believe we will continue on a \nslow yet steady pace, but we are not yet in the clear. We must take \naggressive steps to create jobs and ensure the economy gets moving \nagain.\n  The most effective tool government has for promoting growth is the \ntax code. By lowering taxes we allow people to keep more of their money \nand spend it more effectively than the government ever could.\n   Lowering the taxes on investment income would stimulate the economy \non several levels. First, we would leave more money in the pockets of \nfamilies to spend. Second, lowering taxes on dividends would encourage \ninvestors to re-enter the stock market and realize higher returns since \nthe government would be taking less. The increased demand for stocks \nwould stabilize the market and encourage economic growth. Third, these \ntax cuts would ultimately help to reduce the deficit as tax revenues \nincrease from higher economic growth and increased capital gains \nrevenue.\n\n  A tax cut on investment income would particularly help the elderly \nand others who rely on fixed incomes. A third of seniors received \ndividend income and more than half of dividends go to seniors. With \nsuch pressures as the rising cost of healthcare, it is critical that we \nlet them keep as much of their money as possible. Also, these tax cuts \nwould help a broad cross-section of Americans. For example, almost half \nof those who receive dividends have income of less than $50,000.\n  One of the problems with our tax code is the double taxation of \ndividends. People have already paid taxes on the money they use to \ninvest. Then they must pay taxes on their investment income. This is \nnot fair and discourages savings.\n  Also, companies must use after-tax dollars to pay dividends. \nInvestors then have to pay taxes on their dividend income at the \nordinary income tax rates. This leads to two unintended consequences.\n  First, it encourages investors to focus on returns through stock \nprice appreciation, which are taxed at the lower capital gains rate. \nPeople are encouraged to invest in higher growth, but often in riskier \ncompanies, rather than more stable, dividend-paying companies. As \nanyone can see from the collapse of stock prices in high-growth sectors \nover the past two years, the current incentives in the tax code may\n\n[[Page S40]]\n\nnot lead to the best decisions for investors.\n  Second, the double taxation of dividends encourages companies to \nraise capital by loading up on debt rather than issuing stock, because \ninterest expense on debt can lower a company's taxes while dividend \npayments do not. This leads to an increase in highly leveraged \ncompanies that are at greater financial risk when the economy slows.\n\n  Whether investors should invest in growth stocks is a decision that \nmust be left to individuals. Likewise, the issuance of debt is best \ndecided by the company in question. By lowering the tax rates on \ndividends and interest income, we would reduce the influence of taxes \non these decisions.\n  Increasingly, America is a Nation of investors. Today, half of U.S. \nhouseholds own stock. The number of shareholders has increased more \nthan 60 percent since 1989. Thus, it is critical to ensure our tax laws \nlead to rational decisionmaking; decisions based on the best investment \nchoices, not guided by tax inequities. Let's take tax rates out of the \ncapital allocation decision process. People should make investment \ndecisions based on what is the best investment.\n  I call on the Senate to bolster the economy, help senior citizens \nmeet their financial needs, and level the way we tax investment gains \nby lowering taxes on investment income.

the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to make \nit unlawful for packet to own, feed, or control livestock intended for \nslaughter; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the goal of the farm bill was to improve \nthe economic condition of America's farmers over the next few years. \nHowever one of the many shortcomings of the new law is that it fails to \nprotect family farmers and independent livestock producers from \nvertical integration in the livestock industry.\n  In recent years, family farmers from across Iowa have contacted me to \nexpress their fears about the threat they fell from concentration in \nthe livestock industry. They fear that if the trend toward increased \nconcentration continues, they may be unable to compete effectively and \nwill not be able to get a fair price for their livestock in the \nmarketplace.\n  The bill I am introducing would prevent meat packers from assuming \ncomplete control of the meat supply by preventing packers from owning \nlivestock.\n  This bill would make it unlawful for a packer to own or feed \nlivestock intended for slaughter. Single pack entities and packs too \nsmall to participate in the Mandatory Price Reporting program would be \nexcluded from the limitation. In addition, farmer cooperatives in which \nthe members own, feed, or control the livestock themselves would be \nexempt under this new bill.\n  We have tightened down the limitations in this new version of the \npacker ban. The last version provided an exemption to plants that \nkilled less than 2 percent of the Nation's livestock, per commodity. \nThat meant plants that killed less than 1.9 million pigs or \napproximately 725,000 cattle were excluded under the old version. We \nhave changed the standard to be consistent with the Mandatory Price \nReporting law and other legislation I've introduced. That means the new \nlimit will be 125,000 for cattle and 100,000 for swine.\n  It's also important to realize that this is not the original version \nI co-sponsored with Senator Johnson. Instead, this is the version I \nsuccessfully offered on the floor during the debate on the farm bill \nthat removed the word ``control'' so that the packers couldn't attack \nus with a red-herring argument.\n  It's important for our colleagues to remember that family farmers \nultimately derive their income from the agricultural marketplace, not \nthe farm bill. Family farmers have unfortunately been in a position of \nweakness in selling their product to large processors and in buying \ntheir inputs from large suppliers.\n  Today, the position of the family has become weaker as consolidation \nin agribusiness has reached all time highs. Farmers have fewer buyers \nand suppliers than ever before. The result is an increasing loss of \nfamily farms and the smallest farm share of the consumer dollar in \nhistory.\n  One hundred years ago, this Nation reacted appropriately to citizen \nconcerns about large, powerful companies by establishing rules \nconstraining such businesses when they achieved a level of market power \nthat harmed, or risked harming, the public interest, trade and \ncommerce. The United State Congress enacted the first competition laws \nin the world to make commerce more free and fair. These competition \nlaws include the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Federal Trade Commission Act \nand Packers & Stockyards Act.\n  Since that time, many countries in the world have followed this U.S. \nexample to constrain undue market power in their domestic economies.\n  Unfortunately, competition policy has been severely weakened in this \ncountry, especially in agriculture, due to Federal case law, \nunderfunded enforcement, and unfounded reliance on efficiency claims. \nThe result has been a significant degradation of the domestic \nagricultural market infrastructure. The current situation reflects a \ntremendous mis-allocation of resources across the food chain.

A bill to redesignate the Colonnade Center in Denver, \nColorado, as the ``Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Building''; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nname the Federal building located at 1244 Speer Boulevard, Denver CO, \nas the ``Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Building.''\n  Cesar E. Chavez was an ordinary American who left behind an \nextraordinary legacy of commitment and accomplishment.\n  Born on March 31, 1927 in Yuma, AZ on a farm his grandfather \nhomesteaded in the 1880's, he began his life as a migrant farm worker \nat the age of 10 when the family lost the farm during the Great \nDepression. Those were desperate years for the Chavez family as they \njoined the thousands of displaced people who were forced to migrate \nthroughout the country to labor in the fields and vineyards.\n  Motivated by the poverty and harsh working conditions, he began to \nfollow his dream of establishing an organization dedicated to helping \nthese farm workers. In 1962 he founded the National Farm Workers \nAssociation which would eventually evolve into the United Farm Workers \nof America.\n  Over the next three decades with an unwavering commitment to \ndemocratic principals and a philosophy of non-violence he struggled to \nsecure a living wage, health benefits and safe working conditions for \narguably the most exploited work force in our country, that they might \nenjoy the basic protections and worker's right to which all Americans \naspire.\n  In 1945, at the age of 18 Cesar Chavez joined the U.S. Navy and \nserved his country for two years. He was the recipient of the Martin \nLuther King Jr.\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\nPeace Prize as well as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest \naward this country can bestow upon a civilian.\n  Chavez's efforts brought dignity and respect to this country's farm \nworkers and in doing so became a hero, role model and inspiration to \npeople engaged in human rights struggles throughout the world.\n  The naming of this building will keep alive the memory of his \nsacrifice and commitment for the millions of people whose lives he \ntouched.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 30\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the geographic physician work adjustment factor from the \ngeographic indices used to adjust payments under the physician fee \nschedule, to provide incentives necessary to attract educators and \nclinical practitioners to underserved areas, and to revise the area \nwage adjustment applicable under the prospective payment system for \nskilled nursing facilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues \nfrom Maine to introduce legislation to restore fairness to the Medicare \nprogram. This package of legislation will reduce regional inequalities \nin Medicare spending and support providers of high-quality, low-cost \nMedicare services.\n  The high cost of health care in Wisconsin is skyrocketing: A survey \nissued a few days ago found that the cost of health care benefits for \nemployees in this State rose 14.8 percent this year, to an average of \n$6,940 per employee. That's 20 percent high than the national average \nof $5,758 for workers in businesses with 500 or more employees.\n  These costs are hitting our State hard, they are burdening businesses \nand employees, hurting health care providers, and preventing seniors \nfrom getting full access to the care that they deserve.\n  One of the major contributing factors to the high cost in our state \nis the inherent unfairness of the Medicare Program.\n  With the guidance and support of people across our State who are \nfighting for Medicare fairness. I have proposed this legislation to \naddress Medicare's discrimination against Wisconsin's seniors, \nemployers and health care providers. The Medicare program should \nencourage the kind of high-quality, cost-effective Medicare services \nthat we have in Wisconsin. But as many in Wisconsin know, that's not \nthe case.\n  To give an idea of how inequitable the distribution of Medicare \ndollars is, imagine identical twins over the age of 65. Both twins \nworked at the same company all their lives, at the same salary, and \npaid the same amount to the Federal Government in payroll taxes, the \ntax that goes into the Medicare Trust Fund.\n  But if one twin retired to New Orleans, Louisiana, and the other \nretired to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, they would have vastly different \nhealth options under the Medicare system. The twin in Louisiana would \nget much more.\n  For example, in most parts of Louisiana, the first twin would have \nmore options under Medicare. The high Medicare payments in those areas \nallow Medicare beneficiaries to choose between an HMO or traditional \nfee-for-service plan, and, because area health care providers are \nreimbursed at such a high rate, those providers can afford to offer \nseniors a broad range of health care services. The twin in Eau Claire \ndoes not have the same access to care, there are no options to choose \nfrom in terms of Medicare HMOs, and sometimes fewer health care \nagencies that can afford to provide care under the traditional fee-for-\nservice plan.\n  How can two people with identical backgrounds, who paid the same \namount in payroll taxes, have such different options under Medicare? \nThey can because the distribution of Medicare dollars among the 50 \nStates is grossly unfair to Wisconsin, and much of the Upper Midwest. \nWisconsinites pay payroll taxes just like every American taxpayer, but \nthe Medicare funds we get in return are lower than those received in \nmany other states.\n  My legislation will take us a step in the right direction by reducing \nthe inequities in Medicare payments to Wisconsin's hospitals, \nphysicians, and skilled nursing facilities.\n  Last year, with the introduction my Medicare fairness legislation \nalong with the efforts of many other Senators, we put Medicare fairness \nissues front and center in Congress. The Senate Budget Committee \napproved my amendment to promote Medicare fairness in any Medicare \nreform package. A wide range of Senators from both parties endorsed my \nproposal to create a Medicare fairness coalition. The House passed a \nnumber of Medicare fairness provisions that were a result of these \nsuccesses, and both House and Senate leadership endorsed Medicare \nfairness issues. Now that we have finally brought these issues the \nattention that they deserve, we need to build on that momentum to pass \nMedicare fairness provisions into law.\n  My legislation demands Medicare fairness for Wisconsin and other \naffected States, plain and simple. Medicare shouldn't penalize high-\nquality providers of Medicare services, most of all. Medicare should \nstop penalizing seniors who depend on the program for their health \ncare. They have worked had and paid into the program all their lives, \nand in return they deserve full access to the wide range of benefits \nthat Medicare has to offer.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation \nforward. I believe that we can re-balance the budget, while at the same \ntime encouraging efficient, quality enhancing services, and that's what \nmy legislation sets out to do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 37. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to permit \nKentucky to operate a separate retirement system for certain public \nemployees; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto add Kentucky to the list of States that are permitted to offer \n``divided retirement'' plans under the Social Security Act.\n  Last year, I was contacted by Brian James, President of the \nLouisville Fraternal Order of Police, FOP, and Tony Cobaugh, President \nof the Jefferson County FOP. These two law enforcement leaders called \nmy attention to a problem that could jeopardize the retirement security \nof many of our community's police, fire, and emergency personnel.\n  In November of 2000, the citizens of Jefferson County and the City of \nLouisville, Kentucky voted to merge their communities and respective \ngovernments into a single entity, which will be known as Greater \nLouisville. As one might expect, combining two large metropolitan \ngovernments in such a short time frame cannot be done without \nencountering a few difficulties along the way. Jefferson County and the \nCity of Louisville currently operate two very different retirement \nprograms for their police officers. When these two governments merge \ntoday, current federal law will require the new government to offer a \nsingle retirement plan that could dramatically increase the cost of \nretirement for both our dedicated public safety officers and the new \nGreater Louisville government.\n  Thankfully, when the FOP's leaders called this problem to my \nattention, they also suggested a simple solution, let the police \nofficers and firefighters choose for themselves the retirement system \nwhich best meets their needs.\n  I rise today to offer legislation that will provide retirement \nstability to our public safety officers by allowing Kentucky to operate \nwhat is known as a ``divided retirement system.''\n\n[[Page S44]]\n\n  With passage of my legislation and legislation already passed by the \nKentucky General Assembly, Louisville's and Jefferson County's police \nofficers would decide whether or not they want to participate in Social \nSecurity or remain in their traditional retirement plan. While future \nemployees will be automatically enrolled in Social Security, no current \nofficers would be forced into a new retirement system as a result of \nthe merger without their approval.\n  Current Federal law allows twenty-one States the option of offering \ndivided retirement systems. Unfortunately, Kentucky is not one of these \ntwenty-one states. The legislation I am offering today would change \nthat by adding Kentucky to list of states designated in the Social \nSecurity Act.\n  The language I introduce today was included in legislation, H.R. \n4070, that passed both the House and the Senate in the 107th Congress. \nUnfortunately, there were differences in the House and Senate versions \nof H.R. 4070, unrelated to the Louisville language, that were resolved \nonly shortly prior to the adjournment of the 107th Congress. \nUnfortunately, the 107th Congress adjourned sine die before this \ncompromise version of H.R. 4070 could be considered by both bodies of \nCongress.\n  It is critical that the Senate provide this retirement stability to \nthe brave men and women who protect the citizens of Louisville and \nJefferson County everyday. There is extensive precedent for granting \nKentucky this authority, and my legislation enjoys the broad, \nbipartisan support of policemen, firefighters, local and state \nofficials, and the Social Security Administration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 37\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COVERAGE UNDER DIVIDED RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR \n                   PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN KENTUCKY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 218(d)(6)(C) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 418(d)(6)(C)) is amended by inserting \n     ``Kentucky,'' after ``Illinois,''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     takes effect on January 1, 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 39. A bill to promote the development of health care cooperatives \nthat will help businesses to pool the health care purchasing power of \nemployers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaine to introduce legislation to help businesses form group-purchasing \ncooperatives to obtain enhanced benefits, to reduce health care rates, \nand to improve quality for their employees' health care.\n  High health care costs are burdening businesses and employees across \nthe Nation. These costs are digging into profits and preventing access \nto affordable health care. Too many patients feel trapped by the \nsystem, with decisions about their health dictated by costs rather than \nby what they need.\n  The cost of health care in Wisconsin is skyrocketing: A recent survey \nfound that the cost of health benefits for employees in Wisconsin rose \n14.8 percent this year, to an average of $6,940 per employee. That's 20 \npercent higher than the national average of $5,758 for workers in \nbusinesses with 500 or more employees.\n  We must curb these rapidly-increasing health care premiums. I \nstrongly support initiatives to ensure that everyone has access to \nhealth care. It is crucial that we support successful local initiatives \nto reduce health care premiums and to improve the quality of employees' \nhealth care.\n  By using group purchasing to obtain rate discounts, some employers \nhave been able to reduce the cost of health care premiums for their \nemployees. According to the National Business Coalition on Health, \nthere are more than 90 employer-led coalitions across the United States \nthat collectively purchase health care. Through these pools, businesses \nare able to proactively challenge high costs and inefficient delivery \nof health care and share information on quality. These coalitions \nrepresent over 7,000 employers and approximately 34 million employees \nNationwide.\n  Improving the quality of health care will also lower the cost of \ncare. By investing in the delivery of quality health care, we will be \nable to lower long term health care costs. Effective care, such as \nquality preventive services, can reduce overall health care \nexpenditures. Health purchasing coalitions help promote these services \nand act as an employer forum for networking and education on health \ncare cost containment strategies. They can help foster a dialogue with \nhealth care providers, insurers, and local HMOs.\n  Health care markets are local. Problems with cost, quality, and \naccess to health care are felt most intensely in the local markets. \nHealth care coalitions can function best when they are formed and \nimplemented locally. Local employers of large and small businesses have \nformed health care coalitions to track health care trends, create a \ndemand for quality and safety, and encourage group purchasing.\n  In Wisconsin, there have been various successful initiatives that \nhave formed health care purchasing cooperatives to improve quality of \ncare and to reduce cost. For example, the Employer Health Care Alliance \nCooperative, an employer-owned and employer-directed not-for-profit \ncooperative, has developed a network of health care providers in Dane \nCounty and 12 surrounding counties on behalf of its 170 member \nemployers. Through this pooling effort, employers are able to obtain \naffordable, high-quality health care for their 110,000 employees and \ndependents.\n  This legislation seeks to build on successful local initiatives, such \nas the Alliance, that help businesses to join together to increase \naccess to affordable and high-quality health care.\n  The Promoting Health Care Purchasing Cooperatives Act would authorize \ngrants to a group of businesses so that they could form group-\npurchasing cooperatives to obtain enhanced benefits, reduce health care \nrates, and improve quality.\n  This legislation offers two separate grant programs to help different \ntypes of businesses pool their resources and bargaining power. Both \nprograms would aid businesses to form cooperatives. The first program \nwould help large businesses that sponsor their own health plans, while \nthe second program would help small businesses that purchase their \nhealth insurance.\n  My bill would enable larger businesses to form cost-effective \ncooperatives that could offer quality health care through several ways. \nFirst, they could obtain health services through pooled purchasing from \nphysicians, hospitals, home health agencies, and others. By pooling \ntheir experience and interests, employers involved in a coalition could \nbetter attack the essential issues, such as rising health insurance \nrates and the lack of comparable health care quality data. They would \nbe able to share information regarding the quality of these services \nand to partner with these health care providers to meet the needs of \ntheir employees.\n  For smaller businesses that purchase their health insurance, the \nformation of cooperatives would allow them to buy health insurance at \nlower prices through pooled purchasing.\n  Also, the communication within these cooperatives would provide \nemployees of small businesses with better information about the health \ncare options that are available to them. Finally, coalitions would \nserve to promote quality improvements by facilitating partnerships \nbetween their group and the health care providers.\n  By working together, the group could develop better quality insurance \nplans and negotiate better rates.\n  Past health purchasing pool initiatives have focused only on cost and \nhave tried to be all things for all people. My legislation creates an \nincentive to join the pools by giving grants to a group of similar \nbusinesses to form group-purchasing cooperatives. The pool are also \ngiven flexibility to find innovative ways to lower costs, such as \nenhancing benefits, for example, more preventive care, and improving \nquality. Finally, the cooperative structure is a proven model, which \ncreates an incentive for businesses to remain in the pool because they \nwill be invested in the organization.\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\n  We must reform health care in America and give employers and \nemployees more options. This legislation, by providing for the \nformation of cost-effective coalitions that will also improve the \nquality of care, contributes to this essential reform process. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this proposal to improve the \nquality and costs of health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 40. A bill to prohibit products that contain dry ultra-filtered \nmilk products or casein from being labeled as domestic natural cheese, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce the Quality \nCheese Act of 2003. This legislation will protect the consumer, save \ntaxpayer dollars and provide support to America's dairy farmers, who \nhave taken a beating in the marketplace in recent years.\n  When Wisconsin consumers have the choice, they will choose natural \nWisconsin cheese. But the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, and the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, may change current law, and \nconsumers won't know whether cheese is really all natural or not.\n  If the Federal Government creates a loophole for imitation cheese \ningredients to be used in U.S. cheese vats, some cheese labels saying \n``domestic'' and ``natural'' will no longer be truly accurate.\n  If USDA and FDA allow a change in Federal rules, imitation milk \nproteins known as milk protein concentrate, casein, or dry ultra \nfiltered milk could be used to make cheese in place of the wholesome \nnatural milk produced by cows in Wisconsin or other part of the U.S.\n  I am deeply concerned by recent efforts to change America's natural \ncheese standard. This effort to allow milk protein concentrate and \ncasein into natural cheese products flies in the face of logic and \ncould create a loophole that could allow unlimited amounts of \nsubstandard imported milk proteins to enter U.S. cheese vats.\n  My legislation would close this loophole and ensure that consumers \ncould be confident that they were buying natural cheese when they saw \nthe natural label.\n  Over the past decade, cheese consumption has risen at a strong pace \ndue in part to promotional and marketing efforts and investments by \ndairy farmers across the country. Year after year, per capita cheese \nconsumption has risen at a steady rate.\n  Recent proposals to change to our natural cheese standards, however, \ncould decrease consumption of natural cheese. These declines could \nresult from concerns about the origin of casein and milk protein \nconcentrate.\n  The addition of this kind of milk could significantly tarnish the \nwholesome reputation of natural cheese in the eyes of the consumer.\n  This change could seriously compromise decades of work by America's \ndairy farmers to build up domestic cheese consumption levels. It is \nsimply not fair to America's farmers!\n  Consumers have a right to know if the cheese that they buy is \nunnatural. And by allowing milk protein concentrate milk into cheese, \nwe are denying consumers the entire picture.\n  This legislation will require that labels paint the entire picture \nfor the consumer, and allow them enough information to select cheese \nmade from truly natural ingredients.\n  Allowing MPCs or dry ultra-filtered milk into natural cheeses would \nalso harm dairy producers throughout the United States. Some estimate \nthat the annual effect of the change on the dairy farm sector of the \neconomy could be more than $100 million.\n  The proposed change to our natural cheese standard would also harm \nthe American taxpayer. If we allow MPCs to be used in cheese, we will \neffectively permit unrestricted importation of these ingredients into \nthe United States. Because there are no tariffs and quotas on these \ningredients, these heavily-subsidized products would displace natural \ndomestic dairy ingredients.\n  These unnatural domestic dairy products would enter our domestic \ncheese market and might further depress dairy prices paid to American \ndairy producers. Low dairy prices result in increased costs to the \ndairy price support program. So, at the same time that U.S. dairy \nfarmers would receive lower prices, the U.S. taxpayer would pay more \nfor the dairy price support program.\n  This change does not benefit the dairy farmer, consumer or taxpayer. \nWho then is it good for?\n  It would benefit only unscrupulous foreign MPC producers out to make \na fast buck at the expense of Americans.\n  This legislation addresses the concerns of farmers, consumers and \ntaxpayers by prohibiting dry ultra-filtered milk from being included in \nAmerica's natural cheese standard.\n  Congress must shut the door on any backdoor efforts to stack the deck \nagainst America's dairy farmers. And we must pass my legislation that \nprevents a loophole that would allow changes that hurt the consumer, \ntaxpayer, and dairy farmer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Daschle)\n  S. 41. A bill to strike certain provisions of the Homeland Security \nAct of 2002 (Public Law 107-296), and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Daschle to remedy some problems in \nlandmark legislation passed at the end of the last Congress, and signed \ninto law by President Bush, to establish a Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The legislation we are offering today would strike seven \nextraneous special interest provisions inserted into the Homeland \nSecurity Act by Republican leadership in the bill's waning hours, \nprovisions that are contrary to the bipartisan spirit in which the \nHomeland Security Act was conceived.\n  Since the days following September 11, 2001, when terrorists \nviciously took the lives of 3,000 of our friends, family and fellow \nAmericans, I have advocated establishing a Department of Homeland \nSecurity to beat the terrorist threat. Senator Arlen Specter, and I \ninitially proposed creating a new department in October 2001. Our \nmeasure was not just bipartisan. It was in fact intended to be \nnonpartisan.\n  Unfortunately, some partisan battles did ensue, primarily regarding \nlongstanding civil service protections for homeland security workers, \nand I remain very concerned about the potential impact of these \nprovisions. Nevertheless, the final bill was, for the most part, a \ncritical, well-constructed piece of legislation that incorporated the \nmajority of the provisions approved by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and which an overwhelming majority of the Senate embraced.\n  In some very specific ways, however, the bill was flawed. In the \nfinal stages of passing the bill, the Republican leadership hastily \ninserted several special interest provisions that had no place in this \nmeasure. Most of these provisions had never been in any version of the \nlegislation before the Senate before they were presented in a take-it-\nor-leave-it package by Republicans, and several had not been considered \nby either chamber. The method and spirit in which these provisions \nfound their way into what should have been a consensus piece of \nlegislation was utterly objectionable and Senator Daschle and I made an \neffort to remove them at the time. That effort narrowly failed, but not \nbefore news of these special interest provisions had created great \nconsternation for Democrats and the public, and even for some \nRepublicans. Indeed, according to numerous published reports, the \nRepublican leadership was able to muster the votes to preserve the \nprovisions only after promising to revisit at least some of the most \negregious additions during this session of Congress.\n  I believe that the seven extraneous provisions my legislation targets \nhurt the Homeland Security Act as it was finally passed by the Congress \nand signed by the President. And I believe that, by attaching these \nmeasures to what could have and should have been a common cause, the \nRepublican leadership all but admitted that the provisions cannot \nwithstand independent scrutiny. Following are the provisions my bill \nwould strike.\n\n  First, perhaps the most egregious add-on to the Homeland Security Act\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\nwas a provision that dramatically alters the way certain vaccine \npreservatives are treated for liability purposes under the law. To \nquickly summarize this very complicated issue, children who are hurt by \nchildhood vaccines generally may not go directly to court to hold \nvaccine manufacturers liable. Instead, they have to go first to what's \ncalled the Federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which offers \ncompensation for some of these claims. Parents argued, however, that \nthe bar on lawsuits didn't use to apply to claims regarding faulty \nvaccine additives.\n  These seemingly arcane legal distinctions were particularly important \nto a large number of parents of autistic children who have attributed \ntheir children's autism to thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative \nthat used to be in some childhood vaccines. These parents sued the \nmanufacturers of both vaccines and thimerosal, and they had many \nlawsuits pending in the courts as of last Fall.\n  If you are wondering what any of this has to do with Homeland \nSecurity, you are doing exactly what we all did last November when in \nthe waning days of debate on the Homeland Security bill, a provision \naddressing this issue appeared for the very first time in any version \nof the bill. That provision fundamentally altered the way vaccine \nadditive claims would be treated from then on. With the swoop of a pen, \nthe pending additive lawsuits against both vaccine and additive \nmanufacturers were thrown out of court and, the provision's supporters \nalleged, sent into the compensation fund.\n  As I said last Fall, I don't know whether there is any relationship \nbetween thimerosal and autism. I also don't know whether these cases \nreally should be resolved in court or through the compensation fund. \nBut I do know that figuring out where and how to resolve these claims \nis a very contentious, complex and challenging task, and is just one \npart of addressing broader problems with the vaccine compensation \nsystem. For example, the vaccine compensation fund's viability may be \naffected by the addition of claims regarding these additives. I also \nknow that it is an issue that the committees of jurisdiction had been \nstruggling with for a long time and that they should have been left to \nresolve. And I certainly know that a last second addition to the \nHomeland Security Act was absolutely the wrong way to deal with this \nissue and the wrong bill to use to take so many injured parents' and \nchildren's legal rights away. Indeed, we know that even more now, as it \nhas become clear that while the provision closed the courthouse door to \nautistic children, it apparently didn't open the compensation fund \nwindow as its supporters said it would--because it didn't make the \nchanges to either the fund's statute of limitations or to governing tax \ncode provisions that would be necessary to obtain access to the fund \nfor these cases.\n  The bottom line is that this was a wrong and poorly conceived \nprovision to put in the Homeland Security bill--something I thought \neven the Republican leadership acknowledged when they were forced to \nmake promises to get rid of this provision in order to save their bill. \nWe should scrap it now, and let the committee of jurisdiction undertake \na careful review and, I hope, get it right this time.\n  My legislation would also strike from the Act a measure that requires \nthe Transportation Security Oversight Board to ratify within 90 days \nemergency security regulations issued by the Transportation Security \nAgency. If the oversight board does not ratify the regulations, they \nwould automatically lapse. Despite the TSA having decided that they are \nnecessary, 90 days later, lacking the board's approval, they'd \ndisappear.\n  This doesn't make any sense. In the current climate, shouldn't we be \ntrying to find new ways to expedite and implement TSA rules, not always \nto disrupt and derail them? This provision is contrary to new \nprocedures that the Senate passed in 2001 in the aviation security \nbill. Under that law, regulations go into effect and remain in effect \nunless they are affirmatively disapproved by the Board. I think that's \na better system.\n  Another provision would extend liability protection to companies that \nprovided passenger and baggage screening in airports on September 11.\n  But we in the Senate decided against extending such liability \nprotection in at least two different contexts. First, the airline \nbailout bill limited the liability of the airlines, but not of the \nsecurity screeners, due to ongoing concerns about their role leading up \nto September 11. Then, the conference report on the Transportation \nSecurity bill extended the liability limitations to others who might \nhave been the target of lawsuits, such as aircraft manufacturers and \nairport operators, but again not to the baggage and passenger \nscreeners.\n  Like that little mole you hit with the mallet in a whack-a-mole game, \nsomehow this provision reappeared in the Homeland Security Act. We must \nstrike it.\n  Another unnecessary and overreaching provision I seek to strike gives \nthe Secretary of the new department broad authority to designate \ncertain technologies as so-called ``qualified antiterrorism \ntechnologies.'' His granting of this designation, which appears to be \nunilateral, and probably not subject to review by anyone, would entitle \ncompanies selling that technology to broad liability protection from \nany claim arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of \nterrorism, no matter how negligently, or even wantonly and willfully, \nthe company acted.\n  This provision seems to say that in many cases, the plaintiff can't \nrecover anything from the seller unless an injured plaintiff can prove \nthat the seller of the product that injured him or her acted \nfraudulently or with willful misconduct in submitting information to \nthe Secretary when the Secretary was deciding whether to certify the \nproduct.\n  Even in cases where a seller isn't entitled to the benefit of that \nprotection, the company still isn't fully, or in many cases even \npartially, responsible for its actions, even if it knew there was \nsomething terribly wrong with its product. Perhaps worst of all, this \nmeasure caps the seller's liability at the limits of its insurance \npolicy. In other words, if injured people were lucky enough to get \nthrough the first hurdle and even hold a faulty seller liable, they \nstill could go completely uncompensated even if a liable seller has \nmore than enough money to compensate them.\n  The Homeland Security Act unwisely and unnecessarily allows the \nSecretary to exempt the new department's advisory committees from the \nopen meetings requirements and other requirements of the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act, FACA.\n  Agencies throughout government make use of advisory committees that \nfunction under these open meetings requirements. Existing law is \ncareful to protect discussions and documents that involve sensitive \ninformation, in fact, the FACA law currently applies successfully to \nthe Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the State \nDepartment, even the secretive National Security Agency.\n  So why should the Department of Homeland Security be allowed to \nexempt its advisory committees from its requirements? Why should its \nadvisory committees be allowed to meet in total secret with no public \nknowledge?\n  We all say that we're for ``good government,'' for openness, \nintegrity, and accountability. But as it now stands, few of us will be \nable to say with confidence that the new department's advisory \ncommittees are designed to be as independent, balanced, and transparent \nas possible. I know full well that the Homeland Security Department \nwill deal with sensitive information involving life and death, but so \ndoes the National Security Agency. So does the FBI. So does the \nDepartment of Defense. Their advisory committees aren't allowed to hide \nthemselves away from the public.\n  Finally, our legislation would alter a provision in the Act creating \na university-based homeland security research center. Now, I have \nnothing against creating a university research center focused on \nhomeland security.\n  But there's a problem with this particular provision as it is \nwritten. The research center that it would create is described so \nnarrowly, through 15 specific criteria, that it appears Texas A \nUniversity has the inside track, to say the least, to get the funding \nand house the center.\n  Science in this country has thrived over the years because, by and \nlarge,\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\nCongress has refused to intervene in science decisions. Science has \nthrived through peer review and competition over the best proposals--\nwhich are fundamentals of federal science policy. We are violating them \nhere. This is nothing short of ``science pork.''\n  When it comes to making these research funding decisions, we need a \nplaying field that's truly level, not one that only looks level when \nyou tilt your head.\n  Our legislation keeps the university-based science center program. \nHowever, it removes the highly-specific criteria that appear to direct \nit to a particular university. That's the way we'll get the best \nscience, not by making Congressional allocations to particular \ninstitutions.\n  I'm extremely pleased we have created a Department of Homeland \nSecurity and plan to do everything I can to help ensure its success. \nBut these flaws are real. They are serious. And they are utterly \nunnecessary. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 41\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to prohibit \nthe Secretary of Agriculture from basing minimum prices for Class I \nmilk on the distance or transportation costs from any location that is \nnot within a marketing area, except under certain circumstances, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a measure which \ncould serve as a first step towards eliminating the inequities borne by \nthe dairy farmers of Wisconsin and the upper Midwest under the Federal \nMilk Marketing Order system.\n  The Federal Milk Marketing Order system, created nearly 60 years ago, \nestablishes minimum prices for milk paid to producers throughout \nvarious marketing areas in the U.S. For sixty years, this system has \ndiscriminated against producers in the Upper Midwest by awarding a \nhigher price to dairy farmers in proportion to the distance of their \nfarms from Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n  My legislation is very simple. It identifies the single most harmful \nand unjust feature of the current system, and corrects it. Under the \ncurrent archaic law, the price for fluid milk increases depending on \nthe distance from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, even though most local milk \nmarkets do not receive any milk from Wisconsin.\n  The bill I introduce today would prohibit the Secretary of \nAgriculture from using distance or transportation costs from any \nlocation as the basis for pricing milk, unless significant quantities \nof milk are actually transported from that location into the recipient \nmarket. The Secretary will have to comply with the statutory \nrequirement that supply and demand factors be considered as specified \nin the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act when setting milk prices in \nmarketing orders. The fact remains that single-basing-point pricing \nsimply cannot be justified based on supply and demand for milk both in \nlocal and national markets.\n  This bill also requires the Secretary to report to Congress on \nspecifically which criteria are used to set milk prices. Finally, the \nSecretary will have to certify to Congress that the criteria used by \nthe Department do not in any way attempt to circumvent the prohibition \non using distance or transportation cost as basis for pricing milk.\n  This one change is so crucial to Upper Midwest producers, because the \ncurrent system has penalized them for many years. The current system \nprovides disparate profits for producers in other parts of the country \nand creating artificial economic incentives for milk production. As a \nresult, Wisconsin producers have seen national surpluses rise, and milk \nprices fall. Rather than providing adequate supplies of fluid milk, the \nprices have led to excess production.\n  The prices have provided production incentives beyond those needed to \nensure a local supply of fluid milk in some regions, leading to an \nincrease in manufactured products in those marketing orders. Those \nmanufactured products directly compete with Wisconsin's processed \nproducts, eroding our markets and driving national prices down.\n  The perverse nature of this system is further illustrated by the fact \nthat since 1995 some regions of the U.S., notably the Central states \nand the Southwest, are producing so much milk that they are actually \nshipping fluid milk north to the Upper Midwest. The high fluid milk \nprices have generated so much excess production, that these markets \ndistant from Eau Claire are now encroaching upon not only our \nmanufactured markets, but also our markets for fluid milk, further \neroding prices in Wisconsin.\n  The market-distorting effects of the fluid price differentials in \nFederal orders are manifest in the Congressional Budget Office estimate \nthat eliminating the orders would save $669 million over five years. \nGovernment outlays would fall, CBO concludes, because production would \nfall in response to lower milk prices and there would be fewer \ngovernment purchases of surplus milk. The regions that would gain and \nlose in this scenario illustrate the discrimination inherent to the \ncurrent system. Economic analyses show that farm revenues in a market \nundisturbed by Federal orders would actually increase in the Upper \nMidwest and fall in most other milk-producing regions.\n  While this system has been around since 1937, the practice of basing \nfluid milk price differentials on the distance from Eau Claire was \nformalized in the 1960's, when the Upper Midwest arguably was the \nprimary reserve for additional supplies of milk. The idea was to \nencourage local supplies of fluid milk in areas of the country that did \nnot traditionally produce enough fluid milk to meet their own needs.\n  That is no longer the case. The Upper Midwest is not the primary \nsource of reserve supplies of milk. Unfortunately, the prices didn't \nadjust with changing economic conditions, most notably the shift of the \ndairy industry away from the Upper Midwest and towards the Southwest, \nand specifically California, which now leads the Nation in milk \nproduction.\n  The result of this antiquated system has been a decline in the Upper \nMidwest dairy industry, not because it can't produce a product that can \ncompete in the market place, but because the system discriminates \nagainst it. Today, Wisconsin loses dairy farmers at a rate of more than \n5 per day. The Upper Midwest, with the lowest fluid milk prices, is \nshrinking as a dairy region despite the dairy-friendly climate\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\nof the region. Other regions with higher fluid milk prices are growing \nrapidly.\n  In an free market with a level playing field, these shifts in \nproduction might be fair. But in a market where the government is \nsetting the prices and providing that artificial advantage to regions \noutside the Upper Midwest, the current system is unconscionable.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and bring reform to this \nout dated system and work to eliminate the inequities in the current \nmilk marketing order pricing system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 43. A bill to allow modified bloc voting by cooperative \nassociations of milk producers in connection with a referendum on \nFederal Milk Marketing Order reform; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to re-introduce a measure that \nwill begin to restore democracy for dairy farmers throughout the \nNation.\n  When dairy farmers across the country voted on a referendum four \nyears ago, perhaps the most significant change in dairy policy in sixty \nyears, they didn't actually get to vote. Instead, their dairy marketing \ncooperatives cast their votes for them.\n  This procedure is called ``bloc voting'' and it is used all the time. \nBasically, a Cooperative's Board of Directors decides that, in the \ninterest of time, bloc voting will be implemented for that particular \nvote. It may serve the interest of time, but not always in the interest \nof their producer owner-members.\n  I do think that bloc voting can be a useful tool in some \ncircumstances, but I have serious concerns about its use in every \ncircumstance. Farmers in Wisconsin and in other states tell me that \nthey do not agree with their Cooperative's view on every vote. Yet, \nthey have no way to preserve their right to make their single vote \ncount.\n  After speaking to farmers and officials at USDA, I have learned that \nif a Cooperative bloc votes, individual members simply have no \nopportunity to voice opinions separately. That seems unfair when you \nconsider what significant issues may be at stake. Coops and their \nmembers do not always have identical interests. We shouldn't ask \nfarmers to ignore that fact.\n  The Democracy for Dairy Producers Act of 2003 is simple and fair. It \nprovides that a cooperative cannot deny any of its members a ballot if \none or two or ten or all of the members chose to vote on their own.\n  This will in no way slow down the process at USDA; implementation of \nany rule or regulation would proceed on schedule. Also, I do not expect \nthat this would often change the final outcome of any given vote. Coops \ncould still cast votes for their members who do not exercise their \nright to vote individually. And to the extent that coops represent \nfarmers interest, farmers are likely to vote along with the coops, but \nwhether they join the coops or not, farmers deserve the right to vote \naccording to their own views.\n  I urge my colleagues to return the democratic process to America's \nfarmers, by supporting the Democracy for Dairy Producers Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 44. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe percentage depletion allowance for certain hardrock mines, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \neliminate from the Federal Tax Code percentage depletion allowances for \nhardrock minerals mined on Federal public lands. I am pleased that the \nSenator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, is joining me as an original \ncosponsor.\n  President Clinton proposed the elimination of the percentage \ndepletion allowance on public lands in his FY 2001 budget. President \nClinton's FY 2001 budget estimated that, under this legislation, income \nto the Federal treasury from the elimination of percentage depletion \nallowances for hardrock mining on public lands would total $487 million \nover 5 years and $1.20 billion over 10 years. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimated that it would save $410 million over 5 years and \n$823 million over 10 years. These savings are calculated as the excess \namount of Federal revenues above what would be collected if depletion \nallowances were limited to sunk costs in capital investments. \nPercentage depletion allowances are contained in the tax code for \nextracted fuel, minerals, metal and other mined commodities. These \nallowances have a combined value, according to estimates by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, of $4.8 billion.\n  These percentage depletion allowances were initiated by the \nCorporation Excise Act of 1909. That's right, these allowances were \ninitiated nearly one hundred years ago. Provisions for a depletion \nallowance based on the value of the mine were made under a 1912 \nTreasury Department regulation, but difficulty in applying this \naccounting principle to mineral production led to the initial \ncodification of the mineral depletion allowance in the Tariff Act of \n1913. The Revenue Act of 1926 established percentage depletion much in \nits present form for oil and gas. The percentage depletion allowance \nwas then extended to metal mines, coal, and other hardrock minerals by \nthe Revenue Act of 1932, and has been adjusted several times since.\n  Percentage depletion allowances were historically placed in the Tax \nCode to reduce the effective tax rates in the mineral and extraction \nindustries far below tax rates on other industries, providing \nincentives to increase investment, exploration and output. Percentage \ndepletion also makes it possible, however, to recover many times the \namount of the original investment.\n  There are two methods of calculating a deduction to allow a firm to \nrecover the costs of its capital investment: cost depletion, and \npercentage depletion. Cost depletion allows for the recovery of the \nactual capital investment, the costs of discovering, purchasing, and \ndeveloping a mineral reserve, over the period during which the reserve \nproduces income. Using cost depletion, a company would deduct a portion \nof its original capital investment minus any previous deductions, in an \namount that is equal to the fraction of the remaining recoverable \nreserves. Under this method, the total deductions cannot exceed the \noriginal capital investment.\n  Under percentage depletion, however, the deduction for recovery of a \ncompany's investment is a fixed percentage of ``gross income,'' namely, \nsales revenue--from the sale of the mineral. Under this method, total \ndeductions typically exceed, let me be clear on that point, exceed the \ncapital that the company invested.\n  The rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 \nof the U.S. Code contains depletion allowances for more than 70 metals \nand minerals, at rates ranging from 10 to 22 percent.\n  In addition to repealing the percentage depletion allowances for \nminerals mined on public lands, my bill would also create a new fund, \ncalled the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. One fourth of the revenue \nraised by the bill, or approximately $120 million dollars, would be \ndeposited into an interest bearing fund in the Treasury to be used to \nclean up abandoned hardrock mines in states that are subject to the \n1872 Mining Law. The Mineral Policy Center estimates that there are \n557,650 abandoned hardrock mine sites nationwide and the cost of \nclearing them up will range from $32.7 billion to $71.5 billion.\n  There are currently no comprehensive Federal or State programs to \naddress the need to clean up old mine sites. Reclaiming these sites \nrequires the enactment of a program with explicit authority to clean up \nabandoned mine sites and the resources to do it. My legislation is a \nfirst step toward providing the needed authority and resources.\n  In today's budget climate we are faced with the question of who \nshould bear the costs of exploration, development, and production of \nnatural resources: all taxpayers, or the users and producers of the \nresource? For more than a century, the mining industry has been paying \nnext to nothing for the privilege of extracting minerals from public \nlands and then abandoning its mines. Now those mines are adding to the \nnation's environmental and financial burdens. We face serious budget \nchoices this fiscal year, yet these subsidies remain persistent tax \nexpenditures that raise the deficit for all citizens or shift a greater \ntax burden to\n\n[[Page S49]]\n\nother taxpayers to compensate for the special tax breaks provided to \nthe mining industry.\n  The measure I am introducing is fairly straightforward. It eliminates \nthe percentage depletion allowance for hardrock minerals mined on \npublic lands while continuing to allow companies to recover reasonable \ncost depletion.\n  Though at one time, there may have been an appropriate role for a \ngovernment-driven incentive for enhanced mineral production, there is \nnow sufficient reason to adopt a more reasonable depletion allowance \nthat is consistent with depreciation rates given to other businesses.\n  The time has come for the Federal Government to get out of the \nbusiness of subsidizing one business over another. We can no longer \nafford its costs in dollars or its cost to the health of our citizens. \nThis legislation is one step toward the goal of ending these corporate \nwelfare subsidies.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 44\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make changes to the Office for State and Local \nGovernment Coordination, Department of Homeland Security; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President I rise today with my colleague from Maine \nto introduce legislation to help first responders do what they do so \nwell, protect our communities in an emergency.\n  The Department of Homeland Security will create a massive shift in \nthe Federal Government. Nobody will feel the impact of this shift more \nthan the brave men and women who work in law enforcement, as \nfirefighters, as rescue workers, as emergency medical service \nproviders, and in capacities as first responders.\n  We must make sure that these first responders have the resources that \nthey need.\n  While I commend the Administration for raising the funding dedicated \nto first responders in the President's budget, I am concerned that new \nlayers of bureaucracy and reorganization could reduce these funding \nlevels, or just as harmful, put up barriers to first responders \nactually receiving these funds.\n  The Federal agencies in the proposed Department of Homeland Security \nmust listen to the priorities of our communities. After all, the needs \nof first responders vary between regions, as well as between rural and \nurban communities. In Wisconsin, I have heard needs ranging from \ntraining to equipment to more emergency personnel in the field, just to \nname a few.\n  My legislation would promote effective coordination among Federal \nagencies under the Department of Homeland Security and ensure that our \nfirst responders, our firefighters, law enforcement, rescue, and EMS \nproviders, can help Federal agencies and the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity to improve existing programs and future initiatives.\n  It would first establish a Federal Liaison on Homeland Security in \neach state and coordinate between the Department of Homeland Security \nand state and local first responders.\n  This office would serve not only as an avenue to exchange ideas, but \nalso as a resource to ensure that the funding and programs are \neffective.\n  For example, my hope is that the Homeland Security Department will \nmake programs such as the Fire Act a high priority. The Fire Act \nprovides grants directly to fire departments across our nation for \ntraining and equipment needs. I recently visited one excellent example \nof this program in West Allis, Wisconsin, where the Department received \na grant in 2001 to implement a wellness and fitness program for their \nfirefighters. I am told that it is one of the first departments in the \nState to meet the goals of this program, and I commend the department \nfor its efforts.\n  My legislation would also direct the agencies within the Department \nof Homeland Security to coordinate and prioritize their activities that \nsupport first responders, and at the same time, ensure effective use of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  As part of this coordination, the First Responders Support Act \nestablishes a new advisory committee of those in the first responder \ncommunity to identify and streamline effective programs.\n  Last year, both the original Senate and House homeland security bills \nlacked the provisions needed to ensure that the new Department of \nHomeland Security communicates and coordinates effectively with first \nresponders.\n  During the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee mark-up of the \nHomeland Security bill, the Committee added our First Responders \nSupport Act to the legislation. They did so knowing that we would have \nto reconcile the overlap between our legislation and the language in \nthe Chairman's mark creating an office for state and local government \ncoordination. Our amendment, which was approved by the full Senate, did \njust that. Unfortunately, our proposal was dropped from the final bill \nduring backroom negotiations.\n  Because of this omission, I promised to make enacting this \nlegislation one of our top priorities this Congress. That's why we are \nre-introducing this legislation today.\n  We must be aggressive in seeking the advice of our first responders, \nand helping them get the resources that they need to provide effective \nservices. They are on the front lines, and deserve our strong support.\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\n  In almost any disaster, the local first responders and health care \nproviders play an indispensable role. If the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is to be effective, we need to ensure that the resources are \ndelivered to the front line personnel in an effective and coordinated \nmanner. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this proposal \nand support our first responders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 47. A bill to terminate operation of the Extremely Low Frequency \nCommunication System of the Navy; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation \nthat would terminate the operation of the Navy's Extremely Low \nFrequency communications system, Project ELF, which is located in Clam \nLake, WI, and Republic, MI.\n  I would like to thank the senior Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, \nand the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, for cosponsoring this bill.\n  Project ELF is a Cold War relic that was designed to send short one-\nway messages to ballistic and attack submarines that are submerged in \ndeep waters. The bill that I am introducing today would terminate \noperations at Project ELF, while maintaining the infrastructure in \nWisconsin and Michigan in the event that a resumption in operations \nbecomes necessary.\n  Project ELF is ineffective and unnecessary in the post-Cold War era. \nThis antiquated system does not facilitate the rapid mobilization that \nour military says it needs to respond to current threats from weapons \nof mass destruction. The horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, \nemphasized the need for rapid, reliable two-way communications. Since \nELF cannot transmit detailed messages, it serves as an expensive \n``beeper'' system to tell submarines to come to the surface to receive \nmessages from other sources, and the subs cannot send a return message \nto ELF in the event of an emergency. It takes ELF four minutes to send \na three-letter message to a deeply submerged submarine.\n  With the end of the Cold War, Project ELF becomes harder and harder \nto justify. Our submarines no longer need to take that extra precaution \nagainst Soviet nuclear forces. They can now surface on a regular basis \nwith less danger of detection or attack. They can also receive more \ncomplicated messages through very low frequency, VLF, radio waves or \nlengthier messages through satellite systems. Taxpayers should not be \nasked to continue to pay for what amounts to a beeper system that tells \nour submarines to come to the surface to receive orders from another, \nmore sophisticated source.\n  Further, continued operation of this facility is opposed by most \nresidents in my state. The members of the Wisconsin delegation have \nfought hard for years to close down Project ELF. I have introduced \nlegislation during each Congress since taking office in 1993 to \nterminate it, and I have recommended it for closure to the Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission.\n  Project ELF has had a turbulent history. Since the idea for ELF was \nfirst proposed in 1958, the project has been changed or canceled \nseveral times. Residents of Wisconsin have opposed ELF since its \ninception, but for years we were told that the national security \nconsiderations of the Cold War outweighed our concerns about this \ninstallation in our State. Ironically, this system became fully \noperational in 1989, the same year the tide of democracy began to sweep \nacross Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Now, fourteen years later, \nthe hammer and sickle has fallen and the Russian submarine fleet is in \ndisarray. But Project ELF still remains as a constant, expensive \nreminder to the people of my State that many at the Department of \nDefense remain focused on the past.\n  There also continue to be a number of public health and environmental \nconcerns associated with Project ELF. For almost two decades, we have \nreceived inconclusive data on this project's effects on Wisconsin and \nMichigan residents. In 1984, a U.S. District Court ordered that ELF be \nshut down because the Navy paid inadequate attention to the system's \npossible health effects and violated the National Environmental Policy \nAct. Interestingly, that decision was overturned because U.S. national \nsecurity, at the time, prevailed over public health and environmental \nconcerns.\n  Numerous medical studies point to a possible link between exposure to \nextremely low frequency electromagnetic fields and a variety of human \nhealth effects and abnormalities in both animal and plant species.\n  In 1999, after six years of research, the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences released a report that did not prove \nconclusively a link between electromagnetic fields and cancer, but the \nreport did not disprove it, either. Serious questions remain, and many \nof my constituents are rightly concerned about this issue.\n  In addition, I have heard from a number of dairy farmers who are \nconvinced that the stray voltage associated with ELF transmitters has \ndemonstrably reduced milk production. As we continue our efforts to \nreturn to a sustainable balanced federal budget, and as the Department \nof Defense continues to struggle to address readiness and other \nconcerns, it is clear that outdated programs such as Project ELF should \nbe closed down.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 47\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF OPERATION OF EXTREMELY LOW \n                   FREQUENCY COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Termination Required.--The Secretary of the Navy shall \n     terminate the operation of the Extremely Low Frequency \n     Communication System of the Navy.\n       (b) Maintenance of Infrastructure.--The Secretary shall \n     maintain the infrastructure necessary for resuming operation \n     of the Extremely Low Frequency Communication System.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 48. A bill to repeal the provisions of law that provides automatic \npay adjustments for Members of Congress; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation \nthat would put an end to automatic cost-of-living adjustments for \nCongressional pay.\n  As my Colleagues are aware, it is an unusual thing to have the power \nto raise our own pay. Few people have that ability. Most of our \nconstituents do not have that power. And that this power is so unusual \nis good reason for the Congress to exercise that power openly, and to \nexercise it subject to regular procedures that include debate, \namendment, and a vote on the record.\n  Regrettably, current law permits Members to avoid such an open \nprocedure. All that is necessary for Congress to get a pay raise is \nthat nothing be done to stop it. Unless Congress affirmatively acts, \nthe annual pay raise takes effect.\n  This stealth pay raise technique began with a change Congress enacted \nin the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. In section 704 of that Act, Members \nof Congress voted to make themselves entitled to an annual raise equal \nto half a percentage point less than the employment cost index, one \nmeasure of inflation.\n  On occasion, Congress has voted to deny itself the raise. \nTraditionally, this has been done on the Treasury-Postal appropriations \nbill. But that vehicle is not always made available to those who want a \npublic debate and vote on the matter. In one instance, the Treasury-\nPostal bill was slipped into the conference report on the Legislative \nBranch appropriations bill, and thus completely shielded from \namendment. And during 2002, the Senate did not consider the Treasury-\nPostal bill at all.\n  This makes getting a vote on the annual congressional pay raise a \nhaphazard affair at best. And it should not be that way. No one should \nhave to force a debate and public vote on the pay raise. On the \ncontrary, Congress should have to act if it decides to award itself a \nhike in pay. This process of pay raises without accountability must \nend.\n  The question of how and whether Members of Congress can raise their \nown pay was one that our Founders considered from the beginning of our \nNation. In August of 1789, as part of the package of 12 amendments \nadvocated\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\nby James Madison that included what has become our Bill of Rights, the \nHouse of Representatives passed an amendment to the Constitution \nproviding that Congress could not raise its pay without an intervening \nelection. Almost 214 years ago, on September 9, 1789, the Senate passed \nthat amendment. In late September of 1789, Congress submitted the \namendments to the States.\n  Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in \nthe 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the \nWisconsin State Senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its \napproval by the Michigan legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed \napproval by three-fourths of the States.\n  The 27th Amendment to the Constitution now states: `No law, varying \nthe compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, \nshall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have \nintervened.''\n  I try to honor that limitation in my own practices. In my own case, \nthroughout my 6-year term, I accept only the rate of pay that Senators \nreceive on the date on which I was sworn in as a Senator. And I return \nto the Treasury any additional income Senators get, whether from a \ncost-of-living adjustment or a pay raise we vote for ourselves. I don't \ntake a raise until my bosses, the people of Wisconsin, give me one at \nthe ballot box. That is the spirit of the 27th Amendment. The stealth \npay raises like the one that Congress allowed last year, at a minimum, \ncertainly violate the spirit of that amendment.\n  This practice must end. To address it, I am reintroducing this bill \nto end the automatic cost-of-living adjustment for Congressional pay. \nSenators and Congressmen should have to vote up-or-down to raise \nCongressional pay. My bill would simply require us to vote in the open. \nWe owe our constituents no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 48\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce the deficit of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a measure aimed \nat curbing wasteful spending. In the face of our return to Federal \ndeficits, we must prioritize and eliminate programs that can no longer \nbe sustained with limited Federal dollars, or where a more cost-\neffective means of fulfilling those functions can be substituted. The \nmeasure that I introduce today eliminates or modifies three Federal \nprograms: it establishes a means test for large agribusinesses \nreceiving subsidized water from the Bureau of Reclamation, it \nterminates the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, \nUSUHS, a medical school run by the Department of Defense, and it ends \nthe future production of submarine launched D5 missiles, commonly known \nas the Trident II missiles. Eliminating or reforming these three \nprograms would save the taxpayers in excess of $8 billion over ten \nyears.\n  The irrigation means test provision is drawn from legislation that I \nthat have sponsored in previous Congresses to reduce the amount of \nFederal irrigation subsidies received by large agribusiness interests. \nI believe that reforming Federal water pricing policy by reducing \nsubsidies is important as a means to achieve our broader objectives of \nachieving a truly balanced budget. This legislation is also needed to \ncurb fundamental abuses of reclamation law that cost the taxpayer \nmillions of dollars every year.\n  In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt proposed legislation, which \ncame to be known as the Reclamation Act of 1902, to encourage \ndevelopment of family farms throughout the western United States. The \nidea was to provide needed water for areas that were otherwise dry and \ngive small farms, those no larger than 160 acres, a chance, with a \nhelping hand from the Federal Government, to establish themselves. \nAccording to a 1996 General Accounting Office report, since the passage \nof the Reclamation Act, the Federal Government has spent $21.8 billion \nto construct 133 water projects in the west which provide water for \nirrigation. Agribusinesses, and other project beneficiaries, are \nrequired under the law to repay to the Federal Government their \nallocated share of the costs of constructing these projects.\n  As a result of the subsidized financing provided by the Federal \nGovernment, however, some of the beneficiaries of Federal water \nprojects repay considerably less than their full share of these costs. \nAccording to the 1996 GAO report, agribusinesses generally receive the \nlargest amount of Federal financial assistance. Since the initiation of \nthe irrigation program in 1902, construction costs associated with \nirrigation have been repaid without interest. The GAO further found, in \nreviewing the Bureau of Reclamation's financial reports, that $16.9 \nbillion, or 78 percent, of the $21.8 billion of Federal investment in \nwater projects is considered to be reimbursable. Of the reimbursable \ncosts, the largest share, $7.1 billion, is allocated to irrigation \ninterests. GAO also found that the Bureau of Reclamation will likely \nshift $3.4 billion of the debt owed by agribusinesses to other users of \nthe water projects for repayment.\n  There are several reasons why large agribusinesses continue to \nreceive such significant subsidies. Under the Reclamation Reform Act of \n1982, Congress acted to expand the size of the farms that could receive \nsubsidized water from 160 acres to 960 acres. The RRA of 1982 expressly \nprohibits farms that exceed 960 acres in size from receiving federally-\nsubsidized water. These restrictions were added to the Reclamation law \nto close loopholes through which Federal subsidies were flowing to \nlarge agribusinesses rather than the small family farmers that \nReclamation projects were designed to serve. Agribusinesses were \nexpected to pay full cost for all water received on land in excess of \ntheir 960 acre entitlement.\n  Despite the express mandate of Congress, regulations promulgated \nunder the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 have failed to keep big \nagricultural water users from receiving Federal subsidies. The General \nAccounting Office and the Inspector General of the Department of the \nInterior continue to find that the acreage limits established in law \nare circumvented through the creation of arrangements such as farming \ntrusts. These trusts, which in total acreage well exceed the 960 acre \nlimit, are comprised of smaller units that are not subject to the \nreclamation acreage cap. These smaller units are farmed under a single \nmanagement agreement often through a combination of leasing and \nownership.\n  The Department of the Interior has acknowledged that these trusts do \nexist. Interior published a final rulemaking in 1998 to require farm \noperators who provide services to more than 960 nonexempt acres \nwestwide, held by a single trust or legal entity or any combination of \ntrusts and legal entities to submit RRA forms to the district(s) where \nsuch land is located. Water districts are now required to provide \nspecific information about farm operators to Interior annually. This \ninformation is an important step toward enforcing the legislation that \nI am reintroducing today.\n  My legislation combines various elements of proposals introduced by \nother members of Congress to close loopholes in the 1982 legislation \nand to impose a $500,000 means-test. This new approach limits the \namount of subsidized irrigation water delivered to any operation in \nexcess of the 960 acre limit which claimed $500,000 or more in gross \nincome, as reported on its most recent IRS tax form. If the $500,000 \nthreshold were exceeded, an income ratio would\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nbe used to determine how much of the water should be delivered to the \nuser at the full-cost rate, and how much at the below-cost rate. For \nexample, if a 961 acre operation earned $1 million dollars, a ratio of \n$500,000, the means-test value, divided by its gross income would \ndetermine the full cost rate. Thus the water user would pay the full \ncost rate on half of their acreage and the below-cost rate on the \nremaining half.\n  This means-testing proposal was featured in the 2000 Green Scissors \nreport. This report is compiled annually by Friends of the Earth and \nTaxpayers for Common Sense and supported by a number of environmental, \nconsumer and taxpayer groups. The premise of the report is that there \nare a number of subsidies and projects that could be cut to both reduce \nthe deficit and benefit the environment. The Green Scissors \nrecommendation on means-testing water subsidies indicates that if a \ntest is successful in reducing subsidy payments to the highest grossing \n10 percent of farms, then the Federal Government would recover between \n$440 million and $1.1 billion per year, or at least $2.2 billion over \nfive years.\n  When countless Federal programs are subjected to various types of \nmeans-tests to limit benefits to those who truly need assistance, it \nmakes little sense to continue to allow large business interests to dip \ninto a program intended to help small entities struggling to survive. \nTaxpayers have legitimate concerns when they learn that their hard-\nearned tax dollars are being expended to assist large corporate \ninterests in select regions of the country, particularly in tight \nbudgetary times.\n  The second element of my bill will help our Armed Services obtain \nphysician services at a more reasonable cost by terminating the \nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, USUHS. The \nmeasure is one I proposed when I ran for the U.S. Senate, and was part \nof a larger, 82-point plan to reduce the Federal budget deficit. The \nmost recent estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, project \nthat terminating the school would save $273 million over the next five \nyears, and when completely phased-out, would generate $450 million in \nsavings over five years.\n  USUHS was created in 1972 to meet an expected shortage of military \nmedical personnel. Today, however, USUHS accounts for only a small \nfraction of the military's new physicians, less than 12 percent in \n1994, according to CBO. This contrasts dramatically with the military's \nscholarship program, which provided over 80 percent of the military's \nnew physicians in that year.\n  What is even more troubling is that USUHS is also the single most \ncostly source of new physicians for the military. CBO reports that \nbased on figures from 1995, each USUHS trained physician costs the \nmilitary $615,000. By comparison, the scholarship program cost about \n$125,000 per doctor, with other sources providing new physicians at a \ncost of $60,000. As CBO has noted, even adjusting for the lengthier \nservice commitment required of USUHS trained physicians, the cost of \ntraining them is still higher than that of training physicians from \nother sources, an assessment shared by the Pentagon itself. Indeed, \nCBO's estimate of the savings generated by this measure also includes \nthe cost of obtaining physicians from other sources.\n  The House of Representatives has voted to terminate this program on \nseveral occasions, joining others, ranging from the Grace Commission to \nthe CBO, in raising the question of whether this medical school, which \ngraduated its first class in 1980, should be closed because it is so \nmuch more costly than alternative sources of physicians for the \nmilitary.\n  The real issue we must address is whether USUHS is essential to the \nneeds of today's military structure, or if we can do without this \ncostly program. The proponents of USUHS frequently cite the higher \nretention rates of USUHS graduates over physicians obtained from other \nsources as a justification for continuation of this program, but while \na greater percentage of USUHS trained physicians may remain in the \nmilitary longer than those from other sources, the Pentagon indicates \nthat the alternative sources already provide an appropriate mix of \nretention rates. Testimony by the Department of Defense before the \nSubcommittee on Force Requirements and Personnel noted that the \nmilitary's scholarship program meets the retention needs of the \nservices.\n  And while USUHS provides only a small fraction of the military's new \nphysicians, relying primarily on these other sources has not \ncompromised the ability of military physicians to meet the needs of the \nPentagon. According to the Office of Management and Budget, of the \napproximately 2,000 physicians serving in Desert Storm, only 103, about \n5 percent, were USUHS trained.\n  USUHS has some dedicated supporters in the U.S. Senate, and I realize \nthat there are legitimate arguments that those supporters have made in \ndefense of this institution. The problem, however, is that the Federal \nGovernment cannot afford to continue every program that provides some \nuseful function, especially when such services can be procured \nelsewhere.\n  The final provision of my legislation terminates another wasteful \ndefense program, the continued production of new Trident II submarine-\nlaunched ballistic missiles. Trident submarines, and the deadly \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles they carry, were designed \nspecifically to attack targets inside the Soviet Union from waters off \nthe continental United States.\n  Let me say at the outset that this provision would in no way prevent \nthe Navy from maintaining the current arsenal of Trident II missiles. \nNor would it affect those Trident II missiles that are currently in \nproduction.\n  The Navy currently has ten Trident II submarines, each of which \ncarries 24 Trident II, D5, missiles. Each of these missiles contains \neight independently targetable nuclear warheads, for a total of 192 \nwarheads per submarine. Each warhead packs between 300 to 450 kilotons \nof explosive power.\n  By way of comparison, the first atomic bomb that the United States \ndropped on Hiroshima generated 15 kilotons of force. Let's do the math \nfor just one fully-equipped Trident II submarine. Each warhead can \ngenerate up to 450 kilotons of force. Each missile has eight warheads, \nand each submarine has 24 missiles. That equals 86.4 megatons of force \nper submarine. That means that each Trident II submarine carries the \npower to deliver devastation which is the equivalent of 5,760 \nHiroshimas.\n  And that is just one fully equipped submarine. As I noted earlier, \nthe Navy currently has ten such submarines.\n  Through fiscal year 2003, the Navy will have been authorized to \npurchase 408 Trident II missiles for these submarines. Even taking into \naccount the 86 Trident II missiles that have been expended in testing \nthrough calendar year 2002, the Navy will still have 322 missiles in \nstock once those authorized to be purchased during FY2003 are \ncompleted.\n  The Navy needs 240 missiles to fully equip ten Trident II submarines \nwith 24 missiles each. That leaves 82 ``extra'' missiles in the Navy's \ninventory. And the Navy still plans to buy at least 132 more missiles \nover the next two years, for a total purchase of 540 missiles. My bill \nwould terminate production of these missiles after the currently \nauthorized 408, saving taxpayers $6.6 billion over the next ten years.\n  The tragic events of September 11, 2001, and the recent resumption of \nnuclear activities by North Korea, serve as chilling reminders that \nthere is still a potential threat from rogue states, and from \nindependent operators such as al-Qaeda, who seek to acquire ballistic \nmissiles and other weapons of mass destruction. I also recognize that \nour submarine fleet and our arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons still \nhave an important role to play in warding off these threats. Their \nrole, however, has diminished dramatically from what it was at the \nheight of the Cold War. Our missile procurement decisions should \nreflect that change and should reflect the realities of the post-Cold \nWar world.\n  Our current ballistic missile capability is far superior to that of \nany other county on the globe. And the capability of the Russian \nmilitary, the very force which these missiles were designed to counter, \nis seriously degraded.\n  We should not be buying more Trident II missiles at a time when the \ngovernments of the United States and Russia have signed the Moscow \nTreaty, which calls for deep reductions in our nuclear forces. To spend \nscarce resources on building more missiles now\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\nis short-sighted and could seriously undermine our efforts to negotiate \nfurther arms reductions with Russia.\n  In conclusion, the time has come to rethink our Federal budget \npriorities, and to redirect needed funds appropriately. Eliminating or \nreforming these three programs will go a long way to doing just that, \nand I urge Congress to act swiftly to save money for the taxpayers. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 49\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal reclamation program has been in existence \n     for over 90 years, with an estimated taxpayer investment of \n     over $70,000,000,000;\n       (2) the program has had and continues to have an enormous \n     effect on the water resources and aquatic environments of the \n     western States;\n       (3) irrigation water made available from Federal water \n     projects in the West is a very valuable resource for which \n     there are increasing and competing demands;\n       (4) the justification for providing water at less than full \n     cost was to benefit and promote the development of small \n     family farms and exclude large corporate farms, but this \n     purpose has been frustrated over the years due to inadequate \n     implementation of subsidy and acreage limits;\n       (5) below-cost water prices tend to encourage excessive use \n     of scarce water supplies in the arid regions of the West, and \n     reasonable price increases to the wealthiest western farmers \n     would provide an economic incentive for greater water \n     conservation;\n       (6) the Federal Government has increasingly applied \n     eligibility tests based on income for Federal entitlement and \n     subsidy programs, measures that are consistent with the \n     historic approach of the reclamation program's acreage \n     limitations that seek to limit water subsidies to small \n     farms; and\n       (7) including a means test based on gross income in the \n     reclamation program will increase the effectiveness of \n     carrying out the family farm goals of the Federal reclamation \n     laws.\n\n     SEC. 103.

A bill to permanently extend the moratorium enacted by the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, predictions that the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct would topple Western Civilization have not come to pass. Since the \nmoratorium on taxation of out-of-State, online sales was first enacted \nin October 1998, not a single community, county or state has come \nforward to prove it is being injured by its inability to impose \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. There is simply no \nevidence that States have lost revenue by technology-driven commerce. \nOn the contrary, the technology sector itself has been pounded as hard \nas any sector by the economic downturn.\n  Across the country States are facing tremendous budget pressures. My \nown State of Oregon is facing a nearly 20 percent budget shortfall, and \nOregon has the highest unemployment rate in the Nation. The shift from \nblack ink to red is the result of this Administration's failed economic \npolicies, not the inability of States to impose discriminatory taxes on \nInternet sales.\n  Adding new taxes on the backs of consumers is not the way to salvage \nweakened State and local economies. Sales taxes are among the most \nregressive revenue measures, and imposing new sales taxes at this time \ncould actually make a bad economic situation worse. A number of States \nseem to be arguing that their economic future is tied to taxing \ntechnology entrepreneurs located thousands of miles away with no \nphysical presence in their jurisdiction. I don't share this view. The \nreason States don't tax remote sellers, as former Massachusetts \nGovernor Celluci has testified before the Senate, is they don't want \nthe political heat. Few of the 45 States that could collect a use tax \non all items their residents have purchased out-of-State actually do \nso. Most States simply chose not to enforce their own laws, preferring \nto export their tax burden to out of state businesses who get no \nbenefit from the taxing state.\n  Congress will soon be asked again by the Streamlined Sales Tax \nProject States to take the political heat for new sales taxes. The U.S. \nSenate has voted three times in recent years on whether to overturn \nQuill to require remote sellers with no nexus to serve the States as \ntheir tax collectors. Every time the Senate has rejected the notion. On \nJanuary 19, 1995, the Senate voted 73-25 to table the amendment; on \nOctober 2, 1998, the Senate voted 66-29 to table the amendment; and \nmost recently, on November 15, 2001, the Senate voted 57-43 to table \nthe amendment.\n  As Congress revisits this issue again this year, we should remember \nwhat the Supreme Court said in Quill: ``Congress is . . . free to \ndecide whether, when and to what extent the States may burden mail-\norder concerns with a duty to collect use taxes.'' The authority the \nConstitution vests in Congress to regulate interstate commerce--online \nor otherwise--is an enormous power that must be exercised with great \ncare and caution. I believe the moratorium should be extended \nindefinitely, and that is what the legislation I introduce today would \ndo. I am pleased to be joined once again in this effort by \nRepresentative Chris Cox, and ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 52\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) prescription drug costs are increasing at an alarming \n     rate and are a major worry of American families and senior \n     citizens;\n       (2) enhancing competition between generic drug \n     manufacturers and brand-name manufacturers can significantly \n     reduce prescription drug costs for American families;\n       (3) the pharmaceutical market has become increasingly \n     competitive during the last decade because of the increasing \n     availability and accessibility of generic pharmaceuticals, \n     but competition must be further stimulated and strengthened;\n       (4) the Federal Trade Commission has discovered that there \n     are increasing opportunities for drug companies owning \n     patents on brand-name drugs and generic drug companies to \n     enter into private financial deals in a manner that could \n     restrain trade and greatly reduce competition and increase \n     prescription drug costs for consumers;\n       (5) generic pharmaceuticals are approved by the Food and \n     Drug Administration on the basis of scientific testing and \n     other information establishing that pharmaceuticals are \n     therapeutically equivalent to brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n     ensuring consumers a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective \n     alternative to brand-name innovator pharmaceuticals;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office estimates that--\n       (A) the use of generic pharmaceuticals for brand-name \n     pharmaceuticals could save purchasers of pharmaceuticals \n     between $8,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000 each year; and\n       (B) generic pharmaceuticals cost between 25 percent and 60 \n     percent less than brand-name pharmaceuticals, resulting in an \n     estimated average savings of $15 to $30 on each prescription;\n       (7) generic pharmaceuticals are widely accepted by \n     consumers and the medical profession, as the market share \n     held by generic pharmaceuticals compared to brand-name \n     pharmaceuticals has more than doubled during the last decade, \n     from approximately 19 percent to 43 percent, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office;\n       (8) expanding access to generic pharmaceuticals can help \n     consumers, especially senior citizens and the uninsured, have \n     access to more affordable prescription drugs;\n       (9) Congress should ensure that measures are taken to \n     effectuate the amendments made by the Drug Price Competition \n     and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 1585) \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Hatch-Waxman Act'') to \n     make generic drugs more accessible, and thus reduce health \n     care costs; and\n       (10) it would be in the public interest if patents on drugs \n     for which applications are approved under section 505(c) of \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(c)) \n     were extended only through the patent extension procedure \n     provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act rather than through the \n     attachment of riders to bills in Congress.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to increase competition, thereby helping all Americans, \n     especially seniors and the uninsured, to have access to more \n     affordable medication; and\n       (2) to ensure fair marketplace practices and deter \n     pharmaceutical companies (including generic companies) from \n     engaging in anticompetitive action or actions that tend to \n     unfairly restrain trade.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from \nNew York and Arizona in introducing the Greater Access to Affordable \nPharmaceuticals Act, which will make prescription drugs more affordable \nby promoting completion in the pharmaceutical industry and increasing \naccess to lower-priced generic drugs. The bipartisan bill that we are \nintroducing today is identical to the compromise legislation that \noverwhelmingly passed the Senate last July by a vote of 78 to 21. That \ncompromise was based on an amendment I Offered in the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee with my colleague form North \nCarolina, Senator Edwards.\n  Prescription drug spending in the United States has increased by 92 \npercent over the past 5 years to almost $120 million. These soaring \ncosts are a particular burden for the millions of uninsured Americans, \nas well as those seniors on Medicare who lack prescription drug \ncoverage. Many of these individuals are simply priced out of the \nmarket, or forced to choose between paying the bills or buying the \npills that keep them healthy.\n  Skyrocketing prescription drug costs are also putting the squeeze on \nour Nation's employers who are struggling in the face of double-digit \nannual premium increases to provide health care coverage for their \nworkers. And they are exacerbating the Medicaid funding crisis that all \nof us are hearing about from our Governors back home as they struggle \nto bridge growing shortfalls in their State budgets.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will make prescription \ndrugs more affordable for all Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that are bill will cut our Nation's drug costs \nby $60 billion over the next 10 years. That is why the legislation is \nsupported by coalitions representing the Governors, insurers, \nbusinesses, organized labor, senior groups, and individual consumers \nwho are footing the bill for these expensive drugs and whose costs for \npopular drugs like Cardizem CD, Cipro, Prilosec, and Zantac could be \ncut in half if generic alternatives were available.\n  The 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act made significant changes in our patent laws \nthat were intended to encourage pharmaceutical companies to make the \ninvestments necessary to develop new drug products, while \nsimultaneously enabling their competitors to bring lower-cost, generic \nalternatives to the market. To that end, the legislation has succeeded \nto a large degree. Prior to Hatch-Waxman, it took 3 to 5 years for \ngenerics to enter the market after a brand-name patent had expired. \nToday, lower-cost generics often enter the market immediately upon the \nexpiration of the patent. As a consequence, consumers are saving \nanywhere from $8 to 10 billion a year by purchasing generic drugs.\n  Moreover, there are even greater potential savings on the horizon. \nWithin the next 4 years, the patents on brand name drugs with combined \nsales of $20 billion are set to expire. If Hatch-Waxman were to work as \nit was intended, consumers could expect to save between 50 and 60 \npercent on these drugs as lower cost generic alternatives become \navailable as these patents expire.\n  Despite its past success, however,it is becoming increasingly \napparent that the Hatch-Waxman Act has been subject to abuse. While \nmany pharmaceutical companies have acted in good faith, there is \nmounting evidence that some brand name generic drug manufacturers have \nattempted to ``game'' the system by exploiting legal loopholes in the \ncurrent law.\n  Too many pharmaceutical companies have maximized their profits at the \nexpense of consumers by filing frivolous patents that have delayed \naccess to lower priced generic drugs. Currently, brand-name companies \ncan delay a generic drug from going to market for years. A ``new'' \npatent for an existing drug can be awarded for merely changing the \ncolor of a pill or its packaging. For example, Bristol Myers-Squibb \ndelayed generic competition on Platinol, a cancer treatment, by filing \na patent on the brown bottle that it came in.\n\n  Another example cited by the Chairman of the Federal Trade \nCommission, Timothy Muris, in testimony before the Senate Commerce \nCommission, involved the producer of the heart medication Cardizem CD, \nwhich brought a lawsuit for patent and trademark infringement against \nthe generic manufacturer in early 1996. Instead of asking the generic \ncompany to pay damages, however, the brand name manufacturer offered a \nsettlement to pay the generic company more than $80 million in return \nfor keeping the generic drug off the market. Meanwhile, users of \nCardizem--which treats high blood pressure, chest pains and heart \ndisease--were paying about $73 a month when the generic would have cost \nabout $32 a month.\n  Last July, the Federal Trade Commission released a long-awaited \nreport that found that brand-name drug manufacturers have misused legal \nloopholes to delay the entry of lower-cost generics into the market. \nThe FTC found that these tactics have led to delays of between four and \n40 months--\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\nover and above the first 30-month stay provided under Hatch-Waxman--for \ngeneric competitors of at least eight drugs since 1992. Moreover, six \nof the eight delays have occurred since 1998.\n  The FTC report points to two specific provisions of the Hatch-Waxman \nAct--the automatic 30-month stay and the 180-day market exclusivity for \nthe first generic to file a patent challenge--as being susceptible to \nstrategies that could delay the entry of lower-cost generics into the \nmarket. According to the report, these loopholes ``continue to have the \npotential for abuse,'' and, if left unchanged, ``may have more \nsignificance in the future.'' These are the very loopholes that the \nlegislation we are introducing today would close.\n  The original Hatch-Waxman Act was a carefully constructed compromise \nthat balanced an expedited FDA approval process to speed the entry of \nlower-cost generic drugs into the market with additional patent \nprotections to ensure continuing innovation. The bipartisan bill that \nwe are introducing today restores that balance by closing the loopholes \nthat have reduced the original law's effectiveness in bringing lower-\ncost generic drugs to market more quickly, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 57. A bill for the relief of Donald C. Pence; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private relief \nbill on behalf of Donald C. Pence of Stanford, NC, for compensation for \nthe failure of the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay dependency and \nindemnity compensation to Kathryn E. Box, the now-deceased mother of \nDonald C. Pence. It is rare that a Federal agency admits a mistake. In \nthis case, the Department of Veterans Affairs has admitted that a \nmistake was made and explored ways to permit payment under the law, \nincluding equitable relief, but has found no provisions authorizing the \nDepartment to release the remaining benefits that were unpaid to Mrs. \nBox at the time of her death. My bill would correct this injustice, and \nI urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 57\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Any person who \n     violates this subsection shall be fined not more than $1,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 58. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for the conversion of cooperative housing corporations into \ncondominiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nwhich would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nCooperative Housing Corporations, co-ops, to convert to condominium \nforms of ownership.\n  Under current law, a conversion from a cooperative shareholding to \ncondominium ownership is taxable at a corporate level as well as an \nindividual level. The conversion is treated as a corporate liquidation, \nand therefore taxed accordingly. In addition, a capital gains tax is \nlevied on any increase between the owner's basis in the co-op share \npre-conversion and the market value of the condominium interest post-\nconversion. This double taxation dissuades condominium conversion \nbecause the owner is being taxed on the transaction which is nothing \nmore than a change in the form of ownership. While the Internal Revenue \nService concedes that there are no discernable advantages to society of \nthe cooperative form of ownership, they do not view Federal tax \nstatutes as providing sufficient flexibility with which to address the \nobstacles of conversion.\n  Cooperative housing organizes the ownership structure into a \ncorporation, with shares of stock for each apartment unit, which are \nsold to buyers. The corporation then issues a proprietary lease \nentitling the owner of the stock to the use of the unit in perpetuity. \nBecause the investment is in the form of a share of stock, investors \nsometimes lose their entire investment as a result of debt incurred by \nthe corporation in construction and development. In addition, due to \nthe structure of a cooperative housing corporation, a prospective \npurchaser of shares in the corporation from an existing tenant-\nstockholders has difficulty obtaining mortgage financing for the \npurchase. Furthermore, tenant-stockholders of cooperative housing also \nencounter difficulties in securing bank loans for the full value of \ntheir investment.\n  As a result, owners of cooperative housing are increasingly looking \ntoward conversion to the condominium structure of ownership. \nCondominium ownership permits the owner of a unit to own the unit \nitself, eliminating the cooperative housing dilemma of corporate debt \nthat supersedes the investment of cooperative housing share owners, and \nother financial concerns.\n  The legislation I introduce today will remove the penalty of double \ntaxation from the conversion of cooperative housing to condominium \nownership, and will greatly benefit co-op owners across the nation. The \nbill does not apply to cooperatives which have been or are now being \nfinanced by any Federal, State, or local programs for the purpose of \nassisting in the construction of affordable housing cooperatives or the \nconversion of rental units to affordable housing cooperatives. I urge \nmy colleagues' consideration of and support for this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 58\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill which is \nof great importance to a group of patriotic Americans. This legislation \nis designed to extend space-available travel privileges on military \naircraft to those who have been totally disabled in the service of our \ncountry.\n  Currently, retired members of the Armed Forces are permitted to \ntravel\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\non a space-available basis on non-scheduled military flights within the \ncontinental United States, and on scheduled overseas flights operated \nby the Military Airlift Command. My bill would provide the same \nbenefits for veterans with 100 percent service-connected disabilities.\n  We owe these heroic men and women who have given so much to our \ncountry a debt of gratitude. Of course, we can never repay them for the \nsacrifices they have made on behalf of our Nation, but we can surely \ntry to make their lives more pleasant and fulfilling. One way in which \nwe can help is to extend military travel privileges to these \ndistinguished American veterans. I have received numerous letters from \nall over the country attesting to the importance attached to this issue \nby veterans. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues show their concern and \njoin me in saying ``thank you'' by supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 59\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nenable those former prisoners of war who have been separated honorably \nfrom their respective services and who have been rated as having a 30 \npercent service-connected disability to have the use of both the \nmilitary commissary and post exchange privileges. While I realize it is \nimpossible to adequately compensate one who has endured long periods of \nincarceration at the hands of our Nation's enemies, I do feel this \ngesture is both meaningful and important to those concerned because it \nserves as a reminder that our Nation has not forgotten their \nsacrifices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 60\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act to \nrevise and extend certain programs relating to the education of \nindividuals as health professionals, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Physical and \nOccupational Therapy Education Act of 2003. This legislation will \nincrease educational opportunities for physical therapy and \noccupational therapy practitioners in order to meet the growing demand \nfor the valuable services they provide in our communities.\n  Several factors contribute to the present need for federal support in \nthis area. The rapid aging of our Nation's population, the demands of \nthe AIDS crisis, increasing emphasis on health promotion and disease \nprevention, and the growth of home health care has increased the demand \nfor physical and occupational therapy services. This demand has \nexceeded our ability to educate an adequate number of physical \ntherapists and occupational therapists. In addition, technological \nadvances are allowing injured and disabled individuals to survive \nconditions that would have proven fatal in past years.\n  An inadequate number of physical therapists has led to an increased \nreliance on foreign-educated, non-immigrant temporary workers who enter \nthe U.S. as H-1B visa holders. The U.S. Commission on Immigration \nReform has identified physical therapy and occupational therapy as \nhaving the highest number of H-1B visa holders in the United States, \nsecond only to computer specialists.\n  In addition to the shortage of practitioners, a shortage of faculty \nimpedes the expansion of established education programs. The critical \nshortage of doctoral-prepared occupational therapists and physical \ntherapists has resulted in a depleted pool of potential faculty. This \nbill would assist in the development of qualified faculty by giving \npreference to grant applicants seeking to develop and expand post-\nprofessional programs for the advanced training of physical and \noccupational therapists.\n  The legislation I introduce today would provide necessary assistance \nto physical and occupational therapy programs throughout the country. \nThe investment we make will help reduce America's dependence on foreign \nlabor and create highly-skilled, high-wage employment opportunities for \nAmerican citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nremove the restriction that a clinical psychologist or clinical social \nworker provide services in a comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation \nfacility to a patient only under the care of a physician; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to authorize \nthe autonomous functioning of clinical psychologists and clinical \nsocial workers within the Medicare comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facility program.\n  In my judgment, it is unfortunate that Medicare requires clinical \nsupervision of the services provided by certain health professionals \nand does not allow them to function to the full extent of their State \npractice licenses. Those who need the services of outpatient \nrehabilitation facilities should have access to a wide range of social \nand behavioral science expertise. Clinical psychologists and clinical \nsocial workers are recognized as independent providers of mental health \ncare services under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the \nCivilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, the \nMedicare, Part B, Program, and numerous private insurance plans. This \nlegislation will ensure that these qualified professionals achieve the \nsame recognition under the Medicare comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facility program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 62\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of services provided by nursing school clinics \nunder State Medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Nursing School \nClinics Act of 2003. This measure builds on our concerted efforts to \nprovide access to quality health care for all Americans by offering \ngrants and incentives for nursing schools to establish primary care \nclinics in underserved areas where additional medical services are most \nneeded. In addition, this measure provides the opportunity for nursing \nschools to enhance the scope of student training and education by \nproviding firsthand clinical experience in primary care facilities.\n  Primary care clinics administered by nursing schools are university \nor nonprofit primary care centers developed mainly in collaboration \nwith university schools of nursing and the communities they serve. \nThese centers are staffed by faculty and staff who are nurse \npractitioners and public health nurses. Students supplement patient \ncare while receiving preceptorships provided by college of nursing \nfaculty and primary care physicians, often associated with academic \ninstitutions, who serve as collaborators with nurse practitioners. To \ndate, the comprehensive models of care provided by nursing clinics have \nyielded excellent results, including significantly fewer emergency room \nvisits, fewer hospital inpatient days, and less use of specialists, as \ncompared to conventional primary health care.\n  This bill reinforces the principle of combining health care delivery \nin underserved areas with the education of advanced practices nurses. \nTo accomplish these objectives, Title XIX of the Social Security Act \nwould be amended to designate that the services provided in these \nnursing school clinics are reimbursable under Medicaid. The combination \nof grants and the provision of Medicaid reimbursement furnishes the \nfinancial incentives for clinic operators to establish the clinics.\n  In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-effective \nand quality health care to all Americans, we must consider a wide range \nof proposals, both large and small. Most importantly, we must approach \nthe issue of health care with creativity and determination, ensuring \nthat all reasonable avenues are pursued. Nurses have always been an \nintegral part of health care delivery. The Nursing School Clinics Act \nof 2003 recognizes the central role nurses can perform as care givers \nto the medically underserved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 63\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to correct discrepancies \nin the reimbursement of clinical social workers covered through \nMedicare, Part B. The three proposed changes contained in this \nlegislation clarify the current payment process for clinical social \nworkers and establish a reimbursement methodology for the profession \nthat is similar to other health care professionals reimbursed through \nthe Medicare program.\n  First, this legislation sets payment for clinical social worker \nservices according to a fee schedule established by the Secretary. \nSecond, it explicitly states that services and supplies furnished by a \nclinical social worker are a covered Medicare expense, just as these \nservices are covered for other mental health professionals in Medicare. \nThird, the bill allows clinical social workers to be reimbursed for \nservices provided to a client who is hospitalized.\n  Clinical social workers are valued members of our health care \nprovider network. They are legally regulated in every state of the \nnation and are recognized as independent providers of mental health \ncare throughout the health care system. It is time to correct the \ndisparate reimbursement treatment of this profession under Medicare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 64\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \namend Title VII of the Public Health Service Act to establish a \npsychology post-doctoral program.\n  Psychologists have made a unique contribution in reaching out to the \nNation's medically underserved populations. Expertise in behavioral \nscience is useful in addressing grave concerns such as violence, \naddiction, mental illness, adolescent and child behavioral disorders, \nand family disruption. Establishment of a psychology post-doctoral \nprogram could be an effective way to find solutions to these issues.\n  Similar programs supporting additional, specialized training in \ntraditionally underserved settings have been successful in retaining \nparticipants to serve the same populations. For example, mental health \nprofessionals who have participated in these specialized federally \nfunded programs have tended not only to meet their repayment \nobligations, but have continued to work in the public sector or with \nthe underserved.\n  While a doctorate in psychology provides broad-based knowledge and \nmastery in a wide variety of clinical skills, specialized post-doctoral \nfellowship programs help to develop particular diagnostic and treatment \nskills required to respond effectively to underserved populations. For \nexample, what appears to be poor academic motivation in a child \nrecently relocated from Southeast Asia might actually reflect a \ncultural value of reserve rather than a disinterest in academic \nlearning. Specialized assessment skills enable the clinician to \ninitiate effective treatment.\n  Domestic violence poses a significant public health problem and is \nnot just a problem for the criminal justice system. Violence against \nwomen results in thousands of hospitalizations a year. Rates of child \nand spouse abuse in rural areas are particularly high, as are the rates \nof alcohol abuse and depression in adolescents. A post-doctoral \nfellowship program in the psychology of the rural populations could be \nof special benefit in addressing these problems.\n  Given the demonstrated success and effectiveness of specialized \ntraining programs, it is incumbent upon us to encourage participation \nin post-doctoral fellowships that respond to the needs of the nation's \nunderserved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 65\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Psychologists in the Service \n     of the Public Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 36, United States Code, to improve \nbenefits for Filipino veterans of World War II, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Filipino Veterans' \nBenefits Improvement Act of 2003 to give our country the opportunity to \nright a wrong committed decades ago by providing Philippine-born \nveterans of World War II, who served in the United States Armed Forces, \ntheir hard-earned, due compensation.\n  The Philippines became a United States possession in 1898, when it \nwas ceded from Spain following the Spanish-American War. In 1934, the \nCongress enacted the Philippine Independence Act, Public Law 73-127, \nwhich provided a 10-year time frame for the independence of the \nPhilippines. Between 1934 and final independence in 1946, the United \nStates retained certain powers over the Philippines, including the \nright to call all military forces organized by the newly-formed \nCommonwealth government into the service of the United States Armed \nForces.\n  On July 26, 1941, President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order \ncalling members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army into the service of \nthe United States Armed Forces of the Far East. Under this order, \nFilipinos were entitled to full veterans' benefits. More than 100,000 \nFilipinos volunteered for the Philippine Commonwealth Army and fought \nalongside the United States Armed Forces.\n  Shortly after Japan's surrender, Congress enacted the Armed Forces \nVoluntary Recruitment Act of 1945 for the purpose of sending American \ntroops to occupy enemy lands, and to oversee military installations at \nvarious overseas locations.\n  A provision included in the Recruitment Act called for the enlistment \nof Philippine citizens to constitute a new body of scouts. The New \nPhilippine Scouts were authorized to receive pay and allowances for \nservices performed throughout the Western Pacific. Although hostilities \nhad ceased, wartime service of the New Philippine Scouts continued as a \nmatter of law until the end of 1946.\n  Despite their sacrifices, on February 18, 1946, Congress betrayed \nthese veterans by enacting the Rescission Act of 1946 and declaring the \nservice performed by the Philippine Commonwealth Army veterans as not \n``active service,'' thus denying many benefits to which these veterans \nwere entitled.\n  On May 27, 1946, the Congress enacted the Second Supplemental Surplus \nAppropriations Rescission Act, which included a provision to limit \nveterans' benefits provided to Filipinos. This provision duplicated the \nlanguage that had eliminated veterans' benefits under the First \nRescission Act, and placed similar restrictions on veterans of the New \nPhilippine Scouts. Thus, the Filipino veterans who fought in the \nservice of the United States during World War II were precluded from \nreceiving most veterans' benefits that had been available to them \nbefore 1946, and that are available to all other veterans of our armed \nforces regardless of race, national origin, or citizenship status.\n  The Congress tried to rectify the wrong committed against the \nFilipino veterans of World War II by amending the Nationality Act of \n1940, to grant the veterans the privilege of becoming United States \ncitizens for having served in the United States Armed Forces of the Far \nEast. The law expired at the end of 1946, but not before the United \nStates had withdrawn its sole naturalization examiner from the \nPhilippines for a nine-month period. This\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\neffectively denied Filipino veterans the opportunity to become citizens \nduring this nine-month window. Forty-five years later, under the \nImmigration Act of 1990, certain Filipino veterans who had served \nduring World War II became eligible for United States citizenship. \nBetween November, 1990, and February, 1995, approximately 24,000 \nveterans took advantage of this opportunity and became United States \ncitizens.\n  Although progress has been made, we must, as a nation, correct fully \nthe injustice caused by the Rescission Acts by providing equal \ntreatment for the service and sacrifice by these brave men. The \nFilipino Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2003 will compensate \neligible veterans by providing a number of needed benefits: Dependency \nand Indeminity Compensation to surviving widows of service-connected \nveterans living in the United States; a payment increase to New \nPhilippine Scouts and survivors residing in the United States from 50 \npercent to the full dollar amount for service-connected disability \ncompensation; authorization of non-service connected disability \npensions for veterans residing in the Philippines, but at a rate of \n$100 per month, which matches the amount of the veterans' pension \nreceived by them from the Philippine government; access to veterans \nhospitals for non-service connected disabled veterans in the same \nmanner as United States veterans; and $500,000 per year to the \nOutpatient Clinic in Manila.\n  Heroes should never be forgotten or ignored, so let us not turn our \nbacks on those who sacrificed so much. Many of the Filipinos who fought \nso hard for our nation have been honored with American citizenship, but \nlet us now work to repay all of these brave men for their sacrifices by \nproviding them the veterans' benefits they have earned.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 68\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe establishment of a National Center for Social Work Research; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \namend the Public Health Service Act for the establishment of a National \nCenter for Social Work Research.\n  Social workers provide a multitude of health care delivery services \nthroughout America to our children, families, the elderly, and persons \nsuffering from various forms of abuse and neglect.\n  The purpose of this center is to support and disseminate information \nabout basic and clinical social work research, and training, with an \nemphasis on service to underserved and rural populations.\n  While the Federal Government provides funding for various social work \nresearch activities through the National Institutes of Health and other \nfederal agencies, there presently is no coordination or direction of \nthese critical activities and no overall assessment of needs and \nopportunities for empirical knowledge development. The establishment of \na Center for Social Work Research would result in improved behavioral \nand mental health care outcomes for our nation's children, families, \nthe elderly, and others.\n  In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-\neffective, research-based, quality health care to all Americans, we \nmust recognize the important contributions of social work researchers \nto health care delivery and the central role that the Center for Social \nWork can provide in facilitating their work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 73\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Center for Social \n     Work Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) social workers focus on the improvement of individual \n     and family functioning and the creation of effective health \n     and mental health prevention and treatment interventions in \n     order for individuals to become more productive members of \n     society;\n       (2) social workers provide front line prevention and \n     treatment services in the areas of school violence, aging, \n     teen pregnancy, child abuse, domestic violence, juvenile \n     crime, and substance abuse, particularly in rural and \n     underserved communities; and\n       (3) social workers are in a unique position to provide \n     valuable research information on these complex social \n     concerns, taking into account a wide range of social, \n     medical, economic and community influences from an \n     interdisciplinary, family-centered and community-based \n     approach.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CENTER FOR SOCIAL WORK \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 401(b)(2) of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 281(b)(2)) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(H) The National Center for Social Work Research.''.\n       (b) Establishment.--Part E of title IV of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 287 et seq.) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n         ``Subpart 7--National Center for Social Work Research\n\n     ``SEC. 485J.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation today to \nmodify Title VII of the U.S. Public Health Service Act in order to \nprovide students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with the \nopportunity to participate in various health professions loan programs.\n  Providing students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with \neligibility for financial assistance in the form of loans, loan \nguarantees, and scholarships will facilitate a much-needed infusion of \nbehavioral science expertise into our community of public health \nproviders. There is a growing recognition of the valuable contribution \nbeing made by psychologists toward solving some of our Nation's most \ndistressing problems.\n  The participation of students from all backgrounds and clinical \ndisciplines is vital to the success of health care training. The Title \nVII programs play a significant role in providing financial support for \nthe recruitment of minorities, women, and individuals from economically \ndisadvantaged backgrounds. Minority therapists have an advantage in the \nprovision of critical services to minority populations because often \nthey can communicate with clients in their own language and cultural \nframework. Minority therapists are more likely to work in community \nsettings where ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged \nindividuals are most likely to seek care. It is critical that continued \nsupport be provided for the training of individuals who provide health \ncare services to underserved communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 74\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nhealth care practitioners in rural areas with training in preventive \nhealth care, including both physical and mental care, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation on the Rural \nPreventive Health Care Training Act of 2003, a bill that responds to \nthe dire need of our rural communities for quality health care and \ndisease prevention programs.\n  Almost one fourth of Americans live in rural areas and frequently \nlack access to adequate physical and mental health care. As many as 21 \nmillion of the 34 million people living in underserved rural areas are \nwithout access to a primary care provider. Even in areas where \nproviders do exist, there are numerous limits to access, such as \ngeographical barriers lack of transportation, and lack of knowledge \nabout available resources. Due to the diversity of rural populations, \nlanguage and cultural obstacles are often a factor in the access to \nmedical care.\n  Compound these problems with limited financial resources, and the \nresult is that many Americans living in rural communities go without \nvital health care, especially preventive care. Children fail to receive \nimmunizations and routine checkups. Preventable illnesses and injuries \noccur needlessly, and lead to expensive hospitalizations. Early \nsymptoms of emotional problems and substance abuse go undetected, and \noften develop into full-blown disorders.\n  An Institute of Medicine, IOM, report entitled, ``Reducing Risks for \nMental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\nIntervention Research,'' highlights the benefits of preventive care for \nall health problems. The training of health care providers in \nprevention is crucial in order to meet the demand for care in \nunderserved areas. Currently, rural health care providers lack \npreventive care training opportunities.\n  Interdisciplinary preventive training of rural health care providers \nmust be encouraged. Through such training programs, rural health care \nproviders can build a strong educational foundation in the behavioral, \nbiological, and psychological sciences. Interdisciplinary team \nprevention training will also facilitate operations at sites with both \nhealth and mental health clinics by facilitating routine consultation \nbetween groups. Emphasizing the mental health disciplines and their \nservices as part of the health care team will contribute to the overall \nhealth of rural communities.\n  The Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act of 2003 would implement \nthe risk-reduction model described in the IOM study. This model is \nbased on the identification of risk factors and targets specific \ninterventions for those risk factors.\n  The human suffering caused by poor health is immeasurable, and places \na huge financial burden on communities, families, and individuals. By \nimplementing preventive measures to reduce this suffering, the \npotential overall health and financial savings are enormous.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 75\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend Title 38, United States Code, to revise \ncertain provisions relating to the appointment of professional \npsychologists in the Veterans Health Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to amend \nChapter 74 of Title 38, United States Code, to revise certain \nprovisions relating to the appointment of clinical and professional \npsychologists in the Veterans Health Administration, VHA. The VHA has a \nlong history of maintaining a staff of the very best health care \nprofessionals to provide care to those men and women who have served \nour country in the Armed Forces.\n  Recently, a distressing situation regarding the care of our veterans \nhas come to my attention: the recruitment and retention of \npsychologists in the VHA of the Department of Veterans Affairs has \nbecome a significant problem.\n  The Congress has recognized the important contribution of the \nbehavioral sciences in the treatment of several conditions afflicting a \nsignificant portion of our veterans. Programs related to homelessness, \nsubstance abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder have received \nfunding from the Congress in recent years.\n  Psychologists, as behavioral science experts, are essential to the \nsuccessful implementation of these programs. Consequently, the high \nvacancy and turnover rates for psychologists in the VHA might seriously \njeopardize these programs and will negatively impact overall patient \ncare in the VHA.\n  Recruitment of psychologists by the VHA is hindered by a number of \nfactors including a pay scale that is not commensurate with private \nsector rates together with a low number of clinical and professional \npsychologists appearing on the register of the Office of Personnel \nManagement, OPM. Most new hires have no post-doctoral experience, and \nare hired immediately after a VHA internship. Recruitment, when \nsuccessful, takes up to six months or longer.\n  Retention of psychologists in the VHA system poses an even more \nsignificant problem. I have been informed that almost 40 percent of VHA \npsychologists have five years or less of post-doctoral experience. \nPsychologists leave the VHA system after five years because they have \nalmost reached peak levels for salary and professional advancement. \nUnder the present system, psychologists cannot be recognized, or \nappropriately compensated, for excellence or for taking on additional \nresponsibilities such as running treatment programs.\n  In effect, the current system for hiring psychologists in the VHA \nsupports mediocrity, not excellence and mastery. Our veterans with \nbehavioral and mental health disorders deserve better psychological \ncare from more experienced professionals than they are now receiving.\n  Currently, psychologists are the only doctoral level health care \nproviders in the VHA who are not included in Title 38. This is without \nquestion a significant factor in the recruitment and retention \ndifficulties that I have mentioned.\n  Title 38 appointment authority for psychologists would help \nameliorate the recruitment and retention problems. The length of time \nneeded to recruit psychologists could be shortened by eliminating the \nrequirement for applicants to be rated by the OPM. This would also \nencourage the recruitment of applicants who are not recent VHA interns \nby reducing the amount of time between identifying a desirable \napplicant and being able to offer that applicant a position.\n  It is expected that problems in retention will be greatly alleviated \nby the implementation of a Title 38 system that offers financial \nincentives for psychologists to pursue professional development. \nAchievements that would merit salary increases include such activities \nas assuming supervisory responsibilities for clinical programs, \nimplementing innovative clinical treatments that improve the \neffectiveness and efficiency of patient care, making significant \ncontributions to the science of psychology, and becoming a Fellow of \nthe American Psychological Association.\n  The addition of psychologists to Title 38, as proposed by this \namendment, would provide relief for the retention and recruitment \nissues and enhance the quality of care for our veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 78\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to amend \nTitle 18 of the United States Code to allow our Nation's clinical \nsocial workers to use their mental health expertise on behalf of the \nFederal judiciary by conducting psychological and psychiatric exams.\n  I feel that the time has come to allow our Nation's judicial system \nto have access to a wide range of behavioral science and mental health \nexpertise.

A bill to recognize the organization known as the National \nAcademies of Practice; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould provide a Federal charter for the National Academies of Practice. \nThis organization represents outstanding medical professionals who have \nmade significant contributions to the practice of applied psychology, \nmedicine, dentistry, nursing, optometry, osteopathy, podiatry, social \nwork, veterinary medicine, and pharmacy. When fully established, each \nof the ten academies will possess 100 distinguished practitioners \nselected by their peers. These academics will be able to provide the \nCongress of the United States and the executive branch with \nconsiderable health policy expertise, especially from the perspective \nof those individuals who are in the forefront of actually providing \nhealth care.\n  As we continue to grapple with the many complex issues surrounding \nthe delivery of health care services, it is clearly in our best \ninterest to ensure that the Congress has direct and immediate access to \nthe recommendations of an interdisciplinary body of health care \npractitioners.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 80\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, to \nauthorize the use of clinical social workers to conduct evaluations to \ndetermine work-related emotional and mental illnesses; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Clinical Social \nWorkers' Recognition Act of 2003 to correct a continuing problem in the \nFederal Employees Compensation Act. This bill will also provide \nclinical social workers the recognition they deserve as independent \nproviders of quality mental health care services.\n  Clinical social workers are authorized to independently diagnose and \ntreat mental illnesses through public and private health insurance \nplans across the nation. However, Title V of the United States Code, \ndoes not permit the use of mental health evaluations conducted by \nclinical social workers for use as evidence in determining workers' \ncompensation claims brought by federal employees. The bill I am \nintroducing corrects this problem.\n  It is a sad irony that federal employees may select a clinical social \nworker through their health plans to provide mental health services, \nbut may not go to this same professional for workers' compensation \nevaluations. The failure to recognize the validity of evaluations \nprovided by clinical social workers unnecessarily limits Federal \nemployees' selection of a provider to conduct the workers' compensation \nmental health evaluations. Lack of this recognition may well impose an \nundue burden on Federal employees where clinical social workers are the \nonly available providers of mental health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 81\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clinical Social Workers' \n     Recognition Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \ncertain helicopter uses from ticket taxes on transportation by air; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \nexempt from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund excise taxes on air \ntransportation by helicopters of individuals and cargo for the purpose \nof conducting removal and environmental restoration activities relating \nto unexploded ordnance on the Island of Kahoolawe.\n  The Kahoolawe Island Unexploded Ordnance Clearance and Environmental \nRestoration Project is authorized under Title X of the Fiscal Year 1994 \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act. The Island of Kahoolawe is \nuninhabited, and it served as a bombing range for the Department of \nDefense until 1990. The Department of Defense is currently in the \nprocess of cleaning up and restoring Kahoolawe for its eventual return \nto the State of Hawaii.\n  The Airport and Airway Trust Fund excise taxes help support our \nnation's air traffic systems and airport infrastructures. However, \nthere are no airports or landing zones on Kahoolawe that receive \nbenefits from the Trust Fund. In addition, the taxes place an undue \nburden on the air transportation services provided to the Kahoolawe \nClearance Project. Compared to a normal airline whose aircraft make \nfewer trips per day over much longer distances, the services provided \nto the project are very frequent, with many trips over very short \ndistances. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 82\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \ncredit for the health insurance expenses of small businesses; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am introducing the Small Employer Tax \nAssistance for Health Care Act of 2003, SETAH, a bill to provide tax \nsubsidy to small employers to help them provide health coverage to \ntheir workers.\n  The problem of the uninsured is a problem of working families, but 7 \nout of 10 workers without coverage are not even offered coverage \nthrough their employers. This bill provides assistance and incentives \nfor those employers who are least likely and least able to afford \ncoverage for their workers, small, low-wage firms.\n  Statistics show that small firms are half as likely to offer coverage \nas large firms, while the offer rate for small low-wage firms is cut 50 \npercent further, compared to small high-wage firms.\n  This legislation will offer a significant tax break to those \nbusinesses in order to subsidize their purchase of health insurance. \nThe credit is designed sensibly, so that rates adjust slowly as firm \nsize and average wage increase.\n  Tax credits can unintentionally penalize firms that grow beyond the \neligibility limitation. For instance, a tax credit for firms smaller \nthan 20 means a firm's decision to add the 21st worker could add \nthousands to their tax bill. Tax credits should help businesses and \ntheir workers prosper, and not unintentionally discourage business \ngrowth.\n  The bill would contain the following elements:\n  50 Percent Credit to Help Workers at Smallest and Lowest-Wage firms. \nAll firms smaller than 10, whose average worker earns minimum wage, are \nthe ones who have the lowest insurance offer rates. These firms will \nreceive a 50 percent tax credit up to $2000 per individual policy, and \n$5000 per family.\n  Double Phase-Out. Tax credits can unintentionally penalize firms that \ngrow beyond the eligibility limitation. Using a ``double phase-out'' so \nthat the tax credit diminishes gradually as firm size and average wage \nincrease, eliminating the ``cliff effect'' that would otherwise \ndiscourage firms from adding employees or increasing wages.\n  5 Percent Floor. All firms under 50 workers, with average wages under \n$30,000, would be protected by a 5 percent floor.\n  Simplified Eligibility for All Small Low-Wage Firms. Restricting tax \ncredits to only those firms who did not previously offer can \nunintentionally give small businesses starting out an incentive not to \noffer health insurance. By contract, the SETAH credit will be available \nto all small, low-wage firms, defined as smaller than 50 employees, and \nunder $30,000 in average wages, that quality, regardless of whether \nthey have offered coverage before. This helps employers who are doing \nthe right thing and encourages others to follow their example by \noffering coverage.\n  Fiscally Prudent Targeting. Because the credit is well-targeted to \nfirms who are unlikely to offer anyway, the credit remains less \nduplicative and more efficient than other credits. At an overall cost \nof $6 to $7 billion annually, the SETAH credit covers 3.3 million new \nindividuals for roughly $2000 per newly insured individual, which is \ncrucial in an era of fiscal prudence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 87. A bill to provide for homeland security block grants; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the kind of \neconomic policies we are pursuing because I believe in the absence of \nchanging our economic policies we are not likely to get our economy \ngrowing again. It is important we do all we can to make the right \ndecisions.\n  I know the President was in Chicago today. He addressed his proposal \nfor the economy. I understand it is a package of approximately $650 \nbillion, most of which concern some provisions that will affect \nrelatively affluent Americans. I look forward to seeing what else is in \nthat package.\n  We have to recognize the economic challenges we now confront are not \njust ones in Washington but are throughout our Nation, in the capitals \nof our States, and in our cities. In Washington, we have to be \ncognizant of the ripple effect on revenues to our States and cities by \nthe decisions we make.\n  In fact, one of the unintended consequences of many of the changes \nthat were made at the beginning of the 107th Congress with respect to \ntax policy and that are embedded in what the President is proposing \nwill mean further reduction of revenues for State governments, which \ncannot print money, which have to balance budgets, which have to live \nwithin their means, and the net effect will be either States having to \nraise their taxes, local communities having to raise their property \ntaxes, or dramatic cuts in services.\n  Among those services that we cannot as a Nation afford to cut are the \nones that directly bear on homeland security: Our police and law \nenforcement officers, our firefighters, and our first responders. Today \nI am reintroducing the Homeland Security Block Grant Act that would \nprovide direct funding to our local communities.\n  For me, this is one of our first orders of business because our first \nresponders are our first line of defense at home.\n  Since September 11, 2001, cities, counties, and towns, large and \nsmall,\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nurban and rural, have responded to the call to be more vigilant, to \nbeef up our homeland defenses. They have invested more than $2.6 \nbillion from their own budgets. They have purchased more equipment. \nThey have provided training for emergency responders. They are doing \nthe very best they can to deal with all of the new challenges and \nthreats we face.\n  I have met with mayors, fire commissioners, police chiefs, and other \nemergency workers who all tell me they do not have the resources they \nneed in order to protect us.\n  I have conducted a survey of towns, cities, and counties across New \nYork. From Buffalo to the tip of Long Island, we have heard the same \nthing: Despite this body's passage of legislation creating a Homeland \nSecurity Department, they have yet to see any additional funding where \nthey need it most, close to home.\n  Most of the money that has been passed and sent to the States has not \nbeen addressed directly at beefing up local fire, police, and emergency \nresponders but for a specialized purpose of confronting the challenge \nof bioterrorism.\n  We have a declining economy, rising unemployment, terrible revenue \nproblems in our cities and States, and our answer has been to create a \nnew bureaucracy in Washington. I believe creating the new Homeland \nSecurity Department, without funding our first responders on the front \nlines, is like building a hospital without hiring doctors and \nnurses. We may have a good plan on paper, but we do not have the means \nto execute it.\n\n  The bill I am introducing will give our first responders $3.5 billion \nto give them the resources they need to do what they know they must \naccomplish. We should not be determining in Washington how they spend \nthis money. That should be done at the local level. What Buffalo needs \nmay be different from Rochester which is different from Syracuse or \nAlbany. It makes no sense to hold up this money any longer. We should \ndisperse the money appropriated and we should funnel it, State to local \ncommunities, and we should be looking at what our unmet needs are.\n  The Homeland Security Block Grant Act of 2003 will provide direct \nfunding to our communities and first responders. That is where the \nmoney should go.\n  I am delighted--my belief that this is the appropriate step to take \nis endorsed by the United States Conference of Mayors, the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association \nof Firefighters, the Major Cities Police Chiefs Association, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, and the Police Executive \nResearch Forum.\n  We did well today to deal with part of our problem when it comes to \nthe unemployed. I look forward to working with my colleagues to deal \nwith the other part, which are those who are chronically unemployed, to \ncome up with ways of helping them be able to make a transition or just \nhold their families together until the economy turns around. I also \nhope we will address homeland security in a way that gets the money \nwhere it needs to be, on the front lines of our cities, our towns, with \nour police and our firefighters and emergency responders. That would \nsend a strong signal that homeland security is not just a slogan, it is \na reality throughout America.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 88. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to suspend \nfuture reductions of income tax rates if the Social Security surpluses \nare used to fund such tax rate cuts; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have a whole list of every senator, \nand every candidate in last year's election, all coming out and saying \nwe won't touch Social Security. The President of the United States \npromised Congress in his first address to a Joint Session in February \n2001 that all Social Security surplus money will be budgeted for Social \nSecurity and Social Security only.\n  Now that everyone is talking about cutting taxes, I do not want to \nforget the promises made on Social Security. I want to hold everyone to \ntheir word, because that is what the American people who depend on \nSocial Security want as priority one. So, today, I am introducing a \nbill that says if the Treasury Secretary of the United States \ndetermines that if on October 1, 2003, there is a Federal on-budget \ndeficit, future reductions in income tax rates will be suspended. Once \nthe deficit no longer exists, the tax reductions can be put in place \nagain.\n  Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to do away with tax cuts, so long \nas you can pay for them. The purpose of this Act is simply to ensure \nthat no Social Security surpluses be used to pay for any further tax \ncuts. I want to make sure Social Security will be around when everyone \nretires.\n  So I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to pass this and make Social Security secure once and for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 90. A bill to extend certain budgetary enforcement to maintain \nfiscal accountability and responsibility; to the Committee on the \nBudget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to \nthe order of August 4, 1977, with instructions that if one Committee \nreports, the other Committee has thirty days to report or be \ndischarged.\n\n                Legislation to Extend Budget Enforcement\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, to introduce legislation to \nextend budgetary enforcement and to maintain fiscal accountability and \nresponsibility. this bill would ensure that the budget rules that \ngovern the congressional budget process do not expire on April 15 of \nthis year.\n  On October 16 of last year, Senator Gregg and I joined with Senators \nConrad and Domenici to offer an amendment to extend the budget process. \nThe Senate agreed to our amendment, Senate amendment No. 4886 to S. \nRes. 304, but with a modification that limited the extension to April \n15. Thus the Senate must act before April 15 on legislation like that \nwhich Senator Gregg and I propose today, or we will risk allowing the \nCongress to legislate in an environment nearly completely unconstrained \nby budget discipline.\n  The last 2 years have seen an unfortunate deterioration in the \nGovernment's ability to perform one of its most fundamental jobs--\nbalancing the Nation's fiscal books.\n  In January of 2001, the Congressional budget Office projected that in \nthe fiscal year that ended a few months ago on September 30, 2002, \nfiscal year 2002, the Government would run a unified budget surplus of \n$313 billion. In the actual event, however, the Government ran a \nunified budget deficit of $159 billion. That's a dramatic swing of $472 \nbillion--the disappearance of nearly half a trillion dollars--for that \none year alone.\n  And without counting Social Security, the Government ran a deficit of \nfully $318 billion in fiscal year 2002. Last year, the Government used \n$160 billion of income received by the Social Security trust fund to \nfund other Government programs.\n  For the 4 years before this past year, the Government ran unified \nbudget surpluses. The Government demonstrated that it can exercise \nfiscal restraint, if it chooses to.\n  But now, CBO projects that under current policies, unified budget \ndeficits will continue until 2006. And without counting Social \nSecurity, CBO projects that deficits will continue until 2011, when the \nhypothetical sunset of the tax cut brings us back to surplus again, \njust barely.\n  And using more realistic assumptions of not sunsetting tax cuts just \nenacted and letting appropriations keep pace with inflation, CBO \nestimated last month in response to a request from Senator Voinovich \nand me that deficits will continue at least until 2009.\n  We must stop running deficits because they cause the Government to \nuse the surpluses of the Social Security trust fund for other \ngovernment purposes, rather than to pay down the debt and help our \nnation prepare for the coming retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  And we must stop running deficits because every dollar that we add to \nthe Federal debt is another dollar that we are forcing our children to \npay back in higher taxes or fewer government benefits. When the \nGovernment in this generation chooses to spend on current\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\nconsumption and to accumulate debt for our children's generation to \npay, it does nothing less than rob our children of their own choices. \nWe make our choices to spend on our wants, but we saddle them with \ndebts that they must pay from their tax dollars and their hard work. \nAnd that is not right.\n  That is why I am joining today with my colleague from New Hampshire \nto introduce this bill to extend the budget process. We need a strong \nbudget process. We need to exert fiscal discipline.\n  Our bill would extend the budget process for 5 years, to October 1, \n2007.\n  Specifically, it would extend the requirement that entitlement and \ntax legislation be paid for, or trigger automatic cuts--called \n``sequesters''--in entitlement programs if they are not. We would \nprovide that these automatic cuts would not take place when the \nGovernment is running a surplus.\n  Similarly, our bill would extend the pay-as-you-go rule in Senate \nprocedures, as well, maintaining 60-vote points of order that enforce \nthe pay-as-you-go rule. As we did in our amendment at the close of the \nlast Congress, our bill would prevent savings achieved in \nreconciliation legislation from being used to offset new spending or \ntax cuts in other legislation. And to ensure that there is no loophole \nfor entitlements enacted in appropriations measures, our bill would \nprovide that entitlement expansions and tax cuts added to \nappropriations bills would be subjected to the pay-as-you-go rule, as \nwell.\n  Our bill would extend other Congressional Budget Act enforcement \nmechanisms, as well. All the provisions of the Congressional Budget Act \nthat now require 60 votes to waive would remain in effect in the Senate \nthrough October 1, 2007.\n  Finally, our bill would call for appropriations caps. It would state \nthe sense of the Senate that Congress and the President should \nnegotiate and agree on the appropriate discretionary spending levels \nand extend the statutory discretionary spending caps for 2003 and \nbeyond as early as possible in a manner consistent with fiscal \ndiscipline and accountability.\n  That is what our bill would do. It is a straightforward bill. it is \nthe least that we should do to ensure fiscal responsibility and sound \nbudgeting.\n  We must stop using Social Security surpluses to fund other Government \nprograms. We must stop piling up debt for our children to pay off. We \nmust continue the discipline of the budget process.\n  Together with my colleague from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, I will work \nto those ends. I urge my colleagues to join us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a section-\nby-section analysis of the bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Gregg-Feingold Budget Process Law Extension--Section-by-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n\n extending the pay-as-you-go requirement and automatic cuts in statute\n\n       Subsection 1(a)(1) extends the requirement that entitlement \n     and tax legislation be paid for, or cause automatic cuts \n     (called ``sequesters'') in entitlement programs.\n       Subsection 1(a)(2) provides that these automatic cuts would \n     not take place when the government is running a surplus.\n       Subsection 1(b) pushes back the expiration of the \n     mechanisms that cause the automatic cuts to October 1, 2007.\n\n\n                    extending budget act enforcement\n\n       Subsection 2(a) provides that the provisions of the \n     Congressional Budget Act that require 60 votes to waive \n     Budget Act points of order will remain in effect in the \n     Senate through October 1, 2007.\n\n\n            extending the pay-as-you-go rule in senate rules\n\n       Subsection 2(b) extends the pay-as-you-go rule in the \n     Senate.\n       Subsection 2(b)(1)(A) prevents savings achieved in \n     reconciliation legislation from being used to offset new \n     spending or tax cuts in other legislation.\n       Subsection 2(b)(1)(B) extends the existing pay-as-you-go \n     point of order (in section 207 of the fiscal year 2000 budget \n     resolution, H.

A bill to amend title 9, United States Code, to provide for \ngreater fairness in the arbitration process relating to livestock and \npoultry contracts; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Fair Contracts for Growers Act of \n2003 would simply give farmers a choice of venues to resolve disputes \nassociated with agricultural contracts. This legislation would not \nprohibit arbitration. Instead, it would ensure that the decision to \narbitrate is truly voluntary and that the rights and remedies provided \nfor by our judicial system are not waived under coercion.\n  I certainly recognize that arbitration has its benefits. In certain \ncases, it can be less costly than other dispute settlement means. In \ncertain other cases, it can remove some of the workload from our \nnation's overburdened court system. For these reasons, arbitration must \nbe an option--but it should be no more than an option.\n  Mandatory arbitration clauses are used in a growing number of \nagricultural contracts between individual farmers and processors. These \nprovisions limit a farmer's ability to resolve a dispute with the \ncompany, even when a violation of Federal and State law is suspected. \nRather than having the option to pursue a claim in court, disputes are \nrequired to go through an arbitration process that puts the farmer\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\nat a severe disadvantage. Such disputes often involve instances of \ndiscrimination, fraud, or negligent misrepresentation. Such disputes \noften involve instances of discrimination, fraud, or negligent \nmisrepresentation. The effect of these violations for the individual \nfarmer can be bankruptcy and financial ruin, and mandatory arbitration \nclauses make it impossible for farmers to seek redress in court.\n  When a farmer chooses arbitration, the farmer is waving rights to \naccess to the courts and the constitutional right to a jury trial. \nCertain standardized court rules are also waived, such as the right to \ndiscovery. This is important because the farmer must prove his case, \nthe company has the relevant information, and the farmer can not \nprevail unless he can compel disclosure of relevant information.\n  Examples of farmers' concerns that have gone unaddressed due to \nlimitations on dispute resolution options include; mis-weighed animals, \nbad feed cases, wrongful termination of contracts, diseased swine or \nbirds provided by the company, fraud and misrepresentation to induce a \ngrower to enter a contract, and retaliation by companies against \nfarmers who join producer associations.\n  During consideration of the Farm Bill, the Senate passed, by a vote \nof 64-31, the Feingold-Grassley amendment to give farmers a choice of \nvenues to resolve disputes associated with agricultural contracts.\n  During the last session of Congress, 66 Senators cosponsored S. 1140, \nthe Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 2001, \nto provide similar protection from mandatory arbitration clauses in \nfranchise agreements between auto dealers and manufacturers. This \nlegislation was enacted at the end of the last session. It is my hope \nthat we will be able to move this legislation in an equally efficient \nfashion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 91\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to treat certain hospital support organizations as \nqualified organizations for purposes of determining acquisition \nindebtedness; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \nextend to qualified teaching hospital support organizations the \nexisting debt-financed property rules that apply to tax-exempt \neducational organizations, pension funds, and investment consortia of \nqualified schools and funds.\n  In a June 21, 2002, article, the New York Times describes the \nfinancial straits that nonprofit hospitals now face. More and more \npeople in our weakened economy are seeking medical care from nonprofit \nhospitals. As a condition for Federal tax exemption, nonprofit \nhospitals must provide significant charitable services. Fees from other \npatients, especially in orthopedics, cardiology, and oncology, have in \nthe past, allowed nonprofit hospitals to cover the expense of caring \nfor the poor.\n  For-profit entrepreneurs, however, are better positioned to win away \nthese specialty care patients because they are not burdened by the same \nrequirement to provide indigent care. Consequently, investors and \nlenders have readily funded for-profit health care ventures. This \navailable capital allows profit-making companies to build the most up-\nto-date facilities in competing for the high-margin patient.\n  No doubt, for-profit operations do offer charity care, but their \nprofit orientation limits the amount they will provide. For example, \nresidency and fellowship programs to train our doctors are not \nprofitable, and, therefore, as the New York Times points out, nearly \nall the postgraduate medical education in the United States is provided \nby the nonprofit hospitals.\n  Of course, rising costs, such as for wages, supplies, and insurance, \nfurther compound the problem of nonprofit hospitals of stretching their \nincome to cover significant charitable services. In addition, many of \nthese nonprofit hospitals cannot raise or borrow the capital to \nmodernize. They cover operating costs by postponing hospital \nmaintenance and deferring the purchase of new technology, exacerbating \nan already bad situation. Eventually, as the New York Times article \ndocuments, more and more nonprofit hospitals will be forced to sell \ntheir facilities to for-profit enterprises.\n  The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu faces these very same \nfinancial difficulties. This 143-year-old nonprofit hospital system \nmaintains the largest private, nonprofit hospital in my state. It is a \nteaching hospital that provides residency training in a number of \nareas, and it treated 18,000 inpatients and 200,000 outpatients in \n2001. With the only accredited trauma center in Hawaii, it served over \n40,000 individuals without regard to their ability to pay. Medicaid and \nMedicare patients comprise nearly 60 percent of all its admissions.\n  In addition, the Center directly, or through its affiliates, operates \ncommunity clinics throughout the state, conducts professional training \nprograms, offers home health services, maintains a medical library, in \naddition to running a rural hospital on the rural, economically \ndepressed Island of Molokai. Like other nonprofit hospitals, the Center \nprovides significant charitable care, with nearly $23 million in \nuncompensated services in 2002.\n  Further, like other nonprofit hospitals, it has grave problems \nraising the funds needed to support all these uncompensated services \nwhile at the same time renovating and expanding its treatment \nfacilities. A recent report from the Healthcare Association of Hawaii \nestimated that the hospitals in my state, similar to hospitals \nnationwide, will face additional, major losses this year due to reduced \nreimbursements, higher costs, and greater demand for services.\n  In the past, Congress has allowed tax-exempt schools, colleges, \nuniversities, and pension funds to invest in real estate development so \nas to help meet these institutions' financial needs. Under the tax code \nthese organizations can incur debt to develop their real estate \nholdings without triggering the tax on unrelated business activities. \nOur nonprofit teaching hospitals have equal if not more pressing needs \nand should have the same opportunity. Unless Congress wishes to assume \nresponsibility for charitable health care, we must help our nonprofit \nhospitals, especially the teaching hospitals. My bill, which is \nidentical to an amendment that the Senate had previously\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\nadopted during the debate of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001, would allow support organizations for \nqualified nonprofit teaching hospital to engage in limited real estate \nactivities. These nonprofit hospitals would thereby be able to \nsupplement their investment income in order to meet the growing demand \nplaced on them for more community service.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the New York \nTimes article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 97\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Others \n     make do with outdated facilities and medical equipment, even \n     as for-profit hospitals invest in new technologies.\n       Critics of for-profit hospitals have long raised concerns \n     about how those institutions operate, pointing to instances \n     when they have acquired nonprofits and then cut the staff or \n     reduced the amount of charity care being provided. Other \n     experts say there are no significant differences in those \n     areas, and many for-profit companies say they intend to \n     provide the same care to patients but with better facilities.\n       Still, nonprofit hospitals, roughly 85 percent of all the \n     hospitals in the United States, provide nearly all the \n     postgraduate medical education, and if nonprofits continue to \n     struggle financially, many of them will be trained doctors in \n     out-of-date facilities--or selling facilities to for-profit \n     companies that may prove to have no interest in operating \n     residency and fellow-ship programs for doctors.\n       ``The needs are higher than they have been in the past,'' \n     said Bruce Vladeck, a professor of health policy at the Mount \n     Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Without access to \n     enough capital, many nonprofit hospitals, he fears, will \n     focus only on projects that can demonstrate a financial \n     return, like a new cardiology center. ``It's harder and \n     harder to finance esoteric stuff that isn't profitable,'' \n     he said, as well as basic services like pediatrics.\n       Higher labor costs, rising malpractice insurance premiums \n     and other expenses have all battered the nonprofits' \n     finances, even if some have benefited from the growing demand \n     for their services.\n       Since the beginning of 2000, Moody's Investors Service has \n     downgraded 121 nonprofit hospitals, affecting $34 billion of \n     bonds, and upgraded only 38 with $7 billion in bonds. About 9 \n     percent of Moody's nonprofit hospital portfolio is now \n     considered below investment grade, compared with 7 percent in \n     199, and most hospitals are not even rated.\n       ``We've got a majority of the nation's hospitals in serious \n     financial difficulty,'' said Carmela Coyle, a senior vice \n     president for the American Hospital Association.\n       A number of hospitals, unable to make the kind of \n     investments needed, are taking dramatic steps:\n       Catholic Health Initiatives, one of the nation's largest \n     nonprofit hospital chains, said in late May that it planned \n     to sell three hospitals in Albuquerque to Ardent Health \n     Services, a for-profit company that will invest at least $40 \n     million in them.\n       Memorial Hospital of Salem County agreed last November to \n     be bought by Community Health Systems, another for-profit \n     company. If the deal receives regulatory approval, Memorial \n     will become New Jersey's only for-profit acute-care hospital. \n     While Community Health has said it will invest $30 million in \n     the hospital, advocacy groups like New Jersey Citizen Action \n     have raised concerns about the change of the hospital's \n     status and its possible impact on charity care. Community \n     Health says it is committed to providing the same levels of \n     charity care as Memorial.\n       In Fairmont, W. Va., the operations of the community \n     hospital are being turned over to Triad Hospitals, a for-\n     profit company that has promised to spend $75 million to \n     build a new hospital.\n       The flurry of deals is beginning to echo the situation in \n     the mid-1990's, when for-profit chains gobbled up many \n     nonprofit hospitals. ``There are several signs that \n     acquisition activity is heating up in the hospital sector,'' \n     said Nancy Weaver, an analysts for Stephens Inc.\n       Many for-profit companies are flush with cash from growing \n     profits, a result of higher reimbursements, and surging stock \n     prices. These companies can readily find the money to invest, \n     sometimes by selling more stock or issuing corporate bonds.\n       ``There is no question that this does put the nonprofits at \n     a disadvantage,'' said Stuart H. Altman, a professor of \n     national health policy at Brandeis University.\n       HCA, for example, which was struggling to overcome huge \n     legal problems and overly aggressive expansion just a few \n     years ago, is planning $1.6 billion in capital spending this \n     year and plans to open a new hospital in Denver at a cost of \n     $147 million this year. Triad expects to make capital \n     investments worth roughly $350 million this year at 47 \n     hospitals in 16 states.\n       In some cases, for-profit hospitals are buying troubled \n     institutions that have been poorly managed for years. In \n     addition to much-needed capital, the new owners may bring in \n     stronger management and improved business practices.\n       In other instances, the prospects of better access to \n     capital is leading some nonprofit hospitals to seek out joint \n     ventures with for-profit companies.\n       ``We're seeing a lot of partnerships going on,'' said Ms. \n     Weaver, including for-profit companies providing capital to \n     build surgical centers in partnership with nonprofits. ``It's \n     an evolving model that is coming about because of the capital \n     issue.''\n       Triad says it is in discussions with numerous nonprofit \n     hospitals about a variety of arrangements, including joint \n     ventures. Many hospitals ``are looking for ways to raise \n     money or access capital to remain competitive,'' said James \n     D. Shelton, Triad's chairman and chief executive. ``We're \n     probably seeing more of this in the last year than in the \n     last five to six years.''\n       The alternatives to deals with for-profit companies are \n     few. In Louisiana, Slidell Memorial Hospital will be asking \n     voters to approve a new tax that would generate revenue to \n     pay off the $85 million it needs to borrow for renovations \n     and equipment, according to B. Clement, associate \n     administrator for business development at the hospital. \n     Slidell's board has consider selling the institution, but \n     would prefer it to remain nonprofit.\n       A few nonprofit hospitals with solid credit ratings are \n     still borrowing money with relative ease. Early this year, \n     for example, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center of New \n     York issued $450 million bonds. Memorial expects to use some \n     of the money to build new facilities.\n       But even the nonprofits with finances are being more \n     conservative in how they spend their money. ``We're very \n     conscious of how much debt we have on our books,'' Jerry \n     Judd, vice president for treasury services for Catholic \n     Health.\n       That hospital system plans to spend about $500 million on \n     capital improvements this year, but that may not cover the \n     necessary investment in its Albuquerque hospitals. * * * \n     Health Services, a for-profit company, expects to take over \n     those details some time later this year.\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\n       Some analysts say the tough market environment is providing \n     needed discipline. James C. * * *, a professor of health \n     policy administration at the University California at \n     Berkeley, said many nonprofit hospitals have expanded into \n     areas like managed or physician practices that proved to be \n     disastrous strategies decisions.\n       ``There have been too many adventures.'' he said.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 100. A bill to expand access to affordable health care and to \nstrengthen the health care safety net and make health care services \nmore available in rural and underserved areas; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, in introducing the Access to \nAffordable Health Care Act, a comprehensive, seven-point plan that \nbuilds on the strengths of our current public programs and private \nhealth care system to make quality, affordable health care available to \nmillions more Americans.\n  One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to \naffordable health care for all Americans. There are still far too many \nAmericans without health insurance or with woefully inadequate \ncoverage. More than 41 million Americans do not have health care \ncoverage, including more than 150,000 in Maine.\n  Health insurance matters. The simple fact is that people with health \ninsurance are healthier than those who are uninsured. People without \nhealth insurance are less likely to seek care when they need it, and to \nforgo services such as periodic check-ups and preventive services. As a \nconsequence, they are more likely to be hospitalized or require costly \nmedical attention for conditions that could have been prevented or \ntreated at a curable stage. Not only does this put the health of these \nindividuals at greater risk, but it also puts additional pressure on \nour hospitals and emergency rooms, many of them already financially \nchallenged.\n  Compared with people who have health coverage, uninsured adults are \nfour times, and uninsured children five times, more likely to use the \nemergency rooms. The costs of care for these individuals are often \nabsorbed by providers and passed on to the covered population through \nincreased fees and insurance premiums.\n  Maine is in the midst of a growing health insurance crisis, with \ninsurance premiums rising at alarming rates. Whether I am talking to a \nself-employed fisherman, the owner of a struggling small businesses, or \nthe human resource manager of a large company, the soaring costs of \nhealth insurance is a common concern.\n  Maine's employers are currently facing premium increases of as much \nas 40 percent a year. These premium increases have been particularly \nburdensome for small businesses, the backbone of the Maine economy. \nMany small business owners are caught in a cost squeeze: they know that \nif they pass on the premium increases to their employees, more of them \nwill decline coverage. Yet, these small businesses simply cannot afford \nto absorb double-digit increases of 20, 30 or 40 percent, year after \nyear.\n  The problem of rising costs is even more acute for individuals and \nfamilies who must purchase health insurance on their own. Monthly \ninsurance premiums often exceed a family's mortgage payment. Clearly, \nwe must do more to make health insurance more available and affordable.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act, which we are introducing \ntoday, it a seven-point plan that combines a variety of public and \nprivate approaches to make quality health care coverage more affordable \nand available. The legislation's seven goals are: One, to expand access \nto affordable health care for small businesses; two, to make health \ninsurance more affordable for individuals and families purchasing \ncoverage on their own; three, to strengthen the health care safety net \nfor those without coverage; four, to expand access to care in rural and \nunderserved areas; five, to increase access to affordable long-term \ncare; six, to promote healthier lifestyles; and seven, to provide more \nequitable Medicare payments to Maine providers to reduce the Medicare \nshortfall, which has forced hospitals, physicians and other providers \nto shift costs onto other payers in the form of higher charges, which, \nin turn drives up health care premiums.\n  Let me discuss each of these seven points in more detail.\n  First, our legislation will help small employers cope with rising \nhealth care costs.\n  Since most Americans get their health insurance through the \nworkplace, it is a common assumption that people without health \ninsurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that most uninsured \nAmericans are members of families with at least one full- time worker. \nAs many as 82 percent of Americans who do not have health insurance are \nin a family with a worker.\n\n  Uninsured working Americans are most often employees of small \nbusinesses. In fact, some 60 percent of uninsured workers are employed \nby small firms. Smaller firms generally face higher costs for health \ninsurance than larger firms, which makes them less likely to offer \ncoverage. Small businesses want to provide health insurance for their \nemployees, but the cost is often just too high.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help small employers \ncope with rising costs, by providing new tax credits for small \nbusinesses to help make health insurance more affordable. It will \nencourage those small businesses that do not currently offer health \ninsurance to do so and will help employers that do offer insurance to \ncontinue coverage for their employees even in the face of rising costs.\n  Our legislation will also help increase the clout of small businesses \nin negotiating with insurers. Premiums are generally higher for small \nbusinesses because they do not have as much purchasing power as large \ncompanies, which limits their ability to bargain for lower rates. They \nalso have higher administrative costs because they have fewer employees \namong whom to spread the fixed cost of a health benefits plan. \nMoreover, they are not as able to spread the risks of medical claims \nover as many employees as large firms.\n  Our legislation will help address these problems by authorizing \nfederal grants to provide start-up funding to States to assist them \nwith the planning, development, and operation of small employer \npurchasing cooperatives. These cooperatives will help to reduce health \ncare costs for small employers by allowing them to band together to \npurchase health insurance jointly. Group purchasing cooperatives have a \nnumber of advantages for small employers. For example, the increased \nnumbers of participants in the group help to lower the premium costs \nfor all. Moreover, they decrease the risk of adverse selection and \nspread the cost of health care over a broader group.\n  The legislation would also authorize a Small Business Administration \ngrant program for States, local governments and non-profit \norganizations to provide information about the benefits of health \ninsurance to small employers, including tax benefits, increased \nproductivity of employees, and decreased turnover. These grants would \nalso be used to make employers aware of their current rights under \nState and Federal laws. While costs are clearly a problem, many small \nemployers are not fully aware of the laws that have already been \nenacted by both States and the Federal Government to make health \ninsurance more affordable. For example, in one survey, 57 percent of \nsmall employers did not know that they could deduct 100 percent of \ntheir health insurance premiums as a business expense.\n  The legislation would also create a new program to encourage \ninnovation by awarding demonstration grants in up to 10 states \nconducting innovative coverage expansions, such as alternative group \npurchasing or pooling arrangements, individual or small group market \nreforms, or subsidies to employers or individuals purchasing coverage. \nThe States have long been laboratories for reform, and they should be \nencouraged in the development of innovative programs that can serve as \nmodels for the nation.\n  The Access of Affordable Health Care Act will also expand access to \naffordable health are for individuals and families.\n  One of the first bills I cosponsored as a Senator was legislation to \nestablish the State Children's Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP, which \nprovides insurance for the children of low-income\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\nparents who cannot afford health insurance, yet make too much money to \nqualify for Medicaid. This important program has provided affordable \nhealth insurance coverage to over four million children nationwide, \nincluding over 12,000 who are currently enrolled in the MaineCare \nprogram. Even so, nationwide, hundreds of thousands of qualified \nchildren have yet to be enrolled in this program, many because their \nparents simply don't know that they are eligible for the assistance.\n  Our legislation builds on the success of this program and gives \nStates a number of new tools to increase participation. For example, \nthe bill gives States the option of covering the parents of the \nchildren who are enrolled in programs like MaineCare. States could also \nuse funds provided through this program to help eligible \nworking families pay their share of an employer-based health insurance \nplan. In short, the legislation will help ensure that the entire family \nreceives the health care they need.\n\n  The legislation will also allow States to expand coverage to eligible \nlegal immigrants through Medicaid and SCHIP. Maine is one of a number \nof states that is currently covering eligible legal immigrant pregnant \nwomen and children under Medicaid using 100 percent state dollars. \nGiving States the option of covering these children and families under \nMedicaid will enable them to receive matching federal funds, and will \nhelp relieve the pressure that most a State budgets are currently \nexperiencing due to the economic downturn and rising Medicaid costs.\n  Many people with serious health problems encounter difficulties in \nfinding a company that is willing to insure them. To address this \nproblem, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act authorizes Federal \ngrants to provide money for states to create high-risk pools through \nwhich individuals who have pre-existing health conditions can obtain \naffordable health can obtain affordable health insurance.\n  And finally, to help make health coverage more affordable for low and \nmiddle-income individuals and families who do not have employer-\nprovided coverage and who are not eligible for the expanded public \nprograms, our legislation would provide an advanceable, refundable tax \ncredit of up to $1,000 for individuals earning up to $30,000 and up to \n$3,000 for families earning up to $60,000. This could provide coverage \nfor up to 6 million Americans who would otherwise be uninsured for one \nor more months, and will help many more working lower-income families \nwho currently purchase private health insurance with little or no \ngovernment help.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Insurance Act will also help to \nstrengthen our nation's health care safety net by doubling funding over \nfive years for the Consolidated Health Centers program, which includes \ncommunity, migrant, public housing and homeless health centers. These \ncenters, which operate in underserved rural and urban communities, \nprovide critical primaary care services to millions of Americans \nregardless of their ability to pay. About 20 percent of the patients \ntreated at Maine's community health centers have no insurance coverage \nand many more have inadequate coverage, so these centers are a critical \npart of our Nation's health care safety net.\n  The problem of access to affordable health care services is not \nlimited to the uninsured, but it also shared by many Americans living \nin rural and underserved areas where there is a serious shortage of \nhealth care providers. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act \ntherefore includes a number of provisions to strengthen the National \nHealth Service Corps, which supports doctors, dentists, and other \nclinicians who serve in rural and inner city areas.\n  For example, taxing students adversely affects their financial \nincentive to participate in the National Health Services Corps and \nprovide health care services in underserved communities. The tax bill \npassed by the last Congress provided a tax deduction for National \nHealth Service Corps scholarship recipients to deduct all tuition, fees \nand related educational expenses from their income taxes. The deduction \ndid not extend to loan repayment recipients however, so loan repayment \namounts are still taxed as income. Participants in the loan repayment \nprogram are actually given extra payment amounts to help them cover \ntheir tax liability which, frankly, is a little ridiculous. It makes \nmuch more sense to simply exempt them from taxation in the first place.\n  In addition, the legislation will allow National Health Service Corps \nparticipants to fulfill their commitment on a part-time basis. Current \nlaw requires all National Health Service Corps participants to serve \nfull time. Many rural communities, however, simply do not have enough \nvolume to support a full-time health care practitioner. Moreover, some \nsites may not need a particular type of provider, for example, a \ndentist, on a full-time basis. Some practitioners may also find part-\ntime service more attractive, which, in turn, could improve recruitment \nand retention. Our bill will therefore give the program additional \nflexibility to meet community needs.\n  Long-term care is the major catastrophic health care expense faced by \nolder Americans today, and these costs will only increase with the \naging of the baby boomers. Most Americans mistakenly believe that \nMedicare or their private health insurance policies will cover the \ncosts of long-term care should they develop a chronic illness or \ncognitive impairment like Alzheimer's Disease. Unfortunately, far too \nmany do not discover that they do not have coverage until they are \nconfronted with the difficult decision of placing a much-loved parent \nor spouse in long-term care and facing the shocking realization that \nthey will have to cover the costs themselves.\n\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will provide a tax credit \nfor long-term care expenses of up to $3,000 to provide some help to \nthose families struggling to provide long-term care to a loved one. It \nwill also encourage more Americans to plan for their future long-term \ncare needs by providing a tax deduction to help them purchase private \nlong-term care insurance.\n  Health insurance alone is not going to ensure good health. As noted \nauthor and physician Dr. Michael Crichton has observed, ``the future of \nmedicine lies not in treating illness, but preventing it.'' Many of our \nmost serious health problems are directly related to unhealthy \nbehaviors, smoking, lack of regular exercise and poor diet. These three \nmajor risk factors alone have made Maine the state with the fourth \nhighest death rate due to four largely preventable diseases: \ncardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes. \nThese four chronic diseases are responsible for 70 percent of the \nhealth care problems in Maine.\n  Our bill therefore contains a number of provisions designed to \npromote health lifestyles. An ever-expanding body of evidence shows \nthat these kinds of investments in health promotion and prevention \noffer returns not only in reduced health care bills, but in longer life \nand increased productivity. The legislation will provide grants to \nStates to assist small businesses wishing to establish ``worksite \nwellness'' programs for their employees. It would also authorize a \ngrant program to support new and existing ``community partnerships,'' \nsuch as the Healthy Community Coalition in Franklin County, to promote \nhealthy lifestyles among hospitals, employers, schools and community \norganizations. And, it would provide funds for States to establish or \nexpand comprehensive school health education, including, for example, \nphysical education programs that promote lifelong physical activity, \nhealthy food service selections and programs that promote a healthy and \nsafe school environment.\n  And finally, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act would promote \nequity in Medicare payments and help to ensure that the Medicare system \nrewards rather than punishes states like Maine that deliver high-\nquality, cost effective Medicare services to our elderly and disabled \ncitizens.\n  According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, Maine ranks third in the nation when it comes to the \nquality of care delivered to our Medicare beneficiaries. Yet we are \n11th from the bottom when it comes to per-beneficiary Medicare \nspending.\n  The fact is that Maine's Medicare dollars are being used to subsidize \nhigher reimbursements in other parts of the country. This simply is not \nfair. Medicare's reimbursement systems have historically tended to \nfavor urban\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\nareas and failed to take the special needs of rural states into \naccount. Ironically, Maine's low payment rates are also the result of \nits long history of providing high-quality, cost-effective care. In the \nearly 1980s, Maine's lower than average costs were used to justify \nlower payment rates. Since then, Medicare's payment policies have only \nserved to widen the gap between low and high-cost states.\n  As a consequence, Maine's hospitals, physicians and other providers \nhave experienced a serious Medicare shortfall, which has forced them to \nshift costs on to other payers in the form of higher charges. The \nMedicare shortfall is one of the reasons that Maine has among the \nhighest health insurance premiums in the nation. The provisions in the \nAccess to Affordable Health Care Act provide a complement to \nlegislation that I introduced in the last Congress with Senator Russ \nFeingold to promote greater fairness in Medicare payments to physicians \nand other health professionals by eliminating outdated geographic \nadjustment factors that discriminate against rural areas.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act outlines a blueprint for \nreform based upon principles upon which I believe a bipartisan majority \nin Congress could agree. The plan takes significant strides toward the \ngoal of universal health care coverage by bringing millions more \nAmericans into the insurance system, by strengthening the health care \nsafety net, and by addressing the inequities in the Medicare system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 101. A bill to authorize salary adjustments for Justices and \njudges of the United States for fiscal year 2003; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on this first day of the 108th Congress, I \nrise to address the serious matter of pay inequity in the Federal \njudiciary.\n  As things stand now, nearly every Federal employee will receive a \ncost of living adjustment during 2003, every employee, that is, except \nFederal judges. This is because of a legislative prescription that \nrequires Congress to authorize raises in the salaries of Federal \njudges. Although this COLA of roughly three percent may seem small and \ninconsequential, it makes a significant difference in light of the fact \nthat Federal judges earn far less than many, it not most, of their \ncounterparts in the private sector.\n  In this 2002 year-end report, Supreme Court Chief Justice William \nRehnquist highlighted his concern that salaries of Federal judges have \nnot kept pace with those of lawyers in private firms and in business. \nHe observed, ``Inadequate compensation seriously compromises the \njudicial independence fostered by life tenure. That low salaries might \nforce judges to return to the private sector rather than stay on the \nbench risks affecting judicial performance--instead of serving for \nlife, those judges would serve the terms their finances would allow, \nand they would worry about what awaits them when they return to the \nprivate sector.'' The Chief Justice lamented, ``Unless the 108th \nCongress acts, judges will not even receive the cost-of-living \nadjustment that nearly every other federal employee will receive during \n2003.'' He concluded by urging Congress and the President to ``take up \nthis issue early in the new year.''\n  Today, Senator Leahy and I are introducing a bill that will allow \nFederal judges to receive the COLA that other Federal employees are \nalready slated to receive this year. Although the larger issue of \nminimizing the gap between Federal judicial salaries and private sector \nsalaries still remains, this small step will resolve the salary \ninequity between Federal judges and other Federal employees. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Leahy and me in supporting this bipartisan \nmeasure.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a national rail passenger transportation \nsystem, reauthorize Amtrak, improve security and service on Amtrak, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nDefense Rail Act. This legislation is of vital importance to rail \ntransportation, it provides funding for railroad security, Amtrak, \ninvestment in both freight and passenger rail, and the development of \nhigh speed corridors throughout the country.\n  We have modified the security provision to reflect the creation of \nthe Department of Homeland Security, otherwise, this is the same bill \nthat the Commerce Committee reported last April by a vote of 20 to 3. I \nam joined by twenty five of my colleagues in introducing this \nbipartisan legislation. It is critical that the Senate take this bill \nup, and pass it, to ensure that our railroads are secure and we have \nadequate investment in both Amtrak and the development of high speed \nrail corridors to move us into the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Leahy, Ms.\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\n        Landrieu, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 105. A bill to repeal certain provisions of the Homeland Security \nAct (Public Law 107-296) relating to liability with respect to certain \nvaccines; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I rise to keep a promise I made in \nNovember. On this, the very first day of the 108th Congress, I am \nintroducing a bill that will remove the controversial vaccine component \nliability provisions from the Homeland Security bill.\n  I am joined by a long list of original cosponsors: Senators Daschle, \nBoxer, Levin, Leahy, Landrieu, Dodd, Dayton, Sarbanes, Dorgan, Durbin, \nLautenberg, and Feinstein. The Homeland Security bill, signed into law \nby President Bush in December, contains a provision that protects that \nfinancial security of pharmaceutical companies, not the homeland \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  The newly minted law contains a provision that expands the liability \nprojections that currently exist for vaccines to include other vaccine \ncomponents, such as vaccine preservates like Thimerosal. This provision \nwas included in the bill, at the last minute, with no debate and no \ncommittee hearings\n  Thimerosal; was the subject of several class action lawsuits based on \nincreasing research connecting this preservative, which contains \nmercury, to the rising incidence of autism in children.\n  Now that the vaccine component provision has been signed into law, \nall of these cases are expected to be dismissed. I urge my colleagues \nto join me and to remove the component provision from the law before it \nis too late. If these cases are dismissed with prejudice, then many \nfamilies will have nowhere to go to see justice for the harm their \nchildren suffered.\n  While the research is not conclusive on the connection between \nThimerosal and autism, was this narrowly written, unrelated provision \nin the Homeland Security law the way to respond to these concerns? \nDon't these children and their families merit the full protection under \nthe law? Certainly, they deserve their day in court. The Homeland \nSecurity provision includes vaccine components in the National Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Program, VICP, in which awards are limited to money \navailable through its special trust fund.\n  In 1988, Congress enacted the National Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram as a no-fault alternative to the tort system for resolving \nclaims resulting from adverse reactions to mandated childhood vaccines. \nThis Federal no fault system is designed to compensate individuals, or \nfamilies of individuals, who have been injured by childhood vaccines.\n  Damages are awarded out of a trust fund that is financed by excise \ntaxes of 75 cents per dose imposed on each vaccine covered under the \nprogram. There is a three year statute of limitations on bringing cases \nto the VICP. It is very likely that many families who joined the \nThimerosal class action suits, now under the treat of dismissal, have \nexceeded the three year time limit. Therefore, these families will have \nno recourse whatsoever.\n  An issue as serious as revising the Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram certainly merits due Congressional process. Amending this \nprogram by including a provision in the Homeland Security bill was \ninappropriate and this serious mistake should be corrected. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill and working to see it \nsigned into law as soon as possible. We must remove the vaccine \ncomponent liability provisions from the Homeland Security law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 105\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF CERTAIN VACCINE LIABILITY PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public \n     Law 107-296) is amended--\n       (1) by repealing sections 1714, 1715, 1716, and 1717; and\n       (2) in the table of contents, by striking the items \n     relating to sections 1714, 1715, 1716, and 1717.\n       (b) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect as \n     though enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 \n     (Public Law 107-296).\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak as a cosponsor of S. 105. \nThis bill repeals provisions of the Homeland Security Act offering \ncertain liability protections to pharmaceutical companies.\n  Mr. President, these provisions protect the manufacturers of a \nvaccine additive called thimerosal. This additive is a mercury-based \nvaccine component. It was used extensively in the past, until some \nparents began to claim that it caused autism in their children.\n  Those parents are now seeking their day in court against the \nmanufacturers of the drug. And the effect of the provisions in the \nHomeland Security Bill is to steer claims away from the courts and to \nthe Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\n  I do not know whether the scientific evidence will ultimately support \nthe parents' claim that their children's autism was caused by \nthimerosal. Right now, the research on the link between thimerosal and \nautism is inconclusive. But I do know that the manner in which these \nparticular provisions were added to the Homeland Security law is just \nplain wrong.\n  These provisions were at last-minute addition to the version of the \nHomeland Security Act that was passed in the House of Representatives. \nAnd like many things done at the last minute, without the benefit of \nthoughtful debate, these provisions were poorly conceived.\n  The Chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform, Dan Burton, \nexpressed his concern about these provisions in a letter to his \ncolleagues. He noted that the scientific debate about thimersoal was \nunresolved. And he argued that some parents of autistic children might \nlose all legal recourse if the provisions passed, because the Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Program has a narrow 3-year statute of limitations, \nand some parents may not have filed petitions on time. Chairman Burton \npleaded with his colleagues not to ``stampede'' into cutting of the \nlegal rights of these children ``without hearings and a full public \ndebate.''\n  Despite these pleadings, the provision remained in the House version \nof the Homeland Security Act.\n  When the bill came to the U.S. Senate for consideration, many \nMembers--on both sides of the aisle--expressed concern at the way that \nthe provisions had been introduced. They argued that the provisions did \nnot belong in the Homeland Security Act, and should be considered at \nsome later time.\n  Senators Daschle and Lieberman moved to strike these provisions from \nthe Homeland Security legislation. In the hours before the vote, it \nappeared that the thimerosal language would indeed be struck--until the \nRepublican leadership reportedly gave some Members assurances that the \nprovisions would be struck in the next Congress. Unfortunately, enough \nMembers accepted these assurances that the thimerosal provisions \nremained in the Homeland Security Act.\n  Once the bill was signed into law, and the public became increasingly \naware of what had happened, an interesting thing happened: No one would \nadmit authorship of the provisions. The House majority leader's office \ninitially claimed that it had been the White House's idea.\n  The White House said that it had nothing to do with it. And the \ncompanies that were the beneficiaries of the provisions said that they \nwere as surprised as anybody.\n  So the public was left to ask: Who did this?\n  This is not the way that Congress should legislate. What happened in \nthis instance is deplorable, and it undermines public confidence in our \nlegislative process.\n  If there are good, legitimate reasons to give liability protection to \nthe makers of thimerosal, let us have a thoughtful debate about them. \nLet us have hearings. I understand that the new majority leader, \nSenator Frist, has been working on legislation for some time in this \nregard. Senator Frist now controls the floor, and can ensure a prompt, \nthoughtful debate\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\nabout reforms to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\n  In the meantime, let us strip the thimerosal provisions currently in \nthe Homeland Security Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S.J. Res. 1. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to protect the rights of crime \nvictims; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Crime Victims' Rights \nAmendment.\n  The scales of justice are imbalanced. The U.S. Constitution, mainly \nthrough amendments, grants those accused of crime many constitutional \nrights, such as a speedy trial, a jury trial, counsel, the right \nagainst self-incrimination, the right to be free from unreasonable \nsearches and seizures, the right to subpoena witnesses, the right to \nconfront witnesses, and the right to due process under the law.\n  The Constitution, however, guarantees no rights to crime victims. For \nexample, victims have no right to be present, no right to be informed \nof hearings, no right to be heard at sentencing or at a parole hearing, \nno right to insist on reasonable conditions of release to protect the \nvictim, no right to restitution, no right to challenge unending delays \nin the disposition of their case, and no right to be told if they might \nbe in danger from release or escape of their attacker. This lack of \nrights for crime victims has caused many victims and their families to \nsuffer twice, once at the hands of the criminal, and again at the hands \nof a justice system that fails to protect them. The Crime Victims' \nRights Amendment would bring balance to the judicial system by giving \nvictims of violent crime the rights to be informed, present, and heard \nat critical stages throughout their ordeal.\n  The amendment gives victims of violent crime the right: to reasonable \nand timely notice of any public proceeding involving the crime and of \nany release or escape of the accused; not to be excluded from such \npublic proceeding; reasonably to be heard at public release, plea, \nsentencing, reprieve, and pardon proceedings; and to adjudicative \ndecisions that duly consider the victim's safety, interest in avoiding \nunreasonable delay, and just and timely claims to restitution from the \noffender.\n  These rights have been at the core of the amendment since 1996, when \nSenator Feinstein and I first introduced the Crime Victims' Rights \nAmendment. The amendment is the product of extended discussions with \nthe White House, the Department of Justice, Representative Steve \nChabot, Senators Hatch and Biden, law enforcement officials, major \nvictims' rights groups, and such diverse scholars as Professor Larry \nTribe and then-Professor Paul Cassell. The current version is similar \nto the version in the 107th Congress. As President Bush stated when \nannouncing his support for the language of the amendment, the amendment \nwas ``written with care, and strikes a proper balance.'' http://\nwww.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/04/20020416-1.html. One of the \nnation's leading constitutional scholars, Harvard Law Professor \nLaurence Tribe, who is on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum \nfrom President Bush, concurred. Professor Tribe praised the Amendment's \n``brevity and clarity'' and commented, ``That you achieved such \nconciseness while fully protecting defendants' rights and accommodating \nthe legitimate concerns that have been voiced about prosecutorial power \nand presidential authority is no mean feat. . . . I think you have done \na splendid job at distilling the prior versions of the Victims' Rights \nAmendment into a form that would be worthy of a constitutional \namendment.'' Letter of April 15, 2002.\n  If reform is to be meaningful, it must be in the U.S. Constitution. \nSince 1982, when the need for a constitutional amendment was first \nrecognized by President Reagan's Task Force on Victims of Crime, 32 \nstates have passed similar measures, by an average popular vote of \nabout 80 percent. These state measures have helped protect crime \nvictims; but they are inadequate for two reasons. First, each amendment \nis different, and not all States have provided protection to victims; a \nFederal amendment would establish a basic floor of crime victims' \nrights for all Americans, just as the federal Constitution provides for \nthe accused. Second, statutory and state constitutional provisions are \nalways subservient to the federal constitution; so, in cases of \nconflict, the defendants' rights, which are already in the U.S. \nConstitution, will always prevail. The Crime Victims' Rights Amendment \nwould correct this imbalance.\n  It is important to note that the number one recommendation in a 400 \npage report by the Department of Justice on victims rights and services \nwas that ``the U.S. Constitution should be amended to guarantee \nfundamental rights for victims of crime.'' U.S. Department of Justice, \nOffice for Victims of Crime, New Directions from the Field: Victims' \nRights and Services for the 21st Century 9, 1998. The report continued: \n``A victims' rights constitutional amendment is the only legal measure \nstrong enough to rectify the current inconsistencies in victims' rights \nlaws that vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction on the \nstate and federal levels.'' Id. at 10. Further: ``Granting victims of \ncrime the ability to participate in the justice system is exactly the \ntype of participatory right the Constitution is designed to protect and \nhas been amended to permanently ensure. Such rights include the right \nto vote on an equal basis and the right to be heard when the government \ndeprives one of life, liberty, or property.'' Id.\n  Some may say, ``I'm all for victims' rights but they don't need to be \nin the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution is too hard to change.'' But \nthe history of our country teaches us that constitutional protections \nare needed to protect the basic rights of the people. Our criminal \njustice system needs the kind of fundamental reform that can only be \naccomplished through changes in our fundamental law, the Constitution. \nAttempts to establish rights by Federal or State statute, or even State \nconstitutional amendment, have proven inadequate, after more than \ntwenty years of trying. Then-Attorney General Reno has confirmed the \npoint, noting that, ``unless the Constitution is amended to ensure \nbasic rights to crime victims, we will never correct the existing \nimbalance in this country between defendants' constitutional rights and \nthe haphazard patchwork of victims' rights.'' Senate Judiciary \nCommittee Hearing, April 16, 1997, statement of Attorney General Janet \nReno, at 41.\n\n  On behalf of the Department of Justice, Ray Fisher, then Associate \nAttorney General, now a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, \ntestified that ``the state legislative route to change has proven less \nthan adequate in according victims their rights. Rather than form a \nminimum baseline of protections, the state provisions have produced a \nhodgepodge of rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. \nRights that are guaranteed by the Constitution will receive greater \nrecognition and respect, and will provide a national baseline.'' Senate \nJudiciary Committee Hearing, April 28, 1998, statement of Associate \nAttorney General Ray Fisher, at 9.\n  A number of legal commentators have reached similar conclusions. \nHarvard Professor of Law Laurence Tribe has explained that the existing \nstatutes and state amendments ``are likely, as experience to date sadly \nshows, to provide too little real protection whenever they come into \nconflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, sheer \ninertia, or any mention of an accused's rights regardless of whether \nthose rights are genuinely threatened.'' Senate Judiciary Committee \nHearing, March 24, 1999, statement of Laurence Tribe, at 6. He also \nstated, ``there appears to be a considerable body of evidence showing \nthat, even where statutory or regulatory or judge-made rules exist to \nprotect the participatory rights of victims, such rights often tend to \nbe honored in the breach . . . .'' Id. at 7. Indeed, according to a \nreport by the National Institute of Justice, even in states that gave \n``strong protection'' to victims rights, fewer than 60 percent of the \nvictims were notified of the sentencing hearing and fewer than 40 \npercent were notified of the pretrial release of the defendant. \nNational Institute of Justice, Research\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\nin Brief, ``The Rights of Crime Victims--Does Legal Protection Make a \nDifference?'' at 4 (Dec. 1998).\n  If crime victims are to have meaningful rights, those rights must be \nin the U.S. Constitution. As President Bush has stated, ``The \nprotection of victims' rights is one of those rare instances when \namending the Constitution is the right thing to do. And . . . the Crime \nVictims' Rights Amendment is the right way to do it.'' http://\nwww.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/04/20020416-1.html.\n  The Crime Victims' Rights Amendment has strong bipartisan support in \nthe House and Senate. Senator Feinstein is the lead Democratic sponsor. \nI would like to thank her for her tireless efforts on behalf of crime \nvictims and for her hard and very valuable work on the language. Also, \na bipartisan group of 39 State Attorneys General has signed a letter \nexpressing their ``strong and unequivocal support'' for an amendment. \nIn January 1997, the National Governors' Association voted in favor of \nan amendment. In 1996 and 2000, both the Republican and Democratic \nParty Platforms called for a crime victims' rights amendment. \nAdditionally, the amendment is supported by the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police and major national victims' rights \ngroups, including Parents of Murdered Children, the National \nOrganization for Victim Assistance, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, \nMADD, the Maryland Crime Victims' Resource Center, Arizona Voice for \nCrime Victims, Crime Victims United, and, Memory of Victims Everywhere.\n  The amendment has received strong support around the country. As I \nmentioned earlier, 32 states have passed similar measures--by an \naverage popular vote of almost 80 percent.\n  Since we first introduced the amendment in 1996, Nila Lynn has been \nmurdered in my home State of Arizona. Nila and her husband Duane were \nthree months short of their 50th wedding anniversary. Nila was shot in \nthe back by Richard Glassel and died in Duane's arms. Despite the fact \nthat Duane had a State constitutional right to be heard at Glassel's \nsentencing and despite the fact that Glassel was afforded the right to \nmake a sentencing recommendation to the jury, Duane's voice was \nsilenced because he had no U.S. Constitutional right to make a similar \nsentencing recommendation.\n  For far too long, the criminal justice system has ignored crime \nvictims who deserve to be treated with fairness, dignity, and respect. \nOur criminal justice system will never be truly just as long as \ncriminals have rights and victims have none.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 1\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1.

A victim of violent crime shall have the right \n     to reasonable and timely notice of any public proceeding \n     involving the crime and of any release or escape of the \n     accused; the rights not to be excluded from such public \n     proceeding and reasonably to be heard at public release, \n     plea, sentencing, reprieve, and pardon proceedings; and the \n     right to adjudicative decisions that duly consider the \n     victim's safety, interest in avoiding unreasonable delay, and \n     just and timely claims to restitution from the offender. \n     These rights shall not be restricted except when and to the \n     degree dictated by a substantial interest in public safety or \n     the administration of criminal justice, or by compelling \n     necessity.\n       ``Section 3.

Only the victim or the victim's lawful \n     representative may assert the rights established by this \n     article, and no person accused of the crime may obtain any \n     form of relief hereunder.\n       ``Section 4. Congress shall have power to enforce by \n     appropriate legislation the provisions of this article. \n     Nothing in this article shall affect the President's \n     authority to grant reprieves or pardons.\n       ``Section 5. This article shall be inoperative unless it \n     has been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the \n     legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within 7 \n     years from the date of its submission to the States by the \n     Congress. This article shall take effect on the 180th day \n     after the date of its ratification.''.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join my good friend, Senator Kyl, in \nintroducing S.J. Res, 1, the Victims' Rights Amendment.\n  Two years ago, the Senate debated a proposed constitutional amendment \ndrafted by Senator Kyl and me to protect the rights of victims of \nviolent crime. The amendment had been reported out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on a strong bipartisan vote of 12 to 5. After 82 \nSenators voted to proceed to consideration of the amendment, there was \na vigorous debate on the floor of the Senate. Some Senators raised \nconcerns about the amendment, saying that it was too long or that it \nread too much like a statute.\n  Ultimately, in the face of a threatened filibuster, Senator Kyl and I \ndecided to withdraw the amendment. We then hunkered down with \nconstitutional experts, such as Professor Larry Tribe of Harvard Law \nSchool, to see if we could revise the amendment to meet Senators' \nconcerns. We also worked with constitutional experts at the Department \nof Justice and the White House, and we came up with a new and improved \ndraft of the amendment. This new amendment provides many of the same \nrights as the old amendment.\n  Specifically, the amendment would give crime victims the rights to be \nnotified, present, and heard at critical stages throughout their case. \nIt would ensure that their views are considered and they are treated \nfairly. It would ensure that their interest in a speedy resolution of \nthe case, safety, and claims for restitution are not ignored. And it \nwould do so in a way that would not abridge the rights of defendants or \noffenders, or otherwise disrupt the delicate balance of our \nConstitution.\n  We had a hearing in the Constitution Subcommittee. Unfortunately, the \nJudiciary Committee did not act on the amendment. There are many \nreasons why we need a constitutional amendment.\n  First, a constitutional amendment will balance the scales of justice. \nCurrently, while criminal defendants have almost two dozen separate \nconstitutional rights, fifteen of them provided by amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution, there is not a single word in the Constitution about \ncrime victims. These rights trump the statutory and State \nconstitutional rights of crime victims because the U.S. Constitution is \nthe supreme law of the land. To level the playing field, crime victims \nneed rights in the U.S. Constitution. In the event of a conflict \nbetween a victim's and a defendant's rights, the court will be able to \nbalance those rights and determine which party has the most compelling \nargument.\n  Second, a constitutional amendment will fix the patchwork of victims' \nrights laws. Eighteen States lack state constitutional victim's rights \namendment, and the 32 existing State victims' rights amendments differ \nfrom each other. Also, virtually every State has statutory protections \nfor victims, but these vary considerably across the country. Only a \nFederal constitutional amendment can ensure a uniform national floor \nfor victims' rights.\n  Third, a constitutional amendment will restore rights that existed \nwhen the Constitution was written. It is a little known fact that at \nthe time the Constitution was drafted, it was standard practice for \nvictims, not public prosecutors, to prosecute criminal cases. Because \nvictims were parties to most criminal cases, they enjoyed the basic \nrights to notice, to be present, and be heard. Hence, it is not \nsurprising that the Constitution does not mention victims.\n  Now, of course, it is extremely rare for a victim to undertake a \ncriminal prosecution. Thus, victims have none of the basic procedural \nrights they used to enjoy. Victims should receive some of the modest \nnotice and participation rights they enjoyed at the time that the \nConstitution was drafted.\n  Fourth, a constitutional amendment is necessary because mere State \nlaw is insufficient. State victims' rights laws lacking the force of \nFederal constitutional law are often given short shrift. A Justice \nDepartment-sponsored study and other studies have found that, even\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\nin States with strong legal protections for victims' rights, many \nvictims are denied those rights. The studies have also found that \nstatutes are insufficient to guarantee victims' rights. Only a Federal \nconstitutional amendment can ensure that crime victims receive the \nrights they are due.\n  Fifth, a constitutional amendment is necessary because Federal \nstatutory law is insufficient. The leading statutory alternative to the \nVictims' Rights Amendment would only directly cover certain violent \ncrimes prosecuted in Federal court. Thus, it would slight more than 99 \npercent of victims of violent crime. We should acknowledge that Federal \nstatutes have been tried and found wanting. It is time for us to amend \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  The Oklahoma City bombing case offers another reason why we need a \nconstitutional amendment. This case shows how even the strongest \nFederal statute is too weak to protect victims in the face of a \ndefendant's constitutional rights. In that case, two Federal victims' \nrights statutes were not enough to give victims of the bombing a clear \nright to watch the trial and still testify at the sentencing, even \nthough one of the statutes was passed with the specific purpose of \nallowing the victims to do just that.\n  Let me quote from the first of these statutes: the Victims of Crime \nBill of Rights, passed in 1990. That Bill of Rights provides in part \nthat:\n  A crime victim has the following rights: The right to be present at \nall public court proceedings related to the offense, unless that court \ndetermines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if \nthe victim heard other testimony at trial.\n  That statute further states that Federal Government officers and \nemployees ``engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of \ncrime shall make their best efforts to see that victims of crime are \naccorded the[se] rights.''\n  The law also provides that ``[t]his section does not create a cause \nof action or defense in favor of any person arising out of the failure \nto accord to a victim the[se] rights.''\n  In spite of the law, the judge in the Oklahoma City bombing case \nruled, without any request from Timothy McVeigh's attorneys, that no \nvictim who saw any portion of the case could testify about the \nbombing's impact at a possible sentencing hearing:\n  The Justice Department asked the judge to exempt victims who would \nnot be ``factual witnesses at trial'' but who might testify at a \nsentencing hearing about the impact of the bombing on their lives. The \njudge denied the motion. The victims were then given until the \nlunchbreak to decide whether to watch the proceedings or remain \neligible to testify at a sentencing hearing. In the hour that they had, \nsome of the victims opted to watch the proceedings; other decided to \nleave to remain eligible to testify at the sentencing hearing.\n  Subsequently, the Justice Department asked the court to reconsider \nits order in light of the 1990 Victims' Bill of Rights. Bombing victims \nthen filed their own motion to raise their rights under the Victims' \nBill of Rights. The court denied both motions. With regard to the \nvictims' motion, the judge held that the victims lacked standing. The \njudge stated that the victims would not be able to separate the \n``experience of trial'' from the ``experience of loss from the conduct \nin question.'' The judge also alluded to concerns about the defendants' \nconstitutional rights, the common law, and rules of evidence.\n  The victims and DOJ separately appealed to the Court of Appeals for \nthe Tenth Circuit. That court ruled that the victims lacked standing \nunder Article III of the Constitution because they had no ``legally \nprotected interest'' to be present at trial and thus had suffered no \n``injury in fact'' from their exclusion. The victims and DOJ then asked \nthe entire Tenth Circuit to review that decision. Forty-nine members of \nCongress, all six attorneys general in the Tenth Circuit, and many of \nthe leading crime victims' organizations filed briefs in support of the \nvictims. All to no avail.\n\n  The Victims' Clarification Act of 1997 when then introduced in \nCongress. That act provided that watching a trial does not constitute \ngrounds for denying victims the chance to provide an impact statement. \nThis bill passed the House 414 to 13 and the Senate by unanimous \nconsent. Two days later, President Clinton signed into law, explaining \nthat ``when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the center of \nthe criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in.''\n  The victims then filed a motion asserting a right to attend the trial \nunder the new law. However, the judge declined to apply the law as \nwritten. He concluded that ``any motions raising constitutional \nquestions about this legislation would be premature and would present \nquestions issues that are not now ripe for decision.'' Moreover, he \nheld that it could address issues of possible prejudicial impact from \nattending the trial by interviewing the witnesses after the trial.\n  The judge also refused to grant the victims a hearing on the \napplication of the new law, concluding that his ruling rendered their \nrequest ``moot.'' The victims then faced a painful decision: watch the \ntrial or preserve their right to testify at the sentencing hearing. \nMany victims gave up their right to watch the trial as a result.\n  A constitutional amendment would help ensure that victims of a \ndomestic terrorist attack such as the Oklahoma City bombing have \nstanding and that their arguments for a right to be present are not \ndismissed as ``unripe.'' A constitutional amendment would give victims \nof violent crime an unambiguous right to watch a trial and still \ntestify at sentencing.\n  There is strong and wide support for a constitutional amendment. I am \npleased that President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft have endorsed \nthe amendment. As the President put it last year, ``The Feinstein-Kyl \namendment was written with care, and strikes a proper balance. Our \nlegal system properly protects the rights of the accused in the \nConstitution, but it does not provide similar protection for the rights \nof victims, and that must change. The protection of victims' rights is \none of those rare instances when amending the Constitution is the right \nthing to do. And the Feinstein-Kyl crime victims' rights amendment is \nthe right way to do it.''\n  I greatly appreciate their support. And I am also pleased that both \nformer President Clinton and former Vice President Gore have all \nexpressed support for a constitutional amendment on victim's right. \nMoreover, in the last Congress, the Victims' Rights Amendment was \ncosponsored by a bipartisan group of 28 Senators. I have spoken to many \nof my colleagues about the amendment we introduce today and I am \nhopeful that it will receive even more support in this Congress. In \naddition I would vote the following:\n  Both the Democratic and Republican Party Platforms call for a \nvictims' rights amendment. Governors in 49 out of 50 States have called \nfor an amendment. Four former U.S. Attorneys General, including \nAttorney General Reno, support an amendment. Attorney General Ashcroft \nsupport an amendment. Forty State attorneys general support an \namendment.\n  Major national victims' rights groups--including Parents of Murdered \nChildren, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, MADD, and the National \nOrganization for Victim Assistance, support the amendment. Many law \nenforcement groups, including the International Association of Chiefs \nof Police, the Nation Troops' Coalition, the International Union of \nPolice Associations AFL-CIO, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, and the California District Attorneys Association support \nan amendment. Constitutional scholars, such as Harvard Law School \nProfessor Larry Tribe, support an amendment.\n  The amendment has received strong support around the country. Thirty-\ntwo States have passed similar measures--by an average popular vote of \nalmost 80 percent.\n  I am delighted to join my good friend Senator Jon Kyl in sponsoring \nthe victims' rights amendment, and I look forward to its adoption by \nthis Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter dated April 15, 2002 \nfrom Harvard Law School Professor Larry Tribe be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\n                                Harvard University Law School,\n\n                                    Cambridge, MA, April 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Feinstein and Kyl: I think that you have done \n     a splendid job at distilling the prior versions of the \n     Victims' Rights Amendment into a form that would be worthy of \n     a constitutional amendment--an amendment to our most \n     fundamental legal charter, which I agree ought never to be \n     altered lightly. I will not repeat here the many reasons I \n     have set forth in the past for believing that, despite the \n     skepticism I have detected in some quarters both on the left \n     and on the right, the time is past due for recognizing that \n     the victims of violent crime, as well as those closest to \n     victims who have succumbed to such violence, have a \n     fundamental right to be considered, and heard when \n     appropriate, in decisions and proceedings that profoundly \n     affect their lives.\n       How best to protect that right without compromising either \n     the fundamental rights of the accused or the important \n     prerogatives of the prosecution is not always a simple \n     matter, but I think your final working draft of April 13, \n     2002, resolves that problem in a thoughtful and sensitive \n     way, improving in a number of respects on the earlier drafts \n     that I have seen. Among other things, the greater brevity and \n     clarity of this version makes it more fitting for inclusion \n     in our basic law. That you achieved such conciseness while \n     fully protecting defendants' rights and accommodating the \n     legitimate concerns that have been voiced about prosecutorial \n     power and presidential authority is no mean feat. I happily \n     congratulate you both on attaining it.\n       A case argued two weeks ago in the Supreme Judicial Court \n     of Massachusetts, in which a woman was brutally raped a \n     decade and a half ago but in which the man who was convicted \n     and sentenced to a long prison term has yet to serve a single \n     day of that sentence, helps make the point that the legal \n     system does not do well by victims even in the many states \n     that, on paper, are committed to the protection of victims' \n     rights. Despite the Massachusetts Victims' Bill of Rights, \n     solemnly enacted by the legislature to include an explicit \n     right on the part of the victim to a ``prompt disposition'' \n     of the case in which he or she was victimized, the \n     Massachusetts Attorney General, to who has yet to take the \n     simple step of seeking the incarceration of the convicted \n     criminal pending his on-again, off-again motion for a new \n     trial--a motion that has not been ruled on during the 15 \n     years that this convicted rapist has been on the streets--has \n     taken the position that the victim of the rape does not even \n     have legal standing to appear in the courts of this state, \n     through counsel, to challenge the state's astonishing failure \n     to put her rapist in prison to begin serving the term to \n     which he was sentenced so long ago.\n       If this remarkable failure of justice represented a wild \n     aberration, perpetrated by a state that had not incorporated \n     the rights of victims into its laws, then it would prove \n     little, standing alone, about the need to write into the \n     United States Constitution a national commitment to the \n     rights of victims. Sadly, however, the failure of justice of \n     which I write here is far from aberrant. It represents but \n     the visible tip of an enormous iceberg of indifference toward \n     those whose rights ought finally to be given formal federal \n     recognition.\n       I am grateful to you for fighting this fight. I only hope \n     that many others can soon be stirred to join you in a cause \n     that deserves the most widespread bipartisan support.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Laurence H. Tribe.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S.J. Res. 2. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to require a balanced budget and \nprotect Social Security surpluses; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a Balanced Budget \nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States. When we were in \ndeficit and when we were in surplus, I have always said, if we could \nadopt one fundamental reform to the way the Federal Government does \nbusiness, this is it. The fiscal events of the last couple years have \nagain demonstrated the need for this long-term, fundamental, permanent \nreform.\n  For many Americans, one of the signs of our deep respect for the \nConstitution is our acknowledgment that, in exceptional cases, a \nproblem rises to such a level that it can be adequately addressed only \nin the Constitution, by way of a Constitutional amendment.\n  For four years in a row, a modern record, the first time since the \n1920s, Congress balanced the Federal budget. The first Republican \nCongresses in 40 years made balancing the budget their top priority, \nand did what was necessary, working on a bipartisan basis, to run the \nkind of surpluses we need to pay down the national debt and safeguard \nthe future of Social Security.\n  Then events intervened.\n  A return to budget deficits was caused by an economic recession and a \nwar begun by a terrorist attack. Even before taking office, President \nBush correctly foresaw the coming recession and prescribed the right \nmedicine, the bipartisan Tax Relief Act of 2001, that has bolstered the \neconomy and prevented a far worse recession.\n  Sadly, at least on the budget front, the Senate did not rise to the \nchallenge. Last year, many of us were deeply disappointed by the \nSenate's failure to pass a budget resolution for the first time in the \nhistory of the Budget Act. That failure only made the need for fiscal \ndiscipline all the more evident, as we saw a return to deepening \ndeficit spending.\n  The return to deficit spending can and should be a temporary \nphenomenon. We will rebound from the recent economic slowdown. And we \nmust do whatever it takes to win the war, that's a matter of survival \nand of protecting the safety and security of the American people. \nBeyond that, we must keep all other Federal spending under control, so \nthat we return, as soon as possible, to balancing the budget.\n  In other words, the return to deficit spending will be a temporary \nproblem only if we make a permanent commitment to the moral imperative \nof fiscal responsibility.\n  We always did, and always will, need a Balanced Budget Amendment to \nour Constitution.\n  Even in the heady days of budget surpluses, I always maintained the \nonly way to guarantee that the Federal Government would stay fiscally \nresponsible was to add a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution.\n  Before we balanced the budget in 1998, the government was deficit \nspending for 28 years in a row and for 59 out of 67 years. The basic \nlaw of politics, to just say ``yes'', was not repealed in 1998, but \nonly restrained some, when we came together and briefly faced up to the \ngrave threat to the future posed by decades of debt.\n  Now, the government is back to borrowing. And for some, a return to \ndeficit spending seems to have been liberating, as the demands for new \nspending only seem to be multiplying again.\n  That is why, today, I am again introducing a Balanced Budget \nAmendment to the Constitution and calling upon my colleagues to send it \nto the states for ratification. The amendment I introduce today is the \nsame one I cosponsored last year, which would not count the Social \nSecurity surplus in its calculation of a balanced budget. Those annual \nsurpluses would be set aside exclusively to meet the future needs of \nSocial Security beneficiaries.\n  It's a new day, a new year, and a new Senate. We have the opportunity \nof a fresh start and, hopefully, the wisdom of experience. On this \nfirst day of the 108th Congress, with the first piece of legislation I \nam introducing this year, I call on the Senate to safeguard the future, \nby considering and passing a Balanced Budget Amendment to the \nConstitution, a Bill of Economic Rights for our future and our \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/07/senate-section/article/S85-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S85-S86]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 1--INFORMING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT \n                  A QUORUM OF EACH HOUSE IS ASSEMBLED\n\n  Mr. FRIST submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                               S.
