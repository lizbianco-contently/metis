Madam President, I wanted to say a couple of words today \nwith regard to an article that appeared on the front page of the New \nYork Times entitled ``Ex-Inspector Says C.I.A. Missed Iraqi Arms \nChaos.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 25, 2004]\n\n            Ex-Inspector Says C.I.A. Missed Iraqi Arms Chaos\n\n                            (By James Risen)\n\n       Washington, Jan. 25.--Americans intelligence agencies \n     failed to detect that Iraq's unconventional weapons programs \n     were in a state of disarray in recent years under the \n     increasingly erratic leadership of Saddam Hussein, the \n     C.I.A.'s former chief weapons inspector said in an interview \n     late Saturday.\n       The inspector, David A. Kay, who led the government's \n     efforts to find evidence of Iraq's illicit weapons programs \n     until he resigned on Friday, said the C.I.A. and other \n     intelligence agencies did not realize that Iraqi scientists \n     had presented ambitious but fanciful weapons programs to Mr. \n     Hussein and had then used the money for other purposes.\n       Dr. Kay also reported that Iraq attempted to revive its \n     efforts to develop nuclear weapons in 2000 and 2001, but \n     never got as far toward making a bomb as Iran and Libya did.\n       He said Baghdad was actively working to produce a \n     biological weapon using the poison ricin until the American \n     invasion last March. But in general, Dr. Kay said, the C.I.A. \n     and other agencies failed to recognize that Iraq had all but \n     abandoned its efforts to produce large quantities of chemical \n     or biological weapons after the first Persian Gulf war, in \n     1991.\n       From interviews with Iraqi scientists and other sources, he \n     said, his team learned that sometime around 1997 and 1998, \n     Iraq plunged into what he called a ``vortex of corruption,'' \n     when government activities began to spin out of control \n     because an increasingly isolated and fantasy-riven Saddam \n     Hussein had insisted on personally authorizing major projects \n     without input from others.\n       After the onset of this ``dark ages,'' Dr. Kay said, Iraqi \n     scientists realized they could go directly to Mr. Hussein and \n     present fanciful plans for weapons programs, and receive \n     approval and large amounts of money. Whatever was left of an \n     effective weapons capability, he said, was largely subsumed \n     into corrupt money-raising schemes by scientists skilled in \n     the arts of lying and surviving in a fevered police state.\n       ``The whole thing shifted from directed programs to a \n     corrupted process,'' Dr. Kay said. ``The regime was no longer \n     in control; it was like a death spiral. Saddam was self-\n     directing projects that were not vetted by anyone else. The \n     scientists were able to fake programs.''\n       In interviews after he was captured. Tariq Aziz, the former \n     deputy prime minister, told Dr. Kay that Mr. Hussein had \n     become increasingly divorced from reality during the last two \n     years of his rule. Mr. Hussein would send Mr. Aziz \n     manuscripts of novels he was writing, even as the American-\n     led coalition was gearing up for war, Dr. Kay said.\n       Dr. Kay said the fundamental errors in prewar intelligence \n     assessments were so grave that he would recommend that the \n     Central Intelligence Agency and other organizations overhaul \n     their intelligence collection and analytical efforts.\n       Dr. Kay said analysts had come to him, ``almost in tears, \n     saying they felt so badly that we weren't finding what they \n     had thought we were going to find--I have had analysts \n     apologizing for reaching the conclusions that they did.''\n       In response to Dr. Kay's comments, an intelligence official \n     said Sunday that while some prewar assessments may have been \n     wrong, ``it is premature to say that the intelligence \n     community's judgments were completely wrong or largely \n     wrong--there are still a lot of answers we need.'' The \n     official added, however, that the C.I.A. had already begun an \n     internal review to determine whether its analytical processes \n     were sound.\n       Dr. Kay said that based on his team's interviews with Iraqi \n     scientists, reviews of Iraqi documents and examinations of \n     facilities and other materials, the administration was also \n     almost certainly wrong in its prewar belief that Iraq had any \n     significant stockpiles of illicit weapons.\n       ``I'm personally convinced that there were not large \n     stockpiles of newly produced weapons of mass destruction,'' \n     Dr. Kay said. ``We don't find the people, the documents or \n     the physical plants that you would expect to find if the \n     production was going on.\n       ``I think they gradually reduced stockpiles throughout the \n     1990's. Somewhere in the mid-1990's, the large chemical \n     overhang of existing stockpiles was eliminated.''\n       While it is possible Iraq kept developing ``test amounts'' \n     of chemical weapons and was working on improved methods of \n     production, he said, the evidence is strong that ``they did \n     not produce large amounts of chemical weapons throughout the \n     1990's.''\n       Regarding biological weapons, he said there was evidence \n     that the Iraqis continued research and development ``right up \n     until the end'' to improve their ability to produce ricin. \n     ``They were mostly researching better methods for \n     weaponization,'' Dr. Kay said. ``They were maintaining an \n     infrastructure, but they didn't have large-scale production \n     under way.''\n       He added that Iraq did make an effort to restart its \n     nuclear weapons program in 2000 and 2001, but that the \n     evidence suggested that the program was rudimentary at best \n     and would have taken years to rebuild, after being largely \n     abandoned in the 1990's. ``There was a restart of the nuclear \n     program,'' he said. ``But the surprising thing is that if you \n     compare it to what we now know about Iran and Libya, the \n     Iraqi program was never as advanced,'' Dr. Kay said.\n       Dr. Kay said Iraq had also maintained an active ballistic \n     missile program that was receiving significant foreign \n     assistance until the start of the American invasion. He said \n     it appeared that money was put back into the nuclear weapons \n     program to restart the effort in part because the Iraqi \n     realized they needed some kind of payload for their new \n     rockets.\n       While he urged that the hunt should continue in Iraq, he \n     said continue in Iraq, he said he believed ``85 percent of \n     the significant things'' have already been uncovered, and \n     cautioned that severe looting in Iraq after Mr. Hussein was \n     toppled in April had led to the loss of many crucial \n     documents and other materials. That means it will be \n     virtually impossible to ever get a complete picture of what \n     Iraq was up to before the war, he added.\n       ``There is going to be an irreducible level of ambiguity \n     because of all the looting,'' Dr. Kay said.\n       Dr. Kay said he believed that Iraq was a danger to the \n     world, but not the same threat that the Bush administration \n     detailed.\n       ``We know that terrorists were passing through Iraq,'' he \n     said. ``And now we know that there was little control over \n     Iraq's weapons capabilities. I think it shows that Iraq was a \n     very dangerous place. The country had the technology, the \n     ability to produce, and there were terrorist groups passing \n     through the country--and no central control.''\n       But Dr. Kay said the C.I.A. missed the significance of the \n     chaos in the leadership and had no idea how badly that chaos \n     had corrupted Iraq's weapons capabilities or the threat it \n     raised of loose scientific knowledge being handed over to \n     terrorists. ``The system became so corrupt, and we missed \n     that,'' he said.\n\n\n                      C.I.A. Missed Signs of Chaos\n\n       He said it now appeared that Iraq had abandoned the \n     production of illicit weapons and largely eliminated its \n     stockpiles in the 1990's in large part because of Baghdad's \n     concerns about the United Nations weapons inspection process. \n     He said Iraqi scientists and documents show that Baghdad was \n     far more concerned about United Nations inspections than \n     Washington had ever realized.\n       ``The Iraqis say that they believed that Unscom was more \n     effective, and they didn't want to get caught,'' Dr. Kay \n     said, using an acronym for the inspection program, the United \n     Nations Special Commission.\n       The Iraquis also feared the disclosures that would come \n     from the 1995 defection of Hussein Kamel, Mr. Hussein's son-\n     in-law, who had helped run the weapons programs. Dr. Kay said \n     one Iraqi document that had been found showed the extent to \n     which the Iraqis believed that Mr. Kamel's defection would \n     hamper any efforts to continue weapons programs.\n       In addition, Dr. Kay said, it is now clear that an American \n     bombing campaign against Iraq in 1998 destroyed much of the \n     remaining infrastructure in chemical weapons programs.\n       Dr. Kay said his team had uncovered no evidence that Niger \n     had tried to sell uranium to Iraq for its nuclear weapons \n     program. In his State of the Union address in 2003, President \n     Bush reported that British intelligence had determined that \n     Iraq was trying to import uranium from an African nation, and \n     Niger's name was later put forward.\n       ``We found nothing on Niger,'' Dr. Kay said. He added that \n     there was evidence that someone did approach the Iraqis \n     claiming to be able to sell uranium and diamonds from another \n     African country, but apparently nothing came of the approach. \n     The original reports on Niger have been found to be based on \n     forged documents, and the Bush administration has since \n     backed away from its initial assertions.\n       Dr. Kay added that there was now a consensus within the \n     United States intelligence community that mobile trailers \n     found in Iraq and initially thought to be laboratories for \n     biological weapons were actually designed to produce hydrogen \n     for weather balloons, or perhaps to produce rocket fuel. \n     While using the trailers for such purposes seems bizarre, Dr. \n     Kay said, ``Iraq was doing a lot of nonsensical things'' \n     under Mr. Hussein.\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\n       The intelligence reports that Iraq was poised to use \n     chemical weapons against invading troops were false, \n     apparently based on faulty reports and Iraqi disinformation, \n     Dr. Kay said.\n       When American troops found that Iraqi troops had stored \n     defensive chemical-weapons suits and antidotes, Washington \n     assumed the Iraq military was poised to use chemicals against \n     American forces. But interviews with Iraqi military officers \n     and others have shown that the Iraqis kept the gear because \n     they feared Israel would join an American-led invasion and \n     use chemical weapons against them.\n\n\n                       Role of Republican Guards\n\n       Dr. Kay said interviews with senior officers of the Special \n     Republican Guards, Mr. Hussein's most elite units, had \n     suggested that prewar intelligence reports were wrong in \n     warning that these units had chemical weapons and would use \n     them against American forces as they closed in on Baghdad.\n       The former Iraqi officers reported that no Special \n     Republican Guard units had chemical or biological weapons, he \n     said. But all of the officers believed that some other \n     Special Republican Guard unit had chemical weapons.\n       ``They all said they didn't have it, but they thought other \n     units had it,'' Dr. Kay said. He said it appeared they were \n     the victims of a disinformation campaign orchestrated by Mr. \n     Hussein.\n       Dr. Kay said there was also no conclusive evidence that \n     Iraq had moved any unconventional weapons to Syria, as some \n     Bush administration officials have suggested. He said there \n     had been persistent reports from Iraqis saying they or \n     someone they knew had see cargo being moved across the \n     border, but there is no proof that such movements involved \n     weapons materials.\n       Dr. Kay said the basic problem with the way the C.I.A. \n     tried to gauge Iraq's weapons programs is now painfully \n     clear: for five years, the agency lacked its own spies in \n     Iraq who could provide credible information.\n       During the 1990's, Dr. Kay said, the agency became spoiled \n     by on-the-ground intelligence that it obtained from United \n     Nations weapons inspectors. But the quality of the \n     information plunged after the teams were withdrawn in 1998.\n       ``Unscom was like crack cocaine for the C.I.A.,'' Dr. Kay \n     said. ``They could see something from a satellite or other \n     technical intelligence, and then direct the inspectors to go \n     look at it.''\n       The agency became far too dependent on spy satellites, \n     intercepted communications and intelligence developed by \n     foreign spies and by defectors and exiles, Dr. Kay said. \n     While he said the agency analysts who were monitoring Iraq's \n     weapons programs did the best they could with what they had, \n     he argued that the agency failed to make it clear to American \n     policy makers that their assessments were increasingly based \n     on very limited information.\n       ``I think that the system should have a way for an analyst \n     to say, `I don't have enough information to make a judgment,' \n     '' Dr. Kay said. ``There is really not a way to do that under \n     the current system.''\n       He added that while the analysts included caveats on their \n     reports, those passages ``tended to drop off as the reports \n     would go up the food chain'' inside the government.\n       As a result, virtually everyone in the United States \n     intelligence community during both the Clinton and the \n     current Bush administrations thought Iraq still had the \n     illicit weapons, he said. And the government became a victim \n     of its own certainty.\n       ``Alarm bells should have gone off when everyone believes \n     the same thing,'' Dr. Kay said. ``No one stood up and said, \n     `Let's examine the footings for these conclusions.' I think \n     you ought to have a place for contrarian views in the \n     system.''\n\n\n                      finds no pressure from bush\n\n       Dr. Kay said he was convinced that the analysts were not \n     pressed by the Bush administration to make certain their \n     prewar intelligence reports conformed to a White House agenda \n     on Iraq.\n       Last year, some C.I.A. analysts said they had felt pressed \n     to find links between Iraq and Al Qaeda to suit the \n     administration. While Dr. Kay said he has no knowledge about \n     that issue, he did believe that pressure was placed on \n     analysts regarding the weapons programs.\n       ``All the analysts I have talked to said they never felt \n     pressured on W.M.D,'' he said. ``Everyone believed that they \n     had W.M.D.''\n       Dr. Kay also said he never felt pressed by the Bush \n     administration to shape his own reports on the status of \n     Iraq's weapons. He said that in a White House meeting with \n     Mr. Bush last August, the president urged him to uncover what \n     really happened.\n       ``The only comment I ever had from the president was to \n     find the truth,'' Dr. Kay said. ``I never got any pressure to \n     find a certain outcome.''\n       Dr. Kay, a former United Nations inspector who was brought \n     in last summer to run the Iraq Survey Group by George J. \n     Tenet, the director of central intelligence, said he resigned \n     his post largely because he disagreed with the decision in \n     November by the administration and the Pentagon to shift \n     intelligence resources from the hunt for banned weapons to \n     counterinsurgency efforts inside Iraq. Dr. Kay is being \n     succeeded by Charles A. Duelfer, another former United \n     Nations inspector, who has also expressed skepticism about \n     whether the United States will find any chemical or \n     biological weapons.\n       Dr. Kay said the decision to shift resources away from the \n     weapons hunt came at a time of ``near panic'' among American \n     officials in Baghdad because of rising casualties caused by \n     bombings and ambushes of American troops.\n       He added that the decision ran counter to written \n     assurances he had been given when he took the job, and that \n     the shift in resources had severely hampered the weapons \n     hunt.\n       He said that there is only a limited amount of time left to \n     conduct a thorough search before a new Iraqi government takes \n     over in the summer, and that there are already signs of \n     resistance to the work by Iraqi government officials.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The article begins with a paragraph that reads:\n\n       American intelligence agencies failed to detect that Iraq's \n     unconventional weapons programs were in a state of disarray \n     in recent years under the increasingly erratic leadership of \n     Saddam Hussein, the C.I.A.'s former chief weapons inspector \n     said in an interview late Saturday.\n\n  Mr. Kay, the head of our government's effort to determine precisely \nwhich weapons Saddam possessed prior to the start of the war, offered \nthe view on whether Saddam actually had weapons of mass destruction. \nHis quote:\n\n       I don't think they exist. The fact that we found so far the \n     weapons do not exist--we've got to deal with that difference \n     and understand why.\n\n  I also think it is important for us to understand why. On Saturday, \nSecretary of State Colin Powell held out the possibility that prewar \nIraq did not possess any weapons of mass destruction. That is quite an \nadmission, given the Secretary's presentation to the United Nations, \ngiven his assertions publicly and privately to us and many others as \nthe case for war in Iraq was made last spring.\n  These views are consistent with a report issued earlier this month by \nthe nonpartisan Carnegie Endowment. The report by the Carnegie \nEndowment concluded that the assertion that the fundamental \njustification for the war with Iraq, namely that Iraq possessed \nstockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, was not real. Carnegie also \nconcluded:\n\n       Administration officials systematically misrepresented the \n     threat from Iraq's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons \n     programs and ballistic missile programs.\n\n  Given the conclusion by the Carnegie Endowment, we can only get to \nthe bottom of this issue by thoroughly examining the performance of \nboth the intelligence community and senior administration officials.\n  This has been quite a remarkable turnaround from the debate we had 4 \nor 5 months ago. During that debate, many of us proposed an independent \ncommission to look at these issues. At that point, there was a debate \nabout whether or not we had all the facts and whether or not the \nIntelligence Committee in the Senate was prepared to ascertain what the \nfacts were.\n  But consider now the revelations that have occurred just in the last \nfew days, much less the last several months. You have the Secretary of \nState reversing his public position with regard to weapons of mass \ndestruction. You have the chief weapons investigator working for this \nGovernment publicly declaring that weapons do not exist and questioning \nwhether they did exist at any time in recent years. You have the \nCarnegie Endowment, one of the most respected nonpartisan organizations \nthat also reviewed the matter, coming to to a similar conclusion.\n  The question comes now: What do we do about it? We can ignore it. We \ncan hope it will just go away. Or we can investigate it, research it, \ntry to learn from it to ensure that mistakes of this consequence won't \nhappen again in the future. Unfortunately, it appears neither the \nadministration nor the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nshare this view.\n  According to Dr. Kay, he is stepping down in large part because the \nadministration has reduced his team of analysts, translators, and \ninterrogators working on the search for Saddam's weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I cannot overstate the significance of these claims. They contributed \ndirectly to the decision to go to war last spring. As many of us have \nsaid on several occasions, this obviously wasn't the only motivation, \nbut it was clearly a major part of this decision for many of us.\n  Since we made that fateful decision, over 500 Americans have been \nkilled, over 2,000 have been wounded, and over\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\n100,000 are still deployed in harm's way. In addition, published \nreports indicate the lack of evidence has badly damaged America's \ncredibility around the world.\n  So given all of this, I cannot understand why we would not want to \nget to the bottom of this issue as quickly as possible. We should be \ndedicating more resources to getting these answers not less.\n  I am troubled too by the position of the chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. This committee has the obligation and the \nauthority to examine both the intelligence community and the \nadministration's role in the intelligence failures leading up to the \nwar with Iraq.\n  Yet throughout all of the last session of Congress, the chairman \nsteadfastly refused to permit the committee to meet its \nresponsibilities. We are at the start of a new session of Congress now, \nwith the advantage of a lot more information than we had weeks or \nmonths ago.\n  In the wake of the statements by Secretary Powell and Dr. Kay, and \nthe conclusions of the nonpartisan Carnegie Endowment, I urge the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee to reconsider his position and \nthat of the majority.\n  We will work within the Intelligence Committee to urge the chairman \nto live up to those obligations. If he continues to fail to do so, we \nwill again bring legislation to the Senate floor to establish a \nnonpartisan, independent commission to look at how intelligence was \nused by the intelligence community and this administration.\n  Our troops in Iraq and the American people deserve a full and \ncomprehensive review of all aspects of their Government's actions prior \nto the start of the Iraqi war. I hope all members of the Intelligence \nCommittee, and indeed the entire Senate, will work with us to give them \njust that.\n  Madam President, we will continue to come to the floor to review \nthese matters and to express in the most determined way that it is the \nresponsibility of this Senate to live up to its obligations--the \nIntelligence Committee, the other committees of jurisdiction, and the \nbroad membership--especially when we become aware of revelations and \nconclusions drawn by experts in the field. We simply cannot afford to \nignore what happened, why it happened, and how we can prevent it from \nhappening again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/26/senate-section/article/S226-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3108, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3108) to amend the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     temporarily replace the 30-year Treasury rate with a rate \n     based on long-term corporate bonds for certain pension plan \n     funding requirements and other provisions, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Grassley amendment No. 2233, of a perfecting nature.\n       Kyl amendment No. 2234 (to amend No. 2233) to limit the \n     liability of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with \n     respect to a plan for which a reduced deficit contribution is \n     elected.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, during the last 3 years, we have seen \ntoo many good jobs leave this country, and Americans are ending up with \nlower pay for part-time jobs. Not only do these jobs pay much less, \nthey are also much less likely to offer pension benefits. In fact, 3.3 \nmillion Americans have lost their pension coverage since 2000. In 2002, \nonly 53.5 percent of our Nation's workers were participating in \nretirement plans, the lowest level in over a decade.\n  This means the degradation of jobs not only hurts Americans today, it \nwill continue to hurt them for the rest of their lives and into their \nretirement and old age. Instead of adopting an every-worker-for-himself \nretirement policy, we should be encouraging the growth of secure \npension plans for all workers. Fewer American workers than ever have a \nsecure, defined benefit pension plan.\n  Only one in five workers today has a defined benefit plan compared \nwith nearly 40 percent of workers in 1980. We must help low-wage \nworkers and employees of small businesses, less than 10 percent of whom \nhave pension coverage today.\n  Strengthening and expanding our pension system is our long-term goal. \nBut first we must take the initial step of stabilizing the pension \nplans that exist today, which have been battered by the perfect storm \nof economic conditions over the last 3 years.\n  The amendment that Chairman Grassley, ranking Finance Committee \nmember Senator Baucus, as well as the HELP Committee chairman, Senator \nGregg, and I have offered is a moderate bipartisan measure to address \nthese short-term problems. This amendment does not weaken existing \npension funding rules. These are only temporary measures designed to \ngive companies and workers some breathing room, to take steps to \nfurther protect these pension plans.\n\n  An editorial in today's Washington Post expressed concern about our \namendment and its effect on the PBGC and the American taxpayers. It is \nvery important to respond to these concerns because they stem from some \nmisconceptions about how our pension funding system works.\n  First, additional obligations of the PBGC will not put taxpaying \nAmericans at risk. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which \nensures defined benefit plans, is a self-funded agency. It is not \nsupported by taxpayer dollars; it is funded by premiums from employers \nand holds billions of dollars in assets.\n  Second, the PBGC's funding deficit, while serious, does not mean the \nagency cannot fulfill its mission. The PBGC has been in deficit before. \nThe PBGC single employer program operated at a deficit for the first 16 \nyears of its existence. The PBGC still holds billions of dollars in \nassets, and the agency reports that it has sufficient cash flow to \ncover benefit payments and other operating expenses and other \nliabilities for a number of years.\n  Also, the PBGC can and has operated at a surplus. During the Clinton \neconomy, the PBGC not only shed its deficits, it gained a $10 billion \nsurplus. What is more, the PBGC's multiemployer program operated at a \nsurplus for over 20 years--until this year. When our economy improves, \nthe financial outlook of the PBGC will improve as well.\n  We were also concerned about overburdening the PBGC. That is why we \nlimited the DRC relief to companies with healthy pension plans in 2000. \nThese are companies that have been hit by terrible economic \ncircumstances, from which we believe they will recover. Companies that \nreceive the DRC relief will still be responsible for their regular \npension contributions, and they will be restricted from increasing \nbenefits, thus making pension promises they cannot keep. They will also \nbe required to keep up with the costs of current benefits so they won't \nfall further behind in their funding levels.\n  Finally, not passing this pension legislation will subject the PBGC \nto much greater risk than it faces today. Without the crucial three \npieces that our legislation includes--temporary replacement of the 30-\nyear Treasury bond rate, targeted deficit reduction contribution \nrelief, and funding relief to multiemployer plans--far more pension \nplans would terminate, which would place additional burdens on the \nPBGC.\n  We want to improve our pension funding rules to ensure that companies \nadequately fund pension plans. We want to encourage companies to put \nmore money into their pension plans when times are good, instead of \nonly penalizing them with increased contributions when times are bad. \nHowever, we must first address the perfect storm that is battering our \npension plans today. Once we have adopted this short-term solution, I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to improve and strengthen \npensions for all America.\n  I thought I would take a few moments to talk about this perfect storm \nthat has adversely impacted the pension system, and also the challenges \nit presents to our economy generally.\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\n  Madam President, 3.3 million Americans have lost their pension \ncoverage since 2000. Only 53 percent of our Nation's workers are \nparticipating in a retirement plan, the lowest level in over a decade.\n  As I mentioned before, the three parts of the stool for the American \nworkers, after they have lived a life of productivity and worked hard \nin the workplace, are: One, Social Security; two, their savings; and \nthree, their pension programs. We have seen a decline in the number of \nAmericans who are now covered.\n  The declining quality of jobs in our country also means declining \nbenefits for American workers. Part-time and low-wage workers are far \nless likely to have a pension than full-time workers.\n  That is why we are concerned and why this legislation, as I pointed \nout previously, addresses the needs of nearly 35 million Americans who \nare covered by single-employer defined benefit pension plans and the \n9.7 million Americans who are covered by multiemployer defined benefit \nplans, such as those who work in the construction industry who move \nfrom site to site over a year. That program was developed to make sure \nthose workers will also have a defined benefit pension plan to provide \na secure monthly benefit backed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation. That is a great advantage of the defined benefit program.\n  What I am talking about in terms of the perfect storm is the economic \nfactors which have been hurting defined pension plans: The prolonged \ndownturn of the stock market during the Bush administration, the \nlongest since the Great Depression; the extremely low 30-year Treasury \nbond interest rates--it may be good for some industries, if you are \npurchasing a car or a house, but in terms of its impact on pension \nplans, it has been extremely adverse--and the generally weak economic \nconditions, which means that companies cannot afford to make additional \npayments and pay the excise taxes imposed by our pension laws.\n  Smaller companies, medium-size companies, and even larger companies \nare hard pressed at this time because of the economic exigencies we are \nfacing today. They believe they are under all of this pressure and they \nare unable to meet those responsibilities.\n  I point this out not only to explain the challenge we are facing with \nregard to pensions but how inconsistent this is with the remarks of our \nPresident in his State of the Union Address when he commented that this \neconomy is strong and growing stronger and also pointed out that the \npace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in \nnearly 20 years.\n  As some of us have pointed out, this has been very good for Wall \nStreet but really has not been so good for Main Street.\n  This chart shows what has happened, going back to 1949, when the U.S. \neconomy recovered from a recession. This is a comparison of first \nquarter recovery.\n  Looking at the history, using identical figures--and this is done by \nEPI Analysis based upon BEA data--first of all, we see, going back to \n1949, that wages increased in the first quarter by 16 percent; 10 \npercent in 1954; in 1958 by 10 percent; 7 percent in 1961; 6.8 percent \nin 1970; 7.8 percent in 1975; 9.21 percent in 1982; in 1991, 6.1 \npercent; and look at the year 2001, 1.5 percent. It is a pretty \ninteresting indicator as to what is happening in the job market in \nterms of economic recovery, of which we heard so much during the State \nof the Union Address.\n  This chart is a comparison since 1949 of what has happened to wages \nfor workers in the quarter the recession ended. What we see is that \nthis 1.5 percent is so dramatically different from every other quarter \nthat it is difficult for many of us to be enthusiastic about this as an \neconomic indicator.\n  It is very interesting to look at where the resources have gone in \nthe recovery. In the Bush economy, corporate profits ballooned compared \nto workers' wages. Look at this: In the early nineties, we saw workers' \nwages, as a percent of the economic recovery, were 60 percent; \ncorporate profits, 39 percent. Workers' wages, 60 percent; corporate \nprofits, 39 percent.\n\n  Now look what it is this year. In today's recovery, we find workers' \nwages represent 13 percent of the total recovery and profits 86 \npercent--profits 86 percent. When many of us talk about the recovery \nbeing good for Wall Street, this is it; bad for Main Street, this is \nit.\n  Where are the resources going? They are going to the profits of the \ncorporation. They are not being returned to the workers. We see what \nhas happened.\n  At the end of last week, I noted, when I got home, a very interesting \nCNN report on overwhelmed Americans. This is what they pointed out in \ntheir study and review:\n\n       Wages are stagnant, productivity is soaring, which means \n     many Americans are effectively working more for less. And \n     making matters even worse, millions of American workers now \n     find themselves competing with cheaper foreign labor just to \n     hold on to their jobs.\n\n  Then it quotes Kate Bronfenbrenner, a professor from Cornell \nUniversity, talking about American workers:\n\n       They are frightened because they wake up each morning and \n     they don't know whether their job is going to be outsourced, \n     downsized, contracted out or eliminated. They are overwhelmed \n     because they feel like forces way beyond their control are \n     making the decisions that affect their lives. And they are \n     exhausted because they are working harder and longer and \n     faster just to stand still.\n\n  I showed those other charts that say American workers are working \nlonger and harder than any other industrial society in the world. Not \nonly are workers working longer and harder, but it's all hands on deck \nboth men and women, moms and dads are working longer and harder just to \ntry to stay even.\n  The report goes on:\n\n       In growing numbers, workers are feeling overworked, \n     underappreciated, and burned out. That's according to a \n     recent study of 1,100 workers that concluded ``Emotion about \n     the current work experience is extremely negative.''\n\n  In the Wall Street Journal on Friday, January 23, we saw a lead \nstory.\n  ``The Gap in Wages Is Growing Again for U.S. Workers.\n  ``Inequality Is Seen as a Result of the Jobless Recovery; Potential \nElection Theme.''\n\n       Wage inequality--the gap between America's highest and \n     lowest earners--has started widening again, a situation with \n     election-year ramifications.\n       The trend is a reflection of the job market's exceptionally \n     weak response to the current economic recovery.\n\n  This is the Wall Street Journal. This is not just an article by some \nDemocratic study group. This is the Wall Street Journal, their studies. \nIt says:\n\n       The trend is a reflection of the job market's exceptionally \n     weak response to the current economic recovery, as well as \n     long-term technological and economic changes that have eroded \n     the bargaining power of America's lowest-paid workers. The \n     data show that young workers--who currently have fewer job \n     prospects than a few years ago--and men, in particular are \n     bearing the brunt . . .\n       The numbers continue a movement to greater wage inequality \n     that began around the time President Bush succeeded President \n     Clinton and the economy slid into recession three years ago. \n     The trend represents a reversal from the late 1990s, when the \n     lowest unemployment rates in a generation had enabled the \n     lowest-paid workers to keep pace with those at the top.\n\n  This is the real state of the Union. I am reminded of the study that \njust came out at the end of last week from the Economic Policy \nInstitute, a January 21st study.\n  I will explain this chart. Basically it says the jobs that are being \ncreated, the few jobs that are being created--the estimate by the \nadministration is it is going to be 300,000. They created 1,000 jobs \nthis last month. The jobs that are being created are not as good as the \njobs lost under this administration.\n  This chart shows that in 48 of the 50 States, jobs in higher paying \nindustries have given way to jobs in lower paying industries since the \nrecession ended in November 2001. Nationwide, industries that are \ngaining jobs relative to industries that are losing jobs pay 21 percent \nless annually. For the States that have lost jobs since the recession \npurportedly ended, this is the other shoe dropping. Not only have jobs \nbeen lost, but in 29 of them the losses have been concentrated in \nhigher paying sectors. For 19 of the 20 States that have seen some \nsmall gain in jobs since the end of the recession, the jobs gained have \nbeen disproportionately in the lower paying sector.\n  They mentioned several States. One is the State of New Hampshire. \nOverall, 15,700 New Hampshire jobs have been lost since this President \ntook office,\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\nand New Hampshire's unemployment rate has increased 54-percent under \nPresident Bush. The unemployment rate in New Hampshire was 4.3 percent \nin November 2003, up from 2.8 percent in January 2001. This change \nrepresents a 54-percent increase since President Bush took office.\n  According to the most recent State estimate, 6.1 percent of New \nHampshire residents live in poverty, up from 5.5 percent in 2001. New \nHampshire had lost a fifth of its manufacturing jobs since April of \n2001. Under President Bush, the low-paying jobs are replacing the high-\npaying jobs in New Hampshire. The New England Economic Project recently \nestimated the sectors that lost the jobs between 2001 and 2002 in New \nHampshire have an annual average wage of about $44,000. These sectors \nadding jobs in the State have an average wage of $38,000.\n  Over a third of the jobless people in New Hampshire used up their \nunemployment benefits before finding a new job. Madam President, here \n26 percent of the people on unemployment in New Hampshire used up their \nbenefit before finding new jobs. However, in September of 2003 nearly \none-third were unable to find work by the time their benefits ended.\n  These are hard-working Americans who have paid into the unemployment \nfund, which has about $20 billion surplus at this time. There are \n90,000 workers a week who are losing their unemployment insurance. That \nis happening up there in New Hampshire. We have tried more than a dozen \ntimes to get a temporary extension of 13 weeks. It costs about $7 \nbillion. It has been objected to by the Republicans.\n\n  Real people are hurting. The unemployment filings in New Hampshire \nare the highest since 1992. From 2001 to 2003, the number of \nunemployment filings in New Hampshire was the highest it has been since \n1992.\n  Of 240,000 New Hampshire taxpayers, 40 percent--and I mention this \nbecause in the State of the Union Address, the President talked about \nhow we have doubled the child tax credit, reduced the marriage penalty, \nbegun to phase out the debt, reduced taxes on capital gains, dividends, \ncut taxes on small businesses, have lowered taxes for every American \nwho pays income tax.\n  Listen to this. In New Hampshire, 241,000 New Hampshire taxpayers, \nwhich is 40 percent of the New Hampshire taxpayers, will receive less \nthan $100 from the Bush tax plan in 2004. The top 1 percent of New \nHampshire taxpayers receive 28 percent of the benefits in 2004 and get \nan average tax cut of over $67,000.\n  Some people have asked why some of us were somewhat disappointed in \nthe State of the Union Address and didn't jump up and applaud these \nfigures. We take the State of the Union seriously. When you have that \nkind of result, in terms of the President's tax bill, one which I voted \nagainst for these very kinds of reasons, you begin to understand what \nis happening on Main Street of America.\n  Not only are we talking about the question of pensions, and we talk \nabout jobs, let's think about what has been happening to the average \nworkers with regard to their health care costs and their health care \ncoverage. We have one in five workers who are uninsured and, when they \nare offered insurance, decline coverage because of the limitations of \ntheir wages and because of the costs of health insurance, which I will \ncome back to. Sixty-five percent of the employers increased the amount \nworkers pay for their health insurance and 47 percent of the employers \nincreased the amount workers pay for prescription drugs and 34 percent \nof employers increased the cost share employees pay for office visits.\n  These are the pressures workers are under. That is why we have some \n44 million Americans who do not have health insurance--members \nrepresenting not only workers but family members of the workers. About \n80 percent of all those who do not have health insurance are either \nworkers or members of workers' families. That is why I believe if it is \nworker related in terms of trying to get coverage, we can make a major \nstep in reducing the total number of those who are uncovered.\n  Look at what is happening to the costs, the premium costs versus the \nConsumer Price Index--the average cost of products. Look at what is \nhappening. This is a comparison of costs for workers. In 1999, the \nConsumer Price Index was 2.7 percent but 5.3 percent for health care. \nThe next year, 2000, 3.4, 8.2; 2001, 1.6, 10.9. The next year, 2002, \n2.4, for the Consumer Price Index, 12.9. In 2001, 1.8, 13.9 percent \nincrease in the cost of health insurance.\n  We wonder why workers cannot afford it and workers can't afford it. \nThat is the real state of the Union. That is the real state of the \nUnion.\n  To offer a refundable tax credit of $1,000 is laughable. I say it is \nlike throwing a 5-foot rope to somebody who is in a boat 10 feet away \nand is about to go over Niagara Falls. It is virtually useless. These \nare costs that are impacting, affecting the costs of health care \ninsurance and why workers cannot afford it.\n  What do we hear from the administration? What is their solution? \nShould someone tell us? Do I hear it? I looked hard in the President's \nState of the Union Address to find it. Do you know what it was? It was \nmedical malpractice. That is their answer to all of the problems we are \ntalking about, and the increase in costs. We will have a chance to get \ninto that at some time. That is going to be the answer.\n  It isn't only the cost of health insurance. Look at what is happening \nto the families. These are family responsibilities. Workers have \nresponsibilities. Parents don't want to be a burden. They worked hard. \nWe guaranteed to the families in 1965 when we passed Medicare that we \nwould attend to their health care needs. We didn't know prescription \ndrugs would be so important. Every day that we fail to provide a \ncomprehensive prescription drug program, we fail in our pledge to our \nseniors.\n  Look at what has happened to the prescription drug costs with respect \nto the Consumer Price Index: In 2000, 3.4 percent, and the average \ncost-of-living increase was 16 percent; in 2001, 1.67, and 15 percent; \n2002, 2.4 percent, and 14 percent. We allegedly passed a prescription \ndrug program. What did we say in that bill that would get a handle on \ncosts? Virtually nothing. We prohibited the Secretary of HHS from being \nable to negotiate for lower prices. That is not true with VA; they can \nreduce prices down some 47 percent, but not with regard to Medicare \nbecause we were prohibited from that. I pay respect to my Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, and Congresswoman Pelosi for offering \namendments which we will have a chance to address here very soon to \nchange that.\n  We have to do something on the coverage, we have to do something on \nthe costs, or we are not really looking after what is happening out on \nMain Street. We talk about jobs. We talk about health. Let us take a \nlook at another issue families are very much concerned about; that is, \nthe cost of education.\n  This is the Bush education record: Failure to provide tuition relief \nas college costs increase. On this chart, you find what 4-year costs \nfor a college education are. This includes not only the tuition but it \nis room and board and the routine expenses with which students are \nfaced. Look over here. In 2002, on help and assistance, these are for \nyoung people who come from families with limited means but have \nscholarships and are academically gifted, or are able to meet the \nacademic standards and gain admission to these excellent schools all \nover the country. Look at what we see: Significant increase in the \ncost. Look at what help and assistance: Basically flat over the period \nof time.\n  These are family issues for working families concerned about the cost \nof prescription drugs that are being paid by their parents. These are \nfamily issues for working families who are concerned about the cost of \nhaving their children go to the fine schools across this country. We \nhave left them high and dry.\n  If we look at the Bush economic record, the median household income \nis down effectively $1,500 across the country according to the Bureau \nof Census in the Department of Commerce; $1,500 for the year 2002, and \na further decline beyond to 2004. That is what is happening out on Main \nStreet. People are working harder, as these reports point out, and they \nare barely able to keep up. Millions are working and competing as well. \nAs productivity goes up, they are working more for less. We see\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\nthat allocations of profits versus the wages.\n  We see the failure to respond to the needs of working families with \nregard to their health care costs or their children's education. These \nare all the issues which have been left behind. What has been the \nresponse to those urgent needs? It has been disappointing, at best.\n  First of all, there are 13 million children who are hungry. We have 8 \nmillion Americans who are unemployed. We have 8 million workers who \nlose overtime under the Bush proposal. We have 7 million low-wage \nworkers who have been waiting 7 years for an increase in the minimum \nwage. We have 3 million more Americans in poverty since President Bush \ntook office, and 90,000 workers a week are losing their unemployment \nbenefits every week. We have tried and tried to get a temporary \nextension for these workers.\n\n  The decline in the economy is not the result of workers not working \nhard and producing. It is because of general overall economic \nmismanagement.\n  This country has always recognized that those workers pay into the \nunemployment compensation, and when there is a slide in the economy, \nthey ought to be able to withdraw some of that. But there has been \nobjection time in and time out by our Republican friends and virtually \nno leadership on this issue from the President.\n  More than three in four--77 percent--of the unemployed Americans say \nthe level of stress in their family has increased. How do we measure \nthat? We listened the other night to how our GNP is going up, with all \nof the favorable economic indicators. How do you measure the fact that \nin 77 percent of the unemployed families the level of stress in their \nfamily has increased? Two-thirds of those with children have cut back \non spending for their children. Where is that indicated in any of these \neconomic indicators we heard about in the State of the Union?\n  Twenty-six percent say another family member has had to start a job \nor increase their work hours in order to keep the family together, and \n23 percent have had to interrupt their education or that of a family \nmember. They had to drop out of school for a year, go back to work, and \nthen come back and try to complete their education. That is what is \nhappening out there.\n  We didn't hear about what is happening for average working families. \nIf we had been able to extend the unemployment insurance, we could have \navoided many of these indicators. But no, we were unable to do so.\n  What has been the impact by this administration saying no to \nextending unemployment compensation? No, we can't do that. What about \nthose workers who worked hard for 40 hours a week and 52 weeks of the \nyear? It has been 7 years since the last increase in the minimum wage. \nNow, at the end of this year, it will be at an all-time low.\n  A majority of the Members of this body would vote for an increase in \nthe minimum wage, and we are not able to get it because of the \nRepublican filibuster. That is the reason. Make no mistake about it.\n  Who are these people? These are men and women of great dignity. These \npeople work hard. They take pride in what they do. They work cleaning \nout the great buildings that are the offices of American industry. Many \nof them are teacher's aides, or they work in child care. Many of them \nwork in nursing homes to help look after a generation who brought this \ncountry out of the Depression and sacrificed for their children. They \nfought in the wars. Those are minimum wage workers. They are men and \nwomen of dignity. Most of them are women. This is a women's issue. Most \nof the women have children. So it is a children's issue. It is a family \nissue. Many of them are members of minorities. It is a civil rights \nissue.\n  Beyond all of that, Americans understand that if you work 40 hours a \nweek for 52 weeks of the year, you should not have to live in poverty. \nYou should not have to live in poverty. That is our belief. That is our \nstandard.\n  We are going to take this issue to our Republican friends time in and \ntime out all of this year. We welcome those listening to communicate to \nour Republican friends their views on this issue. Talk about a family \nissue. Talk about family values. How you care for your child, how much \ntime you are able to spend with your child, talk about family values, \nthis is it. And we have opposition from the Bush administration on \nthis.\n\n  Finally, I mention again what is happening in terms of the overtime, \nopposition to extending unemployment compensation, opposition to an \nincrease in the minimum wage, and then the rule and regulation that was \ndebated in the Senate with Republicans and Democrats alike. Rejected. \nIt went to the House of Representatives. Rejected. And then it was \ntucked into the omnibus bill behind closed doors in the dead of night \nand passed, although many Members strongly opposed it.\n  Who are the 8 million Americans who would lose their overtime? It is \nextraordinary with this economy for the administration to say that one \nof the principal problems with our economy today is the fact that these \nworkers are being paid too much. They are saying these workers are \nbeing paid too much. Who are these workers? Police officers will lose \ntheir overtime under the definition of the administration. Police \nofficers, nurses, and firefighters will lose their overtime.\n  Do we hear about homeland security? Who is on the front line of \ndefense? It is the nurses, the firefighters, and the policemen. We are \nasking them to risk their lives in terms of homeland security yet on \nthe other hand we will make them ineligible for overtime. Give me a \nbreak.\n  It is very interesting that so many are professions that involve \nwomen. Women will be very adversely affected. That is why \norganizations, including Nine-to-Five and all of the various women \norganizations, are so strongly opposed to the administration's \nproposal.\n  Not only did they do this but they added something new regarding who \nis made ineligible. That was to say if individuals had gone into the \nArmed Forces and they took training programs and then they come out and \nthey have special skills--that is just what our military has today--\nthat because they got these training programs, because they have \nspecial skills, they will by definition be ineligible for overtime.\n  Can anyone believe that, to say to those fighting overseas in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, scattered around the world, when they come on back, they \nare in the National Guard and Reserve and they come on back in, if they \nhave the special skills, they will not be eligible for overtime--for \nthe first time in the history of this country.\n  Obviously, one of the great reasons we have the best military in the \nworld is because it is the best trained, best led, and has the best \ntechnology. It should always be that way. When we are talking about the \ntraining, the training they receive saves other soldiers' lives and \ncarries forward the interests of the United States.\n  I have my differences with the administration in terms of the Iraqi \npolicy, but I am going to make sure these soldiers are well trained, \nwell led, and have that kind of help and assistance. For those in the \nArmed Forces who have gone through the various training programs, quite \nfrankly, it was a very important inducement for recruitment. I don't \nknow what conversations the Secretary of Labor had with the Secretary \nof Defense. I would love to see the exchange of notes, and love to know \nif they ever had a conversation; obviously, it has a very important \nimpact on recruitment.\n  With the failed economy, so many young people, see going into the \nmilitary as a way to get the kind of training that will put them on the \nroad to some kind of hope and opportunity in the future. Now we are \nsaying: No, no, no; that is not going to be the way it is. You get the \ntraining, you come back, and you will not be able to get paid.\n  This is the final insult that the Bush administration would take away \nfrom the veterans, as I mentioned, the overtime pay. That would reduce \nthe standard of living and quality of life of veterans in scientific, \nengineering, medical, and technical operations. Under the Bush \nadministration, veterans who have received the training in the \nmilitary, equivalent to a specialized 4-year degree, could be \nclassified as exempt ``professional employees'' and would lose their \novertime protection. This is a breach of faith with the American\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\nveterans, another reason it should be defeated. It was not.\n  Then, one of the most extraordinary publications that any agency has \never produced in the time I have been in the Senate was the Department \nof Labor issuing guidelines of how to avoid paying overtime. They said: \nThe reason for having this change in the overtime is we are bringing \nmore workers up, raising their wages. It will have a favorable impact \non a certain number of workers. It will really not disadvantage all \nthese estimated.\n  Then we find out what the real issue was: the publication by the \nDepartment of Labor about how to avoid paying any overtime, giving \nevery business in this country the pathway to avoid paying any \novertime. If they could not figure it out, all they had to do was read \nthe Department of Labor recommendation and avoid it. Why? To \nshortchange American workers. State of the union of American workers, \nwhat is happening to their jobs, their wages, their health care, their \neducation, and now we find out their overtime. That is ``How to Avoid \nPaying Your Employees Overtime,'' courtesy of the Bush Department of \nLabor.\n  I will take a moment to read a letter from a veteran and a Boeing \nemployee worried about losing his overtime.\n\n       My name is Randy Fleming. I live in Haysville, Kansas--\n     outside Wichita--and I work as an Engineering Technician in \n     Boeing's Metrology Lab.\n       I'm also proud to say that I'm a military veteran. I served \n     in the U.S. Air Force from August 1973 until February 1979.\n       I've worked for Boeing for 23 years. During that time I've \n     been able to build a good, solid life for my family and I've \n     raised a son who now has a good career and children of his \n     own. There are two things that helped make that possible.\n       First, the training I received in the Air Force made me \n     qualified for a good civilian job. That was one of the main \n     attractions when I enlisted as a young man back in Iowa. I \n     think it's still one of the main reasons young people today \n     decide to enlist. Military training opens up better job \n     opportunities--and if you don't believe me, just look at the \n     recruiting ads on TV.\n       The second thing is overtime pay. That's how I was able to \n     give my son the college education that has opened doors for \n     him. Some years, when the company was busy and I had those \n     college bills to pay, overtime pay was probably 10% or more \n     of my income. My daughter is next. Danielle is only 8, but \n     we'll be counting on my overtime to help her get her college \n     degree, too, when that time comes. For my family overtime pay \n     has made all the difference.\n       That's where I'm coming from. Why did I come to Washington? \n     I came to talk about an issue that is very important back \n     home and to me personally as a working man, a family man, and \n     a veteran. That issue is overtime rights.\n       The changes that this administration is trying to make in \n     the overtime regulations would break the government's bargain \n     with the men and women in the military and would close down \n     opportunities that working vets and their families thought \n     they could count on.\n       When I signed up back in 1973, the Air Force and I made a \n     deal that I thought was fair. They got a chunk of my time and \n     I got training to help me build the rest of my life. There \n     was no part of that deal that said I would have to give up my \n     right to overtime pay. You've heard of the marriage penalty? \n     Well I think that what these new rules do is to create a \n     military penalty. If you got your training in the military, \n     no matter what your white collar profession is, your employer \n     can make you work as many hours as they want and not pay you \n     a dime extra.\n       If that's not bait and switch, I don't know what is.\n       And I don't have any doubt that employers will take \n     advantage of this new opportunity to cut our overtime pay. \n     They'll tell us they have to in order compete. They'll say if \n     they can't take our overtime pay, they'll have to eliminate \n     our jobs.\n       It won't be just the bad employers, either--because these \n     rules will make it very hard for companies to do the right \n     thing. If they can get as many overtime hours as they want \n     for free instead of paying us time-and-a-half, they'll say \n     they owe it to the stockholders. And the veterans and other \n     working people will be stuck with less time, less money, and \n     a broken deal.\n       I'm luckier than some other veterans because I have a union \n     contract that will protect my rights for a while anyway. But \n     we know the pressure will be on, because my employer is one \n     that pushed for these new rules and they've been trying hard \n     to get rid of our union.\n       And for all those who want to let these military penalty \n     rules go through, I have a deal I'd like to propose. If you \n     think it's okay for the government to renege on its deals, I \n     think it should be your job to tell our military men and \n     women in Iraq that when they come home, their service of \n     their country will be used as a way to cut their overtime \n     pay.\n\n  That says it all. This Senate rejected the administration's proposal. \nThe House of Representatives rejected it. But the Bush administration \ninsists they are going to implement it. And they insisted in taking the \nSenate passed, House approved language protecting workers' overtime pay \nout of the Omnibus.\n  We are going to do everything we can, with every opportunity we have, \nto make sure that provision is overturned. We will do that every time \nwe get a chance as long as we are in Congress this session.\n  I will just take a minute to show what happens when people do not \nhave the overtime protection.\n  It is probably pretty understandable, workers without overtime \nprotection are more than twice as likely to work longer hours. This \nchart shows that for those workers working a scheduled 40-hour \nworkweek, without the overtime protection, 44 percent of them work \novertime. If they have overtime protection, in terms of time and a \nhalf, only 19 percent of them work overtime. If there is no overtime \nprotection for workers if they work over 50 hours a week, still, you \nget 15 percent of the workers who work more than 50 hours in a week; \nbut with overtime protection, only 5 percent work overtime. It is very \nclear what is going to happen to workers without overtime protection: \nThey are going to work harder--a lot harder--and make a good deal less \nmoney.\n  Is overtime protection what is wrong with our economy? Absolutely \nnot. I think this administration and this Congress ought to get it: \nPeople are hurting. And they are trying to find out who is on their \nside. We are going to address each and every one of these issues in the \ncourse of this Congress because that is required if we are going to be \na fair and decent country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the latest \nnumbers from the Congressional Budget Office that reveal the \nseriousness of the explosion in deficit and debt that is occurring in \nthis country.\n  Before I do that, when I came to the floor I heard the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, speaking about the change in overtime \nrules in this country and discussing the unfairness of what has \nhappened.\n  Just days ago, one of the people who works in this Capitol, who works \nwith us every day, talked to me about how this change in overtime would \naffect him and his family. This man is one of the camera technicians \nfor one of the networks that covers much of what we do in this body.\n  He took me aside the other day and said: Senator, this change in \novertime fundamentally threatens me and my family. If those changes go \nforward, if they are not stopped, I probably won't be able to keep my \nhouse, where I live with my wife and my two kids.\n  He said: In our business, an awful lot of our income is overtime pay \nbecause we don't work an 8-hour day. Sometimes we are here 16 hours. \nVery frequently we are here, and part of our pay is overtime pay. It is \nthat overtime pay that allows me and my family to own the home we are \nin and to have bought a new car last year and to have made improvements \nto the house. If these overtime changes go forward, it is going to \ndramatically change my life. I wonder what they are thinking of in \nterms of fueling the economy. I think my family and I have done a \npretty good job of fueling the economy. We bought a home, furnished the \nhome, bought a car--all because there was overtime pay. Now, if they \ntake that away, my family and tens of thousands of other families like \nmine are going to be in a much weakened situation.\n  I hope people are listening. I hope we have a chance to revisit these \nchanges in overtime that were permitted by the Omnibus appropriations \nbill that recently passed. There were lots of things in that omnibus \nbill that should be revisited. It is one of the unfortunate examples of \nwhat happens when a few people go in a back room someplace and come out \nwith a product that has\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\nhad too little scrutiny, too little involvement and, frankly, too \nlittle fairness.\n\n\n                        CBO Report on the Budget\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Congressional Budget Office \nreport on the budget condition of the United States. They have \nindicated that the deficit for this year will be $477 billion. That is \n$100 billion more than the biggest deficit we ever had. That was last \nyear's deficit. Now it is $100 billion more for 2004. Now the record of \nthe President on the question of fiscal responsibility is becoming more \nand more clear.\n  In the last year of the Clinton administration, we had a $236 billion \nbudget surplus. Now in the third year of this President, we have a $477 \nbillion budget deficit, the biggest by far, a record.\n  This chart shows the long-term relationship of the deficit. We can \nsee the $477 billion; last year it was $374 billion--both of those much \nbigger than the previous record deficit of $290 billion back in 1992 \nwhen the President's father was President, Bush 1, as they term it.\n  The President and some of his aides have said: Well, yes, in billion-\ndollar terms, they are record deficits, but as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product, it is not so big.\n  If we exclude Social Security instead of lumping it in with \neverything else, what we see is, even as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct, this deficit is the biggest since World War II, with the one \nexception of 1983. In 1983, there was virtually no Social Security \nsurplus.\n  This year, not only is the deficit off the charts at $477 billion, \nthat understates how much is being taken because under this President's \nplan he is also taking every penny of the Social Security surplus, over \n$150 billion. So on an operating basis, the deficit is over $620 \nbillion, on a budget of about $2.2 trillion, approaching $2.3 trillion.\n  Some say it is not that big. What are they talking about? An \noperating deficit of over $600 billion on a budget of $2.2 trillion, \nand that is not big? What would convince them it is big? It is the \nbiggest ever in dollar terms and one of the biggest ever, even if you \nlook at it as a percentage of gross domestic product.\n  But the biggest worry is not the deficit this year. The biggest worry \nis where this is all headed. If you add to what the Congressional \nBudget Office has told us, the President's recommendations for \nadditional tax cuts and the looming crisis in the alternative minimum \ntax, which will hit 40 million people in this country by 2013 if we \nfail to act, if we put just those two things in, no other additional \nspending, no more supplementals by the President, if we just take what \nthe Congressional Budget Office has told us plus the tax cuts the \nPresident is recommending, plus fixing the alternative minimum tax, we \ncan see there is no end to the red ink. In fact, it explodes as the \nbaby boom generation starts to retire, and a deficit on an operating \nbasis of more than $600 billion for this year will climb to $861 \nbillion by the end of this forecast period.\n  This is a record of fiscal irresponsibility that is utterly reckless. \nThat is the course the President has us on.\n  I hear the President say it is spending; spending is all the problem. \nLet us look at where the increases in spending have occurred. Ninety-\ntwo percent of the increase in discretionary spending has occurred in \ndefense, homeland security, and a third category that is rebuilding New \nYork, the airline bailout after September 11, and the increase in \ninternational affairs, a dramatic increase there, again, as a result of \nthe attack of September 11. As you can see, the vast majority of the \nincrease, 69 percent, is in defense alone. But 92 percent of the \nincrease in discretionary spending is in just these three categories.\n  Interestingly enough, the President says he is now going to restrain \ngrowth in what he calls discretionary spending. But if you look at what \nhas happened to the categories of discretionary spending, domestic \nspending has not been growing. Domestic spending is not the problem. \nNon-defense domestic spending, as the Administration defines it, \nexcluding international affairs and homeland security, has grown in \nreal terms in the last 2 years by just three-tenths of 1 percent. Now \nhe is going to restrain the growth by 1 percent in this category.\n  Again, remember, he has a special definition of the discretionary \nspending that he is constraining. Most of us think of defense and \nhomeland security as a part of discretionary spending that is growing. \nIndeed, that is where spending has grown. But on the discretionary \nspending that he has identified, excluding homeland security, excluding \ninternational affairs, excluding defense, there has been almost no real \ngrowth in spending in the last 2 years, three-tenths of 1 percent. Now \nhe says he is only going to allow it to grow 1 percent this year. That \nis not going to do much. That is a very small part of Federal spending. \nIn fact, that is only 17 percent of the Federal spending he is talking \nabout restraining.\n  So he is going to do very little to cope with these mushrooming \ndeficits. That is a fact. That is reality. If you look at the revenue \nside, it is very interesting. That is where the deficit has exploded. \nIt is largely on the revenue side.\n  This year, according to CBO, revenue will be at 15.8 percent of gross \ndomestic product. That is the lowest revenue as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product since 1950. Remember, when we had high revenue as a \npercentage of GDP, the President said the answer was tax cuts. Now that \nwe have revenue at the lowest it has been since 1950, the President's \nanswer is more tax cuts. Dig the hole deeper. Make the deficits bigger.\n  The President's plan doesn't add up. It doesn't come close to adding \nup. It fundamentally threatens our economic security long-term. We can \ngo back and check the President's record on what he has told us and \nwhat happened. In 2001, he told us:\n\n       We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits.\n\n  He was wrong.\n  In 2002, he told us:\n\n       Our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short-\n     term.\n\n  He was wrong.\n  In 2003, he told us:\n\n       Our current deficit is not large by historical standards \n     and is manageable.\n\n  It is hard to top a record. Not large by historical standards? It is \nthe biggest it has ever been by a huge margin--$100 billion bigger than \nlast year, and last year was a record. He was wrong again.\n  He said:\n\n       The deficit will be cut in half over the next 5 years.\n\n  Will he be wrong again? His track record is pretty clear; he has been \nwrong consistently. Does it matter?\n  There is a story in the Washington Post this morning about the dollar \nand how the dollar has gone down dramatically. What they said in this \narticle was:\n\n       Currency traders who are fretting over that dependency--\n\n  They are referring to the need to borrow money from abroad for our \ntrade deficit, borrow money from abroad for our budget deficit, and \nalso borrow money internally for our budget deficit.\n\n       Currency traders who are fretting over that dependency have \n     been selling dollars fast and buying euros furiously. The \n     fear is that foreigners will tire of financing America's \n     appetites. Foreign investors will dump U.S. assets, \n     especially stocks and bonds, sending financial markets \n     plummeting. Interest rates will shoot up to entice them back. \n     Heavily indebted Americans will not be able to keep up with \n     rising interest payments. Inflation, bankruptcies, and \n     economic malaise will follow.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the risk this President is running by \nconducting a fiscal policy that is absolutely irresponsible. I want to \nmake clear that I am less concerned about the deficit this year than I \nam about the long-term implications of this fiscal policy. That is what \nthese economists are warning us about. But it is not just them. We have \nthe Comptroller General of the United States, a Republican, warning us \nthat we are on an unsustainable course. We have the International \nMonetary Fund warning us that the buildup of deficits and debt in this \ncountry doesn't just threaten our own economic security, it \nfundamentally threatens the economic security of the globe.\n  We have already seen the effect on the dollar from these policies. \nThe dollar has plummeted. It is down nearly 30 percent against the euro \nin just 2 years. In the short term, that can be helpful to U.S. \nmanufacturers. But in the longer term, it is fundamentally threatening \nto our economic security.\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\n  If you think about it, if you were holding dollar-denominated \ninvestments, and you are a foreign investor, how would you feel if the \nunderlying value of that currency plummeted? Does that make sense to \ncontinue holding dollar-denominated investments? Warren Buffet, one of \nthe most successful investors in America, is quoted in the article as \nindicating he started to diversify his investments away from dollar-\ndenominated investments. He is not alone.\n\n  It is time for us to think carefully and clearly about our response \nto this growing fiscal crisis. Record budget deficits--some say they \ndon't matter. I think any sober person knows that deficits do matter. \nDeficits of this magnitude are simply stunning.\n  We are running deficits under this President this year of $900,000 a \nminute--$900,000 a minute. Every minute that goes by, under this \nPresident's budget plan, we are spending $900,000 more than we take in. \nThat is a course that is not sustainable. It must be changed. The \nPresident says he has a plan--it appears to be a secret plan at this \npoint--to cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years. But that \navoids the much larger issue because we know from all of the work that \nhas been done that the deficit will recede from these record levels. \nCutting it in half is not much of an accomplishment when you are \nrunning an operating deficit of over $600 billion a year. And what is \nof deepest concern is that the President's budget plan, which, if he is \ngood to his word, will reduce the deficit somewhat over the next few \nyears, puts us on course for the deficit absolutely to explode as his \ntax cuts become permanent and as the baby boomers retire. That is the \nmuch greater threat to the economic security of this country.\n  When the Federal Government runs massive deficits, that puts upward \npressure on interest rates. When interest rates go up, that slows \neconomic growth and economic activity. That is a reality. This is a \nreckless course the President has taken us on, and not just in the \nshort term. In the short term, we can afford deficits to give lift to \nthe economy. The President is proposing massive deficits even at a time \nwhen he projects strong economic growth. CBO is telling us the economy \nwill grow at 3\\1/2\\ percent a year over the next 5 years. Well, 3\\1/2\\ \npercent growth is considered relatively strong in an advanced economy. \nYet we see no end to the budget deficits under the President's plan. In \nfact, once we get past this 5-year period and the baby boomers start to \nretire, the deficits absolutely explode. That is a reality.\n  It is time for the President and this Congress to address that very \ndeep challenge to America's economic future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I would like to address for a few \nmoments the bill that is now on the floor, H.R. 3108, dealing with \npension funding for defined benefit pension plans. The House passed \nthis bill. In the House version of the bill, what it does is it mainly \nchanges the interest rate assumptions that plans are required to use \nwhen figuring their actuarial liability for their pension plans and for \ntheir annuitants in their plans.\n  The House bill mainly addresses the situation that has arisen by \nvirtue of the 30-year Government bond being done away with. A few years \nago, the Treasury Department made the decision that it would no longer \nissue 30-year Treasury bonds and the interest rate for 30-year Treasury \nbonds had historically been what was used in calculating the \nliabilities for defined benefit pension plans. Now that there are fewer \nand fewer 30-year Government bonds in circulation, the interest rates \nfor those bonds have gone down, and, of course, interest rates have \nbeen very low in general for the last couple of years.\n  So industries in sectors where defined benefit pension plans are \ncommon have come to Washington, asking for some relief in the way they \ncalculate their unfunded liabilities, or their liabilities, and they \nhave asked for the replacement of the 30-year Treasury bond with a \nbenchmark that is, instead, made up of the yield of high-grade \ncorporate bonds. By going to that different reference point, plans \nultimately will have to put less money in their pension plans because \nthey can assume a higher rate of return if they are using 30-year \ncorporate debt or high-grade corporate debt as opposed to 30-year \nTreasury bonds.\n  In fact, right now companies in America, absent any legislation, \nwould have to put about $170 billion into their defined benefit pension \nplans next year. If the interest rate relief alone in H.R. 3108 is \npassed, that will cut about 25 percent off the required payments that \nall companies with defined benefit pension plans will be required to \nmake into their plans over the next 2 years. So the relief in this bill \nas it passed the House--and the only relief in the House bill is the \ninterest rate relief--if that relief passes, it would cut about $40 \nbillion per year off the amount that companies have to put into their \ndefined benefit pension plans. Over 2 years, the life of the bill, it \nwould cut $80 billion off of the required payments.\n  What has happened in the Senate is somewhat disappointing, to me. I \ncould see the public policy rationale for changing the interest rate \nbenchmark that companies use, now that we have done away with the 30-\nyear Treasury bond. I can see the argument for coming up with a \ndifferent reference. I can see the argument for changing the \nassumptions that would allow plans to put less money into their pension \nplans. But the Senate is going way beyond that. In addition to giving \nthe interest rate relief that the House passed, the Senate now is on \nthe verge of passing amendments that would provide special relief for \nairlines and steel companies.\n  The airlines and the steel companies would get further reductions in \nthe amounts they have to pay into their pension plans. This is very \ntroubling because airlines and steel companies, as we all know, tend to \nhave the most woefully underfunded pensions of all industry in America. \nObviously, they are asking for permission to dig their hole even \ndeeper.\n\n  In addition, the Senate amendment that will be offered this week has \na sweetheart provision for Greyhound Bus Company. I don't know why \nGreyhound Bus Company is singled out for this special treatment of all \nthe companies in America, but it certainly must have some powerful \nfriends here on Capitol Hill.\n  Also getting a sweetheart deal is CNF Trucking, which apparently gets \nsome sort of relief in this bill and some limitation on liability that \nit might have to a former subsidiary that it spun off a couple of years \nago.\n  So there are a couple of sweetheart deals, not just for some chosen \nindustries, the airlines and steel companies, but also some rifle shots \nthat would be put in here for two special companies, Greyhound and CNF \nTrucking.\n  In addition, and perhaps most discouraging, is that the Senate \namendment will, in effect, go way beyond just the steel and the airline \nindustries and allow all companies that have underfunded pension plans \nto go through a political process in applying for a waiver from their \nrequired contributions to their pension plans. All companies would be \nable to go to the Treasury Department and request a waiver.\n  If this provision becomes law, you can just imagine right before the \nelection all the industrial companies in the Upper Midwest, in \nMichigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, and so forth, all those \nindustrial companies in States that are critical for the upcoming \nelection, they will all be going to the administration, asking for this \nspecial waiver from the Treasury Department. They will be making \npolitical threats at the same time, that if the administration doesn't \ngive them this relief, they may just support someone else for \nPresident. It sets a very bad precedent because now there is a waiver \nprocess. But it is an apolitical one, and one for which you have to \napply with the Internal Revenue Service and also with the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation.\n\n  As I said, if it were merely adopting the interest rate relief, we \nwould be granting a 25-percent reduction in the\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\nrequired contribution of all companies in toto in America to their \ndefined benefit pension plans. We are going way beyond that. In the \nSenate amendment, we are threatening to grant them an additional about \n$17 billion a year, at least in reductions in required amounts going \ninto pension funds.\n  There is also a provision in the Senate amendment in the managers' \npackage that will allow all multiemployer pension plans--those are \nunion-run plans which span employers--from having to make their full \ncontributions.\n  All of these reductions in required contributions into the pension \nplans wouldn't be so troublesome but for one fact: In allowing these \ncompanies to dig the hole deeper for themselves, it is more likely that \nthey will ultimately default on their pension obligations and turn \nthose obligations over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to \ntake advantage of the Government guarantee. It wouldn't be so offensive \nif it were freezing the Government guarantees. But we are not.\n  There is a no hold harmless provision in this legislation. There are \nno reforms of pension funding trying to get tough on the companies that \nhave considerably underfunded their pension plans. We are just allowing \nthem to skip required payments into their pension plans. We are \nallowing the government guarantees to stay in place.\n  What is more, we are allowing the companies with underfunded plans to \ncontinue sweetening the benefits for their workers and raising their \nown pension liabilities while those pension liabilities are all \nguaranteed by the Federal Government.\n  I know pension funding is something that perhaps makes the eyes of \nthe press glaze over. Not many members of the public understand the \nimportance of this. This is a very roundabout way of transferring \nliabilities to taxpayers. It is not easy for people to understand. But \nif I were to make an analogy that the average American could understand \nabout what we are doing here, imagine that you have someone who is \nbehind in their credit card payments. Imagine that you said to that \nperson, you are behind in making your payments on the credit card. You \nare only making the minimum payment. You are trying to make a minimum \npayment due each month. You have this huge balance. It is going to take \nyears and years to pay off this deficit of what you owe the credit card \ncompany or the bank. Imagine if this person were to have their minimum \npayments lowered. Imagine that when they are already just barely making \nthe minimum payments, you say: OK, we will even lower your minimum \npayment.\n  We are doing that here. But in addition, we are going beyond that. We \nare telling the credit card holder while you are lowering your minimum \npayments and digging the hole deeper so that you are likely never to \nget out of debt, we are going to go out and allow you to continue \nspending and add more to your credit card. Can you imagine a credit \ncard company telling anybody that? That wouldn't be a way to advise a \ndistressed consumer to try to get out of debt.\n  We are doing that and more here today in the Senate. We are not only \nallowing these companies to quit making their required payments into \ntheir pension plans, but we are allowing them to continue spending. We \nare allowing them, specifically if they are 60-percent funded, to keep \nsweetening the pension benefits for their employees and digging the \nhole deeper. That would be not only allowing the credit card holder to \nkeep spending but encouraging the credit card holder to go out while \nthey are behind in the payments on this one credit card and get some \nmore credit cards and run up balances on those credit cards.\n\n  Obviously, if we pass this legislation we are going to make it \nhopeless for some companies ever to recover and to fulfill the promises \nthey have made to their pension participants.\n  Right now, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation--the Government \ncorporation that guarantees pension benefits of people in defined \npension plans--is in the worst financial condition of its entire \nhistory. It has at least a $11.2 billion deficit. Pension plans in \nAmerica are now thought to be underfunded by at least $350 billion. \nThis legislation would allow that collective underfunding in defined \nbenefit pension plans in America to grow considerably.\n  The House was much more responsible. It only passed the change in \ninterest rate assumptions. It passed the separate version of the bill \nthat had the interest rate change, plus some relief for airlines. The \nSenate is poised to go much further. I am troubled by that. The \nadministration has issued a threat to veto the legislation.\n  I refer to a letter. This is a Statement of Administration Policy \nthat was issued on January 22. I ask unanimous consent that Statement \nof Administration Policy on H.R. 3108 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 2004.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                 h.r. 3108--pension funding equity act\n\n       The Administration supports prompt Senate passage of H.R. \n     3108, the Pension Funding Equity Act. The Administration \n     supports the interest rate provisions in the bill, which are \n     consistent with the transitional portion of the \n     Administration proposal for more accurate discounting of \n     pension liabilities. The Administration also supports the \n     provision in H.R. 3108 that calls for comprehensive funding \n     reform to protect the benefits American workers have earned.\n       H.R. 3108 passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan \n     support. Since that time, the temporary adjustment to the \n     statutory rate for discounting pension liabilities has \n     expired, which means that employers are denied important \n     short-term funding relief unless and until legislative action \n     is taken.\n       Recent data from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \n     (PBGC) highlight the importance of passing this legislation \n     free of additional provisions that would worsen underfunding \n     in America's pension plans. The PBGC reports a record single-\n     employer program deficit of $11.2 billion, which is three \n     times larger than any previously recorded deficit, and the \n     first multiemployer program deficit in two decades, as of the \n     end of fiscal year 2003. In addition, the PBGC remains \n     exposed to $85 billion in pension underfunding in plans \n     sponsored by financially weak employers.\n       Consequently, the Administration will strongly oppose any \n     amendment that would substantially weaken funding \n     requirements for single-employer or multiemployer pension \n     plans.\n       The Administration is developing comprehensive reform \n     proposals to strengthen America's defined benefit pensions, \n     and has consistently taken the position that any provisions \n     to alter the DRC rules should be reviewed in that context. \n     The DRC is part of a flawed system of funding rules that \n     should be reviewed and reformed. A well-structured system of \n     funding rules would lead to less volatility in employer \n     contribution requirements, while producing stronger pension \n     funding over time.\n\n                         Pay-As-You-Go Scoring\n\n       The Budget Enforcement Act's pay-as-you-go requirements and \n     discretionary spending caps expired on September 30, 2002. \n     The Administration supports the extension of these budget \n     enforcement mechanisms in a manner that ensures fiscal \n     discipline and is consistent with the President's budget. \n     OMB's cost estimate of this bill currently is under \n     development.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, a couple of days ago, Elaine Chao, \nSecretary of the Department of Labor; John Snow, Secretary of the \nTreasury; and Don Evans, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce, \nthe three board members of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, \nwrote a letter to our majority leader, Bill Frist, which asks that the \nSenate not go beyond amending the interest rate changes that were \npassed by the House. They said they would oppose it and recommend that \nthe President veto any legislation that would further exacerbate the \nsystemic underfunding of defined benefit pension plans in America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Pension Benefit Guaranty\n\n\n                                                  Corporation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 2004.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: As you are aware, the Senate has entered \n     into a unanimous consent agreement for the consideration of \n     H.R. 3108, the Pension Funding Equity Act. We appreciate the \n     Senate's timely action on this issue of great importance to \n     America's workers and pension plan sponsors. We are writing \n     to you in our role as the board of the Pension Benefit \n     Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).\n       At the end of 2003, the temporary adjustment to the \n     statutory rate for discounting pension liabilities expired. \n     This has denied pension plan sponsors the certainty they need \n     to plan their pension funding for 2004.\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\n     The Administration has expressed its support for the \n     provision in H.R. 3108 that would discount pension \n     liabilities for the next two years using a blend of long-term \n     corporate bond rates.\n       The PBGC reported a record single-employer program deficit \n     of $11.2 billion through the end of 2003, three times larger \n     than any previously recorded deficit. Last year, the General \n     Accounting Office added the PBGC's single-employer pension \n     program to its ``high risk'' federal program list. In \n     addition, the PBGC remains exposed to $85 billion in pension \n     underfunding in single-employer plans sponsored by \n     financially weak employers. The PBGC also reported the first \n     multi-employer program deficit in two decades.\n       Pension underfunding threatens workers and retirees, who \n     depend on the defined benefit pension system to be \n     predictable and reliable. If the Congress encourages firms to \n     underfund their pensions by substantially weakening pension \n     funding requirements, retirees could face pension cuts when a \n     firm terminates its defined benefit pension plan.\n       We believe that H.R. 3108 would best protect pensions and \n     pensioners if passed free of any provisions to alter the \n     Deficit Reduction Contribution (DRC) rules. Specifically, it \n     would be irresponsible to amend the interest rate bill with \n     any additional provisions that would significantly further \n     exacerbate systemic pension plan underfunding. If H.R. 3108 \n     were amended to do so, we as the PBGC board would recommend \n     that the President veto the legislation.\n       The Administration is developing comprehensive proposals to \n     strengthen America's defined benefit pensions, and any \n     provisions to alter the DRC rules should be reviewed in the \n     context of reforms to strengthen pension funding over time. \n     We look forward to working with you in the future to \n     strengthen the protection of the pension benefits that \n     America's workers have earned.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that this \n     letter is consistent with the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Elaine L. Chao,\n       Chairman, Board of Directors.\n     John W. Snow,\n       Director.\n     Donald L. Evans,\n       Director.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I think the Washington Post editorial \npage had a very good editorial on this issue this morning. They dealt \nwith the irresponsibility of allowing companies with underfunded \npension plans to dig the hole deeper. They also talked about how it is \ntroubling that in Washington there are always incentives for Members of \nthe House and Senate to do what is wrong, to cater to the special \ninterests--in this case, the airlines, the steel companies. This is a \nsituation in which the airlines and the steel companies and their \nmanagers have conspired with their union members to come to Congress \nand allow dispensation which allows the companies to put less money \ninto their pension plans. And no one in those companies cares because \nthe pension plans are guaranteed by the taxpayers. So you have the \nlabor unions and you have the managers coming here to Washington \nlobbying for this relief.\n  We have gone far beyond just the airline and steel companies. \nApparently, in the Senate bill every company in America would be \neligible to ask the Secretary of Treasury for a waiver from its pension \ncontributions.\n  Allow me to read this editorial from this morning's Washington Post. \nIt is called ``Pension Perniciousness.''\n  Monday, January 26, 2004, by the Washington Post:\n\n       Not for the first time, Congress has muscled up to an \n     important problem, taken a good long look at it and resolved \n     to make it worse. The problem is the vast hole in the \n     nation's corporate pension schemes, and the perverse rules \n     that helped create them. Congress's solution, championed in \n     the Senate by an alliance of Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-\n     Iowa), Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Edward \n     M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), is to reward the hole-diggers with what \n     amounts to a $16 billion loan from taxpayers.\n       About one in five private-sector workers has a ``defined-\n     benefit'' pension, the sort in which an employer guarantees a \n     certain pension to its workers when they retire. To pay for \n     these future benefits, employers are supposed to put \n     sufficient money into a pension fund; the problem is they \n     often don't. The gap between money put aside and money needed \n     in the underfunded pension plans comes to an enormous $350 \n     billion. When companies go bust, the Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corp., the government-backed entity that insures pensions, \n     gets saddled with plans that are in deficit. As a result, the \n     PBGC itself has a deficit of $11.2 billion, which taxpayers \n     may have to plug eventually. As more companies go bust, more \n     of the $350 billion problem out there in the private sector \n     will land on taxpayers' shoulders.\n       Why do companies run these pension deficits? Because \n     regulations perversely encourage them to do so. If a firm \n     gives workers a pay raise, it will have to pay for that \n     immediately; if it gives them an increase in their pension, \n     accounting rules allow it to defer the cost into the future. \n     This deferral is especially tempting for cash-strapped \n     companies--which often means ones with a strong chance of \n     going bust. Bethlehem Steel, for example, upped its pension \n     promises and declared bankruptcy three years later. Wobbly \n     companies that underfund their pensions would pay extra \n     insurance premiums if the insurer were a private company. But \n     the PBGC's rules do not allow it to price risk properly, \n     adding a further incentive for shaky companies to hitch a \n     free ride with the others.\n       There is, as Congress is demonstrating, no political \n     constituency for fixing this problem. Weak companies with \n     underfunded pensions lobby lawmakers for permission to \n     continue their imprudence; labor leaders from those same \n     firms lobby lawmakers in the same direction; nobody is on the \n     other side. In the deal currently being cooked up, a group of \n     hard-pressed companies led by the steel industry and the \n     airlines will be given a special break for two years; if any \n     of these firms goes bust in the meantime, the public will end \n     up shouldering the deficits, which is why the congressional \n     measure amounts to a taxpayer loan.\n       Yet taxpayer support for people in defined-benefit pension \n     plans is a perverse notion. Fully one in two private-sector \n     workers has no company pension plan whatever. Why should the \n     less fortunate bail out the lucky ones?\n\n  That was the editorial from this morning's Washington Post. It \naccurately summed up the imprudence of the bill that the Senate will be \nconsidering this week. Ideally, it would be great if the Senate did not \npass such an irresponsible bill. Obviously, as the Washington Post \npoints out, when you have labor leaders and CEOs of airlines and steel \ncompanies lobbying together, conspiring together to stick a liability \nof theirs off on the taxpayers, I fear they are probably going to win.\n  My hope, however, is that the House, which has been more responsible \non this issue, and the White House, which is opposed to the vast \nexpansion of underfunded liabilities that would be engendered by this \nlegislation--my hope is that the White House and the House will prevail \nupon the conference committee to pass something more responsible than \nthe legislation currently before the Senate.\n  One final point. The Washington Post editorial referred to this case \nof Bethlehem Steel and the editorial talked about how Bethlehem Steel \nwas sweetening its pension benefits for the 3 years prior to its going \ninto bankruptcy; then it just handed the pension plan and all its \nliabilities off on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and, by \nextension, the taxpayers.\n  That brings up another issue. Some people think the pension funding \nrules are too severe for companies in America and that we ask too much \nof companies in the ERISA law where we require them to fund their \npension plans as well as possible. But it turns out that--I held a \nhearing on this issue over the summer and what I found was very \ntroubling--the current rules are exceedingly lax. The law, ERISA, which \nwas passed in 1974, requires defined benefit plans to be 90 percent \nfunded. If they are not 90 percent funded, they have to make extra \ncatchup payments. But that 90 percent funding level is referred to in \nERISA as ``current liability.'' It turns out that the definition of \ncurrent liability is not an actuarial definition. It is not the \ndefinition of how much would actually be owed to pay the benefits that \nhave been promised. It turns out that the definition of current \nliability is actually a political definition.\n  To illustrate this, the Bethlehem Steel case probably is the best \nexample of how woefully inadequate the current pension funding rules \nare. In its last filing with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, \nBethlehem Steel claimed it was 84 percent funded on a current liability \nbasis. That was Bethlehem Steel's last filing. Then they filed for \nbankruptcy and handed their pension plan over to the PBGC. It turns out \nthat Bethlehem Steel's pension plan was not 84 percent funded; it was \nonly 45 percent funded as a percentage of how much the PBGC actually \nhad to pay, to pay the benefits that had been promised.\n  That example shows how the pension funding laws of this country are \nalready woefully lax. We are allowing companies to make promises to \nemployees that they have no hope of ever fulfilling, promises which \nrisk that the taxpayers will ultimately have to pay\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\nthese pensions. This legislation the Senate is considering this week \nwill make this lax funding of pensions in this country far more lax. It \nwill do a lot of long-term damage.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will think carefully about this \nnotwithstanding the political pressures they will have from airline \nexecutives and from labor union leaders.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2236 to Amendment No. 2233\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an amendment No. 2236 at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kyl) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2236 to amendment No. 2233.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To restrict an employer that elected an alternative deficit \n       reduction contribution from applying for a funding waiver)\n\n       At the end of section 3, insert:\n       (__) Restrictions on Application for Funding Waiver for \n     Employers Electing Alternative Deficit Reduction \n     Contribution.--An employer who makes an election under \n     section 412(l)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or \n     section 302(d)(12) of the Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act of 1974 (as added by this section) with respect to a plan \n     for 2 plan years may not receive a funding waiver under \n     section 412(d) of such Code for any plan year beginning after \n     December 27, 2005, and before December 28, 2007.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will describe the amendment briefly, the \nreason for the amendment, and set the stage here. Of course, the \npending business is H.R. 3108, a bill the House passed, dealing with \nthe requirements for businesses to pay into the pension fund to ensure \nthat all of the promises they have made to their employees about \npension benefits being there will in fact exist when the time comes.\n  What has happened is some Senators have offered an amendment to that \nbill which would provide what we call deficit reduction contribution \nrelief. Deficit reductions are the amounts of money the companies are \nsupposed to pay into the fund to ensure the fund will be able to \ncompensate any employees on the pension that has been promised to them. \nWe have had a deficit in that pension over the last few years because \nof the way the amounts due were calculated. That is being fixed. But in \nthe meantime there has to be some kind of makeup payment to account for \nthe deficit that has been created. This deficit reduction contribution \nwill do that.\n  The problem is some specific industries are seeking relief from that \nso they don't have to pay in as much money. They are asking in effect \nfor a waiver of the requirement that they pay this money into the \npension fund so their employees will be able to collect when the time \ncomes. Their argument is they don't have enough money. That should be \nour first clue that there is a problem. If they don't have enough money \nto pay their employees what they are due, we probably should not dig \nthe hole any deeper by allowing them to continue to make promises and \nnot pay into the fund what is necessary for them eventually to pay to \ntheir employees.\n  Some of the Senators have decided what we are going to do is grant a \n2-year partial waiver just to certain airlines and two steel companies. \nOne of the airlines, it is said, cannot afford to pay the premium that \nwould be required, or the bond payment that would be required, if they \nsought a general waiver from the Treasury Department, which you can do. \nIf you are having trouble making your payments, you can go to the \nSecretary of the Treasury and meet certain requirements and say I would \nlike to have a general waiver. That could be granted. This company \napparently doesn't even have the money to pay for the bond that would \nbe required in order to seek that relief. But they are asking us to \nbelieve if we will just bail them out for 2 years, everything will be \nfine; they will have enough money, and the Government won't have to \nmake up any of the difference.\n  The concern I and others have expressed is this partial waiver is \ngoing to result in the Government letting these companies off the hook, \npaying less money into the fund than is necessary, and a couple years \nfrom now, if they don't make it financially, it is the taxpayers who \nwill be on the hook for that difference because we have not had them \npay the full amount. In fact, they are only going to have to pay 20 \npercent of their obligation next year and only 40 percent the year \nafter that. So it is a 2-year waiver of almost the entire amount.\n  I would say this ought to be of concern to us. I don't think it is a \ngood idea to grant this waiver, and the three key people in the Bush \nadministration who sit on the board that oversees this have said they \nwould recommend a veto to the President if this deficit reduction \ncontribution amendment causes any greater strain on the board to make \npayments.\n  What I have done is offer one amendment, and this is the second \namendment, both of which will reduce that strain just a little bit, \nhopefully enough so the Bush administration will not veto this \nlegislation, should it end up passing.\n  I urge colleagues, those who agree with me that this whole deficit \nreduction contribution waiver is not a good idea and those who think it \nis a good idea but might be a little bit concerned the administration \nmight veto the bill over that provision, to support my amendments \nbecause they are designed to close the loophole a little bit so that at \nleast the companies that are taking advantage of this 2-year waiver \ncannot take unfair or undue advantage of it.\n  Let me describe what the amendment specifically does. The amendment, \nwhich I have just offered, provides that a company which seeks to take \nadvantage of this special waiver, where you would only have to pay 20 \npercent next year and 40 percent the year later, then would not, at the \nend of the 2-year period, also then be able to go to the Secretary of \nthe Treasury and say: Now we want a general waiver. The law currently \nprovides for a general waiver, and if you want a general waiver, you \ncan apply for it.\n  This special waiver that is being granted is designed to be a \nsubstitute for the general waiver, not where you would add one on top \nof the other. I think it is a perfectly reasonable request.\n  I would ask, if anybody is against this, why? Is it because, after \nthe 2-year special waiver, they then want to seek a general waiver? The \nquestion then would be, if that is the case, why don't you seek a \ngeneral waiver right now?\n  I think it is a perfectly legitimate amendment. It obviously doesn't \nupset the whole process. The deficit reduction contribution amendment \nthat has been offered will still be permitted to go forward, but what I \nwould call a little bit of a loophole would be closed so the company \nthat gets this 2-year holiday date from making their full DRC payments \nwould not then afterward also be able to apply for a general waiver \nunder the provisions of law that already permits that to be done. It is \nvery simple.\n  By the way, just a word about the general waiver. You can apply to \nthe Treasury Department for any or all of the normal required \ncontributions to the pension fund, and the only part of the \ncontribution Treasury cannot waive is an amortization payment of a \nprevious funding waiver, which makes sense. To receive a waiver, a \ncompany must show there is substantial business hardship, which these \ncompanies all allege; that it is temporary, and they make that point: \nWe are going to be healthy in 2 years, they say. Good. And it is \nreasonable to expect the plan cannot continue unless the waiver is \ngranted. In other words, if they can't continue to pay into the pension \nfund unless a waiver is granted, as I say, a bond can be required of \nthe Secretary to show their good faith.\n  I think it is a perfectly sound amendment. Those people who don't \nlike the DRC waiver, like myself, and those who do should support the \namendment.\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\nFor those who do like the waiver, it doesn't hurt the companies they \nare seeking to help, and it might actually prevent the bill from being \nvetoed by the President.\n  Let me tell you what I have in this regard. I understand my colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Fitzgerald, has already submitted into the \nRecord this letter, so I will not do it, but I would like to make \nreference to the letter, dated January 22, 2004. It is on the \nletterhead of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which is the \nFederal entity that guarantees Federal pensions. It is to Leader Bill \nFrist, and it is signed by Elaine Chao, the Chairman of the Board of \nDirectors, John Snow, director, and Don Evans, director. You might also \nrecall that Elaine Chao is Secretary of the Department of Labor; John \nSnow is Secretary of the Treasury; and Don Evans, of course, is \nSecretary of Commerce. These three important members of the Cabinet are \nthe three board members of the PBGC or the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation.\n\n  What they said in their letter to Senator Frist, among other things, \nis this:\n\n       The PBGC reported a record single-employer program deficit \n     of $11.2 billion through the end of 2003--\n\n  One of my colleagues earlier said there was a $20 billion surplus in \ntheir fund. This letter from the directors notes an $11.2 billion \ndeficit. They point out:\n\n     three times larger than any previously recorded deficit. Last \n     year, the General Accounting Office added the PBGC's single-\n     employer pension program to its ``high risk'' federal program \n     list. In addition, the PBGC remains exposed to $85 billion in \n     pension underfunding in single-employee plans sponsored by \n     financially weak employers. The PBGC also reported the first \n     multi-employer program deficit in two decades.\n\n  What this means is that the PBGC, which is the guarantor of \nemployers' pensions, is in very bad financial condition--a $11.2 \nbillion deficit. It is in the high-risk category of Federal programs. \nThat means that if we add to the risk by reducing the amount that \nemployers pay into the fund, then we are increasing the risk that \ntaxpayers will have to bail these companies out because the fund will \nnot have enough money to make the payments.\n  It is a little surprising to me that people who ordinarily like to \npresent themselves as on the side of employees would be taking the \nsides of the employers here saying: Let's let them off the hook so they \ndon't have to pay as much into this fund for the pensions of their \nemployees.\n  The fund exists for the employees, and I would like to be sure there \nis enough money in those funds to ensure the employees are paid. But \nwhen we relieve the companies of paying their full obligation, we are \ncreating a risk that the employees are not going to be paid.\n  The answer of the bill sponsors is: We will have the Government pick \nup that risk. After all, that is the job of the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation. The directors of the Corporation are saying: We \nare in financial trouble. We don't have enough money to do this. So \nguess who is going to have to make up the difference. You guessed it: \nour constituents, the taxpayers.\n  Haven't we heard a great deal recently about the fact the Federal \nGovernment is spending too much taxpayer money and we have to start \nreining in how much we spend? Right now we are committing to spend a \nwhole lot more because the board that backs up the pension funds is in \na deficit situation. The companies that are seeking relief say they \ndon't have enough money to cover the obligations to which they have \ncommitted. That leaves only one party to make up the difference: the \ntaxpayer. And that means either they pay for it in taxes that we \ncollect or we have to go out and borrow it. Nobody likes the size of \nthe deficit.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, those of you who are \nsupporting this bill and this amendment--not my amendment but the \nunderlying amendment--are guaranteeing that we are going to have a \nbigger deficit, more taxpayer funding of an obligation that \ncorporations took on because the corporations don't have the money to \ndo it themselves.\n\n  This amendment is asking that we relieve them of the full 100 percent \nof what they are supposed to pay in; that for 1 year, they only pay in \n20 percent, and for the other year they only pay 40 percent of this \nmakeup payment, this deficit reduction payment that is required to make \nup the full amount. We are doing it because they are pleading that they \ndon't have enough money.\n  My observation is, when you are in a hole, the first thing you do to \nget out of it is to stop digging.\n  Today's edition of the Washington Post makes the same point. I \nunderstand Senator Fitzgerald also put this in the Record. But let me \nquote a couple lines from this editorial called ``Pension \nPerniciousness'' from the Washington Post today. They point out:\n\n       Not for the first time, Congress has muscled up to an \n     important problem, taken a good long look at it and resolved \n     to make it worse. The problem is the vast hole in the \n     nation's corporate pension schemes, and the perverse rules \n     that helped create them.\n\n  Then it talks about the bill that has been introduced by our \ncolleagues ``to reward the hole diggers with what amounts to a $16 \nbillion loan from taxpayers.'' That is why I say we are already in a \nhole. This old rancher friend of mine from Apache County said, if you \nare in a hole, the first thing to do to get out is to stop digging. We \nare digging the hole even deeper because instead of the companies \ntrying to fill this hole, we are going to have a deeper hole with \ngreater taxpayer exposure as a result.\n  They point out in the Washington Post editorial:\n\n       To pay for these future benefits--\n\n  That are promised to employees--\n\n     employers are supposed to put sufficient money into a pension \n     fund; the problem is they often don't. The gap between money \n     put aside and money needed in the underfunded pension plans \n     comes to an enormous $350 billion. When companies go bust, \n     the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the Government-backed \n     entity that insures pensions, gets saddled with plans that \n     are in deficit. As a result, the PBGC itself has a deficit of \n     $11.2 billion, which taxpayers may have to plug eventually.\n\n  And then, down toward the end of the editorial, they say this:\n\n       There is, as Congress is demonstrating, no political \n     constituency for fixing this problem. Weak companies with \n     underfunded pensions lobby lawmakers for permission to \n     continue their imprudence; labor leaders from those same \n     firms lobby lawmakers in the same direction; nobody is on the \n     other side. In the deal currently being cooked up, a group of \n     hard-pressed companies led by the steel industry and the \n     airlines will be given a special break for two years; if any \n     of these firms goes bust in the meantime, the public will end \n     up shouldering the deficits, which is why the congressional \n     measure amounts to a taxpayer loan.\n\n  In the letter to leader Frist from the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation directors, the three Secretaries I mentioned earlier, are \nthese two points. I quote now:\n\n       Pension underfunding threatens workers and retirees, who \n     depend on the defined benefit pension system to be \n     predictable and reliable. If the Congress urges firms to \n     underfund their pensions by substantially weakening funding \n     requirements, retirees could face pension cuts when a firm \n     terminates its defined benefit pension plan.\n       We believe that H.R. 3108 would best protect pensions and \n     pensioners if passed free of any provisions to alter the \n     Deficit Reduction Contribution rules--DRC rules. \n     Specifically, it would be irresponsible to amend the interest \n     rate bill with any additional provisions that would \n     significantly further exacerbate systemic pension plan \n     underfunding. If H.R. 3108 were amended to do so, we as the \n     PBGC board would recommend that the President veto the \n     legislation.\n\n  By the way, they note that the Office of Management and Budget has \nadvised that this letter is consistent with the administration's \nprogram.\n  What you have here is a pretty firm warning from the key Secretaries \nin the Bush administration, the people who sit as directors on the \nboard here of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, that if the \nunderlying amendment that is proposed here passes, and it significantly \n``further exacerbates the systemic pension plan underfunding''--which I \nthink it is hard to argue would not occur--they would recommend a veto \nof this legislation.\n  The two amendments I have offered--the one I offered Friday which \nwould hold the PBGC harmless for obligations incurred after this, that \nwould be incurred during the time of and for 2 years after this DRC \nwaiver plan, and the amendment I offered today which simply provides \nthat a company that takes advantage of this DRC waiver not be able to \napply also for a general waiver--these two amendments should make the \nDRC amendment slightly less\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\nonerous. It may be enough for the administration, then, to decide to \nallow the amendment to go forward and not recommend a veto.\n  But I am afraid if my two amendments--both of which I think one could \nargue are not harmful to the companies but they might be just enough \nfor the administration to conclude that it is willing to allow these to \ngo to the President without a recommended veto--don't pass, one of two \nthings will happen: Either the President will veto the legislation or, \nif he doesn't, the taxpayers are going to be required to make up a \nfairly large amount of money when these companies decide they can't \nmake it in the long run.\n  I hope my colleagues will give consideration to this. It is my \nunderstanding that perhaps, after the lunches tomorrow, somewhere in \nthe 2:45 timeframe, we may have a vote on these two amendments. We will \nhave about a half-hour to discuss the two amendments, so anybody who \nhas missed the discussion, the robust debate we are engaged in here, \nwill have an opportunity to at least hear both sides of the argument \nand then we will vote on these at 2:45 tomorrow.\n  Again, I reiterate, I can argue that the DRC waiver that is being \nproposed here by the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from Montana, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, and the Senator from Massachusetts greatly \njeopardizes the financial stability of the PBGC; the granting of a 2-\nyear waiver of most of the payment obligations into the fund is a bad \nidea. I think a lot of our colleagues agree to that.\n  What I am saying is, even if you don't agree with that, if you \nsupport the two steel companies or the two airlines--I think there are \ntwo or three airlines that want to take advantage of this--if those are \nyour constituents and you need to support them here, you need to try to \ngive them some relief so they don't have to pay as much money in over \nthe next 2 years--I understand why you would have to do that. But I \nwould argue, A, don't saddle everybody else with that and, B, if you \nreally want it to go into law, it would be important to make sure the \nPresident doesn't veto this legislation. Three Secretaries have already \ngiven you a pretty good idea this is what they are going to recommend \nif this DRC waiver is actually adopted by the Senate tomorrow.\n  What I am suggesting is that you can ameliorate the effect of that \njust a little bit by adopting these two amendments. One would ensure \nthat, as I said about the amendment today, there are not going to be \nany additional waivers granted. The waiver you get for 2 years is it; \nYou don't add a general waiver behind that. I think that is consistent \nwith the intent of the authors here. I certainly hope they will be \nwilling to support that. And, second, the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nBoard would be held harmless for obligations that were incurred once a \ncompany began to take advantage of the special waiver provisions. That \nis only fair.\n  I hope my colleagues will support both of these amendments. Take a \nlook at the Washington Post editorial of today. Certainly take a look \nat the letter from Secretaries Chao, Evans, and Snow, and consider \nwhether a very slight amendment to the underlying amendment would not \nbe appropriate in order to preserve the intention of what they are \ntrying to achieve.\n  I appreciate the earlier comments from my colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Fitzgerald. I think he hit the nail right on the head. I note \none of the airlines seeking to take advantage of this has reported a \nhuge amount of cash on hand, over a couple of billion dollars of cash \non hand. Yet it is saying it doesn't have enough money to make these \nmodest payments into this fund. It seems to me either that corporation \ncould apply for a general waiver, which it could get today, or it can \nafford to make the payments into the fund. It should not be up to the \ntaxpayers of this country to be bailing out a company in that kind of \nposition.\n  I urge my colleagues to think very carefully. We have just been home \ntalking to our constituents, talking about their concerns about \ndeficits, about the role the taxpayers are going to have to pay funding \nnew spending of the Congress. Yet the very first thing we do this year \nout of the box is take on an additional liability that will, in fact, \nadd to the debt if we have to make up the payments to the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation because companies that took advantage of \nthis special waiver decided they could no longer remain in existence or \nwent bankrupt.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will support these two amendments. I will \ndiscuss them again tomorrow right after the lunches.\n  At this time I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask consent to speak in morning business for as much \ntime as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              THE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today the Congressional Budget Office \nreleased its summary of what to expect in fiscal policy in this \ncountry. I know several of my colleagues have spoken about that today. \nBut they predict that in the coming fiscal year, the budget deficit for \nthis country will be $477 billion--nearly a $500 billion deficit--\neasily and by far outdistancing any previous budget deficit.\n  Last week I listened to the State of the Union in the Chamber of the \nHouse.\n  The President described the state of the Union as he saw it. There \nwas no discussion about the nearly $.5 trillion budget deficit this \ncoming year. It was as if everything is just fine; don't worry about \nit; be happy.\n  Days later, the Congressional Budget Office released their January \nreview. Here is what they show. They show that in January 2001, 3 years \nago, they expected us to have a surplus of $5.6 trillion during the 10-\nyear period. As a result of that expected budget surplus, we had people \nscurrying around here like folks who just had not enough to do and they \nwanted to find some way to deal with their $5.6 trillion surplus. Some \nof us said this surplus doesn't yet exist. It is just a prediction; \nmaybe we ought to be a little bit conservative, a little bit careful \nabout how we deal with this. No. The President said don't worry about \nthat, and those who supported him in Congress said don't worry about \nthat; be happy; we are going to have a big, long-term, 10-year surplus, \nand let's have very large tax cuts which, by the way, are token for the \nhighest income earners in this country. If you earn $1 million a year--\nand not many do--this Congress passed tax cuts that said we believe you \nought to have a tax cut of nearly $100,000. I didn't support it. We got \nbusy in this Congress giving that money back not to working families \nbut the wealthiest people who benefited most from those tax cuts.\n  In January of 2003, 2 years later, the expectation was that most of \nthose surpluses had vanished. A number of things had happened, but most \nof those surpluses had vanished. Now, 1 year later, we find out there \nare no surpluses at all. In fact, we face 10 years of deficits equaling \nsomewhere around $2.6 trillion. In a period of 3 years, the \nCongressional Budget Office expected us to have a $5.6 trillion \nsurplus, and then 3 years later a $2.6 trillion deficit.\n  I didn't go to fancy math classes in my small school, but that adds \nup to an $8 trillion difference in just 3 years. What happened? As I \nindicated, the smell of $5.6 trillion in surplus was just too much for \nsome: we have to get rid of this surplus--despite the fact it didn't \nexist. How shall we do it? Let us give the upper-income Americans a \nvery generous tax cut; and they got it through the Congress. Some of us \ncautioned, saying maybe something is going to happen. What if something \ninterferes? What if there is an economic downturn? What if we don't \nhave these surpluses? Never mind, we were told; it doesn't matter. \nDon't worry about it; be happy; we are going to have a long-term \nsurplus and we are going to get about the business of giving it back.\n  In just a matter of months after that debate began, we discovered the \ncountry entered into a recession. I know my colleagues are fond of \nsaying President Bush inherited a recession. He did not.\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\nThat is not true. The recession started in March of 2001. This \nPresident didn't inherit a recession. In March of 2001, the recession \nstarted. It lasted until about November 2001. So we ran into a \nrecession in March.\n  On September 11, 2001, we had this tragic event in which terrorists \nmurdered innocent Americans by flying airplanes into buildings. \nThousands of Americans lost their lives that day. That had a dramatic \nimpact on the economy. There is no question about that.\n  Then we began a war against terrorism, which was expensive; then \nhomeland security, which is expensive; and then an increase in defense \nspending, which is expensive.\n\n  Think about it: A $5.6 trillion surplus expected in 10 years, and the \nfiscal policy coming from the White House was to say, Let's have very \nbig tax cuts for upper income Americans.\n  Then we ran into a recession; September 11, 2001, a terrorist attack; \na war on terrorism; homeland security spending; and defense spending \nup, up, way up. Now we discover that not only is there not a surplus, \nbut we have the largest Federal budget deficit in the history of this \ncountry.\n  The President in his State of the Union Address did not mention it. \nWhy would the President neglect to mention this? Is it because there is \nno fiscal policy coming from this administration that remedies it? Is \nit because the medicine here is not easy to take?\n  I just finished reading a book that was written by a man named \nSuskind about former Treasury Secretary O'Neill who was the Treasury \nSecretary for the first 2 years of this administration during the time \nthis fiscal policy was constructed. That book ought to be read by every \nAmerican because it says again from the Treasury Secretary of this \nadministration that this fiscal policy is folly. It doesn't result from \nthe best minds sitting around thinking about what is the best policy to \nadvance this country's economic interests. It was nothing of the sort. \nIt was all about politics, all about the easy lifting, saying let us \ngive tax cuts and let us give tax cuts especially to those who \nsupported the administration.\n  I was, frankly, very surprised to read that book. I was very \ndisappointed as well to read that book. The book needed to be written, \nand it is controversial. I am sure Mr. O'Neill, former Secretary \nO'Neill, will pay dearly for having been candid. But what he described \nwas the development of a fiscal policy that had nothing at all to do \nwith thoughtful analysis by people who would know. It had everything to \ndo with people in the basement constructing political strategy and how \nthat political strategy should find its way into the fiscal policy of \nthis country and should actually run that fiscal policy.\n  Here we are 3 years later. Instead of a $5.6 trillion budget surplus, \nwe have the prospect of a $2.6 trillion deficit that we will decide our \nchildren should pay. Here we are with an administration that has no \nplan except to say deficits don't matter--an administration that gives \nus a State of the Union that conveniently forgets we have now the \nlargest Federal budget deficit in human history.\n  I mentioned I went to a very small school with a high school senior \nclass of nine. They didn't teach advanced math. But 1 and 1 equals 2, \nand 2 and 2 always equals 4. You cannot have a fiscal policy for our \ncountry that increases defense spending, increases homeland security \nspending, and cuts taxes again and again, and have it add up. It just \ndoes not, especially in circumstances when we hit a rough patch in the \neconomy and are fighting a continuing war on terror. It simply does not \nadd up. We require--this country demands--leadership on these issues. \nAll of us here in the Congress need to get serious about spending \ninitiatives and tax initiatives.\n  Not too many weeks ago, we had a debate on the floor of the Senate. I \noffered an amendment and I lost. It had to do with the expenditure of \n$20.3 billion for the reconstruction of the country of Iraq. I said we \nought not spend $20.3 billion to reconstruct the country of Iraq. We \ndid not bomb Iraq in a manner that destroyed their infrastructure. We \ndidn't target their roads. We didn't target their electric grids, nor \ntheir dams. We did not target the infrastructure of Iraq, and we did \nnot destroy their infrastructure. It is not the obligation or the \nburden of the American taxpayers to rebuild it. The country of Iraq has \nthe second largest reserves of oil in the entire world next only to \nSaudi Arabia.\n  My proposition was very simple: that Iraq would be pumping 3 million \nbarrels of oil a day, according to Ambassador Bremer, by July 1 of this \nyear, and the sale value of that which is available for export will be \n$16 billion a year. That is $160 billion over 10 years. That could \neasily be securitized, and the money from a few years of Iraq oil could \neasily reconstruct all that is necessary to be reconstructed in Iraq. \nIt is the burden, it seems to me, of Iraq oil, the resource that \nbelongs to Iraq, to reconstruct Iraq. It is not the burden of the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I have felt strongly--and I did when we debated this issue--that Iraq \noil owned by the Iraqi people ought to be used to reconstruct the \ncountry of Iraq, not the American taxpayer. I lost that vote. That vote \nwas $20 billion.\n\n  Those who decided, no, it is the American taxpayers' burden, decided \nwe want to spend that money. That is part of Federal spending. We want \nto borrow the money, which is what we are now doing in order to \nreconstruct the infrastructure of Iraq.\n  The next time I hear someone come to this floor to say the problem is \nthe big spenders, it is important to take a look at how Members voted \non the $20 billion to reconstruct Iraq. Talk about big spending, that \nis the big daddy of spending, one big chunk, $20.3 billion, not paid \nfor. We borrowed the money, added it to the Federal debt, and said \nlet's send it to Iraq.\n  Now we read in the newspapers that a Halliburton subsidiary has \ndecided to give money back because there were kickbacks, because there \nwas fraud. There are investigations. We discover the price charged to \nthe American taxpayer to haul gasoline into Iraq is probably $1 more \nper gallon than it should be.\n  Are you surprised? I am not. When we throw money at these issues, \nwhich is what happened to the issue of reconstructing Iraq, we find \ndramatic amounts of waste. That is what is happening.\n  We need a fiscal policy that works. Part of it is beginning to cut \nback on spending in some of these areas. This would have been a good \ncandidate and would still be a good candidate. We do not have to spend \nall of the $20 billion. There is still time to take some back and \nreduce the runup of Federal deficits.\n  Second, we ought to collect some taxes from those who are not paying \nit, some of the largest corporations in the country, some whose names \nyou would recognize instantly because they advertise all the time. They \ndo a lot of business in this country and are household names. They have \ndecided they want to run their business out of a mailbox in the Bahamas \nor the Grand Caymans. Why do they want to make a mailbox their \ncorporate headquarters? To avoid paying U.S. taxes. It is time for us \nto shut that down. The American people pay taxes. They earn a wage; \nthey pay a tax. They do not have flexibility to get out of it. So, too, \nshould the large corporations that do business and earn profits here.\n  Deciding either they want to renounce their citizenship, which is \ncalled an inversion, or deciding they want to create all these special \nenterprises, special subsidiaries, and run them through a mailbox in \nthe Bahamas or Grand Caymans or the Dutch Antilles is not something \nthis country should allow happen.\n  That means tax reform. It is not just the obligation of working \nfamilies to pay taxes, it is the obligation of all Americans who earn \nin this country. That includes those at the top. That includes some of \nthe largest enterprises, some of the largest corporations that now have \ndecided they want all the benefits of American citizenship except the \nrequirement to pay taxes for our common defense and for the other \nthings that invest in this country and its future.\n  We have a lot to do. If all Americans will read the Suskind book \ncalled ``The Price of Loyalty,'' about former Secretary O'Neill, the \nfirst 2 years of this administration, and the construction of a fiscal \npolicy, a reader will shut that book and wonder how on Earth\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\nthis could have happened. Are there not people involved of good \ncharacter who want to do the right thing for this country's future? Is \nit all about politics? Read the book. Then make a judgment. Then ask \nyourself whether it is not necessary for all, Republicans and \nDemocrats, conservative and liberals, to create a different resolve, \nbeginning now. That resolve is to no longer ignore and pretend, as this \nadministration does, that we have the largest budget deficit in \nhistory.\n\n  I did not mention that in addition to the largest fiscal policy \nbudget deficit in history, predicted today by the Congressional Budget \nOffice of $477 billion, we also have the largest trade deficit in \nhistory. Together, these two deficits are very serious for the long-\nterm outlook of this economy. There is no magic.\n  I know the administration says, look, this is not an issue. We will \njust grow out of it. There is no thoughtful economist I am aware of who \nbelieves you grow out of these deficits. You do not. I mentioned an $8 \ntrillion turnaround. The President, in his State of the Union Address, \ndespite not mentioning the Federal budget deficits or a fiscal policy \ndangerously out of control, in my judgment, did mention he wants to \nmake all of the tax cuts permanent, which will add another $2 trillion \nto those deficits in the next 10 years.\n  We have a lot at stake. I believe it is incumbent upon both political \nparties. If the President will not, it is incumbent upon both parties \nthat do work in the Senate to recognize this is a dangerous fiscal \npolicy and we must change it. Men and women of good will serving in \nthis body know that our job is to try to enhance the future of this \ncountry. We want to leave things better than we found it. We want our \nchildren to live in a better world. We want our children to live in a \ncountry that is stronger, whose economy is expanding and producing jobs \nand opportunities for our children. But that will not happen if we \nburden our children with a reckless fiscal policy that has the largest \ndeficits in the history of this country.\n  I call on this President to recognize this issue, work with us to \nsolve this problem, and put this country back on track with a fiscal \npolicy that promotes economic growth, that gets rid of these budget \ndeficits, and provides for a responsible fiscal policy, a balanced \nbudget, one that will promote growth in this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Campaign Finance Reform\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on December 10 I was in Las Vegas when my \nstaff stepped into a meeting and said the Supreme Court had upheld the \nMcCain-Feingold Campaign Reform bill. I couldn't believe it. All of the \npolitical prognosticators said this very conservative Supreme Court \nwould not uphold that law. They not only upheld the law but they \ncompletely repudiated what the intermediate court of appeals had done. \nThey went past them and upheld the law.\n  I was so happy that after I got out of my meeting, when the press \ncalled me, I said that if Sandra Day O'Connor were available I would \ngive her a big hug because the decision she wrote was tremendous. She \nbroke from the pack to do what no one thought she would do. I have \ntremendous respect and admiration for her courage in doing that. I \nwrote her a letter and told her what I said publicly. What she did was \ntremendous.\n  Why did she do it? A lot of it is not only based upon her academic \nprowess but the fact that she served as an elected State legislator in \nArizona. I am sure she remembers what fundraising is all about.\n  The bipartisan campaign finance reform law--I call it bipartisan \nbecause John McCain was one of the main sponsors, even though it was \npassed primarily by Democrats in the House and the Senate--and the \nDecember 10 ruling were the culmination of a remarkable 8-year effort \nby two outstanding public servants.\n  They first introduced this bill in September of 1995. Both of these \nmen realized that since our campaign laws were revamped many years ago, \nthose who wanted to get around the intent of the law had discovered \nsome gaping holes and exploited them beyond what anybody could have \nimagined.\n  In the late 19th century and early part of the 20th century, \ncorporate America basically owned Congress. As a result of that, in the \nearly 20th century, Congress passed a law saying there could be no \ncorporate funds used in Federal elections. That is the way it was \nduring almost all of this past century. Slowly but surely that changed \nbecause the courts ruled that even though you could not give corporate \nor soft money directly to a Federal candidate, that candidate could go \nout and, in any way they wanted, raise money for the State party.\n  As we know, during the last 15 years or so, the largest amount of \nmoney spent in Federal elections was soft money, corporate money, \nbecause corporations would give huge amounts of money to the two State \nparties and they would run these mostly negative ads. The negative \nadvertising taking place in America in recent years has come generally \nfrom soft money--so-called corporate money.\n  Mr. President, the same was developing in recent years that was in \neffect before 1900 and shortly after 1900 when corporate America was \ngiving these huge amounts of money to Congress. Maybe Congress, prior \nto December 10, 2003, was not compromised. Maybe they were not \ncorrupted. I am confident that is true, but what was going on was \ncorrupting. It would only have been a matter of time until this got way \nout of hand, more so than it should have been.\n  So I appreciate very much the law having been drafted. I appreciate \nvery much the fact that now we have a campaign practice in America \nwhich says if somebody is running for office, they can go ask an \nindividual for money and individuals are the only ones who can give \nmoney. An individual Senator or Congressman cannot ask for corporate \nmoney in any fashion or form. That is the way it should be. There is \nnothing wrong with asking for campaign money. There is nothing wrong \nwith giving campaign money, as long as there is full disclosure and it \ncomes from individuals, not corporations.\n  The law that passed and was upheld by the Supreme Court is not a \nperfect law. I am sure people will manage to find ways around it. But \npublic confidence had been eroding and now the political parties are \nnot being allowed to accept large contributions, at least directed at \nindividual Senators, who won't have as much money, and there is \ncertainly nothing wrong with that. I am sure we won't see all the \nnegative ads that we have seen in the past.\n  These unlimited contributions damaged out political system by raising \nthe stakes for those who wrote big checks. I am a strong supporter of \nbusiness. Businesses create jobs and provide health insurance for many \nAmericans. They generate the products and services we all enjoy. Most \nbusinesses play by the rules and play fair. They realize their short-\nterm pursuit of profit is not the only thing that matters. They \nunderstand in the long run, America prospers best when we all share in \nthe prosperity.\n  The influence of big money in politics created an environment in \nwhich special interests threatened to overwhelm the common good. \nInstead of seeking common ground and compromise, business and interest \ngroups began to think in terms of a winner-take-all strategy, with the \nability to influence the process going to the highest bidder.\n  This poisonous climate actually widened the gap between the interests \nof big business--which could contribute large sums of soft money--and \nthe interests of ordinary Americans. Unfortunately, in most cases, \nordinary Americans found themselves on the outside, looking in on a \nprocess that was dominated by big money.\n  I am not pointing fingers at anyone because it was happening on both \nsides. Senators Feingold and McCain realized that something was wrong, \nand they set out 8 years ago to make it right. It wasn't easy. It took \nyears to get to a conclusive vote on the bill. I offered an amendment \nidentical to their proposal, but a cloture vote failed and it died.\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\n  Finally, in 2002, the Senate passed the Campaign Finance Reform Act. \nA week later, it was signed by President Bush into law. A little over a \nmonth ago, that law was upheld by the highest court in the land. The \nsaga of campaign finance reform is a useful lesson to those who study \ngovernment. It illustrates the importance of tenacity and conviction.\n  I have no doubt that the great majority of Americans supported \ncampaign finance reform from the very beginning. As indicated by the \nvote, the people in this body and in the House knew that people favored \nthis. There may have been some individuals who didn't want to vote for \nthe bill in their hearts, but they did so because they recognized that \nthe overwhelming number of people in America supported it. Despite this \nsupport of the American people, the bill would never have become law if \nSenators McCain and Feingold had not kept pushing it because there were \na lot of people who may have been outwardly supportive of this in \nCongress but simply weren't willing to push very hard to make sure it \ncame to be.\n  Time and time again, Senators Feingold and McCain encountered all \nkinds of setbacks. Time and time again, they refused to give up. I \ndon't know how many cloture votes failed in this matter--I would \nestimate at least 25 over the years. These two men kept fighting \nbecause they believed in their hearts that this was an issue of \nfundamental importance to our democracy.\n  Senators McCain and Feingold stayed the course because they were \nfighting not just for a piece of legislation, they were fighting to \nsave our political system. The tenacity might have surprised their \nopponents, but those of us who followed their careers should not have \nbeen surprised. Is McCain-Feingold perfect? Of course not. Will people \ntry to get around it? Of course they will. We will have to look at ways \nto plug those holes. But it is so much better that we don't have these \nlarge amounts of soft money coming into elections.\n  Just to be illustrative, in the State of Nevada, when I ran 6 years \nago, Senator John Ensign and I spent, between us, $20 million. The vast \nmajority of that was soft money that went through political parties. \nThere were negative ads against me and negative ads against Senator \nEnsign. The system would have been better without that money. You can \nmultiply this all over the country because it was the same. So what has \nhappened here and what happened with the Supreme Court is good for the \nsystem. I have great respect and admiration for Senator Russ Feingold.\n  To show you what a man of conviction he is, 6 years ago when he was \ninvolved in his first reelection effort, he was behind in the polls. We \nknew that and we said to Russ Feingold: Let us give some money to the \nState party to help you. He said: Do not give money to the State party. \nIn fact, if I recall correctly, money was given and he made us take it \nback. Even though he was behind at the time, losing the election was \nmore acceptable to him than violating a principle--that is, corporate \nmoney being involved in his election. He wound up winning. I think one \nreason for that is that people know he is a man of conviction and that \nproved it.\n  He comes from the State of Wisconsin, which has a rich tradition of \nprogressive reform. There is a statue in this Capitol of ``Fightin''' \nBob LaFollette, a leader of the progressive movement in that State. \nSenator Feingold's father was involved in that movement, and he passed \nalong his strong values to his son.\n  Russ Feingold graduated from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. \nHe is a Rhodes scholar. Then he went and graduated with honors from \nHarvard School of Law. He then served 8 years in the Wisconsin State \nSenate before coming to this body.\n  His trip to the Senate is a story in itself. Twelve years ago, the \nSenate race in Wisconsin was a race involving money. There were people \nthere who had raised a lot of money and were spending a lot of money. \nRuss Feingold had almost no money. He was a State senator, but he had \nbeen walking door to door all over the State of Wisconsin.\n  Maybe a month before the election, a number of newspapers in \nWisconsin said: We have had enough of this negative campaigning going \non in this race, and we are going to support this young State senator \nfrom Wisconsin. We want people to focus on Russ Feingold, which was a \nname few people had heard of. Russ Feingold came from nowhere within a \nmatter of weeks to win that election.\n  Here in the Senate he fights to help working people and farmers by \nimproving health care, education, and creating jobs. I know Russ \nFeingold is a man who stands for good government, not only what he did \non campaign finance reform, but also as a watchdog against wasteful \nspending.\n  Russ Feingold is a man who practices what he preaches. When he \nlaunched his effort to ban unregulated soft money, the naysayers said \nit couldn't be done. They said the political process had become so \nexpensive that nobody could get elected without corporate money. Russ \nFeingold proved them wrong. He stuck to his principles, kept his \npromises to limit spending and reject the use of soft money in his own \nrace, and he was reelected.\n  He is a man of strong principles, and he shows strong principles and \nsuccessful politics are not mutually exclusive.\n  I have gotten to know Russ Feingold very well. I have gotten to know \nhis lovely wife Mary, who is a friend of mine. I try to call her once \nin a while just to see how she is doing. She is perky and astute--a \nwonderful woman. I want the record to be spread with my admiration for \nRuss Feingold and his wife Mary, for the team they are, and I am \ncertain the encouragement she gave him to stay the course.\n  Mr. President, the other member of this duo that was responsible for \nthis legislation is John McCain. John McCain is an interesting person, \nto say the least. He is a true American hero. He has lived through \nthings that most of us cannot comprehend.\n  More than 20 years ago, I went to a congressional prayer breakfast. \nJohn McCain and I served together in the House of Representatives. We \nwere elected at the same time. The prayer breakfast in the House, as I \nrecall, was every Thursday morning. I can't remember the exact day, but \nit was held in the morning. I wanted to go because John McCain--this \nperson with whom I was elected in the same class--was going to make a \npresentation at the prayer breakfast. It was one of the most memorable \n45 minutes I have ever spent.\n  John McCain recounted to us--there was no press around; it was a \nprivate meeting--what he had gone through in the state of being a \nprisoner of war in Vietnam. He is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. \nHis father was an outstanding military officer, as was his grandfather.\n  In October of 1967, John McCain was flying a mission over Vietnam \nwhen his plane was struck, and he was forced to eject from that jet \nairplane. He parachuted and landed in a lake, a short ways from the \nprison where he was going to be placed. He broke both of his arms, \nbroke a leg, and sustained many other injuries. Not only that, but a \nmob dragged him out of the lake to the shore and then proceeded to beat \non him, even though he was badly injured. He was taken a short distance \nto the famous Hanoi Hilton where he was tortured and held in solitary \nconfinement.\n  He spent 6 years in prison, much of that in solitary confinement. \nBecause his father was head of the Seventh Fleet--I think that's the \nproper designation; he took care of the theater of war in Vietnam--the \nVietnamese said because your father is a military leader in this area, \nyou can go home. John McCain said: No, I am not going home unless my \nfellow prisoners go with me. So they proceeded to break his shoulders \nagain and cause him all kinds of physical pain, discomfort, anxiety, \nand emotional stress. It was brutal what they did to him.\n  He recounted this in some detail at the prayer breakfast. But a lot \nof it had to be put together because he is certainly not a boastful man \nand doesn't talk about his military experience very much and, I repeat, \nthis was in a very private, prayerful meeting. I can remember his \nexplaining the first time all these prisoners were able to get together \nfor Christmas and how they found a way to sing Christmas songs.\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\n  It was, as I said, a remarkable experience to listen to John McCain. \nHe is a man of integrity. To show his humility, if you look at his \nbiography on his Web site, it is four very short paragraphs. He doesn't \ntalk about most of the things he has accomplished in life. You have to \nread on, not on his Web site, because he is a man of some humility.\n  McCain and Feingold are a lot alike. They both have tenacity, \nperseverance. They both cause the Senate and myself, someone who is \ntrying to move legislation along, a bit of heartburn on occasion. I \nhave sometimes asked myself about these two guys--oh, why are they \ndoing this? They are doing what they do, even though there is some \nshort-term pain for me and others who are trying to move legislation on \nthe floor, because they feel strongly about different issues.\n  There are times when I am anxious and concerned about the issue they \nraise, but I never ever question why they do it. I know why they do it. \nI work as much as I can to understand that these two watchdogs work \ntogether on a number of issues, and they also work separately. They \nhave different interests in life.\n  I couldn't let any more time go by without talking about how \nimportant it is for the body politic to have passed McCain-Feingold and \nhow important it is to the country that the Supreme Court of the United \nStates upheld that law nearly as we had written it. It has changed our \nlives, but I think for the better. Even though some people are upset it \npassed, I am very glad, and it would never have happened but for the \nperseverance of these two men. It will renew the vitality of our \npolitical system and restore our faith in Government. It could not have \nhappened but for these two fine Senators about whom the States of \nWisconsin and Arizona should feel proud.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2260\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss \namendment No. 2260, which has been filed. At a later point in my \npresentation, I will ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside. But I first want to talk about the amendment and about \nthe plight of US Airways, a very important constituent for a \nPennsylvania Senator, and a very important airline for the United \nStates on domestic and foreign travel.\n  There is a long history of the problems which US Airways has faced, \narising really out of the problems of 9/11, when the airline industry \ngenerally has been subjected to great problems because of the reduction \nof airline passengers.\n  US Airways has been in the throes of reorganization, in bankruptcy \nproceedings. They have had difficulties obtaining a loan going back to \nDecember of 2002, when there was a critical point.\n\n  At the request of US Airlines, requests were made by me to Labor \nSecretary Chao, then-Treasury Secretary O'Neill, and Commerce Secretary \nEvans to strongly encourage the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to \naccept US Airways' pilot pension plan proposal. Ultimately, the PBGC \ndeclined to do so.\n  Then on January 9, 2003, Senator Santorum and I introduced S. 119 on \nbehalf of the Air Line Pilots Association with the aim to protect their \npension by allowing US Airways to terminate and then restore their \npension plans. The resolution of the pension liability situation is to \nthe completion of US Airway's plan of reorganization by the Air \nTransportation Safety Board.\n  Then on January 14, I chaired a hearing of the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education Subcommittee on the pension plans \nregarding US Airways because it dealt with the labor issue. What we \nhave sought to do here is to have a longer period of time than the 5 \nyears which US Airways had to fund the program. We have asked for \nflexibility of up to 30 years--not necessarily 30 years but up to 30 \nyears.\n  Had the 2-year relief or deficit reduction been in effect when US \nAirways faced the issues relating to its pension plan, there was the \ndistinct possibility, perhaps likelihood, that US Airways would not \nhave been in the throes which it is in today. US Airways has since \nadded to the pilots' defined contribution plan, and the pilots would be \nvery pleased to see the funding there offset the obligation which US \nAirways would have if amendment No. 2260 were to be adopted. That is a \nbrief statement as to the status of the matter.\n  There was a unanimous consent agreement entered into on December 9 of \nlast year which limits the first-degree amendments which are available. \nIt was only last week that the US Airways pilots came to my office, to \nme, to ask that we introduce this amendment. Procedurally, the only way \nat this stage that it can be done is as a second-degree amendment.\n  I have inquired of the Parliamentarian as to whether 2260 would be \ngermane as a second-degree amendment, and I have been advised that that \nis under consideration now and no final decision has been made. I \nthought it useful this afternoon to take the floor and go through the \nexplanation, which I have.\n  I thank the assistant majority leader for the Democrats, the Senator \nfrom Nevada, for coming to the floor so that he would be present to \nhear what I have had to say.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the pending second-degree amendment \nbe set aside so that this second-degree amendment may be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the Parliamentarians have \nnot had an opportunity to study this in detail. Therefore, they are not \nat this time ready to rule on whether or not this amendment is in \norder. A number of people have called our cloakroom, recognizing that \nas soon as the Parliamentarian makes a decision, that will answer the \nquestion itself. Based upon that, on behalf of a number of other \nSenators, I object to setting this amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I understand the situation as stated by \nthe Senator from Nevada. I understand there are other Senators who \nrepresent States which have other airlines, and it is a tough \ncompetitive line out there. So having made the explanation, I shall \nawait the judgment of the Parliamentarian. When the current second-\ndegree amendment is disposed of, I will then be in a position to offer \nthis second-degree amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/26/senate-section/article/S241-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

HIRAM C. POLK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a world-\nrenowned surgeon, inspiring educator, and fellow Louisvillian, Dr. \nHiram C. Polk.\n  While most of us are sleeping in the early morning hours, Dr. Polk is \nalready hard at work, making rounds and advising residents. Since 1971, \nhe has served as the chairman of the Department of Surgery at the \nUniversity of Louisville.\n  Hiram attended Millsaps College in his home State of Mississippi. As \na favor to his chemistry professor, Hiram applied to Harvard Medical \nSchool. Since he wouldn't go to Massachusetts for a candidate-screening \ninterview, Hiram received a visit from the late Arthur Guyton, M.D., \nPh.D. Dr.\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\nGuyton, widely regarded as the world's leading physiologist, discussed \nthe future with Hiram and then offered him a scholarship to Harvard \nMedical School. While Hiram eventually accepted the scholarship, he \ndropped out of the program three times because of his aversion to the \nmore tedious demands of the field. He graduated from Harvard in 1960 \nand began residency at Washington University in St. Louis where he was \ngreatly influenced by one of his instructors, Carl Moyer, M.D. Inspired \nby Dr. Moyer, Hiram began to consider teaching. His love for \nintellectual stimulation and talent for surgery made academia a natural \nconclusion for Hiram.\n  Under Hiram's leadership in the Department of Surgery at the \nUniversity of Lousiville, the number of staff has grown from 5 to 70 \nand the department now receives $1.2 million in annual grants from the \nNational Institutes of Health. He's trained almost 230 general \nsurgeons, more than any other surgery chair and America. He is an \ninspiration to his residents, colleagues, and patients.\n  Hiram is also a leader in research. He's considered a world authority \nin surgical wound infections and has done landmark research regarding \nthe use of perioperative antibiotics. Hiram is also an accomplished \nauthor with nearly 400 papers and journal articles. 152 textbook \nchapters, and 11 books to his name.\n  Hiram is a dedicated and talented surgeon who has brought the \nUniversity of Louisville's Department of Surgery to national \nrecognition. He receives the highest praise from his residents, \ncolleagues, and patients. I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking \nHiram for his dedication to medical excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/26/senate-section/article/S242-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JACK KAIN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jack \nKain, a successful Kentucky businessman and dedicated community member. \nFor the past 50 years, Jack has built an award-winning car dealership \nempire in central Kentucky that generates more than $20 million in \ngross annual sales.\n  What originally started out as a way to avoid milking cows has become \na fifty-year passion for Jack Kain. In 1947, while a pre-law student at \nthe University of Kentucky, Jack first delved into the world of car \nsales with the hopes of escaping work on the family dairy farm. For the \nnext three years, he sold vehicles at the Harry Aldridge and Shug Glenn \ndealerships. He joined the Air Force in 1950 and served in Korea as a \nsecond lieutenant. Following his tour of duty, Jack returned to \nKentucky with his late wife Kathy Webb and their daughter Becky. With \nsome financial support from his father, Jack returned to car sales with \nthe purchase of a DeSoto/Plymouth dealership in Frankfort. In 1960, he \nstarted selling Fords. While there have been some bumps on his road to \nsuccess, Jack has continued to expand his dealership, which now employs \n50 people, including four of his nine children.\n  Jack's business has received the Ford Motor Co. President's Award, a \nselective accolade bestowed upon dealerships with superb customer \nservice. Less than one percent of the 5,000 Ford dealers nationwide \nreceive this award. Stephen Lyons, the president of the Ford Division \nof the Ford Motor Company hails Jack as a ``master of customer \nservice'' and a ``legend.'' Jack's dedication to customer satisfaction \nis illustrated in his frequent interaction with those who enter his \ndealership where he welcomes and thanks every customer. Whether he's \nhelping Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher, Frankfort Mayor Bill May, or \na lesser-known inhabitant of Woodford County, Jack treats all his \ncustomers with respect.\n  Jack, who has nine children, twenty-one grandchildren, and three \ngreat-grandchildren, also stays active in the community. He has been a \nmember of the Greater Lexington and the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, \npresident of the Woodford County Chamber and he has served as director \nof St. Joseph Hospital. For the next couple of years, however, Jack \nwill be spending more time outside the commonwealth with his new \nposition as vice chairman and soon will serve as chairman of the \nNational Automobile Dealers Association. He's the first Kentucky dealer \nto be elected to these posts and will lobby on behalf of dealers in \nWashington, DC and in Detroit.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Jack Kain on his 50 \nyears of business success and his excellent record of customer service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/26/senate-section/article/S242-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WILLIAM T. YOUNG TRIBUTE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nprominent Kentuckian, successful businessman, and devoted \nphilanthropist, William T. Young. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to extend my condolences to his two children, William T. \nYoung, Jr. and Lucy Young Hamilton, and to all of those who knew and \nloved him.\n  Mr. Young graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1939, \nreceiving a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. After \ngraduation, he went on to serve in the U.S. Army during World War II, \nreturning home to Lexington as a major. In 1946 Mr. Young married Lucy \nMaddox, and later had two children.\n  After he married Lucy, Mr. Young decided to make his longtime \nentrepreneurial dreams a reality by starting Big Top Peanut Butter, \nwhich he sold in 1955 to Proctor and Gamble who later renamed it Jif. \nIn 1958 he opened a moving and storage company, W.T. Young Storage Co., \nand started Lexington Cartage, a shipping operation. Mr. Young was also \nappointed to the board of Kentucky Fried Chicken at this time and to \nthe Royal Crown Co. Board, which he became chairman of in 1966.\n  Mr. Young, a true Kentuckian, became a horseman in his later days \nturning a small parcel of land into Overbrook Farms. This 2,400-acre \nbreeding operation trained Derby, Preakness, and Belmont Stakes \nwinners, as well as breeding the Nation's leading stallion, Storm Cat. \nHowever successful Young became, he never forgot his roots and his home \nof Lexington, giving back to the community a hundred times over.\n  Mr. Young's generosity long exceeds the list of his business \nachievements. He gave much to higher education in Kentucky, \nparticularly to two institutions in Lexington--the University of \nKentucky and Transylvania University. His proudest donation was to UK \nfor the building of a state-of-the-art library, which now bears his \nname. At Transylvania University, Young started the Thomas Jefferson \nScholars, one of the Nation's first merit-based scholarships, which the \nUniversity later renamed after him. Besides donating his money, Mr. \nYoung also donated his time to the institutions. He served on the \nCouncil of Higher Education, Board of Curators at Transylvania, \nUniversity of Kentucky Board of Trustees, and the UK Development \nCouncil.\n  He will forever be remembered through the many contributions he made \nto his community and through the many stories his friends and family \ntell of an ambitious gentleman whose humble heart never stopped giving. \nCharles L. Shearer, the president of Transylvania University, tells a \nstory of Mr. Young declining a nomination for a fundraising award given \nby the university. Mr. Young explained, ``If other people had my \nresources, they would do the same thing.'' UK Dean of Libraries Carol \nDiedrichs discussed how Mr. Young would walk through the library \nstopping to talk to the students, asking them how they were doing and \nhow their studies were going. Former Kentucky Gov. John Y. Brown \ndescribed Mr. Young as ``closest to the perfect human being I've ever \nknown.''\n  William T. Young's generosity stretched far across the Nation and far \ninto the hearts of all those who met him. I ask each of my colleagues \nto join me today in paying tribute to William T. Young, for all he has \ndone. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/26/senate-section/article/S242-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S242-S243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         OREGON EDUCATION HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nOregon's unsung heros, Dean Azule. For more than three decades, Mr. \nAzule has dedicated his life to educating and enriching the lives of \ncountless young Oregonians. He is an educator in both mind and spirit \nand has dedicated his life to ensuring the success of Oregon's youth.\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\n  While attending Oregon College of Education, OCE, now know as Western \nOregon State University, Mr. Azule worked as a family liaison with an \nAmerican Indian youth program funded by the Indian Education Act. As a \nfamily liaison, he tutored and counseled hundreds of American Indian \nyouth, providing career guidance and helping them to explore their \ncareer opportunities. Upon graduation from OCE, Mr. Azule joined the \nNorthwest Regional Educational Lab and worked on their Indian Reading \nLanguage Development Program. This program has been invaluable in \nhelping American Indian youth keep their indigenous languages alive.\n  Mr. Azule next established the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde's \nextremely successful Education Department. With his invaluable \nassistance, the Department now includes Head Start, Youth Education, \nHigher Education, and Vocational training programs which has served to \nhelp the lives of hundreds of tribal members. The Grand Ronde Education \nDepartment has become a model of success across the county--much to the \ntireless efforts of Mr. Azule.\n  After almost 10 years with the Grand Ronde Tribes, Mr. Azule joined \nthe Salem-Keizer public school system in 1999. Active in community \noutreach programs, he has helped disadvantaged children continue their \neducation despite facing social and economical hardships at Washington \nElementary, Keizer Elementary, and Miller Elementary School. Most \nrecently, he has taken a behavioral health position at the new West \nSalem High school.\n  Mr. Azule is a true champion for Oregon's children, and I know he \nwill continue to play a vital role in educating and making a difference \nin the lives of children in our State. His tireless spirit serves as an \ninspiration to us all. Today, I am proud to honor Dean Azule as an \neducation hero for our great State of Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/26/senate-section/article/S243-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   STAFF SERGEANT KENNETH HENDRICKSON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am saddened to report the \npassing of SSG Kenneth Hendrickson of Bismark, ND. Kenneth was killed \non January 24, 2004, while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Kenneth, who was called up for active duty last spring, was scheduled \nto leave Iraq in March. He was one of two North Dakota Army National \nGuardsmen killed by a roadside bomb while traveling near Fallujah. \nKenneth was a member of the Bismarck-based 957th Multi-Role Bridge \nCompany and a 15-year veteran of the National Guard.\n  Kenneth, a computer technician for Bismarck public schools, was \nmarried just 4 days before being deployed. Born in Fargo, Kenneth lived \nwith his family in Bismarck. His father Lyle Hendrickson lives in Rapid \nCity, SD and is a Pennington County commissioner. Kenneth is described \nby family members as a free spirit who loved children and knew how to \nhave fun. Even while in Iraq, his number one concern was his family \nback home.\n  Kenneth and his fellow National Guard members are playing a vital \nrole in Iraq. These brave men and women have taken time away from their \nfamily, friends, and jobs to serve their country thousands of miles \nfrom home. Kenneth and many other National Guard members have given the \nultimate sacrifice in defense of freedom. Our country owes them a \ntremendous debt of gratitude for their service.\n  The lives of countless people were enormously enhanced by Kenneth's \ngoodwill and service. He inspired all those who knew him. Our Nation is \na far better place because of his life. The best way to honor him is to \nemulate his commitment to our country.\n  I express my sympathies to the family of Kenneth Hendrickson. I know \nhe will always be missed, but his service to our Nation will never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/26/senate-section/article/S243-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S243-S244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO HUMAN RESOURCES COMMAND--ST. LOUIS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to pay special tribute to the \nU.S. Army's Human Resources Command--St. Louis, formerly known as the \nArmy Personnel Command, AR-PERSCOMD. On October 2, 2003, ARPERSCOM was \ndeactivated and merged with the U.S. Army's Total Army Personnel \nCommand to form the Army's Human Resources Command, headquartered in \nAlexandria, VA. Although its name has changed, the organization's proud \nlegacy of selfless service to Army Reserve Soldiers, veterans, and \ntheir family members continues.\n  The mission of Human Resources Command--St. Louis, HRC-St. Louis, is \nto ensure the full spectrum of human resources programs, services and \nsystems are executed to support the readiness and well-being of Army \npersonnel worldwide. HRC-St. Louis and its predecessor organizations \nhave a long and distinguished history of service to the Nation. Located \nin the Charles F. Prevedel Building at the Federal Records Complex in \nsuburban St. Louis, the command was officially activated on October 1, \n1998, with the mission of providing the highest quality life cycle \nmanagement and services resulting in a trained and ready force in \nsupport of the National Military Strategy. Formed provisionally on \nOctober 16, 1997, AP-PERSCOM replaced the former U.S. Army Reserve, \nUSAR, Personnel Center on ARPERCEN.\n  HRC-St. Louis traces its lineage back to 1919, when the Demobilized \nRecords Division was established in Washington, D.C., as an activity \nunder the Adjutant General's Office. Its mission was to store and \nmaintain the records of soldiers demobilized after World War I. After a \nnumber of moves, the division came to St. Louis in 1945. First located \nat the Federal facility at 4300 Goodfellow Blvd., the division moved to \nits present location on 9700 Page Avenue--1 Reserve Way--in 1956. \nThrough the years, the organization underwent a number of name and \nmission changes, including the establishment of the Reserve Components \nPersonnel and Administration Center or RCPAC in 1971, and ARPERCEN's \nestablishment as a field operating agency under the Chief, Army Reserve \nin 1984. In 1994, a U.S. Army council of colonels convened and \ndetermined that USAR personnel management, service and policy functions \nshould be streamlined and consolidated under one command: AR-PERSCON.\n  Serving as the single focal point for the supporting Army Reserve \nPersonnel life cycle management in peacetime, mobilization, and \ndemobilization environments, HRC-St. Louis provides efficient and \nseamless human resource support to Army Reserve Soldiers who are Troop \nProgram Unit, TPU, members, drilling Reserve unit members; Individual \nMobilization Augmentees, IMA; Individual Ready Reservists, IRR; and \nActive Guard Reserve, AGR soldiers, reservists on extended full-time \nactive duty. The command supports almost 329,000 Ready Reserve \nSoldiers, approximately 212,000 in the Selected Reserve--TPU, IMA, and \nAGR, and over 115,000 IRR Soldiers.\n  HRC-St. Louis is a highly innovative organization; maximizing the \ntalents of its combined military and civilian work force over 1,100 \nmembers. It serves as a leader within the Department of Defense in \nmaximizing use of advanced technology providing personalized, e-care--\nelectronic--to customers. Its award-winning HRC-St. Louis, formerly \n2xCitizen, website, with its numerous applications, informs Reserve \nsoldiers and the public on Army personnel matters. In 2002, alone, \nthere were over 28 million visits--logins--to the website. Soldiers can \naccess and update their records online at any time via the Internet \nthrough their own individual self-service web portal--a significant \ninnovation and major evolution in soldier personnel service support. No \nlonger do Reserve soldiers have to wait extended periods for hardcopy \ndocuments or microfiche copies to arrive through the mail to review \ntheir records or prepare for promotion boards. In providing responsive, \nreal time e-care for soldiers, HRC-St. Louis contributes significantly \ntoward the Army's readiness to engage in support of the implementation \nof the National Military Strategy on behalf of the Nation's security \nobjectives.\n  The command's merger with the Total Army's PERSCOM, and incorporation \nas part of the new U.S. Army's Human Resources Command, is part of an \noverall Army transformation effort to streamline and enhance \nintegration of all personnel functions--making them more efficient and \nresponsive in meeting a wide range of missions--while enhancing \npersonnel service for the soldier.\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\n  This proclamation recognizes and salutes all those who currently \nserve as members of Human Resources Command--St. Louis--soldiers and \ncivilians alike--and all who have gone before them who have made \ncountless contributions to the United States of America. As the Army's \nHuman Resources transformation continues, the soldiers and civilians of \nHRC-St. Louis will continue to make many more significant contributions \nto the soldiers and our Nation as a part of the U.S. Army's Human \nResources Command.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/26/senate-section/article/S244-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM L. PIERCE\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as cochair of the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption, I rise today to remember the recently passed \nWilliam L. Pierce, a man who dedicated his life to helping children. As \nfounder and president of the National Council on Adoption, William \nPierce was a leading adoption advocate who worked tirelessly to help \nformulate and promote several major adoption policies over the last 25 \nyears. To name a few:\n  The Infant Adoption Awareness Act created the Infant Adoption \nTraining Program, which trains health and pregnancy counselors in \npresenting adoption as an option for unplanned pregnancies; the Multi-\nEthnic Placement Act of 1994 reduced obstacles to many adoptions; the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promoted adoptions out of foster \ncare by removing barriers to adoption and creating incentives for \nStates to place more foster children with adoptive families; and the \nEconomic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 included \nprovisions to permanently extend and expand the tax credit for adoption \nexpenses and the employer-based adoption assistance program.\n  William Pierce's consistent advocacy of pro-child adoption policies \nhelped improve the lives of countless children, birthparents, and \nfamilies. He was an outstanding husband, father, grandfather, citizen, \nadvocate, and leader. I remember him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/26/senate-section/article/S244-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY VARSITY CHEERLEADERS\n\n   Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor two of my \nstaff members who not only are integral for my office operations, but \nhave filled the same needs for two previous Idaho Senators. For over 20 \nyears Jim and Chas Grant have worked on the staffs of Idaho Senators in \nthe U.S. Senate. These Caldwell, ID, natives began their service in the \noffices of Senator Steve Symms in the early 1980s. They remained to \nwork with his successor, Senator Dirk Kempthorne, and now they fill a \nvital role in my office.\n  Chas and Jim are without peer when it comes to knowing the people of \nIdaho. Through their work in constituent mail, they have processed \nhundreds of thousands of constituent letters. That incredible number is \na testament not only to the Grants' longevity, but also to their great \ndedication. The Grants read and carefully sort each letter, ensuring \nprompt response from my office. In the 5 years that Jim and Chas have \ndirected the constituent mail program for me, the number of letters, \nfaxes, and e-mails has consistently grown, reaching over 45,000 last \nyear. It is a tribute to the Grants that they have effectively handled \nthis large increase in mail. Constituents often express their \nsatisfaction with the quick, accurate responses to their inquiries. It \nis the hard work of the Grants that makes these quick responses \npossible.\n  While they work side-by-side, they most definitely have provided \ntremendous individual contributions to my office.\n  Chas Grant was born and raised in Idaho. He graduated from Caldwell \nHigh School in 1972, and later received a B.A. in history from Boise \nState in 1977. Chas began working on Capitol Hill for the Postmaster in \n1981. Since that time he has worked for Senator Symms, then Senator and \nnow Governor Dirk Kempthorne, and myself.\n  Jim Grant grew up in Idaho, where he attended Caldwell schools. He \ngraduated from Caldwell High School in 1975. From there, Jim attended \nGallaudet in Washington, DC, where he earned a bachelor of arts in \nEnglish. He began working for Senator Symms on July 18, 1983. During \nhis time working in the Senate he has assisted three Idaho Senators: \nSymms, Kempthorne, and myself. We have all benefited greatly from his \nservice.\n  I asked Senator Symms and Governor Kempthorne to contribute to this \nstatement, as I know they valued the Grant's contributions as much as I \ndo.\n  From Governor Dirk Kempthorne: ``Jim Grant was a dedicated and \ndependable employee in my Senate office for six years. His work ethic \nand `can-do' attitude was a pleasure to be around. As with many of us, \nhe has had to overcome personal challenges, but has served the citizens \nof Idaho well. His hard work was truly appreciated, and he has been a \ntremendous public servant for the citizens of Idaho.\n  ``Chas Grant was always ready to help resolve any problems that came \nup with constituent mail. His common sense view and solutions put the \nconstituent first, and provided me with a smooth running mail \noperation. Chas faced personal challenges, and always found a way to \nmake certain that his work responsibilities were met. His tenure as a \npublic servant has been remarkable for many reasons, and I thank him \nfor his years of service.''\n  And from Senator Steve Symms: ``Congratulations, Jim and Chas, on \nyour many years of exemplary service. On behalf of Steve Symms, \nGovernor Kempthorne, the members of my staff, and other Senate staffers \nthat have benefited from your work: we honor you today. Thank you for \nyour great work!''\n  Since Jim and Chas started in the Senate, many things have changed. \nWhen Chas came to Washington, Ronald Reagan had just been elected \nPresident and Pac-Man was the latest craze. When Jim started in '83, \ncamcorders and ``Just Say No'' had just been introduced. In the Senate, \nwe have gone through 24 sessions of Congress and have made changes like \nallowing TV cameras to cover all the happenings on the Senate floor. \nEven mailrooms have become increasingly complicated as e-mail and fax \nmessages have been added to traditional letters as means of long-\ndistance communication.\n  One constant that has been, however, is Jim and Chas Grant's \ndedicated service to the members of the Senate and the people of Idaho. \nAlso unchanged is the Grants' untiring work ethic and commitment to \ntheir job. I have appreciated their talent, experience, and \nknowledgeable assistance in my office. Jim and Chas recently went out \nof town for an extended period and the rest of my staff stepped in to \nkeep up with the barrage of mail over that time.

Res. 291) to authorize testimony and legal \n     representation in the case of James McKoy v. North Fork \n     Services/Joint Venture.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony in an administrative proceeding before the U.S. Department of \nLabor. An employee of a private contractor at the Plum Island Animal \nDisease Center, a Department of Homeland Security facility in New York, \nwas terminated from his employment.\n  An investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \nsustained the employee's allegations that his termination was in \nretaliation for his voicing environmental safety concerns to the \nHomeland Security Department and to Senator Clinton's office and was \ntherefore in violation of the employee protection provisions of the \nClean Air Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972. That \nfinding is now the subject of the employer's appeal to the Labor \nDepartment and is set for an evidentiary hearing.\n  The regional director in Senator Clinton's Long Island Office is a \ndirect fact witness to the events underlying this controversy and, \nhence, is a necessary witness in this proceeding. Accordingly, this \nresolution would authorize Senator Clinton's employee to testify at \nthis hearing, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 291) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 291\n\n       Whereas, in the case of James McKoy v. North Fork Services/\n     Joint Venture, No. 2004-CAA-00002, pending before the United \n     States Department of Labor, testimony has been requested from \n     Resi Cooper, an employee in the Long Island office of Senator \n     Hillary Rodham Clinton;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\n     1978, 2 U.S.C.
