The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we already \nhave an agreement where we will alternate in recognition of Senators on \neither side of the aisle as we debate the Medicare bill. We have \nseveral hours of requests already from our colleagues. I will not \npropound a unanimous consent request, but I might propose that we \nconsider limiting at least comments today on the floor to 15 minutes to \naccommodate as many Senators as possible.\n  I know there are a lot of Senators who are going to be attempting to \nschedule their day around their opportunity to come to the floor. If we \nhave that understanding, if there are four or five in line, it would \nseem to me it would work. As I say, I will talk to the majority leader \nabout that. I do hope Senators on this side of the aisle will call the \ncloakroom or call Senator Reid or myself to let us know their \nintentions with regard to speaking so that we can coordinate the \neffective use of time.\n  As the majority leader has already announced, we will be in tomorrow \nas well. So Senators will have an opportunity to speak throughout the \nweekend in addition, of course, to Monday. We will work with him to \naccommodate all Senators who wish to speak. We will work on a time \ncertain for a vote at a later date.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as our colleagues are well aware, the \nDemocratic leader and I have set aside all day today, and we can stay \nas late today as necessary. We initially said around 5, but this issue \nis so important, and there are so many people, as the distinguished \nleader implied, who do want to come to the floor, and it is the only \nopportunity for some to come, therefore, we are going to spend all day \ntoday on it, as much time tomorrow as necessary, and in all likelihood \nMonday morning.\n  I hesitate a little bit trying to limit people to 15 minutes because \nI do know some people have 30 minutes of comments, but I think that we \nshould stress keeping the comments to as short a period as possible to \nmake their points because we have a lot of people on both sides of the \naisle who have called and said we are going to be there all day \nSaturday; we want to be able to participate.\n  With this many Senators, it does mean that people need to keep their \nremarks fairly short. I understand we will be alternating back and \nforth. We do want to keep the time equally divided so that both sides \nwill have the opportunity over the course of the day to speak. Then if \nthere are a number of people who have waited and are unable to talk \ntoday or tonight, if we need to go into later tonight, we can come in a \nlittle bit earlier tomorrow or stay longer tomorrow as well.\n  Again, I appreciate the cooperation of all of our colleagues because \nit is not customary for us to be in session on Saturday, and certainly \nnot on Sunday, but in order to pay respect to people's schedules over \nthe holidays and to address this very important issue, we have elected \nto spend all day today and possibly tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask the majority leader if it is his intention to set \naside a moment of silence this afternoon in commemoration of the 40th \nanniversary of the assassination of President Kennedy. It is my \nunderstanding that some thought had been given to that time, and I \nthink it would be helpful, if that time has been set aside, if we could \nmake that announcement in the interest of all Senators.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I believe the time will be set aside at \n12:30 today. If there is a change in that particular time, we can make \nthat announcement very shortly.\n  Mr. President, I do have a statement on an unrelated issue, which I \ncan do now or we can proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/22/senate-section/article/S15514-5", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before entering into the debate on \nMedicare, I will comment on an issue that the Democratic leader and I \nhave worked on very aggressively over the last several months, and it \nrelates to the current asbestos litigation crisis. The current asbestos \nlitigation system is broken, and it is clear that we in this Congress \nshould fix it. We have an obligation, a real responsibility, to fix it.\n  I would like to lay out what our plans are to resolve this asbestos \nlitigation crisis early next year. We have made very good progress \ntoward enacting Chairman Hatch's FAIR Act, which is the Fairness in \nAsbestos Injury Resolution Act. I have made it a personal priority that \nthe Senate participate aggressively in resolving this challenging \nissue.\n  Why do we call what is occurring today a crisis? First, the events \nthat are occurring are overwhelming. The torrent of asbestos litigation \nhas wreaked havoc on asbestos victims, on American jobs, and this havoc \nhas extended into our economy.\n  Over 600,000 claims have been filed and those 600,000 claims have \nalready cost about $54 billion in settlements, judgments, and \nlitigation costs. Yet even after 600,000 claims and $54 billion, the \ncurrent asbestos tort system has become nothing more than a litigation \nlottery at this point in time.\n  Why do I say that? First, a few victims receive adequate compensation \nbut far more suffer long delays for what ends up being unpredictable \nrewards--also, if one looks at the data, inequitable awards. Some \ndeserving victims do not receive anything at all. It is a system that \nthere is only one real consistent winner, and that is the plaintiffs' \ntrial lawyers.\n  I say that because of all of these settlements. They are taking as \nmuch as half of every dollar that is awarded to the victims.\n  If you look to the future, it is a problem that only gets worse. It \nis accelerating in the negative aspect. But if you look to the future, \nit gets even worse.\n  Future funds for asbestos victims are threatened because company \nafter company after company is going bankrupt. About 70 companies have \ngone bankrupt, and about a third of those have gone bankrupt in the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years. The pace of bankruptcies of very large \ncompanies with thousands and thousands of employees is accelerating.\n  Again, this is an issue for us to address. That is why I want to set \na schedule for that in a few minutes.\n  Companies such as Johns Mansville, bankrupt; Owens Corning, bankrupt; \nU.S. Gypsum, bankrupt; and, W.R.\n\n[[Page S15515]]\n\nGrace, bankrupt: these are large reputable companies that have gone \nbankrupt because of this crisis with the associated job losses.\n  Now the hunt is on to get new targets and to go out and sue. People \nsay this is easy money, and the easy way is to go out in terms of \nbringing a lawsuit and filing a lawsuit. Thus, the hunt is on for new \ntargets to sue. What is unfair and inequitable is that many of these \nlawsuits have no connection at all to asbestos. If you really look at \nthe connection between asbestos and the victims, it is just not there.\n  Victims aren't the only ones who suffer but also the workers of these \ncompanies that are going bankrupt suffer. Asbestos-related bankruptcies \nspell doom for these workers' jobs; thus, their families, and, of \ncourse, incomes and retirement savings. Already, these lawsuits have \ncost more than 60,000 Americans their jobs. For those who lose their \njobs, the average personal loss in wages over a career is as much as \n$50,000, and that doesn't include the loss of retirement wages or the \nloss of health benefits. Workers at asbestos-related bankrupt firms \nwith 401(k) plans lost about 25 percent of the value of their 401(k) \naccounts because of this.\n  The economic reality of this crisis is not lost on my colleagues in \nthis body. They understand that under the status quo the national \nasbestos crisis could cause our economy more than the savings and loan \ncrisis of the 1980s and 1990s, and more than the Enron debacle or the \nWorldCom debacle. Member after Member from both sides of the aisle has \nvoiced their agreement with the assessment of the Supreme Court that \nthe system is broken and the Congress should fix it.\n  There is only one question: what can we do? Can we create a system \nbetter than the status quo? The answer is yes.\n  The FAIR Act--the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act--has \nalready made significant headway, and we look forward to progress \ntoday. Under the leadership of Chairman Hatch, it was passed by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee last July, and there have been ongoing \ndiscussions and negotiations since then.\n  I commend Chairman Hatch and the ranking minority member, Senator \nLeahy, for their hard work on the bill.\n  I also want to recognize Senator Specter for his hard work in \nconjunction with Judge Becker.\n  I also want to note that my Democratic colleagues, organized labor, \nand other stakeholders have been deeply involved throughout the \nprocess. Led by Senator Hatch, bipartisan breakthroughs have been made \non issues that previously have proved impossible to address, including \nsuch issues as--and there are many of them--the linchpin issue of the \nmedical criteria that had proven historically to be so difficult and \ncontroversial.\n\n  In addition, agreements among stakeholders following the committee \nmarkup have resulted in even more modifications. The resulting bill \ncreates a system that, while not perfect, is far superior to the \ncurrent tort system for resolving asbestos issues.\n  I became deeply involved in the post-Judiciary Committee negotiating \nprocess, working in concert with Senator Daschle, as well as Chairman \nHatch and Senators Leahy, Specter, Dodd, and Carper, and some others on \nboth sides of the aisle. We have made good progress. I know during the \ndebate over this legislation all of the relevant issues have been \nunearthed. They have been exposed to public debate, and all parties \nhave had an opportunity to get involved to contribute their points of \nview.\n  What emerged under S. 1125 and the current negotiations is a \nstreamlined national trust fund for paying asbestos claimants quickly, \npaying them fairly, and paying them efficiently. The new system \nprovides more certainty and efficiency for claimants, and more \ncertainty and predictability for businesses.\n  Passing this bill will create enormous economic benefits. I say that \nbecause the certainty that flows from the bill will stimulate capital \ninvestment. It will also preserve existing jobs and create new jobs as \nwell.\n  I had hoped that we would bring this bill to the floor before the end \nof this session, but we were unable to achieve that goal. Chairman \nHatch and Senator Leahy worked hard to resolve many difficult issues at \nthe committee level. Senator Daschle and I, along with our staff, have \ncontinued to work with stakeholders to put more issues behind us over \nthe past several months.\n  While there are several issues that remain outstanding, the core \nprinciples of an effective bill are now clear.\n  What are they?\n  First, the bill must create a trust fund that is capable of awarding \nadequate compensation to victims while providing more financial \ncertainty and finality to the business community. The new funding \nproposal that I put on the table would generate payments that would \nexceed by $10 billion the expected funds which victims would receive if \nthe current flawed tort system is left intact.\n  Second, the legislation must establish a schedule of claims values \nthat will ensure victims consistent and equitable awards. We cannot \ntolerate the current system where payments can depend on where a \nplaintiff lives or which is capable of awarding only pennies for every \ndollar promised.\n  I am also prepared to consider further modest increases in claims \nvalues as requested by the Democrats and as requested by organized \nlabor, provided that any new increase is targeted to the most severe \ndisease categories where the relationship to asbestos exposure is most \ncertain.\n  We must make sure, however, that lung cancer claims not caused by \nasbestos are not allowed to overwhelm the fund.\n  Third, the fund must be a nonadversarial program that ensures prompt \npayment of awards to eligible claimants while minimizing transaction \ncosts, including attorney's fees. Care must be taken to ensure that the \nfund is established on an expedited basis, and adequate moneys are \navailable to pay exigent claims from the outset.\n  Fourth, we must preserve the bipartisan medical criteria included in \nS. 1125 as reported by the Judiciary Committee. Only by ensuring the \nuse of real diagnoses of asbestos-related illnesses can the fund avoid \nthe pitfalls that plague the current mass tort system.\n  Fifth, and finally, asbestos victims should not bear the risk of \ninadequate funding or incorrect predictions about future claims, as is \nthe case under the current tort system.\n  The legislation should make clear that if the fund cannot guarantee \nthat victims will receive all of their claims, a program review is \ntriggered, and if not corrected the fund should end and claims should \nrevert to the tort system. To work, however, such a reversion would \nhave to be to Federal court and should contain certain additional \nprotections to ensure the current litigation morass is not recreated.\n  Such an approach reduces, if not eliminates, the need to worry about \nwhich claims projections are correct.\n  Clearly, a more thorough discussion of these observations, \nrecommendations, and outstanding issues is warranted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a document entitled ``Moving Forward in \nAsbestos Injury Resolution Act, S. 1125'' be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit I)\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this allows a more complete discussion of \nthe principles and observations I have made thus far. I do hope people \ntake a look at that document.\n  As for the future, if we intend to make good on our collective hope \nto pass legislation, at some point the ongoing discussions and \nnegotiations must cease and a bill must be brought to the floor. \nVictims are still going uncompensated today, companies are still going \nbankrupt today, and the economy is still unnecessarily burdened. We \nmust act.\n  The minority leader as well as Senator Leahy and other Democratic \nMembers have made clear to me their interest in working toward \nconsensus legislation. It is clear we still need a little more time for \ndiscussion. Consequently, we will not force a vote on the FAIR Act this \nsession. Instead, I will give stakeholders more time to negotiate a \ncompromise. There will, however, be a limit to these discussions \nbecause we must act. Thus, I will commence floor action on an asbestos \nbill by the end of March 2004. Again, I will commence floor action on \nan asbestos bill by the end of March of 2004.\n\n[[Page S15516]]\n\n  There is no perfect solution to the current asbestos litigation \ncrisis, but it is clear that maintaining the status quo is \nunacceptable. We have a responsibility to act, and we will act in this \nbody. We must not let this historic opportunity to enact fair and \nmeaningful reform pass in order to pursue a perfect solution that is \nunachievable. The time has come for the Senate to fashion the right \nsolution to one of the most pressing issues facing us, facing our \neconomy and this Nation today.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n Moving Forward on the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act, S. \n                    1125--Statement of Senator Frist\n\n       To bring an end to the current asbestos litigation crisis, \n     Congress must pass legislation creating a national no-fault \n     asbestos trust fund (``Fund'') that ensures adequate \n     compensation to victims, while providing financial certainty \n     to the business community. This kind of program would provide \n     more direct compensation, more quickly to victims than the \n     current system can deliver. Moreover, it would provide that \n     compensation without the bankruptcies or the lost workers' \n     jobs, incomes, and retirement savings that asbestos personal \n     injury litigation produces. It represents, therefore, a \n     tremendous achievement in the creation of a solution to a \n     problem whose future economic consequences are enormous--in \n     the magnitude of more than $100 billion if the claims stay in \n     the tort system.\n       This past July, under the leadership of Chairman Hatch, the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee approved S. 1125, the Fairness in \n     Asbestos Injury Resolution Act (``FAIR Act''), which \n     establishes the framework for reaching a bipartisan solution. \n     To reach a consensus, we must build upon that structure, \n     making improvements where possible but not jeopardizing the \n     two most fundamental elements of the legislation--adequate, \n     timely, and equitable compensation for claimants and \n     financial predictability for the business community.\n\n\n             i. ensuring adequate compensation for victims\n\n       According to the two actuarial studies on the magnitude of \n     the problem, one by Tillinghast-Towers Perrin and the other \n     by Milliman USA, ultimate loss and expenses under asbestos \n     personal injury litigation are projected to reach $200 to \n     $265 billion. With $70 billion already spent, total estimated \n     future costs thus range from $130 to $195 billion. Victims, \n     however, can expect to receive barely half that amount in \n     actual compensation.\n       According to RAND's analysis of asbestos compensation, \n     transaction costs under the current system--plaintiffs' \n     attorney fees, defense costs, and expenses--consume more than \n     half of the money that goes into the asbestos litigation \n     system. In other words, only about 40 cents on every dollar \n     spent in the asbestos tort system actually reaches victims. \n     Thus, while today's system has a future price tag of $130 to \n     $195 billion, victim compensation is estimated at only $61 to \n     $92 billion of that total.\n       If adopted, the Act will rein in those runaway transaction \n     costs and provide quick, certain, and fair payment for \n     victims. In fact, my funding proposal, which has been agreed \n     to by the defendant companies and insurers, will actually \n     provide asbestos victims at least $10 billion more than they \n     would receive if the current litigation crisis is left \n     intact.\n       The primary source of funding under the Act is derived from \n     mandatory contributions: the Act (as reported) required $104 \n     billion in total mandatory contributions from defendants and \n     insurers. In reaching that total, companies and insurers were \n     to be assessed equally and according to specific statutory \n     provisions. Meanwhile, confirmed bankruptcy trust \n     contributions are estimated to provide an additional $4 \n     billion, bringing total mandatory funding under the Act (as \n     reported) to $108 billion.\n       That funding proposal represented a very fair amount to \n     solve the problem, and provided victims more in direct \n     compensation than they would receive under the current \n     system. The Committee, however, went well beyond this \n     benchmark during markup. S. 1125 (as reported) included \n     significant additional funding provisions. An amendment \n     offered by Senators Kohl and Feinstein authorized the \n     Administrator to compel companies and insurers to pay \n     additional contingent contributions of up to $31 billion, and \n     allowed the Administrator to request back end contributions \n     that could have reached a combined total of $48 billion.\n       The net effect of these changes to the Act was dramatic. S. \n     1125 (as reported) could have required businesses and \n     insurers to provide compensation at up to two times the most \n     credible estimates of total future plaintiffs' recoveries \n     under the tort system. As a result, insurers almost uniformly \n     withdrew their support for the Act, calling it ``dangerously \n     unaffordable'' and ``potentially worse than the existing \n     system.''\n       In order to get the legislation back on track, I initiated \n     a mediation process between insurers and defendant companies. \n     We were able to reach agreement on such major issues as \n     overall funding, allocation of funding obligations, and \n     insurance policy erosion, and gain renewed insurer support \n     for the Act. The agreed-upon revisions not only garnered the \n     support of the business community and insurers for the Act, \n     but would also ensure greater Fund liquidity.\n       Under my funding proposal, insurers would make nominal \n     mandatory contributions of $46.025 billion on an accelerated \n     payment schedule. Meanwhile, defendants would pay $57.500 \n     billion in total mandatory contributions and, if necessary, \n     defendants would provide $10 billion in additional \n     contingency funding. Most importantly, with confirmed \n     bankruptcy trust assets and interest earned, my proposal \n     would provide at least $10 billion more than the current tort \n     system. It will also preserve one of the great breakthroughs \n     that made widespread business community support for the Act \n     possible--the landmark agreement on a fair and reasonable \n     formula for sharing the funding obligation among defendants. \n     Chairman Hatch is to be commended for shepherding the larger \n     business community to his unprecedented agreement.\n       In addition, my proposal would better address the Fund's \n     liquidity needs than the Act (as reported). The greatest \n     stress on the Fund is expected to be in the early years when \n     it is required to pay pending as well as current claims. In \n     order to address the resulting liquidity demands, the Act (as \n     reported) allows the Administrator to borrow against the Fund \n     in an amount equal to that of the following calendar year's \n     anticipated contributions. My proposal would give the \n     Administrator authority to obtain billions of dollars of \n     additional funds, if needed, by expanding the Administrator's \n     borrowing authority. All of the Fund's repayment obligations \n     would be fully collateralized by the defendants' and \n     insurers' mandatory contributions, ensuring that federal \n     monies are not put at risk.\n       Although there are still some funding issues to be worked \n     out, the progress we have made to date is the result of \n     unprecedented cooperation between industry and insurers to \n     find an acceptable solution to the asbestos litigation \n     crisis. We are confident that we can bridge the few remaining \n     differences in the time frame provided.\n\n\n                            II. award values\n\n       A further step on the path to providing fair compensation \n     for asbestos victims is the establishment of a schedule of \n     claim values that will result in consistent awards. The \n     history of awards under the current tort system is one \n     plagued by uncertainty and unfairness to asbestos victims. \n     Many plaintiffs receive little or nothing, or die before \n     their cases can be heard in court. Of those who do receive \n     awards, the amount of compensation typically depends more on \n     where and when the claims are filed than on the nature of the \n     plaintiffs's illness. In one 1999 Mississippi case involving \n     4,000 plaintiffs, allocation of a $160 million settlement was \n     based on how far plaintiffs lived from the courthouse in \n     Mississippi. The Mississippi residents each received \n     $263,000. Similarly situated plaintiffs from Ohio, \n     Pennsylvania, and Indiana received only $14,000 each. (See \n     David Cosey, et al. v. E.D. Bullard, et al).\n       As introduced, S. 1125 contained claim values that were \n     among the highest of any federal compensation program: For \n     example, the award value for claimants compensated under \n     disease level X (mesothelioma) exceeded by three times the \n     maximum death benefits generally available under the National \n     Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, one of the most generous of \n     comparable existing federal programs. Claimant compensation \n     under the FAIR Act's other most serious disease levels was \n     also very generous compared with existing federal programs. \n     Moreover, although the Act's claim values were based loosely \n     on those awarded in existing bankruptcy trusts, it ultimately \n     paid more in real dollars. The Manville Trust, for example, \n     has a scheduled value of $350,000 for mesothelioma claimants, \n     but is only able to pay 5 cents on the dollar, resulting in \n     an award of $17,500. Under S. 1125 (as introduced) such a \n     claimant would have received $750,000--about 43 times the \n     amount actually paid by the Manville Trust. Nonetheless, many \n     Democrats indicated that the values under the Act should be \n     even more generous to claimants.\n       During Committee consideration of S. 1125, a bipartisan \n     amendment offered by Senators Graham and Feinstein \n     significantly increased the claim values. This amendment was \n     approved by a 14-3 vote of the Judiciary Committee. The \n     Committee also considered and rejected an amendment offered \n     by Senators Leahy and Kennedy to provide even higher claim \n     values. That amendment misallocated funds too heavily toward \n     those with illnesses less clearly linked to asbestos \n     exposure. In addition, the Committee adopted an amendment to \n     index claim awaard values to inflation, further providing \n     billions of dollars in additional payments. Moreover, all \n     claimants meeting Level I requirements--potentially over a \n     million exposed workers--would be eligible for medical \n     monitoring reimbursement and would have their statute of \n     limitations tolled so that, if they do get sick, they would \n     have recourse to all the benefits of the Fund. Since the \n     Committee's consideration, Democrats and organized labor have \n     suggested that the medical monitoring should include the out-\n     of-pocket cost of the physician's examination. I believe this \n     is reasonable and should be in the final bill.\n       With the changes reported out of Committee, the scheduled \n     values under the FAIR Act were even more generous than \n     before. Continuing an example previously mentioned, S. 1125 \n     (as reported) set the Level X (mesothelioma) claim value at \n     an amount that was not three times, but four times\n\n[[Page S15517]]\n\n     higher than the death benefits generally available under the \n     National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act--a difference of \n     $750,000. Similarly, in the bill as reported, mesothelioma \n     claimants would have received not 43 times, but 57 times the \n     amount at which the Manville Trust actually compensates \n     similarly situated victims.\n       Finally, as introduced, S. 1125 granted the Administrator \n     broad authority with respect to the timing of award payments. \n     Organized labor expressed concerns that payments would drag \n     out over a long period of time, and argued that claimants \n     should receive payments over three to four years. The \n     Judiciary Committee addressed this concern by providing that \n     payments should be disbursed over a period of three years, \n     and in no event more than four years from the date of final \n     adjudication of the claim. Organized labor has continued to \n     express concern, however, that there is no standard to guide \n     how much of their awards claimants should receive each year. \n     Again, this concern should be more adequately addressed, if \n     possible. To address organized labor's concerns, negotiators \n     have accepted a presumption for payment of awards over three \n     years in the following percentages: 40 percent in the first \n     year, and 30 percent in each of the next two years. However, \n     if necessary to protect the fund from short-term liquidity \n     problems, the Administrator has the authority to make \n     payments in equal 25 percent installments over four years.\n       Notwithstanding the Committee's action to substantially \n     increase claim values, my Democratic colleagues and organized \n     labor continue to believe further increases are warranted. \n     Although I believe the values in S. 1125 are more than fair, \n     even generous, in a no-fault system, and will bring more to \n     claimants in the aggregate than the current system, I am \n     prepared to consider further modest increases in claims \n     awards in an effort to forge a bipartisan consensus, provided \n     they are targeted to categories most uniquely caused by \n     asbestos exposure (versus other possible causes). Consistent \n     with the express philosophy of S. 1125, the greatest \n     increases must be targeted to the most severe disease \n     categories in which the causal relationship to asbestos \n     exposure is most certain.\n       A remaining challenge, and a prerequisite to any additional \n     increase in claim values, is to address the concern that the \n     criteria for eligible claims under Level VII are sufficiently \n     broad that they could potentially sweep in claimants whose \n     lung cancer is not caused by asbestos but by alternative \n     causes, such as smoking. The American Cancer Society \n     estimates that in 2003 alone there will be over 170,000 new \n     lung cancer cases from all possible causes--or 30,000 more \n     than the Fund's highest projected total of eligible claims \n     over 50 years and over 110,000 more than the highest \n     projections made by Dr. Mark Peterson (who testified before \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee during the debate over the \n     FAIR Act) for the same period. Exacerbating that risk is \n     claims experience demonstrating that well over 90 percent of \n     Manville Trust lung cancer claimants are current or former \n     smokers. There is a substantial risk that, in moving to a no-\n     fault system and eliminating the need to establish asbestos \n     as the cause of the disease, compensating a large number of \n     smoking-caused lung cancer claims could jeopardize the \n     solvency of the Fund. If the current exposure criteria do not \n     adequately narrow eligibility to those lung cancer claims \n     where asbestos exposure significantly increases the risk over \n     smoking, the Fund could potentially collapse.\n       Accordingly, a provision should be added to the legislation \n     to make sure that lung cancer claims not related to asbestos \n     exposure are not allowed to overwhelm the Fund's ability to \n     compensate claimants who have disease caused by asbestos. I \n     will continue to work with my Republican and Democratic \n     colleagues to craft a program review which would authorize \n     the Administrator (in consultation with Congress) to protect \n     the fund if the total number of Level VII claims \n     substantially exceeds projections.\n\n\n                    iii. administration and startup\n\n       In addition to ensuring the availability of adequate funds \n     to pay fair and consistent awards to asbestos victims, \n     another critical element of any solution is to create a \n     system that ensures prompt and efficient payment of awards to \n     eligible claimants, while minimizing transaction costs. \n     Again, this is an area in which we have made great headway \n     towards resolution, but there are still some aspects to be \n     worked out.\n       A number of parties have expressed concerns with the system \n     for filing, evaluating, and reviewing claims established by \n     the FAIR Act. Under S. 1125 as reported from Committee, \n     claims would be filed with, and reviewed by, special masters \n     operating under the guidance of the U.S. Court of Federal \n     Claims. If a claimant were not satisfied with his or her \n     initial award determination, the claimant could appeal to a \n     separate panel of three special asbestos masters. From there, \n     a claimant could appeal an adverse decision to an en banc \n     panel of three judges of the Court of Federal Claims, sitting \n     as the United States Court of Asbestos Claims. Appeals from \n     the Court of Asbestos Claims would be heard by the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A separate Administrator \n     would manage the Fund and pay final claims awards. Because \n     the system was court based, there was no provision \n     authorizing the promulgating of substantive regulations, \n     which could help guide special asbestos masters through the \n     establishment of generally applicable policies for claims \n     evaluations and eligibility determinations. Instead, these \n     issues have necessarily been addressed on an ad hoc basis in \n     the context of individual claims determinations.\n       This court-based system was heavily criticized by Democrats \n     and by organized labor as too complex and adversarial from \n     the perspective of claimants. Labor in particular has \n     insisted instead on an administrative review process, which \n     it believes could resolve more claims in less time using a \n     no-fault, non-adversarial system. With an administrative \n     process, substantive regulations could be utilized to \n     establish generally applicable presumptions and to help guide \n     those evaluating claims to ensure eligibility criteria are \n     fairly and consistently applied. Such a process could also be \n     more ``user friendly'' and would allow claimants themselves, \n     if they so desired, to navigate the process for filing claims \n     without the need to retain counsel. While all parties \n     recognize that legal representation may be beneficial or even \n     necessary at some level of claims review, organized labor has \n     consistently expressed the desire for an administrative \n     system that minimizes the need for attorneys in order to \n     maximize the recovery of a award values by claimants.\n       I recognize the benefits of such a system. I believe we can \n     find common ground on developing a non-adversarial system \n     that can effectively and quickly deliver benefits to \n     claimants. I urge the parties to continue working towards a \n     consensus on this issue. Such a system should significantly \n     reduce transaction costs. We should therefore include a \n     provision limiting plaintiffs' attorney fees to ensure that \n     actual awards to victims are maximized. If done correctly, a \n     new administrative process can also address another problem \n     with the bill as reported by the Committee, by ensuring that \n     the program is operating and processing claims in the minimum \n     amount of time following passage of the FAIR Act.\n       On a related note, S. 1125, as introduced, provided that \n     the new federal trust fund would be the exclusive remedy for \n     all asbestos claims under state and federal law, and that all \n     other remedies were preempted and barred as of the date of \n     enactment. Exclusivity and finality are key elements of the \n     necessary reform. The current tort system has failed victims, \n     and it has done so largely because filing claims on behalf of \n     the unimpaired has become too profitable a business for too \n     many lawyers. Any legislation we pass must end the massive \n     misallocation of limited funds to unimpaired claimants and \n     their lawyers at the expense of those who are ill from \n     asbestos-related disease. We cannot continue to tolerate the \n     expenditure of limited funds into this broken system, a \n     system which spawns inventory-style settlement agreements \n     entered into by attorneys on behalf of claimants who have not \n     even been identified much less bound by the agreement. Nor \n     can we leave insurers and businesses exposed to collusive \n     default judgments or other efforts to evade the Act's \n     exclusivity provisions. Similarly, the bill should plainly \n     foreclose all asbestos-related litigation by claimants \n     against insurers and businesses, including direct actions. In \n     short, given the consensus that the tort system is terribly \n     flawed, we cannot allow the current abuses to persist. \n     Proposals that would have the effect of continuing the status \n     quo--and draining resources that would otherwise be available \n     under the Fund for the truly impaired--are unacceptable.\n       During the markup, Democrats, organized labor, and the \n     trial bar expressed concerns that asbestos victims could be \n     faced with a period of time during program startup when they \n     would have no remedy for their injuries--all tort suits would \n     be preempted but the Fund would not yet be processing claims. \n     In response to this concern, the Committee adopted an \n     amendment offered by Senator Feinstein, which provided that \n     the preemption and bar on asbestos claims would not be \n     effective until the Administrator determined that the Fund \n     was ``fully operational and processing claims.'' Until that \n     time, all remedies would remain available under state law, \n     and defendants' and insurers' contributions to the Fund would \n     be offset by ``the amount of any claims made payable'' during \n     the startup period.\n       The Feinstein amendment was intended to address the \n     legitimate concern that asbestos victims could face a \n     potentially lengthy period of time during which they would be \n     without a remedy. Unfortunately, the amendment would leave \n     the current tort system, with all of its inherent problems, \n     intact for too long and would allow some parties to \n     manipulate this interim period for their personal benefit. No \n     one wants to see the expectations of asbestos claimants \n     undermined by the kind of legal chicanery that created the \n     current crisis. If not fixed, the amendment could cause the \n     very problem the bill is attempting to fix--even more \n     bankruptcies and the continued diversion of resources away \n     from legitimate victims.\n       Moreover, in practice, the Amendment would effectively doom \n     the prospects of the Fund. As was the experience in states \n     that have recently adopted tort reform laws, such as medical \n     malpractice limits, the pending demise of a segment of the \n     tort system inevitably leads to a flood of claims before the \n     courthouse door is effectively closed. Under the Feinstein \n     amendment, awards to plaintiffs, but not defense costs, could \n     be offset against future Fund contributions. As a result, \n     settling claims would be cost free to defendants and \n     insurers, while defending\n\n[[Page S15518]]\n\n     claims in the tort system would continue to be prohibitively \n     expensive. The certain result of this provision would be a \n     very strong incentive, perhaps even a duty for publicly \n     traded companies, to immediately settle all pending claims at \n     potentially elevated values in order to avoid the expense of \n     defending even the most illegitimate claims. Because all \n     these settlement costs would be offset against Fund \n     contributions, the financial effect on funding would be \n     disastrous. Therefore, it is clear that the amendment is \n     not the right solution to a very real problem.\n       To ensure that victims are not left without a remedy for an \n     unjust period of time, I believe we need an alternative to \n     the Feinstein amendment that will address the concerns raised \n     by (1) authorizing the creation of an administrative program \n     on an expedited basis that will be capable of quickly \n     processing the most serious claims, and (2) enhancing the \n     funding provisions to ensure adequate funds are available \n     from the outset to pay these exigent claims on an expedited \n     basis. The bill as reported by the Committee goes a long way \n     toward ensuring that the Fund receives the mandated \n     contributions within a reasonable time frame. Since that \n     time, there has been a number of innovative suggestions \n     relating to the funding and administrative provisions that \n     would work in concert to address the concerns raised, without \n     the dire consequences of the Feinstein amendment. I am \n     confident we can resolve this issue, so that claimants with \n     the most serious injuries are not left without a remedy, and \n     I intend to continue working in conjunction with my \n     Democratic colleagues toward a solution.\n\n\n                  iv. eligibility and medical criteria\n\n       Once the necessary funding is assured, and an \n     administrative process is in place to manage claims fairly \n     and efficiently, the next essential element is to make sure \n     that available resources are directed to the most deserving \n     claimants. In contrast to the existing tort system, in which \n     many if not most asbestos claimants are unimpaired, the FAIR \n     Act will ensure that awards are directed principally to those \n     who have suffered the most from exposure to asbestos. This is \n     assured through the consensus eligibility criteria in the \n     bill, which set forth the applicable exposure, latency, \n     medical, and diagnostic requirements for receiving \n     compensation from the Fund.\n       The basic premise of the FAIR Act is to ensure that true \n     victims of asbestos disease receive fair and consistent \n     awards. To be eligible for compensation from the Fund, \n     claimants must satisfy the eligibility criteria for various \n     disease categories. The FAIR Act also provides a mechanism \n     for consideration of exceptional cases, where claimants can \n     clearly establish the presence of an asbestos-related disease \n     but may not satisfy the otherwise applicable medical \n     criteria. Exceptional cases, as well as those related to \n     ``take home'' exposures where asbestos was brought into the \n     home by an occupationally exposed person and those related to \n     the high levels of environmental exposures of residents and \n     workers in Libby, Montana, are eligible for review by a \n     Medical Advisory Committee, made up objective, experienced \n     physicians, to determine whether the claimant is eligible for \n     compensation. Because the medical conditions of Libby \n     residents are currently being studied by various agencies, \n     claims filed by Libby claimants are automatically designated \n     as exceptional medical claims and referred to the Medical \n     Advisory Committee.\n       The consensus criteria reflected in S. 1125 provide a solid \n     foundation to ensure that eligibility decisions are based on \n     sound medical practices and real diagnoses by the claimants' \n     physicians. As a doctor, I cannot emphasize enough the \n     importance of a diagnosis by the claimant's physician. The \n     success of the program hinges on ensuring that the Fund \n     compensates only those with conditions caused by asbestos \n     exposure and not other causes. Only by ensuring the use of \n     real diagnoses of asbestos-related illnesses can the Fund \n     avoid the pitfalls that plague the current mass tort system.\n       The eligibility criteria reflected in S. 1125, as reported, \n     are the result of an unprecedented agreement among the \n     various stakeholders working to find a solution to the \n     current asbestos litigation crisis. I commend Chairman Hatch \n     and Ranking Member Leahy for an achievement few thought \n     possible. I appreciate how complex and contentious an issue \n     the medical criteria presented. The approval of these \n     criteria by a unanimous vote in the Judiciary Committee \n     markup created the opportunity we have for an historic \n     achievement.\n\n\n                    v. protecting victims from risk\n\n       From the very beginning, one of the key goals of S. 1125 \n     has been to ensure that compensation is directed at those \n     legitimately ill from asbestos exposure and is awarded on a \n     timely basis. The bill accomplishes this fundamental change \n     from the status quo by moving from a system that compensates \n     claims of questionable validity to one based on sound medical \n     evidence and real doctors' diagnoses.\n       Nonetheless, legitimate concerns remain about the accuracy \n     of estimates of the number of future claimants that will be \n     eligible for compensation under the Act. Obviously, prior \n     attempts to forecast asbestos claimants have proven \n     inaccurate, leaving the very people who most deserve \n     compensation with no real recourse. For example, claims to \n     the Manville Trust have exceeded initial projections, and the \n     Trust has been forced to reduce claim values to the point \n     where today the Trust pays claimants as little as five cents \n     on the dollar. Congress cannot and will not recreate the \n     Manville experience.\n       Various experts have developed estimates about future \n     claims, and the Congressional Budget Office has offered its \n     own predictions based upon its review of the available \n     evidence. The truth, however, is that there is no guarantee \n     that any of these estimates is accurate. The legislation \n     creates new eligibility criteria and establishes a new system \n     for processing claims, one designed to weed out unimpaired \n     claimants and those who suffer from diseases not caused by \n     exposure to asbestos. Since there is no comparable system \n     operating today, what is happening with the existing private \n     asbestos trusts can at best offer only some general \n     indication of what may happen over the 50-year life of the \n     proposed Fund. Obviously, this reality makes it even more \n     important for Congress to make sure that if we establish a \n     national asbestos trust fund, that we also make sure that \n     asbestos victims have someplace to go to seek compensation if \n     the Fund cannot handle all future claimants.\n       The FAIR Act, as reported by the Judiciary Committee, \n     includes an amendment offered by Senator Biden that requires \n     the Fund to terminate and claims to revert to the tort system \n     if funding proves inadequate. Specifically, the Administrator \n     would be required to certify annually that 95 percent or more \n     of the eligible claimants that year had received 95 percent \n     of their compensation under the FAIR Act. If not, and the \n     situation could not be remedied within 90 days, the program \n     would sunset immediately. Although this language clearly \n     shifts the risk away from claimants, it unnecessarily \n     jeopardizes the Fund from its very inception and fails to \n     provide sufficient flexibility to address unexpected, and \n     possibly fixable, fluctuations in claims.\n       I agree with the key principle that the risk of inadequate \n     funding cannot fall on those truly ill from asbestos \n     exposure. However, the business community cannot be subjected \n     to an open-ended funding commitment to accommodate an unknown \n     and unlimited number of claimants into the future. Similarly, \n     American businesses cannot risk paying over $100 billion \n     dollars into a Fund only to see it sunset in a few short \n     years. Either of these outcomes would be worse than the \n     current broken system. To succeed, the business community \n     believes the solution must provide at least a limited \n     window of ``peace'' to bring certainty to business and to \n     allow the economy to recover from the burden that asbestos \n     litigation has imposed on it.\n       Therefore, I propose an alternative that will balance these \n     competing tensions while fully protecting sick victims. Under \n     my proposal, if victims do not receive 100 percent of their \n     claim values, the Fund would end and claims would revert to \n     the tort system so that claimants will still have a \n     guaranteed avenue to receive compensation. This approach \n     significantly reduces the need to worry about which claims \n     projections are correct. If the estimates of eligible claims \n     over the next 50 years are too low and the funding is \n     exhausted, then claims will automatically return to the tort \n     system and claimants will be able to preserve their ability \n     to receive compensation. To avoid many of the abuses that \n     have created the current crisis, however, this reversion to \n     the tort system must be to the federal courts and must \n     contain certain additional protections to ensure that the \n     current litigation crisis is not recreated. Obviously, while \n     protecting asbestos victims from risk, my proposal does \n     impose a price on the business community. It compromises to a \n     degree the absolute certainty and finality that have been the \n     hallmarks of a solution for those that must fund the program. \n     They will be forced to bear the risk that the total program \n     funding is not sufficient.\n       There is also a legitimate concern that the Fund could \n     sunset, not because of inaccurate claims projections, but \n     because the new and untested eligibility criteria in the FAIR \n     Act end up compensating the wrong kinds of claims. These \n     would include claims for injuries not caused by asbestos (for \n     example, smoking-related lung cancers, idiopathic pulmonary \n     fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, byssinosis, etc.) or because \n     the Fund's medical, diagnostic, and exposure criteria do not \n     sufficiently eliminate unimpaired claimants. Future victims \n     of asbestos-related disease, as well as those funding the \n     program, have a legitimate and strong interest in ensuring \n     that the Fund is not exhausted because of those kinds of \n     claims. To address that risk, I propose the Fund undertake a \n     periodic review of the program to ensure it is compensating \n     legitimate asbestos-related illnesses. This program review \n     would regularly evaluate the claims submitted, the quality of \n     the supporting evidence, and eligibility and award \n     determinations to determine whether the Fund is compensating \n     the wrong kinds of claimants and to provide the authority and \n     opportunity for the Administrator to address the problem \n     early if that occurs.\n       My proposal also would address another reality--under the \n     current tort system, too much of the risk already falls on \n     victims. Today, some victims go uncompensated because they \n     cannot remember the product to which they were exposed. \n     Others are without recourse because they were exposed in \n     connection with military service and cannot sue the federal \n     government. Other victims who should be compensated too often \n     experience long delays before they receive payment,\n\n[[Page S15519]]\n\n     waiting for their litigation and all possible appeals to be \n     exhausted, and then only seeing half of their award, the rest \n     taken by the lawyers. This is especially true for claimants \n     who are suing companies that have been forced into \n     bankruptcy. There, the legal process can take half a decade \n     and consume millions of dollars, leaving claimants able to \n     recover only pennies on the dollar from the resulting \n     bankruptcy trust. In short, victims bear much of the risk \n     under the status quo, and they will continue to bear that \n     risk until Congress acts. My proposal protects victims from \n     those risks, and offers asbestos victims far more protection \n     and certainty than they have today.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure, having heard the \ndistinguished majority leader speak about asbestos, that we understand, \nas he has indicated, it is a very complicated, difficult issue. But \nthere are concerns that I have, and I think I speak for lots of people \nin this country. I am very concerned about how it affects business, but \nI am also concerned how it affects individual people.\n  I called Mrs. Bruce Vento this week, a woman from Minnesota whose \nhusband served in the House of Representatives, a wonderful man. He \nworked in an asbestos facility for a few months as a young man. He is \n58 years old, he gets sick, he is dead within a year as a result of the \ndisease that comes from being around asbestos, mesothelioma. The \naverage life expectancy of a person who is diagnosed with this disease \nis a little over a year. They die quickly.\n  Then we have asbestosis, where people live longer but it has a \ndetrimental effect on their health.\n  What we have to do is get rid of the spurious lawsuits, those that \ndon't deal with those two conditions about which I just spoke.\n  So I hope, as we proceed through asbestos legislation, we worry about \nand are concerned about these very sick people. People in this Senate \nhave worked extremely hard to come up with a solution. The \ndistinguished Senator from Utah is in the Chamber, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. He and the ranking member, Senator Leahy, have \nworked days and weeks to try to come up with something. We always get \nclose but never quite close enough.\n  So I hope as we proceed, as the distinguished majority leader \nindicated, toward legislation dealing with this, that we keep in mind \nthe main reason we are doing it. The main reason we need to legislate, \nin my opinion, is to take care of the people who get afflicted with the \ndiseases that are related to asbestos. In the process, I hope we can \nban the importation of asbestos into our country. We continue to import \nthousands of tons of this stuff on a yearly basis, even as we speak.\n  So I appreciate the concern of the majority leader. I have concerns \nalso. But if I were giving a speech in a prolonged fashion, I would \nspeak about the people who get sick, as Bruce Vento did, and are now \ndead.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senate Majority \nLeader for his remarks today on the need for the Senate to consider \nasbestos legislation next year. I wholeheartedly agree with him on the \nneed for reform to establish a better system for providing fair and \nefficient compensation to victims of asbestos-related diseases. I \nremain committed to working with Senator Frist, Senator Daschle, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Dodd, Senator Specter, and others, to forge a \nbipartisan solution to this complex challenge.\n  Last fall, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held the \nCommittee's first hearing to begin a bipartisan dialogue about the best \nmeans to compensate current asbestos victims and those yet to come. \nChairman Hatch wisely held two additional hearings this year. Our \nknowledge of the harms wreaked by asbestos exposure has certainly grown \nsince last fall, as have the harms themselves. Not only do the victims \nof asbestos exposure continue to suffer, and their numbers to grow, but \nthe businesses involved, along with their employees and retirees, are \nsuffering from the economic uncertainty surrounding this litigation. \nMore than 60 companies have filed for bankruptcy because of their \nasbestos-related liabilities.\n  These bankruptcies create a lose-lose situation. Asbestos victims who \ndeserve fair compensation do not receive it, and bankrupt companies can \nneither create new jobs nor invest in our economy.\n  A solution has never before been closer than it is today. Since the \nbeginning of 2003, we have come to complete accord on the idea that the \nfairest, most efficient way to provide compensation for asbestos \nvictims is through the creation of a national fund that will apply \nagreed-upon medical criteria in evaluating patients' injuries. We have \nbeen working tirelessly with representatives from organized labor, \ndefendant companies, insurers, and other interested parties, to craft \nan effective trust fund system that will bring the certainty of fair \npayments to victims and financial certainty to industry. A myriad of \nissues have been resolved, from the definitions of the panoply of \nillnesses resulting from asbestos exposure to a ban on the use of \nasbestos in the United States. We are working, even today, on the \ndetails of other aspects of this scheme, down to the fine points of the \nadministrative mechanism for processing claims.\n  We have made real progress in finding common ground. But we have yet \nto reach consensus, and without consensus we cannot end this crisis. \nToo much is at stake for us to walk away when we have come so far. An \neffective and efficient means to end the asbestos litigation crisis is \nwithin reach, and we must grasp it. Although the year is drawing to a \nclose, our bipartisan commitment to this effort remains strong. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my colleagues and all stake holders \nto craft a consensus bill that we can move through the legislative \nprocess and into law next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/22/senate-section/article/S15519-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15519-S15533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF \n                        2003--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are now on this historic piece of \nlegislation. I want to begin a discussion of that shortly.\n  But since the majority leader discussed the subject of asbestos \nlegislation, and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has been \nlargely responsible for moving that legislation as far as it has come \nto date, is here and wishes to make a couple of comments, I would like \nto yield a couple of minutes to the distinguished Senator from Utah and \nthen regain the floor to discuss the Medicare bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, what was the concern?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has yielded to the \nSenator from Utah for 2 minutes and then will reclaim his time. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                            Asbestos Reform\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I appreciated the \nremarks of the distinguished majority leader on the asbestos reform \nlegislation. I certainly appreciate the kind remarks of the minority \nwhip with regard to this. I think both of them spoke eloquently.\n  I rise today in support of the comments of the distinguished majority \nleader with respect to the asbestos legislation. This is an absolutely \nvital issue, and we have the opportunity\n\n[[Page S15520]]\n\nwith S. 1125, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act, to \ncorrect what has been a gross injustice--both to asbestos victims and \nto our economy.\n  For more than 20 years now, compensation to legitimate victims of \nasbestos exposure has been delayed and diminished, while scores of \ncompanies with almost no connection to the problem have had to file for \nbankruptcy and hundreds of others live under the constant threat of \ninsolvency from litigation. As a result tens of thousands of victims \nare not compensated and tens of thousands of workers have lost their \njobs.\n  We've heard the statistics, but they bear repeating. The RAND \nInstitute for Civil Justice tells us that, to date, approximately 70 \ncompanies have been forced into bankruptcy--at least three with \noperations in my home state of Utah.\n  The number of claims continues to rise as does the number of \ncompanies pulled into the web of this abusive litigation, often with \nlittle, if any, culpability. More than 600,000 people have filed \nclaims, and more than 8,400 companies have been named as defendants in \nasbestos litigation.\n  This has become such a gravy train for some abusive trial lawyers \nthat over 2,400 additional companies were named in the last year alone. \nRAND also notes that ``about two-thirds of the claims are now filed by \nthe unimpaired, while in the past they were filed only by the \nmanifestly ill.'' Former Attorney General Griffin Bell, amongst many \nothers, has denounced this type of ``jackpot justice.''\n  To address this problem, I introduced a bipartisan bill with my \nfriends Senators Ben Nelson, Mike DeWine, Zell Miller, George \nVoinovich, George Allen, Saxby Chambliss and Chuck Hagel. This bill \ncreates a fund to provide fair compensation to victims, while reducing \nwasteful transaction costs dramatically. Let me first just dispel a few \nmyths about this bill and set the record straight on a couple of \nissues. First, some Democrats and unions are saying there isn't enough \nmoney in the bill but the fact is that this bill gets more money to \nclaimants on average than the current system does.\n  Let me explain how. There have been several studies of future \nasbestos-related costs under the current system, and the one which \nshows the highest reasonable estimate of prospective costs--the \nMilliman study-- would result in approximately $92 billion for victims, \nafter attorney fees and expenses.\n  Under the FAIR Act, it is estimated that claimants will receive 90 \npercent or more of the total funds under the no-fault, non-adversarial \nsystem. This means the FAIR Act fund--which will have $114 billion \nunder the agreement proposed by Senator Frist--will allow claimants to \ntake home more than $100 billion. This is more total money than they \nare projected to receive under the current tort system.\n  But it is not just more money in the pockets of victims, it is faster \nand more certain compensation as well. We anticipate that claimants \nwill not have to endure years of discovery battles and endless \nlitigation before they get paid. Currently, some victims are dependent \non the solvency of businesses to decide if they get paid or not. Under \nthe FAIR Act, these victims will no longer have to go without payment. \nIt is time to end the current system of Jackpot Justice where only some \nwin and many lose.\n  Some have also argued that there aren't adequate safeguards to ensure \nsolvency of the fund. Baloney. This fund--which is funded at the \nhighest reasonable claim-rate scenario--is equipped with many \nmechanisms to ensure that the pay-in and pay-out requirements are met. \nThis includes borrowing authority against future contributions.\n  It also includes guarantee surcharge and orphan share reserve \naccounts which set aside money to grow and pay for unexpected \nshortfalls. Another safeguard is the provision to empower the Attorney \nGeneral to enforce contribution obligations and ensure collection. And \nbeyond these, there is $10 billion in contingent funding as one more \nadditional safety net. On top of all these safeguards, if the fund \nstill becomes insolvent, claims would revert back to the tort system--a \nprovision, by the way, which Democrats insisted be part of the bill.\n  Given that this bill is a clear net monetary gain for legitimate \nvictims, and provides payments faster and with more certainty, I am at \na loss as to why anyone could object to this bill. The unions that \ncontinue to oppose the bill risk throwing away the last, best chance to \ncompensate fairly those who are truly sick and provide some protection \nto those whose jobs and pensions are at risk because of the asbestos \nlitigation crisis.\n  Quite frankly, the only entity that stands to lose under this bill is \nthe plaintiffs' bar which has siphoned off more than $20 billion of the \ncosts incurred on this issue as of the end of last year. If the FAIR \nAct is passed, they will not be able to use unimpaired claims to \ncontinue to squeeze a projected $41 billion more for themselves from \nremotely-connected companies by abusing a broken system.\n  Fair is fair--I am all in support of compensating plaintiffs' \nattorneys for the value of their work. But when it diverts valuable \nresources away from sick victims, something is wrong with the system.\n  No one can accuse us of being unwilling to compromise in order to \nfinally be able to address this overwhelming crisis being caused by \nasbestos litigation. When you look at where our bill started--and it \nwas a good start--and where it is now, our efforts at compromise are \nblatantly clear.\n  In May we circulated a bipartisan draft measure and my staff met with \nDemocrat staff to listen to their concerns and we incorporated several \nrequests--even before introduction. We then embarked on several weeks \nof markup which saw 23 Democratic-initiated amendments adopted into \nthis legislation. Now I didn't agree with all of them, but it can \nhardly be said that there hasn't been strong participation by Democrats \non this bill. This chart behind me lists just some of the changes we \nmade at the behest of Democrats; let me highlight a few of them for \nyou.\n  We increased overall funding. Our bill started with a mandated $94 \nbillion in contributions, which by most reasonable estimates should \nhave provided sufficient resources for compensating legitimate \nclaimants. In committee we increased base funding to $108 billion \ndollars. That additional $14 billion is not pocket change. We also took \nsteps to ensure the enforcement of contributions as an added protection \nto the solvency of the fund.\n  We increased the number of claimants that would receive compensation \nby modifying the qualifying medical criteria and by including a \nprovision to accommodate the unique circumstances of the victims in \nLibby, MT.\n  Moreover, we increased the amount of money that will go to claimants. \nEven though our original claim values would have on average provided \nmore money to legitimate claimants, we increased the values even more. \nAnd we removed most collateral source offsets to ensure that more of \nthe award goes directly to the claimant.\n  These changes listed on the chart behind me do not even include other \nchanges that we have offered since the bill was reported out of \ncommittee to even further accommodate their requests, such as an \nadditional $6 billion increase in overall funding and significant \nincreases in claims values in many categories. And we also offered a \nmore flexible borrowing authority as another safeguard for solvency.\n  Now I understand that some want to make further changes, including \nstreamlining the claims process even more, and I have said I'm willing \nto look at such proposals. But this and other complaints have been \nraised without the follow up of a concrete, alternative proposal. I \nhope that before this issue comes up in March as the Majority Leader \nindicated that we will resolve the outstanding issues.\n  We cannot delay any longer--we need to ensure that the truly sick get \npaid, while providing stability to our economy by stemming the rampant \nlitigation that has resulted in a tidal wave of bankruptcies, \nendangering jobs and pensions. This crisis reaches far and wide--and it \nhurts everyone.\n  On Monday, this body will pass an historic bipartisan Medicare bill \nthat will provide our seniors with drug benefits.\n  We can and should use this spirit of bipartisanship to come together \non the asbestos issue.\n\n[[Page S15521]]\n\n  I thank Senator Frist for his leadership on Medicare and the \nconstructive role he is playing on asbestos. Working together I am \nconfident that Senators Daschle, Specter, Leahy and Dodd will all join \ntogether when we bring the asbestos bill to the floor in March.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say again, this asbestos legislation, \ndiscussed by the leader, is very important for us to conclude early \nnext year, and I make the point again, were it not for the work of the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, we would not be at the position \nwhere we hope to be close to finishing that legislation at some point.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield to determine where we might be this \nmorning?\n  There are several in the Chamber who wish to begin to speak on the \nMedicare prescription drug issue. Have we established any order for \nthat purpose?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order other than to alternate \nspeakers.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield for \na response?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. What is in place is an agreement, gentlemen's in nature, \nthat we would go back and forth. We are trying to work out an agreement \nwhere we would divide the time between proponents and opponents until \n11 o'clock tonight. That has not been done yet, but there is something \nthat has been typed up.\n  The reason going back and forth may not be fair is someone may speak \nfor an hour and a half and someone else may speak for 10 or 15 minutes. \nSo we have to come up with something better than that. That is what we \nare trying to do now.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I suggest that during the time I am \nspeaking, those who would like to speak in conjunction with the Senator \nfrom Nevada begin to work up a schedule. I would be happy to propound a \nunanimous consent request when that is concluded to reflect the \nagreement, at least for the next several hours, if that could be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is a historic day. Obviously, when one \ngoes back to 1965 and thinks about the creation of Medicare, a lot has \nchanged since then. We are here today to begin debating in the Senate a \nbill which passed early this morning in the House of Representatives, \nhas long been advocated by President Bush, and which many people have \nworked on for a very long time, to try to modernize our Medicare system \nwhich, after 35 years, we recognize in this new 21st century needs to \nbe changed to some extent.\n  For example, during that period of time, prescription drugs have \nbecome a major component--indeed, in many cases the first component--of \ntreatment for ailments, disease, and afflictions of people.\n  Mr. President, 35 years ago prescription drugs were used to alleviate \nsymptoms of pain and occasionally to treat conditions, but more \nintrusive methods were the order of the day at that time. The Medicare \nprogram for seniors reflects the conditions then by covering hospital \nstays and physician benefits, but not outpatient prescription drugs. \nThe prescription drugs which have over the last 35 years become a key, \nif not the key, component of medical treatment have not been a part of \nMedicare because they were not as key in 1965. So we know we need to \nadd prescription drug coverage for our seniors and for those who are \ndisabled and who qualify for Medicare.\n  There are other changes we know, also, that would help to strengthen \nMedicare, to ensure that as we proceed to provide Medicare to the baby \nboom generation, we will be able to do so with the highest quality of \ncare possible, at prices that both they and the American people can \nafford and, as I say, which really encompasses the new concepts of \nmodern medicine in this treatment.\n  So the question was how we would develop a system to provide \nprescription drugs as a component of Medicare. There were several \ndifferent options, but the option that has been finally settled upon is \none which I can support, and as someone who actually advocated a \nsomewhat different approach, I would like to speak to those primarily \nwho, like me, were not particularly pleased with the initial direction \nin which this legislation proceeded, to talk about why, at the end of \nthe day, it is the best we can do under these circumstances and I think \nunder any foreseeable circumstances of the near future, and therefore \nwhy it is important to move forward with this legislation.\n  It is momentous, it is huge in terms of the amount of money we are \ntalking about, a commitment over the next 10 years of $400 billion. \nThat was the amount that Congress agreed to with the adoption of our \nbudget and the crafting of this legislation. We resolved that this \nmoney would be set aside to provide this prescription drug benefit and \nmake changes in Medicare to ensure the benefits of Medicare would be \navailable to everyone in a quality way during the 21st century.\n  Let me discuss first of all some disappointments I have with the bill \nbecause these have been discussed by others and I want them to know I \nam very cognizant of the concerns that have been expressed.\n  I served on the conference committee that crafted this legislation \nand I spent literally hundreds of hours working with colleagues through \nthese issues. Some of the battles we fought, I helped to prevail on, \nothers we did not prevail on. But it is the nature of compromise \nbetween the two bodies and between the two parties, especially when the \nSenate is almost equally divided that no one is going to get everything \nthey think is best.\n  Let me first of all talk about the approach that was taken here and \nwhy in some respects I think we made some wrong turns, but how we have \ntried to recognize that and to ameliorate the effects of those wrong \nturns as much as we could.\n  There was a sense in this country, because there are many people who \ncould not afford all of the prescription drugs they need in their \ntreatment, that the Medicare plan had to be modified to ensure they \ncould have access to those drugs at a reasonable cost. That was an \napproach that many Members thought would best utilize the funding \navailable, to provide the maximum amount of benefit to those who most \nneeded it.\n  Somewhere along the way, a major decision was made which \nfundamentally altered that concept. It was a decision that was strongly \nfavored by the AARP, for example, a group which I am very pleased to \nsay is in support of this legislation and has taken a strong role in \neducating America about the benefits of this legislation. That decision \nwas to make the benefit of prescription drugs universal; that is to \nsay, to make it available to all Medicare-eligible people, not simply \nto try to help those who needed the help the most.\n  The first result of that was it significantly reduced the amount of \nmoney we could make available to those who need it the most because, \nobviously, if you provide a universal benefit, you are providing it to \neveryone who qualifies for Medicare basically equally to those who do \nnot need the benefit, because they have more money, as well as those \nwho do need the benefit. Once that decision was made, it reduced the \namount of money we could allocate to help those who needed the help the \nmost. I regret that. We could have structured a plan that would have \nmore targeted the benefits where they were needed the most.\n\n  In addition, we created some other problems. One of the problems is, \nemployers who provide prescription drug retiree benefits will have less \nincentive to do that in the future because the Government will do so if \nthey do not. Many will argue, why should we spend our money, our \ncorporate funds, to support the prescription drug retiree benefits that \nwe have done in the past when, if we stop that coverage, the Government \nwill pick it up? The result of that was we had to allocate over $70 \nbillion of this money to be paid to these business plans, union plans, \nand even government plans, that provided retiree health care benefits \nwith drug coverage. We had to provide that money to them to enable them \nto continue providing the coverage. Some call it a subsidy. It is a \nfair term, I suppose. But one might say we are paying them three \nfourths of what it would cost the Government, to provide this \nparticular benefit.\n\n[[Page S15522]]\n\n  So from the Government's point of view, we are saving money because \nif these company plans did not continue the coverage, the Government \nwould have to pick up 100 percent of the cost. Nevertheless, it took a \nchunk of the money out of the program to pay for benefits that are \nalready being paid for by somebody else, thus further reducing the \namount of money we could allocate to those that need the care the most.\n  So those are just two examples of problems created by this initial \ndecision.\n  The original idea of many Members was that we should provide more \nchoices to seniors. Many Members came to that conclusion because \nFederal Government employees such as Members of Congress have a lot \nmore choices in our drug coverage. We are entitled to enroll in \nsomething called the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, or \nFEHBP, and we have a lot of health insurance options. These insurance \noptions are integrated health-care plans. They provide all of our care, \nfrom hospitals to doctors as well as prescription drugs.\n  A lot of Federal employees, 10 million strong, like those kind of \nplans. Many are PPOs, preferred provider organizations, where you go to \nany one of the doctors on a list who has signed up with that \norganization, or you can even go out-of-network, you can go to a \ndifferent doctor, and that is still OK. This was the concept the \nPresident originally announced and it is a concept I strongly supported \nbecause it would maximize choices.\n  At the same time, we recognize that a lot of people would still want \nto maintain what they currently have, what we call traditional fee-for-\nservice Medicare, and simply add a drug benefit on top of that. We did \nnot want to take that choice away. So the concept was to have basically \ntwo choices: Stay in traditional Medicare with the new drug benefit, or \nsign up with one of these new insurance programs, a PPO or what we call \ntoday Medicare+Choice, which is predominantly HMOs. That choice has \nbeen created in this legislation. The choice is a good choice.\n  I regret, however, that I don't think we have given the health \ninsurance option a good enough chance to attract very many \nbeneficiaries. There are efforts in the bill to do that, but I think we \nput too many restrictions on the PPOs, in particular, to expect they \nwill be very successful. For one thing, we strongly regulate how much \nthey can be paid. As a matter of fact, their payment rates are directly \ntied to what we pay in regular fee-for-service Medicare. That is price \ncontrol. Congress and the administration set the prices that can be \npaid under the traditional Medicare Program. We were trying to get away \nfrom that heavy price control with this new insurance option. \nUnfortunately, in an effort to make sure we could keep the costs \nratcheted down and compare those costs to what we are paying for \ntraditional Medicare, there is a direct relationship between what we \npay in traditional Medicare and what will be paid on the private health \ninsurance side. It is not really like regular private insurance. This \nis very highly regulated, controlled price, controlled private \ninsurance as the alternative to fee-for-service Medicare.\n  I think it is less likely those PPOs are going to succeed as a result \nof that. Nevertheless, we at least, for the first time, have the \nconcept of private health insurance as an option to traditional fee-\nfor-service Medicare for all beneficiaries.\n  Senator Nickles, in particular, and I worked strongly to increase the \nflexibility that the insurance option could provide so there could be \nliterally dozens of products out there like the FEHBP for Federal \nemployees, and people could decide what was best for them. Again, \nunfortunately, that flexibility has been greatly limited in this \nlegislation, primarily because of concerns by the Congressional Budget \nOffice that if very much flexibility were provided, the cost of the \nprogram could exceed the $400 billion.\n  As a result, the options that are offered by these private plans will \nbe very limited. For example, as you will hear others get into the \ndetails of the legislation, especially the drug benefit--and my \ncolleague, the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Mr. Grassley, is in the Chamber. I know he will go into \ngreat detail about precisely how this works.\n  When that occurs, and you see how this benefit is going to be \nprovided, one of the things you will see is that even though there is a \nvery generous benefit--the Government will pay 75 percent of your drug \ncosts up to $2,250, after a $250 deductible; so it will pay about \n$1,500 worth of drug benefits--at that point, then, the individual is \ngoing to be responsible for a little under $3,000 worth of drug \nbenefits, before the catastrophic coverage of 95 percent Government-\npaid kicks in. Some people refer to this as a donut hole.\n  Obviously, with $400 billion allocated to the problem, we are not \ngoing to be able the pay all of everybody's drug costs. There is not \nenough money in the Federal budget for us to do that. As a result, you \ncan only cover what that amount of money will cover.\n  Well, it is hoped that the private sector insurance option will \nprovide different ways of ensuring against that donut hole, ensuring \nagainst that out-of-pocket expense that individuals will have to pay. \nBut, unfortunately, that cannot be done under this legislation. The \nthreshold can be raised, but the out-of-pocket amount still has to \nremain the same. As a result, there is a limitation on the insurance \nproduct that can be offered.\n  Again, Senator Nickles and I had hoped there would be a lot more \nflexibility. I am hoping in the future we can loosen this up so these \nhealth insurance options can act like regular insurance options.\n  Another point: If you go to an insurance company today, a preferred \nprovider organization, and you would like to get treatment from a \ndifferent doctor who is not in their network, you can go to that \ndifferent doctor. The plan will only pay an agreed-upon amount, and \nthen you are billed for the difference between that and the physician's \nreasonable and customary fee. That is standard practice today.\n  That cannot be done under the way this legislation is written. That \nhas to be fixed as well. Right now there is a price cap on that, and, \ntherefore, it will discourage people from going out of the network, \nwhich will discourage people from signing up with PPOs in the first \nplace.\n  These issues will have to be addressed later because we did not give \nsufficient flexibility to the insurance company alternative in this \ncurrent bill. Again, I am speaking primarily to those who, like me, \napproach this with the idea that we could provide coverage similar to \nFEHBP coverage that the President originally articulated as the goal, \nand as someone who did not win all of the battles in this negotiation, \nbut who still believes that at the end of the day, this is the best we \nare going to do, either now or any time in the future, that I can \npredict, given the politics, given the closeness of the Democrat-\nRepublican split in the Senate and in the House of Representatives and \nthe various other factors that influenced the decisions that we made.\n  Let me talk a little bit more about the drug benefit. Seniors today \nbuy Medigap insurance, and that provides them a certain degree of drug \ncoverage. It is regulated by the Government, but I think a lot of \nseniors believe they have pretty good drug coverage because of the \nMedigap insurance they have. The reality is, they are paying a lot of \nmoney for not that great of coverage. They pay almost as much money in \npremiums as the amount of coverage they receive. So it is not \ncompletely dollar for dollar, but it is not the kind of insurance that \nordinarily we would think of.\n\n  As a result, the drug benefit that we provide here will be more \nsubstantial for the amount of money that is paid. But I do fear a lot \nof people will see the drug benefit we provide here as less than they \nare able to obtain today through their Medigap insurance, and it is \ngoing to be incumbent upon all of us to explain to people how this drug \nbenefit will work. Again, it calls for us to try to loosen up the way \nthe private insurance market can provide the drug coverage to meet \nseniors' objectives, not all of which are precisely the same.\n  Therefore, in order to convince them there are good alternatives to \nwhat they have today, since they are not going to be able to purchase \nthe new drug benefit through the means of\n\n[[Page S15523]]\n\nMedigap insurance anymore--that will be done through a different \nmechanism--it is going to be important for us, I think, to provide them \nthe maximum type of flexibility and choices, something, again, that we \nare going to have to address in the future because it is too restricted \nin the bill as we have it written today.\n  There are other items--and I do not want to dwell on the negative--\nbut just to cite two or three others to show areas in which we could \nhave done better.\n  Today, we reimburse physicians and hospitals in a very irrational \nway. It is very tightly controlled. It is price controls. We never get \nit right. We tend to want to save costs, so we do not reimburse them \nenough, and then hospitals begin to shut down, doctors begin to get out \nof Medicare, and we realize we have made a horrible mistake. So then we \nratchet the payments back up, and it is a very herky, jerky way of \nreimbursing the very people we rely upon to provide the critical health \ncare that we want. As a result, we have tried to figure out ways to \nmake this more rational.\n  Well, the best example is in the case of oncologists, doctors who \nprovide us drugs to treat cancer. The oncologists are not reimbursed at \nanywhere near what it costs them to provide this service for us. As a \nresult, what they have to do is to buy the drugs for the chemo part of \nchemotherapy, and they mark up the value of those drugs, sell them to \nthe patient, and that is how they get reimbursed for what they do. Of \ncourse, people have said: Well, it is a huge markup. They are making a \nlot of money off these drugs. And it is true that there is a huge \nmarkup. It is not a rational way of reimbursing them.\n  So what we tried to do was to go back and fix the basic formula, \ncalled the practice expense formula, to figure out how much it really \ncosts those doctors to stay in business to provide this all-critical \ncare for cancer patients, and we begin to re-adjust that formula so it \nwill pay them more, and, at the same time reducing the markup they get \non the drugs so they would not have to be paid out of that pot of \nmoney, in effect.\n  Well, we got about halfway there, but we still have more work to do \non that particular formula. So it is just an example of how the \nMedicare system served seniors well, but there are clearly things in it \nthat need to be fixed if we are going to continue to provide high-\nquality care and to ensure that we have physicians and hospitals that \ncan stay in business to take care of us.\n  Cardiothoracic surgeons are another group. The very best of these \nsurgeons go into the operating room with their own team. This is life \nand death. They have teams that work together for years. They have had \na lot of experience in doing what they do. But they do not get \nreimbursed for their team members, their nurses, and so on. What they \nhave to do is pay for that out of their own pocket. You can obviously \nsee, at a certain point, they are not going to be able to provide the \nhigh-quality care. What they have to do is basically go into the \nhospital and take whoever the hospital has at that time. They do not \nwork together as a team, and they provide about half as many people as \nsome of these surgeons need in order to provide the highest quality \ncardiac care.\n  Here is another area in which we could have provided at least a \ndemonstration project or two to figure out how best to reimburse these \ncardiothoracic surgeons. We failed to do so in this legislation. We \nneed to do that in the future. Cost containment was another matter. We \nwanted, given the fact this legislation could explode in cost, to have \nsomething in this bill that would ensure that the costs would be \ncontrolled.\n  There is a section in here that purports to do that, but it is \nlargely illusory. It basically says, at a certain point in time we have \nto get together and make some recommendations. The President has to \nsend some recommendations down to us. We do not have to act on them, of \ncourse. And it is really very hard to change the rules of the Senate to \nforce us to act on something like this.\n  So I just want to let my conservative friends know that, no, there is \nnot good cost containment in this legislation. But I would also ask \nthem to think about one other thing; and that is, there is no free \nlunch. If you want high-quality health care, you are going to have to \nbe willing to pay something for it.\n  I think sometimes conservatives look at one side of that ledger but \nnot the other. We have to do everything we can to ensure that taxpayers \ncan afford this expense. But we also do not want to be penny-wise and \npound-foolish when it comes to providing quality health care for our \nseniors and for others who are on Medicare.\n  Indeed, for those who say we are going to control the costs in this \nlegislation, I would say that the means of doing so that are in the \nbill are primarily price controls by the Government, which have been \ndemonstrated not to work very well, and I think we can expect that the \nyounger generation is going to bear the full brunt of this expense.\n  It is a $400 billion expense over 10 years. It is not taken out of \nany kind of payroll tax or other kind of payment by the beneficiary for \nthat segment of what we are providing. It is going to be paid for out \nof the pockets of people who are working to earn a living and pay for \ntheir kids' education. We have to stop and evaluate whether, with a lot \nof seniors who are well enough off to afford drug coverage, it is fair \nto ask their kids, who are struggling at this point to make a living, \nto bear more of the burden.\n  There is well over $100 billion of this, probably about $150 billion, \nin premiums and copays and deductibles that will go toward the benefit \nwe are providing here that is worth $400 billion. But let us not forget \nthat the $400 billion money is being paid by taxpayers. So cost \ncontainment is important, and it will boil down to the discipline that \nwe in the House and Senate and the President can exercise in keeping \nthe right balance between cost containment and providing high-quality \ncare.\n  I have stressed the negatives to try to establish a point. I didn't \nget my way negotiating this legislation despite hundreds of hours of \nwork in the conference committee. Nobody got 100 percent of what they \nwanted. For those conservatives who are disappointed because of the \nkind of things I have been talking about here or the lack thereof that \nshows we really missed a historic opportunity to make the bill better, \nI would like now to address why I think, nevertheless, they should \nsupport the legislation.\n  It boils down to the fact that it is extraordinarily difficult with \nsomething this big and this complicated and important to so many \npeople, with every Senator and every Representative having a very big \nstake in trying to get it right, to reach the kind of compromise that \nis going to make any particular group happy.\n  I note there was a scathing op-ed piece against one of the Democratic \nMembers who was substantially involved in these negotiations, \ncriticizing him for not representing his point of view well. I can't \ntell you how wrong the writer of that piece was. From my perspective, \nthat distinguished Senator got far more than I did out of this. He won \nmore of the battles than I did.\n  I think one should be a little bit careful about simply putting the \nideology out there and saying, because one side didn't get everything \nit wanted, therefore it is a bad bill. The reality is that under the \ncircumstances we face today, I think it would be impossible to put \ntogether a bill that would provide drug benefits for our seniors that \nwould do it any better than what we have done here.\n  Why do I say that? Some people say, let's let this bill fail and we \nwill come back and simply provide a drug benefit to those who need it \nthe most. I think we have gone too far for that. Groups such as AARP \nare not going to support that. Their support is very important for a \nprogram such as this. I don't think a lot of Senators would support \nthat. So even though that might have been how I would have liked to \nhave started this process, I don't think that is going to pass.\n  Do we let 2 or 3 more years elapse without providing a drug benefit? \nI don't think that is an alternative. So I would challenge anybody who \nsays this bill isn't perfect to demonstrate to me how they could cobble \ntogether a majority to provide an important drug benefit and still \nachieve all of the objectives they want to achieve and get it passed.\n\n[[Page S15524]]\n\n  We do need to include prescription drugs in Medicare. They haven't \nbeen included, and we all know this is the preferred method for \ntreatment by most physicians for many illnesses and diseases today. We \nalso need to ensure that those who don't have coverage can get it. The \noptions we provide in this bill at least get us part way down that \nroad.\n  Importantly, we will be reducing the costs of prescription drugs both \nto third party payers, whether it be the Government or the employers, \nas well as the seniors for the part they have to pay. How is this done? \nThere are a variety of mechanisms in the bill. One of them is the fact \nthat the Government and the private plans will be buying in bulk. \nEverybody can understand that concept. You can buy for a lower cost if \nyou buy in bulk. Another is that there are a lot of incentives to use \nfewer drugs, to use generic drugs, drugs that are based on a formulary \nthat more specifically fits the particular patient's need, and not to \nhave a lot of extra drugs sitting around in the drug cabinet. Almost \nall of us have extra drugs sitting around, which is probably not a very \nhealthy thing. It is a costly thing as well.\n\n  There are a lot of incentives built in this legislation that should \npermit us to reduce the cost of drugs both for the third party payers \nas well as for the seniors themselves for the portion they are going to \nhave to take care of.\n  Another important thing in this legislation is that we at least go a \nlittle way toward rationalizing the system of paying the doctors and \nthe hospitals and other health care providers that have not been \nadequately reimbursed. There were large cuts in store for hospitals and \ndoctors. Those cuts are no longer in place. In fact, there are very \nmodest increases for physicians and hospitals: A 1.5 percent increase \nfor the physicians, instead of the 4.5 percent cut that was going to \ntake place starting January 1 if we did not act. At least there is \nmodest support for those that we really count on when the chips are \ndown to take care of us.\n  As I said, if we defeat this bill now, I don't see how we can come \nback and provide these things, how we can get consensus to do it \nanytime in the near future.\n  Another important item is the health savings accounts provision. Many \nof us have believed for a long time this could really provide a long-\nterm way for people to build up the savings they can apply toward \nhealth care for insurance and out-of-pocket expenses so that they won't \nneed to rely as much on Medicare when they get to be eligible for \nMedicare.\n  We know one of the reasons we have high-priced drugs is that \nAmericans have to bear almost the full burden of the cost of production \nof drugs since other countries, such as our friends to the south and \nnorth, have price controls on how much they can reimburse the drug \ncompanies for their prescription drugs. This is unfair trade. It puts \nall of the burden, a cost shift, on the American consumer. This bill \nprovides instruction to our Trade Representative to come up with a way \nto deal with those other countries to get them to share more of the \nburden of the expense of producing these important drugs for us.\n  We also include the affluence testing of the Medicare Part B premium \nfor those at the very wealthy end of the spectrum; a senior who makes \nover $80,000 a year, for example. I think it is not too much to ask \nthem to pay a little bit more in their Medicare premium for the \ncoverage they receive.\n  We index the Part B deductible so we don't have to come back every 10 \nyears and have Congress pass a law. This will basically keep up with \nthe cost of inflation. We also include a change for so-called 340B \nhospitals. These 340B hospitals are public safety net hospitals, and we \nenable them to purchase their inpatient drugs cheaper than they can \npurchase them today. I introduced legislation earlier on this subject, \nand I am pleased we have that provision included here.\n  Then finally a provision that is important to those States such as \nthe border States--Arizona, Texas, California, and others--that are \nrequired under Federal law to provide treatment to illegal immigrants \nbecause of the law called EMTALA, the Emergency Medical Treatment and \nActive Labor Act, that says no emergency room can turn away a patient \nwhether that patient can pay or not.\n  Because emergency rooms now are faced with treating illegal \nimmigrants under this requirement and because the Federal Government \nhas not been able to enforce the law to prevent those people from \ncoming into the country illegally in the first instance, we believed it \nwas important for the Federal Government to at least help these \nhospitals defray some of the expenses they are incurring, which in some \ncases are so severe, it is forcing hospitals to consider closing down \nand certainly shutting down emergency room care.\n  That can't be. American citizens should not suffer because of a law \nthat requires that we provide care to illegal immigrants. We can at \nleast reimburse those hospitals for a portion of the cost they bear. \nThis bill provides $250 million a year for 4 years to provide that kind \nof reimbursement.\n  There are a lot of positives in the bill. There is a lot more I know \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee will discuss in more detail.\n  What I want to do is discuss it from the standpoint of somebody who \nhas been critical, who has constantly said: We can do better. We are \nmissing opportunities. We ought to do this in a way that is more \nflexible, that looks more like the FEHBP. I didn't win a lot of those \nbattles, but we have an opportunity to at least implement a plan that \nwe have a possibility of making better over time as people see the \nadvantages of the concepts we have put in the legislation.\n  We have the knowledge that at least in the foreseeable future, \nbecause we are adequately reimbursing those people upon whom we rely \nfor care, that we are going to have that care provided to us in a \nquality way and that our seniors will not suffer because we didn't \nconsider it important enough to provide for them the very best.\n  Without this legislation, they will continue to pay more than they \nshould for prescription drugs. They won't receive as much in the way of \nprescription drug coverage or care. And that will be a shame at a time \nwhen this country has the capability of providing that kind of care.\n  Notwithstanding all of the concerns I have noted, the challenges we \nneed to face in the future, we should support the legislation.\n  I chair the Health Care Subcommittee of the Finance Committee in the \nSenate. I intend to have hearings next year into areas that may need \nimprovement. I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve \nthis historic legislation as we move forward. We owe our senior \ncitizens no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are alternating back and forth. It is \nobvious that it is not fair. The Senator from Arizona did not speak for \nan inordinate amount of time. If somebody comes and speaks for 5 \nminutes who is opposed to the legislation and someone speaks for 45 \nminutes in favor of it, that doesn't work out. I am somewhat at a loss \nas to why we have not worked out an arrangement that the time between \nnow and 11 o'clock be equally divided between proponents and opponents, \nwith no limit as to how much they could speak.\n  If someone who wanted to speak in favor of the legislation were here \nand there was nobody to speak in opposition, that person could go ahead \nand speak. For reasons I don't understand, the floor staff has not \ngotten that approved by the managers and leadership.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is here in the Chamber. He is going to \nspeak against the legislation. With the agreement now in effect, it \nwould be his time to speak. I know the manager is here. Is that OK with \nthe Senator?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield? I know the Senator is going to \nspeak at 11 o'clock. I was told I could speak. The Senator from \nIllinois has been here for some time. I understand both of these \nSenators anticipate fairly lengthy statements. I do not. I anticipated \nno more than 10 minutes. Is it possible that I could slip in there \nsomewhere?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the Senator from West Virginia would \nbe happy to yield for 10 minutes to the Senator; is that right? I don't \nknow that to be the case. This shows how unfair this whole situation \nis.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Exactly right.\n\n[[Page S15525]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I cannot imagine what is holding up the UC to allow the \ntime to be divided equally.\n  I yield to the Senator from West Virginia. He has an obligation. That \nis why he is here at 11. The Senator from Illinois said he would be \nhappy to yield, following the statement of Senator Byrd, to the \nSenator. He has that right anyway; he doesn't need consent to do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in any event, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois would be recognized at the same time--if I understand the \nrequest of the Senator from Nevada. If the Senator from Idaho goes \nfirst and then I go next, then the Senator from Illinois would go; or \nif I go first, and the Senator from Idaho goes next, then the Senator \nfrom Illinois would go. So the Senator from Illinois, through his \ngracious courtesy, which is so characteristic of him, either way, that \nwould suit the Senator from Illinois.\n  That being the case, I have no problem with yielding to the Senator \nfrom Idaho next, if he can limit his statement to 10 minutes, which I \nunderstood he would.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would do that under a unanimous consent, certainly.\n  Mr. REID. Just understand that following Senator Byrd is Senator \nDurbin. There could be as much as an hour and a half. I want to make \nsure everybody understands that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Idaho be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes, and then the Senator from West \nVirginia, followed by the Senator from Illinois.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will not speak longer than 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Chair signal me when I have spoken for 9 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Medicare conference report now before \nthe Senate, brings to fruition President Bush's early and strong \ncommitment to prescription drug relief, and it reflects nearly 6 years \nof difficult congressional debate.\n  The Senator from Iowa is here in the Chamber. He has played a key \nrole in shaping the final package, in hours and hours of work with our \nmajority leader and with leaders from the other side, to try to strike \na critical balance.\n  This historic legislation, like the 38-year-old program it seeks to \nreform, is indeed expensive, complex, and unweildy but it is a \ncompromise I can and will support, although not without some very \nstrong reservations.\n  This bill is a solid step toward accomplishing two core goals: \nProviding prescription drug relief to seniors in need, and \nstrengthening Medicare's future through greater market competition.\n  This legislation also includes dramatic improvements in consumer \nchoice through health savings accounts, and perhaps the best package of \nrural health care improvements Congress has ever considered. I know its \nimpact on the rural hospitals of Idaho will be significant.\n  Despite its deep and undeniable faults, this bill offers a rare \nopportunity unlikely to return for several more years, if ever--years \nin which millions of seniors will continue to suffer for lack of needed \ndrugs and years in which the retirement of America's baby boomers will \ndraw ever closer, and the modernization of Medicare will become ever \nmore urgent. No, it is not perfect, but to hold out for perfection \nwould risk a permanent sacrifice of much that is good and necessary in \nthis legislation.\n  As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I have chaired \nseveral hearings examining many of the hard questions in this debate--\nincluding the long-term demographic and financial pressures facing \nMedicare, and the importance of integrating competitive alternatives \ninto Medicare's future. I am pleased to see some of these themes \nreflected in the legislation before us today.\n  Mr. President, my reasons for supporting this legislation are \nstraightforward:\n  First, the legislation provides long overdue drug relief for our \nNation's seniors. Nearly every health insurance plan in America today \ncontains drug coverage. It is time Medicare did, too.\n  Beginning in 2006, seniors who decide to enroll in this completely \nvoluntary new program and will pay a premium of about $35 and will \nreceive a 75 percent subsidy for the first $2,250 in annual drug costs, \nafter meeting an initial $250 deductible. And after a senior's annual \ndrug costs reach $3,600, Medicare will cover 95 percent, providing \nessential relief for those seniors with catastrophic drug needs.\n  Overall, the average senior enrolled in this program will see annual \ndrug costs reduced by 44 percent to 68 percent. In the nearer term, \nprescription drug discount cards will be available, offering seniors \ndrug discounts of up to 10 to 25 percent.\n  Second, I am very pleased that the bill devotes the greatest share of \nits relief to seniors of modest and low income, those who need it the \nmost.\n  For these seniors, the relief will be even greater than in the basic \npackage. In Idaho, nearly 35 percent of our Medicare beneficiaries are \nlikely to qualify. Seniors whose incomes fall below about $13,500 for \nan individual or $18,200 for a couple will receive deeply discounted \npremiums and deductibles, and those whose income is below about $12,100 \nfor an individual or $16,200 for a couple will have no premium or \ndeductible and will pay only a few-dollar copayment for each \nprescription.\n  The important thing to keep in mind is that the proportion of seniors \ntoday who have no private drug coverage at all is relatively small--\nabout 25 percent--and it is on these seniors, as well as those whose \ncurrent coverage is inadequate, that this bill is focused. In short, \nthose in the greatest need get the greatest benefit and that is as it \nshould be.\n  Third, the bill before us today seeks to bring Medicare into the 21st \ncentury, not just by providing prescription drug coverage, but also by \noffering seniors the choice to enroll in federally supervised but \nprivately operated health care plans--that same kind of choice and \ncoverage currently enjoyed by other Americans under 65.\n  Medicare today remains weighted down by rigid bureaucracy and complex \nregulations--regulations that are already beginning to drive doctors \nand other health care providers out of the program. Even more \ndistressing, the heavily bureaucratic Medicare Program has utterly \nfailed to keep up with the kinds of medical innovations and coverage \noptions most of the rest of us take for granted.\n  By contrast, this bill's new competing regional preferred provider \nplans will give seniors one-stop shopping for comprehensive and \nintegrated coverage, including prescription drugs, preventive care, \ncare coordination, and protection against very high catastrophic \nmedical bills--benefits which are largely unheard of in today's \nMedicare Program. Even more encouraging, six large-scale \ndemonstrations, beginning in 2010, will test direct price competition \nbetween private plans and traditional Medicare. Although not as \nextensive as I would have wanted, these competition-based reforms are \nnevertheless the most substantial steps Medicare has ever taken toward \nbringing marketplace innovation into the program.\n  Importantly, all of these new choices will be completely voluntary. \nSeniors who want to keep their current coverage and stay in the \ntraditional Medicare will be free to do just that. No senior will see \nany reduction in any Medicare benefits under this bill. No benefits \nwill be taken away--none.\n  Fourth, this legislation contains landmark improvements in the \nability of Americans to take charge of their own health care through \nexpanding the use of health savings accounts.\n  To a greater degree than ever before, this bill will permit \nindividuals to build significant tax-free health care savings for use \nin meeting a family's health care needs, including long-term care. As \nwe try to encourage those who are becoming seniors to acquire long-term \nhealth care insurance, here is a way to finance it and finance it with \ntax-free dollars. Together with high deductible insurance for very high \nmedical expenses, this approach puts control of health care where it \nbelongs--in the hands of the individual citizens of our country.\n  This is something I have been fighting for since I first came to \nCongress, and I believe this bill's health savings account provisions \nare among its most important accomplishments.\n\n[[Page S15526]]\n\n  Fifth, I am tremendously pleased, as should be every Idahoan, that \nthis bill includes an unprecedented package of nearly $25 billion in \nimprovements for rural health care. Senator Grassley can be extremely \nproud of the work he has done to ensure the stabilizing of rural \nhospitals and rural health care. Most importantly, this legislation \nachieves a permanent evening out of rural and urban Medicare \nreimbursement rates. For far too long, doctors and hospitals in Idaho \nand other rural States have suffered under payment classifications and \nreimbursement levels that put them at a significant disadvantage--and \nthat makes the already difficult task of providing rural health care \neven more daunting.\n\n  Sixth, the conferees have included, for the first time, a requirement \nthat high income seniors (those making over $80,000 individually or \n$160,000 as a couple) pay slightly more in Medicare premiums than those \nwho are less well off.\n  In the decades to come, I believe our children will thank us for \nrecognizing that America's taxpayers simply cannot afford to continue \nsubsidizing care for the wealthiest among us at the same level we \nprovide for the less well off.\n  Finally, I believe it is important to recognize that the conferees \nhave taken great care to include protections against something I know \nhas concerned many seniors--namely, Will this bill cause me to lose the \ndrug coverage I already have? The final bill includes very significant \nassistance to employer-sponsored plans to help assure their continued \nparticipation in retiree health care. Indeed, some are concerned that \nthis assistance is, in fact, too substantial. But Congress's intent on \nthis issue is clear: Seniors who are happy with the coverage they have \ntoday should be free to keep it.\n  The underlying framework of this bill is a sound one, and it follows \nthe strong and guiding principles laid out by President Bush earlier \nthis year--namely to strengthen traditional Medicare and keep it as an \nalternative for those seniors who want it--but also to provide a new \nfoundation for the future, one built on choices, competition, and \ninnovation.\n  This said, however, I remain gravely troubled by certain aspects of \nthis bill.\n  First, it troubles me deeply that this legislation will add \nsubstantially to an entitlement program whose long-term future is \nalready sobering in the extreme. Even without a new $395 billion drug \nbenefit, Medicare is expected to spend nearly $3.9 trillion over the \nnext 10 years--and by 2075, these costs will nearly triple.\n  Nothing can change the fact that desperately hard choices lie ahead, \nregardless of what we do this year. Nevertheless, what we sow today, \nfuture generations will reap.\n  Second, I am disappointed that the conferees chose not to adopt firm \nexpenditure restraints if and when Medicare cost growth rises faster \nthan currently projected. Nearly all honest observers predict that this \nbill will ultimately cost more than the $395 billion over 10 years that \nis now budgeted. Such a cost restraint measure would have gone a long \nway toward assuring future generations that we are serious about fiscal \nrestraint and preserving a viable Medicare program for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n\n  Third, I believe this bill should have moved Medicare more \nassertively toward a 21st century competitive approach, with an even \ngreater role for private plans and the innovation they generate--an \napproach patterned, for example, after the highly successful program \nnow available to Members of Congress and other federal employees. As it \nis, this bill makes a credible start in that direction, but much more \nremains to be done.\n  And finally, I am concerned by this legislation's very high level of \ncomplexity and prescriptiveness. Of course, Medicare legislation is \nnever simple. However, this bill runs to many hundreds of pages and is \nvery heavy with exceptions, rules, and carveouts--including literally \ndozens of provisions and billions of dollars relating to specifics of \nprovider payment.\n  This bill's new competitive alternatives, if they succeed, are \nintended to take us away from this kind of micromanagement. \nUnfortunately, if the complexity of this bill is any guide, we may yet \nhave a ways to go.\n  My concerns about this bill are very serious ones. However, on \nbalance, I believe this legislation is a positive step forward for \nAmerica's seniors, for the Medicare program, for Idaho, and for the \ncountry as a whole.\n  President Bush deserves tremendous credit for making Medicare and \nprescription drugs a top priority this year, as do Majority Leader \nFrist, Senator Grassley, and the other conferees for bringing us to \nwhere we are today.\n  Medicare urgently cries out for a better future, and America's \nseniors desperately need meaningful prescription drug relief. This \nlegislation moves solidly toward reaching both of these goals, and I \nurge my colleagues to stand with the President and support its passage \ninto law.\n  I close by thanking the Senator from West Virginia for his courtesy. \nI will adhere to our agreement. I yield the floor, and I thank my \ncolleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, our friend, the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, who serves on the Appropriations Committee, is welcome. I thank \nhim for his kind references to me.\n  I thank the Chair, Senator Cornyn of Texas, who has had the good \nfortune of presiding over the Senate on many occasions this year. I \nsay, I have had the good fortune of speaking on almost every occasion \nthat the Senator from Texas has presided over the Senate, and he \npresides so well. He presides with a degree of dignity and skill and \naplomb that is so rare as a day in June.\n  I also thank my majority whip, the best whip the Senate has ever had. \nAnd I have been the whip. I was the whip for 6 years. But I say--I will \nrepeat the words of a great poet--``You're a better man than I am Gunga \nDin.''\n  Harry Reid is a better whip than I was, and it wasn't because I \ndidn't do my best. I don't grow lax in any job. Any duty that is placed \non me, I do my very best. But he is a jewel, Harry Reid.\n  Let me thank the Senator from Illinois also, the distinguished \nSenator, Mr. Durbin. He is always so gracious, but he can afford to be \ngracious. He is so able, an inimitable debater. He can speak at the \ndrop of a hat, and the hat won't hit the ground. That man, Durbin, is a \nvery fluent and ready speaker. I am so pleased that he is my friend and \nthat he is a Senator on my side of the aisle. I thank him for his \ncourtesies on this beautiful morning in November.\n  It is a beautiful morning. May I say to the young pages who are here \nso early in the morning:\n\n       Ah, great it is to believe the dream\n       As we stand in youth by the starry stream;\n       But a greater thing is to fight life through\n       And say at the end,\n       The dream is true!\n\n  Mr. President, I had hoped to be out here on the floor talking about \na plan to give senior citizens a prescription drug benefit for \nMedicare.\n  I had hoped to be extolling the virtues of a bill that would give \nneeded relief to the millions of our Nation's elderly citizens who have \nbeen serving their country and their communities for so long and who \nare entitled to needed relief. Instead, the Congress will be voting on \na measure that would undermine Medicare--undermine Medicare, I say. \nListen to me. Hear me now. The elderly citizens who are watching \nthrough those electronic lenses, and also the sons and daughters of the \nelderly citizens as well, will be affected. So instead of voting on a \nmeasure that would give relief to the elderly citizens of this country, \nwe are going to vote on something else.\n  In speaking of the elderly citizens, I speak of the young people as \nwell. Why do I say that? I say it because I can remember the days when \nthere was no Social Security or Medicare Program in this country. I \nused to go by the old county poor farm in Raleigh County, and as I \ntraveled by there many years ago I would see sitting on the porch up \nthere at the old county poor farm, sitting just within sight of the \nroad, those old people in their rocking chairs. They had no dreams to \nlook forward to. When they grew old, as some of them did--and those \ncoal miners especially grew old early in life--they had no place to go, \nno place to go but to the homes of their sons and daughters. They would \nstand with their hats in their hands waiting to be taken in by their \nchildren. What a life.\n  Then there came to the White House of this country a crippled man, a \nman\n\n[[Page S15527]]\n\nwho was paralyzed, a man who could not walk, as I can walk even at my \nyoung age of 86. There they stood waiting at the gates of their \nchildren hoping that they could be taken in. Then that man came to the \nWhite House and a Democratic Congress worked with him to give to the \npeople of this country, the elderly citizens and their children, that \npromise. He fulfilled that promise of Social Security so that no longer \nwould the old folks stand at the gates of their children with their \nhats in their hands. They could live out their lives with dignity and \nnot be such a burden to their children.\n  Then I remember Medicare when it came. I was a Member of the Senate \nand voted for that program. That was when Lyndon Johnson, a great \nDemocrat, was President of this land. Again, the Democratic Congress, \nworking with that Democratic President, gave to the country this \nprogram of Medicare, the most successful program that the country has \never had, a program that today's Senators know and trust.\n  The Congress should be fashioning a real prescription drug benefit. \nThat is what the American people have been told we are doing, but we \nare not doing that. Instead, the Congress debates a major restructuring \nand a step toward the privatization of Medicare.\n\n       I watched them tearing a building down,\n       A gang of men in a busy town.\n       With a ho-heave-ho and a lusty yell,\n       They swung a beam and a sidewall fell.\n       I asked the foreman, ``Are these men skilled,\n       As the men you'd hire if you had to build?''\n       He gave me a laugh and said, ``No, indeed!\n       Just common labor is all I need.\n       I can easily wreck in a day or two\n       What builders have taken a year to do.''\n       And I thought to myself as I went my way,\n       Which of these two roles have I tried to play?\n       Am I builder who works with care,\n       Measuring my life by the rule and square?\n       Am I shaping my deeds by well-made plan,\n       Patiently doing the best I can?\n       Or am I a wrecker who walks the town,\n       Content with the labor of tearing down?\n\n  That is what we are doing here. That is what we are about to do. That \nis what we are getting ready to do. That is what the seniors and their \nchildren of this country are about to see happen. This building which \nwas built by careful hands, by caring hands, is about to be torn down.\n  This is a debate that has largely been hidden from the public, a \ndebate for which our Nation's seniors did not ask. They did not ask for \nthis.\n  The conference report before us was hatched behind closed doors. We \nsee so much of that time and again under this Bush administration--\nprograms, plots, hatched behind closed doors. Most Members of Congress \nhave been largely excluded from the backroom deals--largely excluded \nfrom the backroom deals--that produced this conference report.\n  Some have asserted this legislation is merely a Trojan horse designed \nto get rid of Medicare. I hope that is not true, but there is something \nawfully suspicious about this particular horse that is galloping \nthrough the Congress.\n  We need to slow down and consider the unintended consequences of this \nmassive bill. We may be signing off on the assisted suicide of Medicare \nas we know it. This legislation takes the first step to undermine a \nhealth care system that has benefited millions of retirees, and it is \nall happening within legislation designed to enhance Medicare to \nprovide a drug benefit. Proponents are selling it one way but may be \ndoing something quite different. You know the old magic tricks? I can \nremember vaudeville. I can remember when the vaudeville shows came to \nthose coal camps in the hills of southern West Virginia and the actor \nwould say: Watch my right hand, watch my hand, watch my hand. Don't \nlook at this one. Watch this hand. Don't look at what's going on over \nhere.\n\n  There is my friend from Maryland--he knows; he remembers--Senator \nSarbanes, one of the great pillars of the Senate, one of the truly \ngreat Senators, a thinker in the tradition of the venerable Socrates: \nPaul Sarbanes.\n  So proponents are selling it one way but may be doing something quite \ndifferent--a classic bait and switch. But seniors are not falling for \nthe bait. Many letters coming to me clearly reveal a genuine fear that \nthis Medicare bill will leave seniors worse off. West Virginians have \nnot been clamoring for enrollment in HMOs. They don't want restrictions \non their choice of doctors. They have not been pushing for a new \nMedicare system that could leave them bouncing in and out of private \nhealth plans. My constituents are rightly fearful at the thought of \nhaving to pay significantly higher premiums just to stay in their \ncurrent Medicare plan.\n  Some analysts of this bill estimate that as many as 29,000 \nbeneficiaries in West Virginia will lose their retiree health benefits \nas a direct result of this bill and that as many as 45,000 Medicaid \nbeneficiaries in my State will pay more for the prescription drugs they \nneed. I thought our goal was to help seniors, not hurt them, as this \nbill may do.\n  Senior citizens across America are fed up with fast rising drug costs \nthat they cannot afford. They are traveling by the busload to Canada--\nyes, traveling by the busload to Canada and Mexico--just to obtain the \nmedications prescribed by their doctors. And this bill does nothing, \nzilch, to help reduce the price of prescription drugs. In fact, this \nlegislation explicitly prohibits the Federal Government from directly \nnegotiating with pharmaceutical companies to use the bargaining power \nof 40 million senior citizens to lower the cost of prescription \nmedicines. This is something the Veterans' Administration, the \nDepartment of Defense, the Medicaid Program do every day to save money \non drugs. Why in the world are we prohibiting Medicare from saving \nmoney?\n  Unfortunately, this bill offers more of a figleaf than sufficient \nprescription drug coverage--a figleaf. Do Senators remember the first \nquestion that was ever asked in the history of the human race? It \noccurred during the evening, during the cool of the day when God came \nwalking through the Garden of Eden looking for Adam and Eve. There they \nwere in that paradise--how it might have been, how it might have been. \nGod came through in the cool of the evening looking for Adam, and it \nwas there and then that God asked that first question:\n\n       Adam, where art thou? Adam, where art thou?\n\n  Adam was hiding. Adam and Eve were hiding. They were trying to hide \nfrom that all-seeing eye that pierced through every veil. Yes, they \nwere hiding back in the bushes with a figleaf--a figleaf.\n  That question: Where art thou? These seniors, senior citizens all \nover this country, are going to be asking their Senators: Where were \nyou? Where were you when the critical moment came?\n  I hear the siren call: ``You better take it. It's all you are going \nto get.''\n\n  This Senator will never bow to that siren call. And there are others \nwho will not.\n  Rather than building on the traditional and successful Medicare \nProgram, the measure in front of us would force Medicare beneficiaries \nto rely on a private, untried, untested, drug-only insurance market for \ntheir prescription drug coverage. Is that what our seniors want? Is \nthat what the people of West Virginia want? No. No.\n  It would cover less than a quarter of the Medicare beneficiaries' \nestimated drug costs over the next 10 years. The complicated coverage \nformula has a large, gaping hole smack in the middle, providing zero \ncoverage just when seniors might need that coverage most--a large hole, \nlarge enough for Attila the Hun to drive his thousands of horsemen \nthrough.\n  This legislation includes copayments, premiums, and deductibles that \nmay be unaffordable for many low- and middle-income seniors. A closer \nlook at the fine print of this legislation reveals that private \ninsurers could choose to charge seniors double or even triple these \namounts. Seniors may find that their premiums could fluctuate \ndramatically based upon where they live and how healthy they are. At \nthe same time, the Federal Government will be handing over billions of \ntaxpayer dollars to for-profit insurance companies, just to get them to \nparticipate in Medicare.\n  Let's face it, the kind of prescription drug benefit that we have \nrepeatedly promised to our Nation's seniors and they now rightly expect \nwould cost at least $800 billion during the next decade. Drug costs for \nsenior citizens alone are expected to total almost $2 trillion during \nthis same period. Yet the Bush administration and congressional \nleadership have only set aside $400 billion for a Medicare prescription\n\n[[Page S15528]]\n\ndrug benefit. Although, isn't it remarkable that we can afford to spend \n$1 billion a week--$1 billion a week--in Iraq?\n  I will have plenty more to say about that. I made 62 speeches on that \ngargantuan mistake. I will make some more, the Lord willing.\n  Missiles? Yes. Medicines? No. Missiles? Yes. Medicines? No.\n  Where are the priorities of this administration? Where are the \npriorities of the Congress?\n  It seems that this Congress is trying to pull the wool over the eyes \nof our Nation's seniors hoping to claim victory and keep seniors in the \ndark until they become painfully aware of the fine print in this \nlegislation upon a visit to their local pharmacy--in 2006. That will be \nmy next election year, 2006, the Lord willing.\n  In the Book of James, we are told always never to say, I will go \nhere, I will go to this city or to that city, I will buy this, or I \nwill buy that tomorrow, but always to say, the Lord willing, I will go \nto this city or I will go to that city and I will buy this or that. So, \nthe Lord willing, 2006 is my next election day. Eighty-six is not too \nold. I am 86 years old. Abraham lived to be 175, Isaac lived to be 180, \nJacob lived to be 147, Moses, 160; and so on.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. He lived to be 120.\n  Mr. BYRD. Was I wrong on that?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Moses lived to be 120, not 160.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right, 120. The distinguished Senator from Iowa \ncorrected me. But he won't correct me on this bill. He won't correct me \non the tragedies of this bill. But I accept his correction. I will go \nlook it up to make sure.\n  As lobbyists for the pharmaceutical and health industry swarm all \ncorners of the Capitol, the Congress is on a mad dash to pass this bill \nbefore Thanksgiving, regardless of its contents or its flaws, so long \nas it can be called prescription drug coverage. Unfortunately, when it \ncomes to their health care security, it appears our Nation's senior \ncitizens will find that they have little for which to be thankful.\n  I have heard some Senators argue that something is better than \nnothing. Is that what we are being given? Something rather than \nnothing? Nothing?\n  They try to rationalize a bad bill by claiming that this may be our \nlast chance and you had better take it; something is better than \nnothing. They argue that we should vote for this now and fix the bill's \nproblems down the road. I have been down that road. I have seen that \nand heard that many times in my 51 years in Congress. This conference \nreport is a pill that is too bitter to swallow.\n  I am one of perhaps only a handful of Senators in this body who voted \nto create Medicare. I can say to you, Mr. President, that it was not \ncreated overnight. It was not created in the hidden dungeons, in the \nhidden subterranean caverns under this Capitol. It was created in \nresponse to a private sector that would not offer affordable and \nreliable health insurance to the elderly and the disabled.\n  Few can argue that seniors are not better off today as a result of \nMedicare. We should not turn our backs on one of the most successful \nGovernment initiatives ever created. We should seek ways to strengthen \nMedicare, not dismantle it.\n  Senior citizens who need life-sustaining medicines want us to get it \nright. They trust us to get it right. We should reject this bill and \nwork to pass a bill that does get it right. Thanksgiving is an \narbitrary deadline. It means nothing when measured against the \npotential damage that could be done in haste--haste that could \njeopardize the health care security of generations to come. We should \ndo better for our senior citizens. We owe them that much.\n  In closing, I thank Senators who have worked hard on this bill, \nSenators who have toiled late into the nights and weekends. I thank \nSenator Grassley. I thank Senator Baucus. I thank all Senators. I thank \nall Senators for listening.\n  By the way, as to Joseph, how long did he live? He lived to be 110 \nyears old.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sure the Chair can protect the majority \nif there is a problem. We need to get this unanimous consent agreement, \nwhich has been approved by both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time until 11 o'clock tonight be \nequally divided between the opponents and proponents; provided that \nwhen time expires on either, it be in order for either side to consume \nadditional debate time; further, that the debate time used beginning \nwith Senator Kyl's statement this morning be counted against the time \nallotment. I further ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the \norder for an alternating fashion following the remarks of Senator \nDurbin, it be in order for two Republicans to speak consecutively, one \nSenator for 20 minutes and the other Senator for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, further, so Senators will have some \nunderstanding as to when they can speak, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Democrat order be Senators Stabenow and Reed of Rhode Island \nfollowing Senator Durbin, and that the Republicans be Senators Snowe, \nCornyn, Collins, Bennett, Hatch, Bond, Nickles, and Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before saying a few words about this \nMedicare bill, I would like to say a few words about the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia. This man is such an amazing person. At 86 years of \nage, what he brings to public service and what he brings to the Senate \nis incredible.\n  I was in the Chamber earlier this morning when Senator Byrd arrived. \nHe said he would like to say a few words. I said, quite honestly, I am \nready to follow you into battle any day. I deferred to him, which I was \nhappy to do. He is a grand person and such an amazing Senator.\n  I have been fortunate to represent a congressional district in \nIllinois and the State of Illinois for over 20 years on Capitol Hill, \nand I have many favorite moments. But in the top tier of those favorite \nmoments was the time in a conference committee downstairs from this \nChamber involving Senator Byrd, and I would like to tell those who are \nfollowing this debate about that experience because I still marvel at \nwhat he did that day.\n  He came to a conference committee on the Transportation \nappropriations bill facing a critic in the House who said that Senator \nRobert C. Byrd of West Virginia had put too much in this bill for the \nState of West Virginia. And your critic from the House was going to \nhave his day with you at that conference committee.\n  As some people know who follow the Senate, the appropriations \nconference committees gather at a large, long table and the House \nMembers sit across the table directly from the Senate Members. So your \ncritic in the House came and took his seat with a sheaf of papers \nprepared to do battle with you over the Transportation appropriations \nbill. You arrived and just fortuitously happened to sit directly across \nfrom him at that table. He began his peroration about how terrible it \nwas that West Virginia would have so much in this Senate bill and he \nwas going to do something about it. He went on for all of 15 minutes. \nHe got red in the face, his arms were waving, and finally he was spent. \nHe had nothing more to say.\n  Then, as I recall, you turned to the chairman--which could have been \nSenator Hatfield of Oregon--and asked if you could be recognized.\n  The Senator began his remarks, and that is what I thought was the \nmost remarkable moment, saying, in the history of the United States \nthere is an exchange of speeches between two individuals which defined \nFederalism as we know it and the role of small States like West \nVirginia in the Senate and larger States. That exchange was between \nDaniel Webster and Robert Hayne.\n  Senator Byrd went on to say, Webster's reply to Mr. Hayne was \ndelivered on January 20, 1830. And then Senator Byrd added, ``and if my \nmemory serves me, it was a Thursday.'' He proceeded to give an \nimportant history lesson to all who had gathered, Members of the House \nand the Senate, about why West Virginia had a fighting chance in the \nSenate but might not have that same chance in the House, as each State \nhas\n\n[[Page S15529]]\n\ntwo Senators, of course, in this Chamber, and represented \nproportionately in the House.\n  I was absolutely spellbound by his performance that day in that small \nroom. When it was all over, of course, West Virginia fared well in that \nappropriations bill, as it always has since Senator Byrd has been here \nto make sure his State was not shortchanged. I was in the House at the \ntime, and a few years later I came to the Senate and said to Senator \nByrd: Of all the things you said in the speeches, when you said, ``If \nmy memory serves me, it was a Thursday,'' I still remember those words.\n  Senator Byrd said: Well, Mr. Durbin, if I am not mistaken, it was a \nThursday.\n  I said: I am not questioning you; I am sure it was a Thursday.\n  Later in the day, he called me over to his desk and pulled out a \nperpetual calendar, and said, yes, January 20, 1830, was a Thursday.\n  It says a lot about this Senator, not only his reverence for history \nand this institution, but the fact that he brings to many of these \npolitical battles an insight that many Members admire so much and \nrespect. Whether you are on his side or not, you best sit back and \nlisten closely when Senator Byrd takes the floor because he brings to \neach one of these debates the very best in public debate and the very \nbest in public service.\n  This Senator was happy to step back and listen very carefully as the \nSenator from West Virginia made another compelling argument on a very \nimportant and historic piece of legislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I listened to the able Senator from Illinois with great \npleasure because I strongly share his feeling and views about Senator \nByrd. I took the floor for a brief moment to underscore the \nextraordinary contribution that Senator Byrd has been making to the \nnational debate in the recent period on issues of critical national \nimportance. He has taken to the floor time and time again and spoken \nwith a clear strong voice. He has sounded a clarion call to the \ncountry. I know from people I talk to that voice is reaching into many \ncorners across the land and prompting Americans to think deeply about \nthe issues that confront the Nation, and even more deeply and \nfundamental about how we go about conducting our business and making \nthese decisions.\n  The vote last night in the House of Representatives was held over for \n3 hours in order for the Republican leadership to twist arms in order \nto change the outcome, which was already up on the board, where they \nhad lost by two votes. That rollcall vote was held open indefinitely. \nMy able colleague from Maryland, Congressman Hoyer, remarked \nafterwards, it would be as though you had election day, the time came \nfor the polls to close, and you held the polls open for another 15 \nhours while you went out and somehow found the votes to assure you the \nresult. It is an abuse of the democratic process.\n\n  The Senator from West Virginia has always spoken. He sounded a loud \ntrumpet about our Nation. We are deeply in debt to him and appreciate \nthat.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I might just add \nsomething I have said in the Senate and I told Senator Byrd during the \ndebate on Iraq. I went to my church in Chicago with my wife--this is \nhighly unusual in my church--as we came back from communion, and we are \nkneeling, an elderly man came up to me and leaned over on his way back \nfrom communion and he said: Stick with Bob Byrd.\n  I came back to tell Senator Byrd that his message reached beyond this \nChamber and beyond the State of West Virginia. It has been not only \nheard, but it has been applauded by the Nation of grateful people who \nare glad you are here in service to our country and continue to be. If \nyou reach the age of Methuselah, Abraham, Isaac, or Moses, I hope I am \nstill here to defer to you and listen carefully as you make these \npresentations.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am deeply grateful to these two fine \nSenators for the kind words they have just spoken, Senator Durbin and \nSenator Sarbanes. I will go to my everlasting resting place with love \nand gratitude and affection and admiration and respect for these two \nSenators and how they have served the Nation and this institution and \nbeen loyal and true to the Constitution of the United States forever. I \nshall think of them and be in their debt. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The Senator from West Virginia, when he came to the floor, gave us an \nimportant message. He asked us to look at this very carefully. This, my \nfriends and fellow colleagues, is a proposed law. It is huge. But that \nis not uncommon. And that should not be a reason to vote against it. \nThe reason to vote against it is what is contained in this law, this \nproposal, this bill.\n  When we started this debate about prescription drugs for seniors, \noverwhelmingly the President, the Republicans, Democrats, all agreed on \none thing: We needed to find a way to provide affordable prescription \ndrugs for senior citizens. Medicare, as good as it is, provides good \ncare through hospitals and doctors but not enough help when it comes to \npaying for prescription drugs. We understood that needed to be done.\n  The solution was obvious from the start. The solution to this \nchallenge was to put under the Medicare Program a voluntary, \ncomprehensive, and universal plan to pay for prescription drugs, to use \nthe same successful model that has guided us for 40 years in keeping \nseniors healthy through good doctors and good hospitals, and also \nprovide prescription drugs. We knew if we did that, it would work as \nMedicare has worked. The proof of Medicare's success is the fact that \nseniors are living longer, they are healthier, they are independent, \nand they are strong.\n\n  But there was a criticism of using this so-called Government \napproach. The criticism came from political extremes that argue that \nthe Government shouldn't be involved, and also from the pharmaceutical \nindustry which understood full well, if Medicare could bargain for \nseniors across America, Medicare could bring down the prices of \nprescription drugs just as the Canadian Government has brought down the \nprice of those same drugs for its citizens.\n  The pharmaceutical companies lived in dread that Medicare would be \nable to have cost control and competition and bring down the price of \ndrugs.\n  So we started on this convoluted path to find an alternative. The \nfirst suggestion was, why not let private insurance companies provide \nthis prescription care benefit? Let them compete. There is nothing \nwrong with that from this Senator's point of view. If private companies \nwant to offer prescription drug benefits and compete with Medicare, so \nbe it. Let's see what happens. Let's see if that competition will also \nhelp seniors.\n  But they said, wait a minute, we are not wanting these private \ncompanies to compete with Medicare. We want Medicare out of the \nbusiness of competition completely. That was the starting point for the \nRepublican approach to prescription drugs. Of course, the \npharmaceutical companies applauded this because if they do not have to \nanswer to Medicare with 40 million Americans under its protection but, \nrather, to smaller companies, they have more bargaining power. So we \nwent through this long exercise in the Senate about this proposition \nthat private insurance companies would somehow provide prescription \ndrug benefits to seniors.\n  I offered an amendment on the floor, supported by most of my \ncolleagues who are here today, that said: Give Medicare a chance to \ncompete. We did not prevail. In fact, we did not get any votes from the \nother side of the aisle. The Republican approach to this from the start \nwas to say they believed in Medicare, but then to turn their backs on \nMedicare when it came to prescription drug benefits.\n  Well, eventually we were faced with the prospect, in the Senate bill, \nof either accepting their approach, and moving toward prescription \ndrugs for seniors, and passing it out of the Senate, or doing nothing. \nMost of us voted to move the bill forward and into the conference \ncommittee. But, sadly, that was not the end of the story.\n  When it came to the conference committee, there was a new political \nforce\n\n[[Page S15530]]\n\nat work, not just the people who wanted to keep Medicare out of the \nprescription drug business but a new group from the House of \nRepresentatives with a much more radical agenda. What they wanted to \nachieve was not just private insurance companies offering prescription \ndrug benefits, they, in fact, wanted to privatize Medicare itself.\n  We started by wanting to add a benefit to Medicare, and now the House \nRepublicans, and their cohorts in the Senate, have said: We want to \nchange Medicare. We want to make certain that Medicare as you know it \nwill not be there in the future.\n  One of the proponents of this point of view was former Speaker of the \nHouse Newt Gingrich, who this week came to the Republican House caucus \nand said: Vote for this bill; this is a good bill. That should be proof \npositive to anyone listening that this is a bad bill. Because it was \nthat same Speaker Newt Gingrich, whom I served under in the House, who \nsaid, at one point, that we should allow Medicare to wither on the \nvine. There was no personal or political commitment by Speaker Gingrich \nto Medicare. And for him to endorse this huge bill is proof positive to \nme that within the four corners of this bill are threats to Medicare we \nneed to take seriously.\n  This morning, as I came to the office, on Saturday, I had an e-mail \nfrom one of my staffers who fields the phone calls that come into my \noffice. She wrote and said: Senator, something unusual is happening out \nthere. When you first started debating prescription drugs under \nMedicare a few months ago, the phone calls were generally positive. \nSeniors were saying: Let's do it; we have waited too long. But she \nsaid: Something's happened. There is a sea change out there. The phone \ncalls are overwhelmingly negative now.\n  Seniors have come to understand this bill not only does not give them \ngood prescription drug coverage but it is a full-scale assault on \nMedicare itself, and they are calling every office, congressional and \nsenatorial office alike, saying: Defeat this legislation.\n  Now, doesn't that tell us something? Doesn't it tell us something, \nthat what we started off in believing--that seniors wanted prescription \ndrugs--has now been rejected by them when they learned what is at \nstake? And there is a lot at stake.\n  This bill will raise Medicare premiums, something which lower income \nseniors will find very difficult to deal with. It will force seniors \ninto HMOs. And you know what that means. That means insurance companies \nwill pick their doctors and their hospitals for them and say that they \nwill lose the right to choose their own doctors and hospitals.\n  Of course, that is the grand old Republican plan: that Medicare as we \nknow it would change; that, instead, we would be dealing with HMO \ninsurance companies. And I can tell you, I have yet to run into a \nsenior citizen anywhere who endorses HMOs, nor many doctors who believe \nthey are very good when it comes to quality health care. Yet that is \nthe solution that is being offered here.\n  It is not bad enough that my friends on the Republican side of the \naisle have said they want to move toward private insurance companies \nand privatizing Medicare. They do not even believe in the value of the \nfree market in this experiment. Because they are not saying to HMOs: We \nwant to open the door and give you your chance to compete. No. They are \ncoming through with more than $10 billion in Federal taxpayers' \nsubsidies to be given to these HMO insurance companies so that they \ncapture more and more seniors out of Medicare.\n\n  Think of that. The Republican free market, entrepreneurial spirit \nthat is being sustained by a $10 billion Federal slush fund for HMOs so \nthey can take more and more seniors out of Medicare.\n  What is even worse, as they draw seniors out of Medicare, they will \nlook for, as most insurance companies do, the healthiest of the \nseniors, leaving behind the poorest and the sickest seniors in \nMedicare, meaning that the costs of Medicare per person are going to go \nup, and Medicare will become more expensive, and perhaps less popular \nfrom a budget point of view.\n  That is the grand plan here: Starve Medicare; have it wither on the \nvine. Newt Gingrich's vision for Medicare is finally realized in this \n1,200-page bill. Speaker Gingrich rides again. He has prevailed. His \nwas the voice that prevailed when it came to the contents of this bill.\n  Sadly, too, this bill will eliminate drug coverage for millions of \nAmericans. We have had a Congressional Budget Office review of what \nhappens when this bill goes into effect.\n  Mr. President, 2.7 million retirees will lose the private insurance \ncoverage they currently have. Understand who these people are. These \nare people who have worked for a lifetime for a company, with the \nunderstanding they would receive a retirement benefit which included \nprescription drug coverage. And when this goes into effect, this \nproposal that has been brought before us, the Congressional Budget \nOffice and other sources tell us 2.7 million Americans will lose their \nprescription drug coverage. They may lose all of their health coverage \nduring retirement.\n  Over 100,000 of these unlucky retirees are in my State of Illinois. \nFor them, if for no other reason, I will be voting no on this. I will \nbe voting no because, frankly, we are basically saying: We want to \nreward HMOs. We want to reward pharmaceutical companies at the expense \nof people who have worked a lifetime for security in their retirement \nand will lose it because of this bill.\n  How can we, in good conscience, stand here and say we are going to \ncreate a mechanism where companies will have the rationale and the \nopportunity to drop their retiree health care coverage? That is sad. \nMedicare was created because seniors across America did not have a \nhelping hand when it came to doctors and hospitals. And now, in this \neffort to privatize Medicare and reward the big drug companies, we are \ngoing to provide less coverage for seniors across America.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the pharmaceutical aspect of this \nbill. We know if we have competition, we can bring prices down. We also \nknow if the Government shows leadership, as they have in Canada, prices \nof drugs will come down. But the pharmaceutical companies have \nprevailed. The pharmaceutical companies have won the argument.\n  The most important question asked about any piece of legislation \nbefore the Congress is this: Who wants it? Who wants this bill?\n  First and foremost, the pharmaceutical companies want this bill \nbecause there is no effort to bring down the cost of drugs that \nAmerican families and seniors have to pay--no effort whatsoever.\n  We had a provision included that called for generic drugs, one way to \ntry to get good drugs that are lower priced in the hands of seniors, \nand it was weakened dramatically in the conference. We had an \nopportunity, through a provision proposed by the House of \nRepresentatives, for reimportation of drugs from Canada and Europe so \nseniors had a chance to get a break there if they could not afford the \ndrugs here in the United States. That was dramatically weakened, too. \nAnd the Bush administration has vowed they will never let it happen, \nthey will not allow reimportation to happen.\n  So if you do not have generics encouraged, and you do not have \nreimportation, and Medicare is not competing for cost, what it means is \nthe pharmaceutical companies have their prayers answered, their dreams \ncome true. They will continue to hike the cost of pharmaceuticals and \ndrugs, and this Government and this bill will do nothing to stop it, \nand seniors across America will find this so-called prescription drug \nbenefit of little or no value as time passes. Because if the cost of \ndrugs goes up 10 or 15 percent a year, no matter what the Federal \nGovernment offers, in the end, there is little to show for it--less and \nless each and every year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question from the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Am I correct in my understanding that under this bill, \nthe Government, through Medicare, could not, in fact, bring its weight \nto bear in order to lower the cost of prescription drugs through a \nbuying program, where they are a heavyweight in the scale--\n\n[[Page S15531]]\n\nthat the bill actually precludes that from happening?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is correct because Medicare is not given the \noption of offering prescription drug coverage here, an option which \nmost seniors would gladly endorse. And the reason is obvious: If \nMedicare can bargain on behalf of 40 million Medicare recipients, it \nhas the bargaining power to bring down the cost of drugs for seniors. \nThe pharmaceutical companies hate that concept, ``like the devil hates \nholy water,'' to quote our old friend Senator Bumpers, who used to say \nthat on the floor from time to time.\n  They don't want competition. They don't want cost control. They have \nwon the day.\n  The Senator from Maryland has turned on his television at home in the \nlast few days and weeks and maybe heard his name mentioned on \ntelevision commercials that are being paid for by the pharmaceutical \ncompanies saying: Senator Mikulski, Senator Sarbanes, vote for this \nbill. They are spending millions of dollars saying vote for this bill \nbecause this bill will mean millions and millions more in profit for \nthose same pharmaceutical companies.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In addition to precluding the Government from bringing \nits weight to bear in purchasing in order to lower the cost of drugs \nbecause they would be a very big purchaser and obviously they would \nhave an impact, some have said: Well, let's at least allow for the \nreimportation of drugs from other countries, particularly Canada. Some \nof our people have been going to Canada in order to get their \nprescription drugs. They cross the border, and they can buy them at 40, \n50, 60 percent less than they pay in this country. So there were \nprovisions that passed to allow reimportation. Am I correct that, in \neffect, this bill eliminates that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is correct. This bill gives the last word to \nthe Bush administration and the head of the FDA who have said \ncategorically they are opposed to reimportation. The reason they are \nopposed is that it would be more competition for pharmaceutical \ncompanies that want to charge higher prices in the United States. I \nhave believed all along that we are not importing drugs from Canada, we \nare importing leadership from Canada. The Canadian Government has stood \nup for its citizens and said: We are not going to allow the drug \ncompanies to raise their prices every single year. This Government, \nthis Congress, refuses to show the same leadership, and now is \neffectively blocking the reimportation of drugs that seniors need to \nsurvive.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I also understand there was an effort to clear the path \nfor generic drugs to become available. Of course, generic drugs sell at \na lesser cost than brand name drugs. A lot of the pharmaceutical people \nare opposed to that.\n  It is also my understanding that this bill fails to carry through on \nthe efforts to make it easy to bring generic drugs to market. Am I \ncorrect in that respect?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Maryland is correct. It is another \nsuccess story for the pharmaceutical industry because they bring the \ndrugs to market, brand name drugs, under patent, and during a period of \ntime they have a right to sell them exclusively in America. But when \nthat patent runs out, then other companies can make that same drug and \nsell it, usually at a much lower cost. So the pharmaceutical companies \nthat make the brand-name drugs found ways to delay the process so that \nthe generic drugs could not replace the brand-name drugs, so they could \ncontinue to make millions and millions of dollars off the brand-name \ndrugs even when their patents expired. We changed that in the Senate.\n  We put in language that said we are going to move toward generic \ndrugs so consumers can have affordable drugs. And, frankly, in \nconference committee, the pharmaceutical companies won again, another \nreason they are running ads about this Senator and the Senator from \nMaryland saying vote for this bill right now, because they know it \nmeans more money to an industry that is already the most profitable \nindustry in America.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for one final question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I hate to intrude on his time, but this is a very \nimportant point. With this legislation, the pharmaceutical companies \nhave, in effect, slowed the ability of generic drugs to come to market, \nwhich would be one source of competition that would lower their prices. \nThe reimportation provisions have been written in such a way that it is \ncompletely in the hands of the administration whether reimportation of \ndrugs, say, from Canada is allowed. The administration has been very \nclear that they are opposed to doing that. The legislation also, in \neffect, knocks out the Government from being a direct purchaser and \ncontrolling the prices.\n\n  Every source that potentially could exercise some pressure or \ninfluence on the pharmaceutical companies to lower or restrain their \nprices is being blocked out by this legislation. So the end result is \nthat it is an absolute bonanza for the drug companies. Would you say \nthat is a reasonable perception of what this legislation does?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say the Senator from Maryland is correct. I would \nrefer him to a Bloomberg News article yesterday with the headline ``139 \nMillion Dollar Lobby Blitz Thrown at Medicare Bill.'' And it leads by \nsaying:\n\n       Health care companies, led by drug makers Merck & Co. and \n     Eli Lilly, spent a record $139.1 million in six months to \n     lobby Congress on a Medicare bill that will help the elderly \n     buy prescription medicines. The pharmaceutical companies were \n     the biggest spenders in the health care industry putting \n     money into this lobbying effort.\n\n  The Senator knows, as I do, that if you find pharmaceutical companies \nworking feverishly night and day to pass this legislation, it isn't \nbecause they want to make less money. They want to make more money. So \nwe have the GOP, which could now be the acronym for the Greedy Old \nPharmaceutical companies; that is what is pushing this legislation. \nThat is proof positive that the seniors will be the losers.\n  The seniors understand that, as do families across America. It isn't \nbad enough that it is just pharmaceutical companies that are going to \nmake out so well. The same thing is true about HMO companies, the HMO \ninsurance companies with the more than $10 billion Federal slush fund \nso they can compete with traditional Medicare, $10 billion, and a \nreimbursement level of 109 percent for these same companies for their \nexpenses while they are competing.\n  Then to add the crowning touch is something called health savings \naccounts. I would say to the Senator from Maryland, you are going to \nrecognize this song after I sing a few lyrics. A company called Golden \nRule Insurance Company, originally out of Evansville, IL, now based out \nof Indianapolis, with a man named Mr. Rooney as its CEO, has been \nlocked at the hip with the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill since \nSpeaker Gingrich took over in the House. That is when they dreamed up \nthis idea of medical savings accounts and said: Here is the wave of the \nfuture. We can replace health insurance as we know it with the Golden \nRule model of medical savings accounts, resulting in our efforts in \n1996 of a demonstration project to so see if this flawed concept would \nwork. So few people were interested in signing up for it, it was a \nfailure on its face.\n  Guess what. In this bill there is a $6 billion subsidy for health \nsavings accounts. In other words, not only are we guaranteeing record \nprofits for pharmaceutical companies, not only are we creating a $10 \nbillion slush fund for HMOs to take seniors out of Medicare, we are \nputting $6 billion into this boondoggle health savings account. I was \non the floor watching the Energy bill yesterday and thinking it was \nscandalous that we were putting $2 billion into the MTBE and oil \nindustry--$2 billion. They did us better with this bill. The Republican \nconferees came back and said: Let's up the ante; let's make it $6 \nbillion to subsidize this crazy concept of health savings accounts \nengendered by the Golden Rule company, one of the greatest benefactors \nof the Republican Party on Capitol Hill. If that isn't proof positive \nthat this bill has gone astray, I don't know what is.\n\n[[Page S15532]]\n\n  I say to seniors who continue to call congressional offices, keep the \ncalls coming in. Let me suggest to them as well that if many of them \nhappen to be members of AARP, here is that telephone number. Call your \nfriends at AARP, ask Mr. Novelli, who has endorsed this boondoggle, why \nin the world has he turned his back on seniors? Why is he not fighting \nfor more competitive drug prices? Why isn't he trying to stop the HMOs \nfrom privatizing Medicare? And why are we putting a $6 billion subsidy \nin here for friends of the Republican Party, the Golden Rule Insurance \nCompany. I think seniors across America get the message.\n  There was just a poll taken this week of members of AARP, which I \nhope Mr. Novelli will have a chance to read.\n  The poll shows that once seniors have been told what is in this bill, \n65 percent of the members of AARP said they should stop trying to pass \nthis bill and work for a better plan, and only 18 percent of the \nmembers of AARP supported it. So by a margin of almost 4 to 1, the \nmembers of AARP are saying to their leadership: You have it wrong.\n  I think, frankly, it is a burden now on AARP to come back to its \nroots and decide whether it is going to stand up for seniors or for \npharmaceutical companies and HMOs. I hope the seniors across America \nwho are as upset about this as many of us are will call AARP and tell \nthem to stop spending millions of dollars trying to pass this bill. \nInstead, they should try to save Medicare first, and they should say \nbasically don't sell out the seniors of America.\n  AARP is now in lockstep with these pharmaceutical companies and HMOs. \nThey have forgotten their mandate, which is to stand up as a voice for \nseniors across America. That is unforgivable. I think they are going to \nfind a lot of their members tearing up their cards and walking away \nfrom this organization. It has become very political and insensitive to \nthe seniors across America.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator made reference to a better bill. The very \nable Senator from Illinois, in the course of debate in the Senate, \noffered a better bill, which I was very pleased to support. That bill \nwould have been a very significant and substantial step forward. Among \nother things, it did not have this ``donut'' in coverage that is in \nthis bill.\n  As I understand this bill, at a certain point--I think $22.50 in drug \ncost--and beyond that, up to $3,600, the burden falls back on \nindividuals; is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In the Senator's bill that didn't happen; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct. This is a moving target. The fact is \nthat there is a gap in coverage for prescription drugs built into this \nproposal so that the sickest seniors with the highest prescription drug \ncosts will find some coverage on the front end of the year for their \nillness and then find themselves paying out of pocket $2,850, if I am \nnot mistaken, before they get more coverage from the prescription drug \nbenefit. So this so-called donut hole is one that I think seniors who \nare really sick and those who need expensive drugs should be aware of.\n  The bill we offered said Medicare will come in and compete for lower \ndrug costs and the savings we can gather for lower drug costs will \nclose this donut hole.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator further yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would we not also have been able to not have a donut \nhole if these moneys the Senator made reference to that are going to \nthe HMOs--the $10 billion, I think you said--\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, a $10 billion slush fund for HMOs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Also $6 billion--\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, for health savings accounts, for their buddies at \nGolden Rule.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So that $16 billion could have been taken and put \ndirectly to improve the benefit for our seniors, could it not?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is correct. The Senator starts with the same \npremise I do--that seniors are most comfortable with Medicare. If this \nstarted off as an added benefit to Medicare, this bill would have been \nmuch smaller and more understandable and supported by seniors. But when \nthey rejected that and said, we are going to go to private companies, \nthey really opened up all sorts of problems. They guaranteed \nprofitability, put in slush funds, and they complicated it to the point \nwhere most seniors will struggle to understand it. This didn't have to \nbe the case.\n  When you are out to privatize Medicare and reward pharmaceutical \ncompanies and help HMOs, that is where you end up.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I perceive it, all of these things that are being \ndone--the HMOs, the medical accounts, the limitation on Medicare being \nable to act directly, and so forth--if this stack of papers on the desk \nrepresents the Medicare Program itself, they are circling around it to \nundermine and undercut it. This bill has taken on an added fundamental \ndimension.\n  So as we look at this bill, we have to look at not only its \nshortcomings in adding prescription drugs to the Medicare Program, but \nwe have to perceive that built into the bill are a number of efforts \nbeing put into place that will undercut the Medicare Program itself. Is \nthat a reasonable view of the potential of this legislation?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is correct. There are those who began this \ndebate saying: We are going to change Medicare. Well, they had their \nway. Many came here saying: We want to help seniors pay for \nprescription drugs. If we had stuck to our original goal and focused on \nwhat seniors really want and what works, I think we would have achieved \nthis result through Medicare a long time ago. It would have been at the \nexpense of the profitability of pharmaceutical companies.\n  I say to my friend, who follows some of these corporate reports more \nthan I do, this pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable in \nAmerica. Look at this chart. Profits as a percentage of revenue in \n2002: No. 1, pharmaceutical companies, with 17 percent return on \nrevenues. Return on assets: No. 1, pharmaceutical companies, with 14.1 \npercent. Then they were nosed out when it came to return on \nshareholders' equity by household and personal products, but they are \nstill No. 2, with 27.6 percent profit as a percent of equity.\n  This bill is giving them more profit at the expense of families and \nlow-income seniors in America. That is why the pharmaceutical companies \nare spending millions of dollars for television, radio, and newspaper \nads telling this Congress to ``do our bidding.'' That is why they \nalready spent $139 million lobbying Congress to pass this bill.\n  If the pharmaceutical companies wanted to help seniors, they could \nhave done this long ago. They could have charged more reasonable \nprices, particularly to low-income seniors. But that isn't their goal. \nTheir goal is more profitability. Sadly, they found allies with the \nRepublican majority who are attempting to pass this bill and make \ncertain they are more profitable.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield on that point, in \nconfirmation of the Senator's analysis, the markets, in the last few \ndays, have been boosting the price of the stocks of the pharmaceutical \ncompanies. The perception in the capital markets of the smart money \npeople is that this legislation is going to significantly benefit the \npharmaceutical companies, and they are building up the stock prices, \nwhich only goes to confirm and corroborate the analysis the Senator \nfrom Illinois has made on this issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Maryland is correct. I will make this \none last reference as I see colleagues in the Chamber who want the \nfloor.\n  Represented on this chart are the compensation packages for the HMOs. \nThis is another group that is benefiting. The $12 billion slush fund \nwill be going to HMO companies such as these on the chart. They will \nleave poor and sicker people behind. There will be a $12 billion slush \nfund and some more benefits given to HMO companies. Look at the \ncompensation for the executives. It runs from the obscene at Oxford, \nwhere Norman Payson gets $76 million.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is that per year?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. Mr. Payson had a very good year. Alan Wise at \nCoventry gets $21.6 million. This man must be really gifted if he is \nworth that to run a managed care company, which is now\n\n[[Page S15533]]\n\ngoing to be in the category of companies eligible for the $10 billion \nFederal subsidy.\n  Down here is United Health Group, where R. Channing Wheeler is \ngetting $9.5 million. I bet he was embarrassed going to the country \nclub with his friends and only making $9.5 million.\n  Incidentally, United Health Group--do I remember that name from the \nAARP newsletter? Yes. It turns out they are in business together. It \nturns out that AARP, which is for this bill, is in business with United \nHealth Group, a managed care company. Frankly, as I understand it, 60 \npercent of the revenues of AARP come through their insurance and \nadvertising. Is it any wonder that AARP is pushing for this bill, when \nseniors are opposed to it?\n  I want to close because I see other colleagues in the Chamber. I say \nto seniors across America: If you have received your AARP solicitation \nand sent back your membership card, please call AARP at 1-800-424-3410. \nTell them to stand up for seniors for a change, to reject this bad bill \nthat won't result in lower prescription drug costs and will privatize \nMedicare.\n  Tell them you are opposed to a slush fund that is being created for \nHMOS. Tell them you think it is scandalous that we give $6 billion to \nGolden Rule for health savings accounts. And tell them it is time for \nyour organization, AARP, to stand up for seniors and stand up for \nMedicare instead of caving in to the special interest groups and \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/22/senate-section/article/S15533-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we discussed this morning that we will have \na moment of silence at 12:30. I request we have a moment of silence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will observe a moment of silence.\n  (Moment of Silence.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this moment of silence gives us an \nopportunity to reflect in a way that expresses our deep respect and \nalso an opportunity to contemplate how we can capture what happened in \nthe past and those lessons of the past and project them to the future \nbut also in terms of carrying out our responsibilities in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for those of us who are old enough to \nremember President Kennedy, November 22 is always tinged with a sense \nof sadness and loss. Today, on this 40th anniversary of President \nKennedy's death, we are especially aware of that loss.\n  One floor above us, in a corridor leading to the House side of the \nCapitol, there is a wonderful exhibit by a long-time Senate \nphotographer named Arthur Scott--``Scotty.'' He was an official Senate \nphotographer from 1955 until his death in 1976.\n  One of my favorite of his photos up on the third floor shows a very \nyoung-looking Senator John Kennedy playing catcher in a baseball game \nwith other Senators in 1958. Scoop Jackson is at bat and Mike Mansfield \nin umpiring. John Kennedy looks more like a staffer than a Senator.\n  About 12 feet down that same hall hangs another photograph. This one \nwas taken on January 20, 1961. It shows a smiling, older-looking JFK \nwalking into the Rotunda shortly before he was sworn in as President. \nNext to that is another photograph, also taken in the Rotunda. It shows \na grim-faced Everett Dirksen with his arm around the shoulders of \nHubert Humphrey as the two men walk past President Kennedy's casket in \nNovember 1963.\n  Only 5 years passed between that first photograph and the last. Only \n1,000 days elapsed between John Kennedy's inauguration and his death. \nNot long at all. Yet, 40 years after that terrible day in Dallas, \nPresident Kennedy remains vivid in our memories and he continues to \ninspire even people who were not yet born when he died.\n  There are many reasons for this, I believe.\n  John Kennedy believed that politics can be a noble profession. Many \nof us in this Senate are here, in part, because we were inspired by his \nbelief and his example. That is certainly true of me. That belief was \nalso shared by his brother Robert, and it continues to be demonstrated \ntoday by his last surviving brother, our friend and colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Another reason that President Kennedy remains such a force in our \nnational life is that he inspired us to be our best possible selves.\n  He led by appealing to our better instincts, not our base fears. He \nshowed us that we need not fear great challenges, as when he said \nAmerica chose to go to the moon not because it was easy, but because it \nwas difficult. He understood that there is almost nothing Americans \ncannot achieve when we are united and willing to sacrifice and work \ntogether toward a common goal.\n  John Kennedy was, indelibly, the grandson of immigrants. He was \ndeeply grateful for the freedoms and opportunities that America \naffords. But he also understood that, with rights come \nresponsibilities. As he said so often, ``To those whom much is given, \nmuch is required.''\n  President Kennedy understood that the most powerful weapon America \npossesses is the power to do good in this world. And he transformed \nthat belief into the Peace Corps.\n  President Kennedy understood that we are all connected to each other, \nas he said to the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev when the two leaders \nbegan negotiations on the first limited nuclear test ban treaty \nfollowing the near-cataclysm of the Cuban missile crisis. ``In the \nfinal analysis, we all share the same planet, we all breathe the same \nair, we all cherish our children's future.''\n  Today, thousands of people are expected to visit President Kennedy's \ngrave in Arlington National Cemetery. They will file past that eternal \nflame. But we don't need to go to Arlington to pay our respects to John \nFitzgerald Kennedy. That eternal flame also shines in the hearts of \nevery American and every person on Earth who recalls what President \nKennedy taught us in his too-brief life and who tries to live those \nlessons today.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to say a word about my friend, Senator \nKennedy. I know this is a sad day for him.\n  In the drawer of every desk on this floor are the names of the \nSenators who occupied these desks before us. I suspect we have all had \nthe experience of seeing those names and thinking what an awesome \nresponsibility it is to follow in such footsteps. In the drawer of \nSenator Kennedy's desks are the names of two of his brothers, John and \nRobert. I am grateful to my friend that he chose to follow in his \nbrothers' footsteps, despite the pain that public service has brought \nhim and his family. It is an honor to work with him. America is better \nfor the Kennedy family's service and sacrifices.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/22/senate-section/article/S15533-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15533-S15569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF \n                   2003--CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nDemocratic speaker following Senator Reed of Rhode Island be Senator \nHarkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Maine is recognized. Does \nthe manager of the bill seek recognition?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 4 \nminutes and that Senator Snowe and Senator Cornyn not lose their right \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak a lot longer to respond \nto what the Senator from Illinois has said because there is so much \nthat can be so successfully rebutted. I will speak to two or three very \nobvious statements that are wrong.\n  The first one is that the Senator from Illinois has never run into a \nsenior who endorsed HMOs. Forty percent of the seniors in Miami are \nvoluntarily in Medicare+Choice. That is an HMO. And 6 percent of the \nseniors in his own large city of Chicago are members of HMOs. They are \nthere because they want to be there. They can get in or, if they leave \nthe area in which they live to go someplace elsewhere and they\n\n[[Page S15534]]\n\ndon't have HMOs, they are going to have fee for service. These seniors \nare there because they want to be there.\n  That brings me to the point that a major portion of this legislation \nis the right of seniors to choose. Seniors who want prescription drugs \ncan have them or they don't have to buy into it if they don't want to. \nIf they want to keep fee-for-service Medicare just as it is, they can \nstay there. They do not have to go into any of the new programs that we \nprovide in this bill. They have the right to choose.\n  I believe members of the other party don't believe that seniors ought \nto have the right to choose because their response to Government health \nprograms for seniors or others is more Government, more Government, \nmore Government.\n  Another obvious point that was made that ought to be rebutted is the \nquestion about the AARP becoming so political. Why does the AARP \nsupport this legislation? ``Seniors are the losers.'' The AARP speaks \nfor 40 million members. Why is it that this year when we are dealing \nwith bipartisan legislation and the AARP backs it that they are \npolitical, but last year when they backed the Democrats in their \nefforts to have a partisan bill, the AARP, at that point, was not \npartisan?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today we stand at the precipice of opportunity. \nCulminating a decade of work, we have before us legislation that will \nforever change the face of Medicare, providing every senior in America \nwith a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare Program that will \nexperience the largest expansion in its 38-year history.\n  We would not have arrived at this day without the exceptional \ncommitment by Finance Committee Chairman Grassley to advance this issue \nand to meld the considerable policy and political differences that have \nmarked the development of this legislation. His efforts were nothing \nshort of Herculean from the outset and guided us through a very \nchallenging and contentious conference committee over the last 4 \nmonths.\n  He, as well as Ranking Member Baucus, have remained committed to the \nbipartisan principles that forged the Senate legislation which garnered \nthe support of 16 members of the Senate Finance Committee, as well as \nin the overall passage of the legislation last June of 76 Members of \nthe full Senate.\n  I also wish to recognize the outstanding leadership of the President \nwho, in 2001, challenged Congress to enact a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, propounded a set of principles, and has provided strong \nimpetus during this home stretch for Congress to complete our work and \nto send to his desk legislation that he can sign this year.\n  I know firsthand from my conversations with the President that this \nis a cornerstone of his agenda, and absent his driving force, we would \nnot be here today.\n  So, too, has the majority leader redoubled his longstanding and \nunflagging commitment to enacting into law a bipartisan bill, moving us \never closer to that goal. And thanks to the unique confluence of his \nskills, his unparalleled knowledge and grasp of the issues, and his \nsingle-mindedness of purpose, more than three-quarters of the Senate \ncame to support S. 1 that we passed last June. And in bringing that to \nthe eve of final passage of this conference report, he has typically \nbeen respectful of and responsive to wide-ranging concerns and \nrecommendations that have been voiced by me and others. I thank him for \nhis leadership and for shaping this process to its ultimate and I know \nsuccessful conclusion of this report.\n  I also extend my appreciation to my colleagues, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Breaux, and Senator Jeffords, with whom I have worked so \nclosely on a prescription drug benefit over the last 3 years. They have \nbeen stalwarts in this fight and developed the template tripartisan \nbill of which so many of the principles have been incorporated in this \nconference report.\n  Certainly no one has more fiercely championed the cause than another \ncolleague I have joined with in this battle in the past, Senator \nKennedy, who I recognize does not support this conference report but \nwhose early involvement and passionate policy advocacy unquestionably \nbuilt momentum for this issue in Congress.\n  Finally, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Ron Wyden, \nwith whom I began my prescription drug coverage journey almost 6 years \nago when we developed the first bipartisan prescription drug plan in \nCongress, which established the principles that we both believed were \nso crucial and essential to shaping this benefit. We reached across \nthis political aisle because we recognized that only through a \nbipartisan plan could we ever see the light of day in enacting this \nkind of benefit as part of the Medicare Program.\n  We joined forces, as members of the Budget Committee, to carve out \nthe 2001 budget, believe it or not, which was a $40 billion 5-year \nreserve fund. Well, how far we have come from the $370 billion \ntripartisan plan developed last year to the historic passage of S. 1 \nthis last June of $400 billion.\n  But I can tell my colleagues from my own personal professional \nexperience that Congress' journey along this road has never been easy, \nalthough it has been infinitely more arduous for America's seniors. The \nprocess has borne witness to a multiplicity of goals and philosophies \nacross the spectrum.\n  Some have wanted to add a drug benefit to the existing Medicare \nProgram that would leverage purchasing power for the more than 40 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries, while others sought to use the issue as \neither a vehicle for the wholesale privatization of Medicare or full \nscale Government-administered benefits. Some have said we are providing \ntoo great an incentive for people to enroll in private plans, while \nothers argue we are starving those very same plans. As some have \nargued, the benefits provided in a particular bill are inadequate while \nothers submit that they are, in fact, too generous and should be \nlimited to a low-income catastrophic plan.\n  Today, we essentially all agree we are well beyond one question: The \nquestion of need. Therefore, it is imperative that we acknowledge the \nreality that just as the journey thus far has been imperiled by the \nslings and arrows of those on all sides of this issue that we have \nheard this morning, it will not be easier with the passage of time, not \nwhen we are debating the creation of the largest domestic program in \nnominal terms ever, not when we are attempting the largest expansion in \nthe history of the third largest Federal domestic spending program.\n  I think it is important to emphasize the extent to which this is a \nsizable expansion. So for those on the other side who are talking about \nthe fact that we are not doing enough, this is a substantial beginning. \nWhen we consider all of the significant challenges that are looming on \nthe horizon, such as strengthening Social Security and Medicare as 77 \nmillion baby boomers will begin to retire in the year 2013, all the \nwhile we are facing record-setting deficits.\n  We did have an optimal window for positive change just 2\\1/2\\ years \nago when the Congressional Budget Office was projecting surpluses as \nfar as the eye could see, about $5.6 trillion through 2011. Now we have \nnext year's Federal deficit alone projected to be nearly $500 billion. \nWe know the reasons: In the aftermath of September 11, the war in Iraq, \na declining economy.\n\n  It begins to illustrate how quickly the tide can turn; that is, how \nquickly the opportunities can be lost. Just think, many of the same \nspeakers today are standing on the Senate floor arguing from different \nperspectives and plans on adding a prescription drug benefit to the \nMedicare Program. At that time, just a year ago, the Senate was \npresented with a choice between a tripartisan plan that ensured \ncoverage would be available to all seniors--comprehensive, maximum \nbenefit possible for low-income seniors and was a permanent part of the \nMedicare Program. The alternate that we were debating at the time was \ntemporary. It would have sunset and would have statutorily restricted \naccess to drugs because it would have been a Government-run system that \nwould have cost close to approximately $1 trillion; although at the \ntime, as my colleagues recall, we did not have any CBO scores, so we \ncould not possibly know or ascertain the exact cost, but we knew that \nit would probably be $1 trillion and\n\n[[Page S15535]]\n\ncounting because it would have been a Government-run system. It would \nhave restricted choices to seniors, and they would not have had access \nto the array of drugs that are available on the market today with that \ntype of system. The benefit sunsetted after 7 years.\n  Those who are dissatisfied with what we have before us today should \nfondly recall the tripartisan bill and lament its unfortunate demise \nbecause at that time we had a plan that brought together disparate \ninterests for a very favorable benefit. That was then and this is now.\n  We are here, and the conference report before us is the result of an \nattempt to balance the competing viewpoints not only among Members but \nthe stunningly disparate views between the House-passed legislation and \nthe Senate-passed legislation. The simple truth is, while I continue to \nprefer the Senate bill, as many of us do, it is this conference report \nupon which we will vote.\n  After careful review, I have concluded that while it is not \neverything it could be, it is not everything it should be, in the end, \nmake no mistake about it, millions of seniors will benefit over the \nstagnation of the status quo benefit.\n  Margaret Thatcher once said, you may have to fight a battle more than \nonce in order to win. Well, some of us have been fighting this battle \nnow for nearly 6 years, and for some even longer. The bottom line is, \nwe cannot hold hostage our seniors' futures to a political \nunwillingness to compromise. This bill provides us with our best \navailable opportunity to secure for the first time a legislative \nfoothold that honors the same basic principles that I and others have \nexpounded upon since I first came to this issue more than 6 years ago; \nthat in keeping with the basic tenets of Medicare, this prescription \ndrug benefit will be universal. Everybody in the system will have \naccess to this benefit. That is important because there were other \ndivergent views that simply wanted a low-income and a catastrophic.\n  We preserved the universal principle of Medicare, and that is not to \nbe underestimated for a variety of reasons. It is comprehensive. It is \na wide-ranging benefit. It is affordable, particularly for those at the \nlow-income scale. It is voluntary participation and not mandatory. \nSeniors can choose to participate if they want to. It is permanent. \nUnlike what we were considering a year ago on this floor, it does not \nsunset because the costs were so prohibitive that the benefit had to be \nsunsetted. We have a permanent benefit, and it provides equal benefits \nacross the spectrum of plans. That is also very important. So everybody \nwill have access to the same benefit, regardless of what plan they \nchoose.\n  Like the Senate bill and the tripartisan proposal before that, it \ndirects the most assistance toward those seniors with the lowest income \nand includes a reliable Government fallback mechanism of last resort to \nmake sure that every senior, regardless of where they live in America, \nwill have access to and the stability of the traditional Medicare \nProgram. But they will also, regardless of where they live in America, \nhave access to a prescription drug benefit so there will be that \nreliability, with a Government fallback program.\n  In its totality, looking at this conference report, it fulfills all \nof those principles. That is very important. It is something we cannot \noverlook. It cannot be minimized. It cannot be denigrating. Those \nprinciples have been captured in this legislation, irrespective of all \nthe other disparate views that come in between. Those principles \nframework this conference report. Those were the principles that were \nin the Senate-passed legislation.\n  Now let's look at some of the individual components of the package \nbefore us. We should be mindful of how we arrived at this destination \nbecause we have to put this conference report in context, not only for \nwhy we are here today but what happened previously, what happened last \nyear, what happened 4 years ago, what happened 6 years ago, because it \nillustrates the long journey we have taken down this road and what has \nhappened in the House--what has happened in America, in terms of the \nrising cost of prescription drugs and the impact on seniors.\n  As this Senate passed a bill with overwhelming bipartisan support, \nthose 76 votes I was referring to earlier, last June, the House passed \nlegislation with the most razor-thin margin of just 1 vote--just 1 \nvote. We all witnessed what unfolded this morning in the early morning \nhours when the House with a 5-vote margin passed the conference report. \nObviously, it reflects some very different views between both Chambers, \namong philosophies, among regions of the country. We cannot overlook \nthat, in terms of what do we do now. What can we ever potentially do in \nthe future that will be even better?\n  We see the results, obviously, in those differences. Some have \nreferred to the benefit that is available in this conference report. I \nthink it is important to talk about some of those issues.\n  We see the result, obviously, in the starkest terms reflecting \ndifferent philosophies in the nature of the benefit that ultimately was \ndesigned by the conference committee to sort of split the differences, \nbecause that is what conference committees are all about. No, it can't \nbe all one way or the other. You have to sort of go back and forth, to \nfigure out what can you do to design an equilibrium of thought. It has \nto be carefully calibrated so that you do not compromise what you \nbelieve but it advances the legislative agenda on your ultimate goal, \nin this case designing a prescription drug benefit as part of the \nMedicare program. So let's look at the underlying benefit when it comes \nto the drug plan.\n  It includes aspects that are modeled after each bill. The deductible \nwas set at the House lower level of $250. We had $275. And the \nconferees worked to improve this proposal by offering a benefit that \nhad an actuarial value that was higher than the benefit from both \nbills. However, in providing these improvements, concessions had to be \nmade. In doing so, the Senate's benefit cap that was referred to by \nother speakers--we had a $4,500 benefit cap, a spending threshold--that \nwas lowered to $2,250. So while they got a better actuarial benefit for \nall beneficiaries, the spending cap was lowered to $2,250.\n\n  But in the same respect, the cost sharing provided under this cap was \nlowered from 50 percent to 25 percent that was in the legislation in \nthe Senate bill.\n  So we had a cost sharing between Government and the beneficiary that \nwas 50-50. But in the conference report, now the Government will \nprovide the 75 percent and the beneficiary 25. So that is an \nimprovement. We see it is not all perfect, but again this benefit \nrepresents the art of the compromise. You have to think again, is this \nbetter than the status quo? I think there is no question that it is \nbecause millions will stand to gain, No. 1, getting a benefit; No. 2, \ngetting generous assistance on the low end of the income scale. But \neverybody stands to gain who participates in the Medicare Program, who \nwants to participate in accessing this prescription drug plan.\n  As I see it, this conference report will at least get the Federal \nfoot in the door in providing a significant level of assistance to one \nout of four Americans who, right now, don't have any assistance. They \ndon't have any assistance currently. If you look at the graphs, a \nquarter of Medicare beneficiaries have nothing. So are we saying this \nis not better than that status quo?\n  We also design a benefit for all seniors with a $35 monthly premium \nthat will save 50 percent on their cost of prescription drugs. So, for \nexample, a senior who spends $3,600 on prescription drugs will realize \na saving of $1,714 annually.\n  Then as I mentioned earlier about the lowest income and the \nassistance they will receive under this conference report, which was in \nkeeping with the principles of the Senate-passed legislation for which \nwe received 76 votes, we find that the conferees utilized the model \nthat was established in the Senate bill. Most critically, no senior who \nqualifies for one of the low-income categories will experience a gap in \ncoverage--none. So for those under the 150 percent of poverty level, \nthey will experience no gap in coverage.\n  It also means in Maine, for example, there will be 93,450 Medicare \nbeneficiaries, more than 40 percent of the overall Medicare population, \nwho will receive a generous benefit with no gap in coverage, not to \nmention that it will be at a high level of assistance--up to 150 \npercent, with minimal copays, in\n\n[[Page S15536]]\n\nsome instances--most instances, no deductible, no premiums, and, as we \nknow, a sliding scale on the monthly premium of 135 to 150.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I did not know there was a time restriction, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a 20-minute time limitation. The \nSenator may ask for additional time. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for an additional 10 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. While the Senate has extended this to a greater number of \nseniors, unlike the Senate bill, this proposal ensures all seniors, \neven the so-called dual eligibles, will be part of this conference \nreport. That certainly benefits my beneficiaries in Maine but 6 million \nnationally.\n  Not only do seniors deserve a subsidy to help make prescription drugs \nmore affordable, they should also have the benefit of choice when it \ncomes to the coverage they purchase. Seniors should not be limited in \ntheir options for coverage, so that we ensure all seniors have a choice \nof at least two privately delivered drug plans.\n  Options are important. They will have choice among prescription drugs \nas well. That is critically important because the choices will be \nthere, and they will also have the benefit of a fallback to ensure this \ncoverage and those options are available nationwide.\n  Finally, I want to get to the one remaining point because of time \nlimitations. We have heard so much about the privatization of Medicare, \nwhat this would do. This conference report unquestionably represents \nthe end of the House bill's open-ended efforts to move Medicare towards \na national privatized system through an untested, untried policy known \nas premium support that could have led to a patchwork quilt of uneven \nhealth care delivery that existed prior to the creation of the Medicare \nProgram in 1965. This approach would have fostered wild fluctuations in \nthe premiums for the traditional Medicare Program whereas, incredibly, \nMedicare now provides all seniors with the same benefit for the same \npremium. Under this proposal, premium variations would have occurred \nnot just from State to State but within a State and even within \ncongressional districts across the country.\n  There are many illustrations of that point. For example, from the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid, they indicated that in Miami, FL, \nthey would pay $2,100 a year for the traditional Medicare Program \ncompared to $900 to seniors who would pay that in Osceola, FL, for the \nsame benefit.\n  When you compare North Carolina to variations from State to State, it \nwould have been extreme.\n  For example, they would have paid $750 for the traditional Medicare; \nwhereas, in Florida they were paying $2,100 for that same benefit but \ntheir premium, obviously, would be much higher.\n  In response to a letter that 43 colleagues and I sent--I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters, along with \nan editorial on this subject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2003.\n     Chairman Charles E. Grassley and Ranking Member Max Baucus,\n     Senate Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Chairman W.J. (Billy) Tauzin and Ranking Member John D. \n       Dingell,\n     House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Chairman William M. Thomas and Ranking Member Charles B. \n       Rangel,\n     House Ways and Means Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Conferees: The Medicare conference has reached a \n     critical junction in its effort to craft a conference \n     agreement to develop a Medicare prescription drug and \n     modernization bill: The time is fast approaching when final \n     agreements must be made if a proposal is to be developed \n     prior to the November 7 target-adjournment date. However, \n     many key issues remain unresolved, which will determine \n     whether this bill can garner strong bipartisan support and \n     ultimately become law. As you progress into this critical \n     stage, we urge you to remain committed to the bipartisan \n     principles contained in the legislation developed and passed \n     by the United States Senate.\n       First, the Senate bill takes strong steps to provide every \n     senior and disabled American, no matter where they live, with \n     choices in coverage. Notably, this is done in a manner that \n     preserves the traditional Medicare program as a viable \n     option. This balance was achieved by providing all seniors \n     with access to the same level of drug coverage no matter the \n     coverage option chosen. Further, the Senate bill assures this \n     choice will be a fair one that will not disadvantage senior \n     citizens who remain in traditional Medicare. Accordingly, we \n     urge you to remain committed to principles that provide a \n     level playing field between the private sector and Medicare \n     and reject proposals that would unduly raise Medicare \n     premiums or otherwise advantage private plans.\n       Second, the Senate bill assures affordable, comprehensive \n     coverage to those with incomes below 160 percent of the \n     federal poverty level or $15,472 for an individual in 2006. \n     Generous and affordable coverage for this population is \n     essential, given that most presently do not have access to a \n     prescription drug benefit. The conference must assure that \n     the generous assistance provided to low income beneficiaries \n     is maintained and reject measures that would reduce the \n     benefits presently accorded Medicaid recipients.\n       Third, we urge the conferees to include a mechanism that \n     will ensure that all seniors have access to a prescription \n     drug benefit, no matter where they live. The Senate bill \n     assures that private plans interested in providing this \n     benefit can do so and will be the preferred mechanism of \n     delivery in every geographic locality; however, it is not \n     possible to guarantee their participation. Therefore, it is \n     necessary that the final proposal include a ballback \n     mechanism, as was included in the Senate bill, that will \n     ensure that beneficiaries will have access to the drug \n     benefit in the event that private plans are not available in \n     a region.\n       Finally, we caution the conferees against including \n     provisions that will circumvent established congressional \n     procedures or delegate responsibilities for establishing the \n     benefit and cost-sharing requirements to the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS). The responsibility for \n     developing and overseeing benefits included in the Medicare \n     program rests with the Congress, and this bill should not \n     violate that principle.\n       Enactment this year of a bill that adds a Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit and improves the program is a top \n     priority for each of us. America's seniors have waited too \n     long for comprehensive drug coverage and the addition of \n     market-based options. However, to achieve this goal, we must \n     continue to work together to develop agreements that will \n     receive bipartisan support in each chamber, In 1965, the \n     original Medicare bill garnered this level of support and a \n     change to the program of this magnitude should be no \n     different.\n       We remain ready to help you address these and other issues \n     that will impact the final proposal, and hope you will work \n     with us to develop bipartisan proposals that we can support.\n           Sincerely,\n     Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Arlen Specter,\n     Mike DeWine,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Jeff Bingaman,\n     Blanche L. Lincoln,\n     James M. Jeffords.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 13, 2003.\n     The Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Frist: It has come to our attention that \n     leadership is considering the inclusion of a new version of \n     the policy model known as premium support. As you know, this \n     policy places the traditional Medicare program and private \n     plans into direct competition and according to the Centers \n     for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will lead to \n     dramatic increases in the annual premium for the traditional \n     Medicare program.\n       We are extremely concerned about the inclusion of this \n     policy proposal in a Medicare bill. Thought some may consider \n     this a demonstration project, we disagree. This appears to be \n     a veiled attempt to institute this policy into law. According \n     to CMS data this proposal could capture up to 10 million \n     seniors, 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. Further, it \n     will require them to bear the burden of cost increases \n     associated with the demonstration project.\n       This policy also unfairly targets some seniors simply based \n     on their geographic location and mandates their \n     participation. The likely result will be significant \n     increases in traditional Medicare premiums for seniors living \n     in the affected areas and could destabilize the Medicare \n     program for all seniors.\n       We understand that leadership and some conferees may be \n     considering possible changes to this latest proposal. We urge \n     you to remove this policy from the bill. We believe there are \n     other possible options that will encourage private plan \n     participation in the Medicare program that do not negatively \n     impact the traditional Medicare program.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this vitally important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Signed by 44 members of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Bangor Daily News, Nov. 21, 2003]\n\n                           Hobson's Medicare\n\n       Never have so many dollars been put to so little use. The \n     $400 billion Medicare bill before Congress establishes what \n     all sides agree\n\n[[Page S15537]]\n\n     is necessary--a prescription drug benefit--but blasts away at \n     much of Medicare's foundation. It is a deal that makes all \n     previously rejected Medicare reform look wise and generous by \n     comparison. It is also the best deal the current Congress is \n     likely to get.\n       The difficult calculation is this: Is a badly flawed bill \n     that contains a needed drug benefit worth passing when the \n     alternative is to reject it without the chance to enact \n     approved legislation? The $400 billion has been set aside for \n     funding this legislation; should it fail, the money would \n     disappear and given the extent of the deficit for the next \n     decade or more, would not be available next year, even in the \n     unlikely chance a bill could be passed in an election year or \n     perhaps after that.\n       Much of the debate this week has focused on the plan's \n     intent to establish privatization pilot projects--subsidized \n     private insurers would offer Medicare in six metropolitan \n     areas in competition with traditional Medicare--but other \n     aspects of it are equally important and equally troubling. \n     The means-testing provision in the bill, for instance, raises \n     costs for middle-class seniors; reimbursements for medical \n     residents, harm clinic work; those who remain in traditional \n     Medicare for the pilot program will see increases in their \n     costs; states that could negotiate for their Medicaid-\n     Medicare clients lose much of their bargaining power while \n     also losing their federal support for the program. The fear \n     remains strong among health care advocates that the entire \n     reform is an attempt to cap the federal contribution to \n     Medicare and shift future costs to seniors. Several of these \n     problems are being debated now--Sen. Olympia Snowe has been \n     in the middle of negotiations all week; imagine the time and \n     argument that would have been saved had she been put on the \n     conference committee. Some of these issues may be resolved \n     but several are likely to remain as the House and Senate \n     vote.\n       Some members of Congress do not support the bill for these \n     many reasons; some don't support it because of its cost and \n     relatively small nod toward privatization. But for those who \n     believe a drug benefit is important and will become more \n     important in the coming years, the choice is to vote yes, and \n     immediately set about chipping away at some of the worst \n     aspects of the bill. This is a terrible way to build a health \n     care safety net for the nation's seniors, but lamenting the \n     process is not an excuse for allowing this opportunity to \n     pass by without approving the drug benefit.\n       At 1,100 pages, the Medicare bill is too long and complex \n     to describe it merely as a sop to industry (though \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers should love it), an ideological \n     document (though its medical-savings accounts are a GOP \n     crowd-pleaser) or a broad expansion of entitlements (though \n     the drug benefit is exactly that). It is fair to say the bill \n     is a poor version of what should have been passed years ago \n     and now that Congress is out of time and out of money, it is \n     about as much as the public can expect.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in that letter, we expressed our strong \nopposition to this ideological venture. It is important to know that \nsignificant changes were made to transform the full-scale national \npremium support proposal into a limited bone fide demonstration \nproject. That is important to know.\n  I have it here on the chart. I hope it is something I can get back to \non Monday.\n  It is important to know how far we have come from where it was. The \nopen-ended privatization of the Medicare Program, starting in 2010, \nwould have been a wholesale privatization which didn't offer any \nseniors any protection, regardless if they were low income, from \npremium fluctuations. Because it would open it up to competition in the \nprivate sector, the conferees shifted it to a bone fide limited \ndemonstration project. We moved from that open-ended privatization to \nthe first proposal in the conference report which provided protection \nfor low-income seniors for any type of open-ended privatization.\n  They also moved to a demonstration project so it wouldn't be \nnational--it wouldn't be permanent for one region in four metropolitan \nstatistical areas. We said that is not enough; that is too open ended. \nWe finally were able to reduce it to six MSAs with limited criteria. \nThat limited the number of people who would participate in those six \nmetropolitan areas.\n  It is very important, because what we had before was nationwide and \nopen ended, which would have been a frontal assault on the traditional \nMedicare Program as we know it with an untested and untried approach \nwhere we don't have a scintilla of evidence whether it would work. \nThrough our efforts and through the responsiveness of the leader and \nChairman Grassley, we were able to move from a nationwide approach to \nsix metropolitan areas which includes criteria that GPO says will limit \nthis to 1 million--anywhere from 650,000 seniors to 1 million seniors--\nand it would be sunset by the year 2016. It would kick in in the year \n2010. It will be phased in and will be sunset in 2016.\n  That is important.\n  What is also important is the fluctuation in premiums, which I was \nreferring to earlier. That is critical because that won't occur. \nOriginally, there was no protection, with huge, wide variances, \ndepending on where you live in America, and subject to undermining and \ndestabilizing of the Medicare Program. The Congress agreed originally \nto fluctuations which would vary from 10 percent per year compounded. \nWe were able to weigh in. Finally, what we have here is a reduction in \nthe level of allowing increases in premiums to 5 percent, removing the \ncompounding mechanism that originally would have had a total cumulative \nimpact of 30 percent over 6 years.\n  We have come a long way from where this proposal was in the House \nthat would have undermined the traditional fee for service.\n  When I hear speakers on the other side of the political aisle talking \nabout privatization, I think it is important to stick to the facts of \nwhat we now have.\n  This is a sea change from the original initial proposal that was in \nthe House-passed legislation. Obviously, the Senate had nothing \nreferring to this premium support program. What we have now is a \nlimitation to one Federal demonstration project for a legitimate avenue \nto experimenting with new options for potentially improving upon the \nMedicare Program in the future. But we cannot do it unless we \nabsolutely have assurances that it will work.\n\n  That is what demonstration projects and programs are all about. We \nlearn from them. I didn't want to use seniors as an experiment on the \nroad to learning. That is why this is very limited. Now it is no longer \nnationwide. It is down to six MSAs.\n  It includes selection criteria that the Congressional Budget Office \nsays will limit the number of impacted seniors to 1 million. It also \noffers protection even in that demonstration project to seniors under \n50 percent of poverty level or below.\n  That is very important to note.\n  We are essentially holding seniors harmless even in those \ndemonstration projects. But, again, this is no longer what it was in \nthe House-passed legislation.\n  I think it is important that we understand that.\n  This is a means to evaluate anything in the future that may be \npotentially an improvement to strengthen the future of the Medicare \nProgram. But, obviously, we don't want to use open-ended programs at \nthe expense of the traditional program that has worked so well.\n  Ironically, in all of this, that is why this was not viable to what \nwas in the House-passed bill--that the traditional Medicare Program \nworked. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office told us it would not \nachieve the savings that the proponents were suggesting. It would only \nsave $1 billion potentially, and it could threaten the underlying \ntraditional fee for service. Where would the seniors be? Where they \nwere prior to 1965 where a lot of working Americans are--barely being \nable to have access to any type of health care, let alone health care \nwith consistency, or where the costs were so prohibitive they were \nrestricted to catastrophic coverage. Why do we want to assign that \nproblem to our seniors until we know what could work in the future?\n  I can tell you that there is not one scintilla of evidence in the \npublic sector or in the private sector that would tell you that any \npremium support plan would work at this point. That is why it should be \nconfined to a limited demonstration project of no more than 1 million--\nit could be as low as 650,000--to learn what will work to potentially \nimprove. It sunsets, we will learn from it, and decide what it can do \nfor the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a very careful look at this legislation \nbecause this is a transformational moment in history, and there will be \nno going back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S15538]]\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to speak for a few minutes about this \nconference report which is before the Senate.\n  I did not support the Medicare bill voted out of the Senate. I voted \nagainst it hoping and praying all along that this bill would be \nimproved as a result of the collaboration of the leadership in the \nHouse and the Senate in the conference. Indeed, I believe it has. That \nis not to say that I believe this is a perfect bill--far from it. But \nthis bill does represent an improvement.\n  This bill provides coverage for those who need it most. In Texas, \nnearly 300,000 low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are not eligible \nfor Medicaid and who did not have any prescription drug coverage will \nbe covered under this new bill.\n  It will increase the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries in Texas \nwith prescription drug coverage from roughly 60 percent to 95 percent.\n  I would like to express my congratulations to leadership, to Majority \nLeader Frist, who I know has taken a personal interest in this cause as \na medical doctor and as someone who has worked very hard to get us to \nwhere we are today; Chairman Chuck Grassley, who has the patience of \nJob and who I know has worked very closely with Senator Baucus, the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, and Senator John Breaux of \nLouisiana on other side, as well as Senators Nickles and Kyl and others \nwho specifically shared some of the concerns that I had with the Senate \nbill but which I believe have produced as a result of their \ncollaboration a much improved bill, and one which I am now proud to \nsupport.\n  I do not view this bill as the finished product. I view this as a \ngood start. But I think it would be a mistake to say because we view \nthe glass is half empty as opposed to half full that we ought to vote \nagainst this Medicare conference report. I have no confidence the stars \nwill align and the political climate will be such that we could ever \nget to this point any time in the near future. It is important we \ndeliver on the promise that each Member in this Chamber made when we \nran for this office and which the President made when he was elected, \nthat we would strengthen and improve Medicare by providing prescription \ndrug coverage for seniors who need it. The reason I am proud to support \nthis bill today is because this represents delivery on that promise.\n\n  In the end, I don't think the American people care very much about \ndemagoguing certain aspects of the bill. They do not care very much \nabout partisan differences. They do not care that much, really, about \nsome of the ideological differences, the competing ideas that now have \nbeen melded into this bill and which create, to some extent, a \nhodgepodge, but on balance, an improvement over the status quo. It is \nour responsibility to govern. Governing means delivering results and \nnot just criticizing things that are easy enough to criticize.\n  Frankly, any bit of legislation that comes before this floor has \ndefects that are easy to criticize. We are sent here to get the work of \nthe American people done. This bill represents delivery on a promise we \nhave made.\n  We spend about $1.4 trillion a year in this country on health care. \nWe know as much money as is spent on health care that still we have \nlarge segments of the population that are underserved and who do not \nhave access to good quality health care. Fortunately, since 1965, our \nseniors have been provided access to good quality health care through \nthe Medicare Program. We also know unless you happen to be among even \nthe most modest means in our society, you would not have coverage. For \nexample, under Medicaid, only those who are of very modest means who \nfall beneath the poverty level are eligible for that free health care \nprogram. Children are provided coverage to health care under the S-CHIP \nprogram which has provided coverage for many children who come from \nfamilies of modest means who would not otherwise have access.\n  We still have about 45 million people in the United States who do not \nhave health insurance and who have limited access to health care \ncoverage. That is something that we need to address. Fortunately, it is \nsomething that has been addressed, at least in part, in this bill.\n  For example, in my State of Texas, we have many people who are \nuninsured and, indeed, who are undocumented. In other words, they have \ncome to this country without the benefit of the legal process. But \nunder Federal law, the Federal Government says you must provide free \nmedical care at your emergency rooms and hospitals all across the \ncountry.\n  Finally, rather than to foist that financial burden on the local \ngovernments and the local taxpayers and the State government and State \ntaxpayers, this bill starts at least a downpayment to provide for that \npreviously unfunded mandate. Indeed, it provides $250 million a year to \nbe distributed among the States based on their percentage of population \nof undocumented immigrants. For example, the State of Texas will \nreceive about $50 million a year over the next 4 years to help make \ngood on that broken promise by the Federal Government.\n  Indeed, that unfunded mandate will at least be funded to that extent. \nIt is not by any stretch of the imagination enough to make Texas whole, \nbut it is a start, a movement in the right direction.\n  The other reason I am for this bill is because in 1965 the U.S. \nGovernment made a promise to our senior citizens that if you played by \nthe rules, if you worked, if you paid your Medicare taxes, when you \nturn 65, Medicare would be there for you. While we know there have been \nenormous changes in the practice of medicine and the delivery of health \ncare since 1965, Medicare has not changed. It is in response to the \ndemands of that passage of time that we see this bill which does \nactually strengthen and improve Medicare today.\n  If there is one fundamental reason I am for this bill it is because I \nthink it is the best this body and our counterparts across the Rotunda \nare able to come up with at this time. It would be unconscionable to \nleave our seniors without prescription drug coverage, especially after \nall Members in this Chamber and elsewhere have campaigned on that \nissue, year after year after year, and left perhaps too many people \nskeptical or maybe even cynical about whether we actually intended to \nfollow through on our campaign promises. This bill represents the kind \nof results I think they deserve and the kind of results that make good \nthose promises we have made.\n  As I say, I believe this is a good start. This is not a finished \nproduct. One of the best aspects of this bill is it changes the nature \nof Medicare to some extent by turning at least to some small degree \nfrom the command and control model that says the Federal Government \nknows best, which provides no choice, no alternatives, no opportunities \nfor seniors to actually get better service or better health care by \nhaving some competition in the marketplace. Now, 38 years after \nMedicare was first passed in 1965, we see better coverage under this \nbill. We see more choice. We see coordination of medical therapies \nbecause, of course, many people are on multiple types of therapies, \neven drugs that may interact. This bill provides for a coordination of \nthose medical therapies in a way that will enhance and protect the \nhealth of our seniors, not damage them.\n  This bill places an important emphasis on prevention. This is one of \nthe areas on which we need to do a lot more work. Frankly, it is much \nmore humane and much cheaper and, indeed, much more compassionate to \nprevent disease than to wait until it has occurred and then try to \ntreat it, perhaps with some or no success. This bill does provide for \nscreening for cardiovascular disease, for diabetes, for greater access \nto mammography so that breast cancer can be diagnosed earlier, and it \nwill provide an opportunity for every senior, as they go into Medicare, \nto get a complete physical examination so that if there is some way we \ncan prevent them from becoming ill or perhaps address that illness much \nmore effectively and efficiently by getting to it earlier, we can \nimprove the quality of life and also save the taxpayers money when it \ncomes to treating full-blown illnesses as they run amok.\n  This bill is a vast improvement over the status quo because it has \nstrong provisions for prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse. It is \ninevitable in a bill this big, some $400 billion over the next 10 \nyears, that there is potential\n\n[[Page S15539]]\n\nfor fraud, waste, and abuse. I congratulate Chairman Grassley and the \nconference committee for writing into this bill important protections \nthat will allow for the detection, indeed, for the investigation and \nhopefully for the prosecution of fraud, waste, and abuse when it comes \nto the taxpayers' dollars.\n  I know the chairman of the Finance Committee shares a passion for \nprotecting people in the rural parts of his State, and certainly across \nthe United States. I share that passion with him.\n  I still remember when I was campaigning up in the panhandle of Texas, \na place where there is low-population density, in a rural part of our \nState where the county judge, who is the chief administrator for the \ncounty government, came up to me. She was concerned about her mother. \nShe said the doctor for her mother, who was 80 years old, had refused \nto continue to accept Medicare patients. And this individual's mother \nhad no other way to pay for her health care other than Medicare. So \nliterally she lost access to the only doctor she had ever had and that \nshe had ever known, at least during that period of her life.\n  This bill addresses that concern, too, by providing greater access to \nhealth care in rural parts of our country, and it imposes reimbursement \nrates for doctors and hospitals. Frankly, I have always thought it was \nwrong for us to try to balance the budget on the backs of health care \nproviders because, frequently, these people provide free health care \nout of the goodness of their heart, for which they have no hope of \ncompensation. I think it is only just and it is only right that we \nprovide for fair and adequate reimbursement for treatment of Medicare \npatients. Frankly, that is the only way we are going to continue to see \nready access for our seniors to the health care they need.\n  There were two reasons I was very concerned about the bill as it left \nthe Senate. One was because it lacked any means testing; in other \nwords, the young man or young woman who earns minimum wage would be \nexpected, out of their Medicare taxes, to pay for the prescription \ndrugs of Bill Gates or Ross Perot from my State, someone who is more \nthan capable of paying for their prescription drugs. I, frankly, \nthought it was unfair to foist that on the minimum-wage worker.\n  Then the other concern I had was that I wanted to make sure we were \nnot providing incentives for employers who maintain health insurance \ncoverage for their employees after they retire, to simply drop them and \ncreate a greater burden on taxpayers.\n  I think both of those issues have been addressed.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think the provision of health savings \naccounts represents a tremendous victory for those of us who believe \nthat individuals ought to have greater choice, greater opportunity to \nmanage their health care costs, by taking pretax dollars to pay for \nmedical costs that are not otherwise covered by insurance.\n  So for all those reasons, I congratulate again Chairman Grassley and \nthose who have worked so hard on this bill. I know it has not been \neasy. It is not perfect, but, again, I do not think we should let the \nbest be the enemy of the good. So I will proudly support it and work \nwith Chairman Grassley and others to see that this gets to the \nPresident's desk for signature as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, with the \nconcurrence of Senator Stabenow, that I be allowed to go in her place \nand she go in my place in the order of speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could I \nask, is that in line with what we have agreed to?\n  Mr. REED. Absolutely. The original order was that Senator Stabenow \nspeak as the next Democratic speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, opinion has already been registered with \nrespect to this Medicare proposal before us today. I think one of the \nmore interesting comments was from the Des Moines Register editorial \nboard, describing this legislation as ``a big, sloppy kiss to the \npharmaceutical and insurance industries.'' That is essentially what \nthis bill is. It is a huge payoff to pharmaceutical companies and to \nthe insurance industry. It is not really about giving seniors what they \ndeserve and what we have all labored for many years to provide them \nwith; and that is, comprehensive drug coverage.\n  There is another fallacy that is operating, too, in our debate today. \nThat fallacy is that this bill is the best we can do, so let's just \nmove on. I think it is a fallacy because I checked this morning the \ndiscussion of the vote early, early this morning in the House of \nRepresentatives. Apparently, the last few votes that were arm-twisted \ninto supporting this bill from conservatives in the House was based \nupon the logic that if this bill failed, the next bill, which would \ncome promptly after this bill, would be, from their perspective, worse; \nbut from the perspective of seniors, much better because it would not \nrepresent ``a big, sloppy kiss to the pharmaceutical and insurance \nindustries.'' It would represent a commitment to provide prescription \ndrugs--real prescription drugs--and maintaining the Medicare system. \nAnd that is what seniors want.\n  So I believe we can make this bill better simply by holding our \nground, by debating it extensively, by not rushing to judgment, by not \nsurrendering to artificial deadlines of the Thanksgiving holiday or \neven the Christmas holiday.\n  This is the largest proposed change in the Medicare Program since its \ninception in 1965, and to rush through this in a few hours, not because \nof the substance of the bill, but because of the timetable for \nairplanes and trains to get home for the holidays, is wrong. We should \nstay here and do our job, just as thousands and thousands of young \nAmericans are staying across the globe and doing their job to protect \nus.\n  I think there is another issue here, too; and that is the notion that \nthis is the end of the privatization argument. On the contrary, this is \nthe beginning of privatization. That is the quid pro quo for the \nsupport, particularly support of conservatives, of this bill in the \nHouse and here in the Senate. I can envision and anticipate that with \neach new reconciliation bill that is forced upon us, with a procedure \nthat does not allow unlimited debate in the Senate, we will see again \nand again the slow erosion of the traditional Medicare Program, under \nthe guise of cost savings, under the guise of competition, under the \nguise of so many other claims and so many other excuses.\n  So we are at a position where we are looking at legislation that \nrepresents, again, a massive giveaway to pharmaceutical and insurance \ncompanies, that does not provide an adequate benefit for seniors, and \nthat really does begin the privatization of the Medicare Program.\n  Since 1965, Medicare has provided dependable health care for our \nseniors. But we have all recognized in the last decade or more the rise \nof pharmaceuticals as a principal, and expensive, way to treat \ndiseases. We have all recognized that Medicare must adjust to this \nchange. We have urged and fought to get an adequate benefit for our \nseniors for drug coverage.\n  Now, in Rhode Island, with 14.5 percent of the population over 65, \nthis is of central concern to me. And I have worked very hard, as so \nmany others have, to try to get a good drug benefit program, but not at \nthe expense--not at the expense--of Medicare.\n  Now what has happened is that the administration, their allies in \nCongress, the pharmaceutical industry, and the insurance industry have \nall gotten together and have attempted not just to provide a drug \nbenefit that is adequate for seniors, but to provide a drug profit \nbonanza for the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies \nand to alter fundamentally the shape of traditional Medicare.\n  Now, in the wake of the Gingrich revolution in 1995, Newt Gingrich \ndeclared his intention of letting Medicare wither on the vine. His \nundisguised hostility to Medicare met a swift rebuff from Democrats \nbut, more importantly, from the American people because they understand \nthe critical need and the value of Medicare.\n  Today, this hostility to Medicare persists, but it has been \ncamouflaged\n\n[[Page S15540]]\n\nunder the cloak of a prescription drug benefit. As a result, we are on \nthe verge of a historic bait and switch. Under the guise of providing \ndrug coverage, the Bush administration is beginning the unraveling of \nthe Medicare Program. The bait is drugs; the effect is the slow \nunraveling of the Medicare Program.\n  This bill was cobbled together by the administration, by their allies \nin Congress, and by lobbyists for the drug and insurance industries to \nentice support based upon the notion of a drug benefit. But the goal, \nultimately, and the plan, in effect, is to privatize Medicare.\n  There is a memorable scene in America cinema in the movie ``Patton,'' \nof George C. Scott, who plays the illustrious general, watching the \nretreat of the German forces from the Battle of El Guettar.\n  He bellows at the top of his voice: Rommel, I read your book.\n  Of course, the obvious inference is people will declare their \nintentions years before and then carry them out. And that is exactly \nwhat is happening here. If you read the Gingrich book, if you read the \nconservative ``book'', this is about the privatization of Medicare. Now \nit might take a few years because tactically the lessons have been \nlearned since 1995. You can't get up on the rooftops and announce: We \nare ending traditional Medicare. This is a program that allows, in my \nview, more choice than an HMO because traditional Medicare allows \nseniors to choose their doctor, to change their doctor. In fact, if you \nask most seniors if they could, they would have that choice without any \ntype of condition whatsoever.\n  That is what is happening here. The intention is clear. But the \ntactics have been adjusted since 1995, since they ran into popular \nopposition. Now it is a subtle change, a series of changes over time, \nreconciliation bill after reconciliation bill. That would be incredibly \ndisastrous to the system and a disservice to our seniors.\n  The drug benefit is scheduled to begin in roughly 2006. Conveniently, \nit is after the 2004 election, and it also allows additional time to \nfiddle with the benefits before any of this becomes real in the lives \nof our seniors. One can anticipate that these benefits will be adjusted \nas our fiscal crisis becomes deeper and as we try desperately to \nconstrain costs within not just this program but every other program. \nThe benefits, as they exist today, are a monthly premium averaging \nabout $35, a deductible of $250 or so before Medicare covers 75 percent \nof an individual's drug costs. But because of inadequate funding in \nthis bill--the $400 billion was never enough--and because of the lavish \ncontribution to HMOs in a $12 billion slush fund, the lavish \ncontribution to health savings accounts of $6 billion, we already have \ndefects within the drug protection for our seniors because if a \nsenior's drug costs reach $2,200, Medicare will pay nothing until that \nsenior has already paid out of pocket $3,600. There is a gap, the \nproverbial donut hole. Must this donut hole exist? One could argue it \nhas to. But certainly, if we had extra resources, if we had the $18 \nbillion that this bill lavishes upon HMOs and insurance companies, why \ndon't we simply close the gap? Because we are not interested in \nproviding the best benefit under available resources to seniors. There \nis another priority: Let's go ahead and begin the slow privatization of \nMedicare.\n  There are those who say: Well, something is better than nothing; we \nwill take anything now.\n  Again, we can do better. We could do better in this Congress because \nthe fear last night that motivated those last few holdout votes was \nthat the Senate would do better, that we would bring another bill to \nthe Senate and to the House, and that bill would not have such a big \ngap; that bill would not be such a big sloppy kiss to the \npharmaceutical and insurance industries; it would be something seniors \ncould use, something seniors could use much more effectively than what \nwe are presenting them today.\n  They should recognize, too, that ``something is better than nothing'' \ndoesn't apply because the price of that something is the withering away \nof Medicare. We know what this is about. We know that if unchecked, \nthat is what you will insist upon and demand over each coming year.\n  Medicare works because it covers every senior. It spreads the risk. \nAn essential, fundamental point of any insurance plan is spreading the \nrisk. It works also because Medicare is willing to subsidize the cost \nof providing health care to seniors. The reason the private insurance \nindustry did not cover seniors before 1965 is simple: It was too \nexpensive. They couldn't make any money on it.\n  It took the Government to say: We will use public resources to \nsubsidize the health care costs of these seniors, and we will try to do \nit in an efficient way by first cutting out the overhead of a private \nhealth insurer, cutting out the profits of a private health insurer, \nmaking this a nationally based program having the broadest possible \ncoverage for all seniors. That is the essence of Medicare.\n  This bill is turning that on its head. This bill is fragmenting the \npool of seniors who will be covered. It is tilting the playing field \nagainst traditional Medicare by providing incentives for insurance \ncompanies. It is giving money not directly to subsidize the health care \nof seniors but to subsidize the bottom line of insurance companies. \nThat is the only reason they will play in the senior market, because \nthey are being paid to do so, paid in the form of their profits, not \nessentially in the form of services to seniors.\n\n  I suggest that if the market for senior health care was there to be \nexploited by private companies, it would have been exploited in 1965, \nin 1955, in 1945, but it wasn't. And we all know because this body \ncontains people who at least have reached middle age. We all can \nremember in every home there was an elderly relative--a grandmother, a \ngrandfather, an aunt or uncle--who had to live with you because they \ncould not afford the price of health care; they could not afford the \nprice of a nursing home. That all changed, not because private health \ninsurance companies stepped up to the plate. It is because Medicare and \nMedicaid stepped up to the plate. And we are about to change that \nfundamentally. There are those who will say this is just a modest \ndemonstration program. No, this is the first step. The path has been \ncharted. The direction was declared years before. You just have to read \nthe book.\n  This bill fragments senior health care coverage. It does so along the \nlines of age and health. By giving incentives to HMOs, it will \nencourage them to enroll the youngest and healthiest seniors.\n  Here is how you make money as a health insurance company. First you \nget a large subsidy from the Federal Government. Then you carefully \nselect your risks so that they don't incur costs. That increases your \nprofits. That is what any of my colleagues would do if they were \ndirecting an HMO, that is what I would do, because their business is to \nprovide profits to their shareholders. That is what is going to happen. \nIt is not because suddenly they have thought of a much more efficient \nway to deliver services to seniors.\n  Frankly, the way they derive efficiencies is to ration health care. \nWe all know it because we have all heard the complaints from seniors \nand from doctors: They won't pay me for what I am doing. It takes me 6 \nor 7 months to get a bill through, and they give me 10 percent of what \nI claim as my true cost.\n  That is what the doctors tell me. They don't want to work with \nprivate insurers. They like Medicare. They like the fact that it is \npredictable. It pays them on time or certainly in a predictable range \nof time. That is not what HMOs do. They are in it for the money. That \nis the essence of what they do.\n  We think we can change the morbidity and the mortality rates of \nseniors and the costs associated with senior health care? We can't.\n  So what do we do? We give the HMO's subsidies, and then they will use \nthe subsidies and the leverage of this new law to seek out the \nhealthiest risk, and they will maximize their profits.\n  That is clear because Wall Street certainly has already voted on this \nbill. Pharmaceutical stocks are soaring; health insurance HMOs are \ndoing very well. That is what is happening.\n  What happens also is that we take these healthy seniors out of the \npool of traditional Medicare. Then what happens to the cost of \ntraditional Medicare? It goes up. We no longer have the 65-year-old or \n68-year-old marathon runners and triathletes. We have 85-\n\n[[Page S15541]]\n\nand 90-year-old frail elderly who need increased care. No insurance \ncompany is going to underwrite those people if they can avoid it, and \nthey can avoid it very easily. So the cost of traditional Medicare will \ngo up.\n  Then, of course, a year or two from now the people who say this is \nnot about privatization, this is about choice, will come in and say: \nLook how expensive Medicare is. The private sector is doing so much \nbetter. And we will see, I think, the inevitable erosion of traditional \nMedicare. The irony is that we already know traditional Medicare \ndelivers high quality at essentially a lower cost than an HMO.\n\n  A report by the trustees of Medicare this year estimated that \nreimbursements for HMO enrollees would exceed the average cost of \ntraditional Medicare. That makes sense. Medicare is not advertising on \nevery billboard in Rhode Island like the Plan 65 is. Medicare is not \nputting out glossy 25-page brochures describing its great programs, or \nadvertising on the radio for profit. Medicare doesn't have to run a \nmultimillion-dollar profit. Medicare is not paying a CEO of an HMO $26 \nmillion, or $9 million a year. It is obvious why they are running more \ncosts.\n  So, again, we know this already. We have Medicare+Choice. Every year, \nthey say ``we need greater reimbursement.'' Why are we then trying to \ntilt resources to induce private companies to come and do something \nthat seniors will say general traditional Medicare does just as well? \nIt is not about efficiency or a new innovative way of paying for health \ncare, it is about ideology and catering to special interests--that big \nsloppy kiss again to the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance \nindustry.\n  The Bush administration proposal, this proposal, divides seniors \nalong the lines of income. For the first time, we are using means \ntesting to determine how much someone must pay to participate in \nMedicare. Now, one could argue that if this was a last-ditch effort to \nsave traditional Medicare and you had to make sufficient financial \ncalls, you could consider means testing. But this is not about saving \nMedicare, this is about privatizing Medicare. This is about not saving \nthe system but essentially destroying the system. It creates this \nfragmentation along the lines of income. When you start seeing the \ncosts accumulate--when seniors start seeing those costs accumulate, a \nvery wealthy senior might say, I don't want to participate anymore, and \nthey will begin walking away from the system. That is not a lot of \npeople, but once you have a public program, and people say, I don't \nwant to participate any longer, and you see the income lines start \ndividing people it will undercut the support and the strength of the \nsystem.\n  I listened intently to my colleague from Texas say it is so unfair to \nhave the minimum wage workers pay as much as the very wealthy who pay \nin. I am someone who is pretty sympathetic to minimum-wage workers. \nUnlike many of my colleagues on the other side, I think we can increase \nthe minimum wage, and I think we can do that right now. They have \navoided a vote on that for months and months.\n  Let me tell you, you have to recognize that, through our tax system, \nthose upper income Americans are paying much more into the Medicare \nsystem during the course of their lifetime. But that is beside the \npoint. I think that is a footnote. The fundamental point is that this \nprogram has worked so well because it is a social insurance program, \nnot a welfare program. It is a program which every senior comes to, \nregardless of their health, age--other than meeting the 65-year-old \nthreshold--or their income. It is really a common ground. That has a \nvalue above and beyond simple accounting, or who is paying what and who \nis doing what. So this is another way the program is divided. Again, I \nbelieve this is the wrong approach.\n  Now, this whole proposal eliminates the stability, dependability, and \nreliability of the Medicare Program. It is unfortunate that this \nprocess was essentially hijacked behind closed doors. All of the \nconferees didn't even meet. Two of our colleagues on the Democratic \nside, Senators Baucus and Breaux, were admitted to the conference, but \nthere were others who were deliberately excluded, which is against, if \nnot the rules, the spirit of the Senate. I think that is wrong. This is \nnot a product of the free interchange between all interested parties, \nthis is simply a backroom deal. If they weren't willing to deal, they \ncould not get in the back room.\n  This legislation will affect all seniors. That is another reason we \nneed more time on this floor to debate this bill, explain the bill, to \nhave the opinions registered by seniors who are not dazzled at first by \nan attempt or a first glimpse of a drug benefit but by the underlying \nreality of the bill.\n\n  There is much to be criticized in the bill, but I believe there are \nthree general areas. First, when I was considering a drug benefit for \nseniors being attached to Medicare, I believed it had to meet three \ntests: affordability, accessibility to all beneficiaries, and uniform \ncoverage. This bill fails those tests miserably.\n  In terms of affordability, seniors will pay, over the next 10 years, \n$1.8 trillion for drugs--a staggering total. We began this debate with \n$400 billion over 10 years for Federal support--much too inadequate, I \nbelieve. We were stuck with that. But as I pointed out in previous \nremarks, we didn't use all the money in this bill to creatively and \ninnovatively help seniors buy drugs. It went to help the insurance \ncompanies and pharmaceutical companies.\n  We are beginning with a benefit scheme where a senior will have, \nfirst, a $250 deductible, roughly $35 a month premium; and if they do \nthat, and they pay the deductible and the premiums, 75 percent of their \ncost of drugs up to $2,250 will be absorbed by the Federal Government.\n  But these deductibles and premiums will increase each year. Our \nseniors should know that. In fact, by 2013, CBO estimates that \nbeneficiaries will be paying a $445 deductible and almost $60 a month \npremium, and a quarter of their drug costs will be deferred up to \n$4,000. So we are looking not at a fixed benefit for seniors over the \nnext 10 years, we are looking at increased premiums and deductibles.\n  I mentioned the donut hole before. Even paying these fees, this \ndoesn't provide for continuous coverage for our seniors for the drugs. \nThey will spend up to $2,250, and then they will get nothing. I would \nlike to be around in at least--perhaps if this bill passes--I hope it \ndoesn't--a few months or years because it doesn't really begin until \n2006--when our offices get flooded with calls saying: I just got a bill \nfor my premium this month, but I was informed that I will get no help \nwith drug costs, and I have to choose--not between eating or buying \ndrugs, but I have to choose between paying my premium or buying my \ndrugs. That will happen to seniors when they get in this donut hole, \nthis gap. That will be their choice.\n  I hope we are preparing good answers by saying: Oh, that is just the \nway it works. Keep paying your premium because if you don't, you will \nnever be able to qualify for help $2,000 or $3,000 down the road--after \nyou have spent that much more on drugs. It is a baffling system of \ninsurance.\n  It is interesting because I have heard so many people on the floor \ntalk about and say: We are just going to give the seniors what we have \nin the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. I can tell you, we don't \nhave a donut hole in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. We \ndon't reach a point at which our drug coverage stops, while we spend \nsome more money. No, we have what most insurance plans have; we have \ncontinuous coverage. Our deductibles and premiums might be different, \nbut we have continuous coverage. So this is nothing close to the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan.\n  It might be an interesting experiment--maybe our plan should be \nchanged. Maybe we should have this gap. Maybe we should experience the \nfact of paying premiums and not getting anything for them.\n  Again, this is one of the problems we have with the bill. When this \nbill passed the Senate, there was some good work--some. One of the \nareas where we had good work was in trying to cushion the blow for poor \npeople who could benefit from this drug bill. Specifically, the Senate \nbill had a section also for people at 160 percent of poverty. That has \nbeen pulled back to 150 percent of poverty--the threshold for low-\nincome assistance. It is estimated that because\n\n[[Page S15542]]\n\nof that change, over a million beneficiaries with annual incomes \nbetween $13,000 and $14,000, approximately, will lose out on their \nincome assistance. Now, an annual income of $14,000 might be a lot of \nmoney in some States, but in the Northeast it is very difficult to get \nby on that.\n  When you are paying $800 a month for an apartment--and, indeed, we \nare doing so poorly at providing affordable housing for our seniors \nthat more and more seniors are on the private market--if you are paying \n$800 to $1,000 a month for an apartment, that is about $10,000, $12,000 \na year. And you don't qualify for this benefit? This is protection for \nlow income seniors?\n  Millions more will be further disqualified by the imposition of an \nasset test. I must say, I voted against the Senate version of this bill \nfor many other reasons. But, there were some commendable elements in \nthat proposal. One was the elimination of the asset test. The asset \ntest is back. That means if your income is below 135 percent of poverty \nand you have assets over $6,000, you will be disqualified for low-\nincome assistance.\n  Let me put it in the vernacular. Assets over $6,000: If you have a \nFord Escort, it is probably worth maybe $6,000. Certainly, if you own a \nCrown Victoria, it is $6,000. So let's tell the seniors right now, if \nthey can afford to have a car or a little bit of savings, they are \ndisqualified from the income protections for low-income seniors because \nof this asset test. That I think is wrong.\n  There is another aspect to this bill that has been much discussed and \ndebated, and that is what are we going to do with dual eligibles, those \nindividuals who qualify for Medicaid but also, because of age or \ndisability, are in the Medicare system. There is a lot of discussion \nabout the success of this bill dealing with dual eligibles, making sure \nthey are protected. Frankly, I think the protections are ephemeral.\n  First, the States are not actually relieved of their fiduciary \nresponsibility for these dual eligibles. The Governors all want the \nMedicare system to go in and say: You are going to take care of these \npeople; they are Medicare individuals now with a drug benefit. \nEffectively what we have done is something called a clawback, I \nbelieve, which requires the States to keep paying forever.\n  More than that, I am told, is that before, the Medicaid systems in \nthe State could negotiate better drug prices, and now I believe they \nare subject to whatever the traffic will bear in terms of prices \nestablished by this bill. And there is no cost containment on the drug \ncompanies. There are cost containments on what we can spend for \nseniors, but not on what the drug companies can charge. That is another \nreal major problem with this bill.\n  When I go up to Rhode Island and talk about cost containment, what \nseniors say to me is: Hallelujah, you are finally going to be able to \nconstrain these accelerating prices from drug companies. You are \nfinally going to be able to do what we all want you to do--use the \nmarket creatively, not price controls but market force to get these \nprices down. No, because this bill essentially prevents Medicare from \nnegotiating for drug prices effectively against the drug industry. That \nis why, again, it is a ``big sloppy kiss'' to the insurance industry \nand to the drug industry because they have their way. There will be no \nmarket power. There will be no Medicare with approximately 41 million \nbeneficiaries saying: Give us your best price, drug companies. It is \nfragmented by region, by private entities. It is fragmented \ndeliberately so there is no market power.\n  For those people who preach on and on about the power of the market, \nthat we have to get away from all this command-and-control economic \npolicy, they walked away from using the market creatively to deal with \nthe No. 1 issue that has driven this whole debate: the ever-increasing \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  It is not an accident because the people who wrote this plan and the \nbiggest beneficiaries of this plan are those in the drug industry.\n  There is another aspect of this whole issue of the States and \nMedicaid. We have prohibited the States from using Medicaid money to \nhelp address these increased drug costs. We have essentially said: You \ncan't use Medicaid money for that. Again, this is not only something \nthat is unfortunate, but it puts tremendous strain on the States.\n  It has been estimated that my State, over the next 10 years or so, \ncould be paying up to $500 million to the Federal Government in this \nclawback. I hope my Governor is aware of that. I am going to make him \naware of that because the states had always expected that the federal \ngovernment would pay these costs if a Medicare drug benefit was \ncreated.\n\n  There is another issue. Because of the ambiguity of some of the \nlanguage, it is unclear what happens to individuals in the TriCare \nProgram and individuals who are in the Veterans Administration program. \nWhat happens to their drug coverage? Are they displaced? That remains \nto be seen.\n  Also, in terms of the approach to Medicare, as I said several times \nover, it is just not adding a pharmaceutical benefit. That is what \nseniors want many of us to do; create a Part D in Medicare, a \npharmaceutical benefits with rules, with fair costs, and with \nprotections. The overall effect to the Medicare Program is we are \nraising Part B from $100 to $110 in 2005, and then indexing it to \nexpenditures in future years. We know that is going to keep going up, \nand some of the fastest growing costs in the country are health care \nexpenditures.\n  By contrast, the Social Security benefits are tied to increase in the \nConsumer Price Index. Here is what is going to happen to seniors: The \nSocial Security check goes up, a very modest figure because of the CPI \nindexing, and the part B goes up like a rocket because it is tied \nexclusively to the health care expenditures. In a way, it could lead to \nthe point where Part B is more and more expensive and less and less \nattractive to seniors.\n  Again, with the means test, with deductibles, all those things, we \ncould find initially wealthy seniors leaving the system, and that \nerosion could spread.\n  There is another aspect to this, too, and that is access to home \nhealth services. Again, there was a proposal initially to put on a \ncopay, a co-fee, for home health care. That was defeated. I see my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Collins, in the Chamber. She led the \nfight to see that was protected and did it admirably and graciously, as \nalways.\n  What I am reading in this bill is that we are reducing reimbursement \nrates for home health care providers by an estimated $6.5 billion over \nthe next 10 years. We already know the home health care industry took a \nsignificant cut in the Balanced Budget Act. In fact, many were pushed \nto the brink of bankruptcy, some beyond and failed and closed their \ndoors.\n  Now they have to adjust to a $6.5 billion reimbursement reduction \nover the next 10 years. Once again, why didn't we take some of this \nmoney going to the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry \nand keep the home health care industry strong and vibrant? We all know \nit is a much more efficient way to treat seniors, more so than having \nthem traipse to the emergency room, then having them go home without \nhome health care, and then come back a week later.\n  Frankly, in my view, that is what made traditional Medicare a very \nattractive program. We have ransacked many of the aspects of \ntraditional Medicare to fund this experiment, this demonstration in \nprivatization.\n  Another general topic of concern is the accessibility issues. There \nis a complicated scheme now that says we are not going to let Medicare \nrun a drug program unless, of course, there are no private vendors. \nWhen it left the Senate, the fallback would begin to operate--i.e., a \nFederal program--a Medicare Program for drug provisions would operate \nwhen two drug-only plans were not available in the market. That has \nbeen changed. Now, it is a drug-only or another private plan. So \nessentially we are doing all we can to keep Medicare from running this \ndrug plan, not because of efficiency, not because of anything except \nspecial interest politics and an erroneous ideological commitment to \nuse the private market anytime, even when the market and the market for \nsenior health care is not, without major subsidies, conducive to \nprivate plans.\n  If it was, why did we have to create Medicare in 1965? Because no \ninsurance company will voluntarily enroll sick, elderly people unless \nthey are highly\n\n[[Page S15543]]\n\nsubsidized. We did it not because we had a profit motive but because \nthe American people decided in 1965 that this society would be more \ndecent, stronger, and the fabric of this country would be better if we \ndevoted public resources to help seniors with their health care needs.\n  The other aspect of this, which time and again is repeated, is why do \nwe need a $12 billion slush fund to do what we think private health \ninsurance companies will do anyway? Because we do not believe they will \ndo it anyway. We know they will not. We have to give them lots of money \nto participate. Why can we not use that money to strengthen traditional \nMedicare? Why can we not use that money to decrease the gap in \ncoverage? Why can we not use that money to provide further \nreimbursement to home health care, which we know is an efficient, \nvaluable program? This does not make sense to me on simple grounds of \neconomic efficiency, but it does have a certain logic if one is \nrewarding their friends and appealing to ideological concerns.\n  There is another important aspect, too, and that is the fact that we \nhave seniors, retirees, already with health care and drug benefits \nthrough their employers. Two point seven million of these retirees are \nin danger of losing those benefits.\n  There have been attempts in this legislation that comes before us to \nbring that gap down. In fact, it was estimated that there were about 4 \nmillion retirees who would lose their benefits under previous versions \nof this legislation. That has been reduced, but 2.7 million Americans--\nat least 9,000 Rhode Islanders--are likely to lose better private drug \nbenefits that they have today because of this proposal.\n  I can guarantee my colleagues, we will hear from every one of those \n2.7 million retirees--the at least 9,000 in Rhode Island--because that \nis not what they thought Congress was doing when it was debating a drug \nbenefit.\n  As I mentioned before, not only does this approach fragment the \nhealthy and young seniors from the older and sicker seniors based upon \nthe cherry-picking of the insurance industry--which they will do--it \nalso fragments them in terms of income because of the nature of this \nmeans testing. It might not happen right away, but anyone who is under \nany illusion that we are setting in concrete this proposal right now \nhas not been here long enough.\n  I can imagine, my colleagues can imagine, with every reconciliation \nbill--and for those who are not devotees of the parliamentary musings \nevery year when we come and have a special procedure where there is no \nfilibuster, it is just 50 or 51 votes--we find all sorts of interesting \nprovisions in that bill. We all stand up and say, oh, that is terrible, \nbut I have to vote for it because it is the budget.\n  What we will find is this means testing will become broader because \nthe principle has been established. What we will find is these \ndemonstration programs for privatization will become larger.\n  Let me talk about this demonstration program. It allows for \ndemonstration projects to be established in six metropolitan \nstatistical areas where there is a 25-percent private plan \nparticipation. Presently, there are 41 MSAs around the country that \nmeet this test, including most of my State of Rhode Island, as well as \nborder communities in Massachusetts. It is estimated that almost 7 \nmillion seniors and disabled beneficiaries, one in six Medicare \nbeneficiaries, could find themselves subject to this privatization \nexperiment. That is a heck of a demonstration project, 7 million \npeople.\n  As I mentioned before, what are we demonstrating? We have had \nMedicare+Choice for a while. We know the problems. We know that seniors \nwill go into it. In fact, in my home State of Rhode Island we have \nabout 30 percent who have gone into these managed care plans. They went \nin originally because of the offer of pharmaceuticals and drugs. Every \nyear we get complaints when they change the plan, when they raise the \ncopays, when they do all of these things. We know how it is going to \nwork and we also know that we have to pay more and more each year to \nsubsidize these private plans to participate. As a result, we are going \nto see tremendous erosion. Seven million seniors could be affected.\n\n  What does this mean in terms of their coverage as they look at the \ncompeting plans? According to the office of the actuaries at CMS, \nbeneficiaries could pay up to 5 and 25 percent more to remain in \ntraditional Medicare in areas where these demonstration projects are \ngoing on. However, the proposal at least caps that increase at 5 \npercent. Why would premiums go up? Let me go back to two basic points. \nWe are subsidizing the private plan and then they are out carefully \nselecting to minimize their risks. They do not have to do it by \noffering inducements. They can put signs up at the health club, go to \nthese 5K races and hand out brochures. They will not go into \nneighborhoods with high rates of disease. They will not go into senior \ncenters in low-income areas where people have the kind of health issues \nassociated with having earned a low income all of their lives. They \nwill not do that. They will go to the country clubs, to the affluent \nsuburbs, and sign everybody up. Then we will subsidize it.\n  So when one is a senior trying to make a choice between traditional \nMedicare and this new plan, well, if they have to pay even 5 percent \nmore, that might make them choose the new plan--not because they have \nbetter quality, not because they maintain their doctor, not because of \nany substantive reason, but simply because it is a little cheaper, in \nthe beginning. Then a year later, when they discover it is a little \nmore expensive, and 2 years later as Medicare continues to decline, the \noptions start evaporating.\n  So, again, this proposal is not only dangerous but unnecessary. We \ncould have simply done what many Americans think we are doing, create a \nMedicare drug benefit.\n  So I believe we can do much better. We should do much better. We have \nthe time to do much better. Anyone who is saying that we cannot spend 2 \nweeks or 2 months continuing to discuss this bill, I think is putting \nan undue premium on enjoying the holiday over the health care of \nseniors and the structure of our health care for seniors that has been \nin place for more than 35 years.\n  I hope that rather than beginning the path of privatization of \nMedicare, providing an inadequate benefit not only because we started \nout with insufficient funds, but then diverting those funds to take \ncare of the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry, that we \nwould go back to principles and try to create, under the $400 billion \ncap, a program that would work for seniors. I hope we can do that, and \nI hope we can continue this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senate will soon have an historic \nopportunity to pass landmark legislation to make affordable \nprescription drug coverage available to all of our Nation's seniors, as \nwell as to people with disabilities who receive Medicare benefits. This \nlegislation, which represents the largest expansion of Medicare in the \nprogram's 38-year history, is long overdue, and it deserves our \nsupport. Prescription drugs are as important to the health of our \nseniors today as a hospital bed was back in 1965 when the Medicare \nProgram was first created.\n  I have long been a supporter of providing a prescription drug benefit \nas part of an effort to strengthen the Medicare Program, and I believe \nthat were prescription drugs as important back in the 1960s as they are \ntoday the creators of the Medicare Program undoubtedly would have \nprovided for that coverage. But back then the focus was on covering \nhospitalization.\n\n  While I continue to have reservations about some of the conference \nagreement's provisions, we simply cannot allow the perfect to become \nthe enemy of the good. This historic opportunity may never come again, \nand we cannot afford to let it pass. We cannot allow yet another year \nto go by without taking action to help our seniors with the soaring \ncost of prescription drugs. Millions of older Americans and their \nfamilies will be helped by this legislation. Millions more will be \nhelped in the future. I, therefore, will cast my vote in favor of the \nconference report, and I want to take a moment to commend the majority \nleader, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Breaux and, indeed, all of the conferees who \nhave worked so hard to craft a compromise and to bring this bill before \nus.\n\n[[Page S15544]]\n\n  With recent advances in research, prescription drugs can literally be \na lifeline for many patients. They reduce the need to treat serious \nillness through hospitalization and surgery. They allow our seniors to \nlive longer, healthier, happier lives. Soaring prescription drug costs, \nhowever, have placed a tremendous financial burden on millions of our \ndisabled citizens and senior citizens who must pay the full retail \nprice for these essential drugs out of their pockets. Monthly drug \nbills of $300 or even $400 or even more dollars per month are not at \nall uncommon for older Mainers living on very limited incomes.\n  Lorraine White, of Winthrop, ME, wrote to tell me that she and her \nhusband spend about $400 each month on vital prescription drugs. They \nlive on limited income and they have had to draw down their savings to \nmake ends meet. They wonder what they are going to do when their \nsavings are depleted.\n  Time and again, seniors in Maine have come up to me to tell me they \nsimply cannot afford the essential prescription drugs their physicians \nhave prescribed. I remember an elderly woman coming up to me in a \ngrocery store in Bangor and telling me she could only get 12 of the 36 \npills for which her doctor had written a prescription. None of our \nseniors should be faced with those kinds of decisions. They should not \nbe choosing between paying their bills and buying the pills that they \nneed to stay healthy.\n  The legislation that is before us today will make affordable \nprescription drug coverage available to seniors such as the Whites, \nlike so many seniors with whom I have talked in Maine, and it will \nprotect them from these high out-of-pocket costs that are such a \nburden.\n  Under this legislation, the Whites' drug costs would be cut by more \nthan half, and the savings would be even greater for this couple if \nthey qualify for the low-income subsidies provided under this \nlegislation.\n  The legislation before us today makes prescription drug coverage a \npermanent part of the Medicare Program, and it provides a benefit that \nwill be available to all seniors and disabled individuals on Medicare, \nregardless of where they live.\n  It is also crafted in a way that, if a senior citizen is very happy \nwith their health care insurance, the drug coverage that that senior \nalready has, he or she does not have to take this additional benefit \nunder the Medicare Program. It is a voluntary benefit.\n  Beginning in 2006, all seniors will be eligible to get both upfront \nand catastrophic protection for an average premium of $35 a month. \nMoreover, low-income seniors, those who are most burdened with the high \ncost of prescription drugs, will receive generous subsidies and get \nadditional protections. The more than 12 million older and disabled \nAmericans nationwide, including 75,000 Mainers, with incomes below 135 \npercent of poverty will not have to pay any premiums at all to secure \ncomprehensive prescription drug coverage, and they will have only \nminimal cost sharing. An additional 18,500 low-income Mainers will \nqualify for reduced premiums, lower deductibles, and coinsurance rates, \nand no gaps in coverage.\n\n  The senior Senator from Maine spoke earlier today about this \nlegislation, and I agree wholeheartedly with her contention that our \nMedicare beneficiaries will, indeed, be far better off once this \nlegislation is signed into law. Clearly, we are providing meaningful \nand realistic help to our seniors, particularly those who are \nstruggling the most--low-income seniors and those with very high drug \ncosts.\n  The one drawback that I see in the way this benefit is structured, \nthat I want to discuss right now, is that, unfortunately, it takes time \nfor this new benefit to come on line. I fear many of our seniors \nbelieve this benefit is going to be available immediately and, \nunfortunately, that is not the case. But there is still help, immediate \nhelp, in this bill for our seniors. To provide some interim assistance, \nstarting next year seniors will receive discount cards that will save \nthem between 15 and 25 percent on each prescription drug purchase. \nMoreover, low-income beneficiaries will receive a $600 credit on that \ncard, in both 2004 and 2005, that they can apply to the purchase of \ntheir drugs. This subsidy in conjunction with the discount card will \ngive our most vulnerable seniors immediate assistance in purchasing \ndrugs that they otherwise might not be able to afford.\n  In addition to the prescription drug benefit, there are other \nsignificant features in this bill that I strongly support. For example, \nthe bill takes major steps to make Medicare payments more equitable. \nThis is an issue I have been working on since my first year in the \nSenate. The bill tracks very closely legislation that Senator Feingold \nand I introduced earlier this year.\n  Medicare's reimbursement systems have historically tended to favor \nlarge urban areas and failed to take into account the special needs of \nrural States. This simply is not fair. Ironically, in Maine the low \npayment rates are also the result of the State's long history of \nproviding high-quality, cost-effective care.\n  In the early 1980s, Maine's lower than average costs were used to \njustify lower payment rates to doctors and hospitals. Since then, \nMedicare's payment policies have only served to widen the gap between \nlow-cost and high-cost States. I am, therefore, particularly pleased \nthat the chairman of the Finance Committee worked so hard to include in \nthe conference report significant steps to strengthen the health care \nsafety net by increasing Medicare payments to physicians and hospitals \nin rural States such as Maine.\n  According to the American Hospital Association, these provisions will \nincrease Medicare payments to Maine's rural hospitals by more than $125 \nmillion in the next 10 years.\n  Moreover, they will increase payments to physicians in Maine by an \nestimated $7 million a year.\n  I can't tell you how important these rural provisions are to my \nState. Maine ranks near the bottom in the rate of Medicare \nreimbursement despite the cost of survival care in my State and despite \nthe fact that the providers in Maine give very high quality care. This \ninequity has only worsened as additional payments under the Medicare \nsystem have gone to large urban hospitals.\n  I am very pleased that the rural health care package will help \nrelieve some of the stress on our rural hospitals which are so \nimportant to rural States such as Maine. It will help ensure that there \nis more equity in the Medicare reimbursement system.\n  I also include a special thanks to the conferees for including a \nprovision at my request that will ensure continued Medicare graduate \nmedical education funding for Maine's family residency programs. These \nfamily practice residency programs are absolutely essential in training \nphysicians who tend to stay in Maine and serve. They practice in \nunderserved areas of the State.\n  I am also pleased that the legislation restores the rural add-on; \nthat is, the enhanced reimbursement for Medicare home health payments \nthat is vital to sustaining home health care in the rural areas of our \ncountry.\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Missouri, and I have worked \nvery hard over the years to sustain and revitalize home health care. We \nare well aware that many of our elderly citizens would prefer to \nreceive the health care they need in the privacy and security of their \nown home. But Medicare reimbursement rates, particularly in rural \nareas, have been so lacking that that home health care has been in \njeopardy. I wish the bill went further. I think we should have had a \n10-percent rural add-on in order to compensate for the additional costs \nin terms of travel time, long distances between patients, and other \nfactors that come into play when home health care is provided to \nseniors and disabled citizens in rural areas.\n  In fact, surveys have shown that the delivery of home health services \nin rural areas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly. But \ncertainly the extension of a 5-percent rural add-on is a major step in \nthe right direction.\n  I am also very relieved that the conferees rejected an ill-advised \nproposal to have our seniors have a copay for the cost of home health \ncare. I am convinced that had that been included in this package and \nsigned into law, it would have discouraged many of our most vulnerable \nsick seniors from getting the home health care they need. The conferees \nmade a wise decision, indeed, in dropping that provision which was \nincluded in the House version of this bill.\n\n[[Page S15545]]\n\n  The conference report will also make prescription drugs more \naffordable for all consumers by closing loopholes in our patent laws \nthat some of the large brand name pharmaceutical companies have \nexploited in order to delay consumers access to lower priced generic \ndrugs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, these provisions \nwill help to reduce our Nation's drug costs by some $60 billion over \nthe next decade.\n  I am very pleased to have played a role in drafting this legislation \nwith leaders on the bill--Senator Schumer, Senator McCain, Senator \nEdwards, and Senator Gregg. All of us worked very hard to bring this \nabout. This is a really significant provision. It is going to help \nreduce the cost of drugs in State Medicaid programs. It will help to \ncontrol the cost of drugs in the Medicare Program as we are adding this \nbenefit. It will help uninsured individuals because it will lower the \ncost of drugs for them. It will help employers who are providing \nprescription drug coverage as part of a health insurance plan. This is \na very important provision and one I advocated very strongly to be \nincluded in this conference report.\n\n  In addition, the conference report includes the provision which I \noffered, and which the Presiding Officer cosponsored, to the Senate \nbill to establish a pilot program to help modernize the outdated \n``homebound'' definition that has impeded access to needed home health \nservices for many of our elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I know that when we start talking about the definition of \n``homebound'' in the Medicare Act it may sound esoteric, but in fact it \nis vitally important for so many disabled and elderly citizens who, \nbecause of the interpretation of the law by some of the fiscal \nintermediaries in the Medicare Program, have literally become prisoners \nin their own homes fearful of leaving in that they will jeopardize \ntheir ability to continue to receive essential home health care.\n  I particularly thank David Jayne, the courageous advocate who \ninspired this legislation, a truly heroic individual, and also Senator \nBob Dole who has been such an outstanding advocate for disabled \nAmericans for so many years. They worked very hard to ensure that this \nprovision was retained in the final version of the bill.\n  Overlooked in much of the discussion of this Medicare bill are other \nvery important provisions that will provide better coordinated care for \nseniors with chronic conditions such as diabetes. As the cochair, along \nwith Senator Breaux and the founder of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I \nbelieve these provisions will greatly improve the quality of care for \nindividuals suffering from diabetes. I am very pleased that these \nprovisions have been included in this bill.\n  I have talked now at some length about the many provisions in this \nconference report that I strongly support. I do, however, have \nreservations about other provisions.\n  The House bill included provisions based on a premium support model \nthat would have called for direct competition between private plans and \ntraditional Medicare. I have serious concerns about the implications of \nthis proposal, particularly that it could result in driving up premiums \nin the traditional Medicare Program. That would be particularly \nproblematic in a rural State such as Maine where seniors are not likely \nto have a host of insurance companies competing for their business \nbecause of the small size of the market.\n  Moreover, the House bill could have resulted in sharply different \npremiums for seniors in different parts of the country and even within \na single State. Those health provisions really troubled me because I \ndid not think that a senior living in Fort Kent, ME, should be paying a \ndifferent rate for the same coverage as a senior who is living in San \nFrancisco, CA. I therefore joined a number of my colleagues in sending \na letter to the majority leader expressing concern about the inclusion \nof this controversial policy in the Medicare bill.\n  The final bill, while it still causes me a lot of concerns in this \narea, is different from what was in the original House proposal. The \noriginal proposal was significantly downsized to a limited pilot \nproject that would not begin until the year 2010 and that would provide \nsignificant protections for those seniors who are remaining in the \ntraditional Medicare Program.\n\n  While I continue to have reservations about even the demonstration \nproject, I urge my colleagues to look at the package as a whole. I \nagree with the AARP and the National Council on the Aging that its \nstrengths clearly outweigh its weaknesses. When I hear some say that \nsomehow this legislation spells the end of the traditional Medicare \nProgram, I know that is not true. I know it is not true because I have \ncarefully studied this bill. I also am convinced it is not true because \nthe AARP, the Nation's largest seniors organization, would never \nendorse a bill that spelled the end of the Medicare Program. That is \njust not conceivable.\n  This conference report represents the last real hope of getting an \naffordable Medicare prescription drug benefit anytime in the \nforeseeable future. Our seniors have already waited too long for this \nbenefit. We cannot delay; we cannot continue to push this issue off to \nthe future. Since the cost of providing a meaningful drug benefit will \nonly increase as time passes, it is imperative we act now. Our seniors \nhave waited too long for this coverage. We cannot push this off another \nyear, another month, another week. Let's act now. Let's not let the \nperfect be the enemy of the good.\n  This package is worth supporting despite its flaws. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in voting yes on the conference agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GRASSLEY). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBarbara Boxer be the next Democrat to speak after Senator Harkin, who I \nbelieve is the last person at the moment we have unanimous consent for \nin terms of speaking order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is interesting to listen to the \ndebate with colleagues today on both sides of the aisle concerning this \nlegislation. To hear the discussion from the other side of the aisle, \nthere would be no reason at all to oppose the bill; there would be no \nreason at all, last night, to have to hold the voting boards open for 3 \nhours to twist arms to be able to change votes, to be able to get the \nvotes to actually pass the bill; there would be no reason that \noverwhelmingly Members on the Democratic side of the House and the \nSenate who crafted and led the creation of Medicare would be opposed to \nthis bill.\n  On its surface, what is happening makes no sense if, in fact, this is \na good bill for seniors. There is no way, if this were a good bill for \nseniors and for the disabled in this country, that I would be standing \nhere opposing it. There is no way my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives--some of whom were there when Medicare was passed, some \nof whom have championed health care and senior citizen services for \ndecades--would have stood on the House floor and voted no if it was \ngood for seniors and for the disabled.\n  On its face, that makes no sense.\n  For those who have worked for years on this issue, Mr. President, \nI actually came into public service over 25 years ago; I often joke \nthat I was 5 at the time--I came into public service over the issue of \nsenior health care in Michigan. That is what brought me into public \nservice. Since that time, I have worked very hard to continue to \nimprove services, access to care, expand home health care, to be able \nto modernize health care as we have changed with new technology, new \nmedicines, and new opportunities. I was very pleased that the first \nbill I introduced coming to the Senate was a bill to lower prescription \ndrug prices by allowing our local pharmacist to do business across the \nborder in Canada and other States to lower prices. So I care very \ndeeply about this issue.\n\n  Nothing would please me more than to be able to stand here today and \ndeclare a victory for our seniors and a victory for all Members because \nwe have finally done the right thing. Seniors have waited too long, \nthere is no question. They have waited way too long.\n  Unfortunately, under this plan, they are still waiting. Not only will \nan awful lot of people continue to wait, some of them will find instead \nof a step\n\n[[Page S15546]]\n\nforward--which we all would like this to be--a step forward that I \nsupported with the Senate bill, even though it was not all that I \nwanted it to be, but it was a bipartisan bill. It was truly a step \nforward. I supported it as something we could build on. Instead of this \nbeing a step forward for seniors, for too many it is a step off the \ncliff.\n  Let's look at what we are talking about, just the facts. For someone \nwho is putting out $5,100 worth of prescription drugs in a year--which, \nunfortunately, is not a high amount given what people are having to pay \nfor prescription drugs--if they are paying $5,100 for prescription \ndrugs, they would have to have out of pocket under this bill $4,020 of \nthat $5,100. They would still pay $4,020 for that $5,100.\n  Some would say--and I respect that--Well, at least it is something. \nIt may not be much, but at least it is something. The question is, What \nare you giving up to get that less than $1,100 in help when you have a \n$5,100 drug bill? The first thing, you may be giving up your coverage \naltogether to get that benefit. Estimates are that 2.7 million retirees \nwill lose their coverage as a result of this bill. That is about one \nout of four people in Michigan.\n  Some would say: Well, 75 percent will not lose coverage. That is \ngreat, if you are one of the 75 percent. But what if you are one of the \n25 percent of folks who worked all their life, probably along the way \ngave up some pay raises to get a good health care benefit, may have \nmade a number of tradeoffs to make sure in your retirement you and your \nfamily had quality health care?\n  To get a very meager amount of money for prescription drug help, one \nout of four folks will lose their benefits. We do not have to do that \nunder a bill we passed when there was a Democratic majority in this \nSenate. That bill was brought forward under Senator Bob Graham's \nleadership and sponsorship. I was pleased to be a cosponsor. We had a \nbill where nobody lost their coverage. We do not have to write a bill \nwhere 25 percent of the retirees lose their private insurance coverage. \nIt is all in how it is designed.\n  This is designed in a way to give incentives, unfortunately, for some \nemployers to drop their coverage--not everyone, but if you are that \nfourth person when it is one out of four, that is 100 percent of \nyou, 100 percent of your coverage and your family's coverage. So for \nthose folks, this is not a good deal.\n\n  Well, let's look at some more. Who else isn't it a good deal for? \nWell, we are told that about 6.4 million people are low-income seniors \nwho will have less access to the drugs they need, and possibly pay \nmore. These are folks who are the poorest of the poor seniors. These \nare the folks who really are sitting down tonight at the kitchen table \nand deciding, do they eat or do they get their medicine?\n  This is not some platitude, some rhetoric. This is real for people \nwhere a dollar or two-dollar or five-dollar copay on a prescription \nmakes the difference between eating, paying their electric bill, or \nhaving a roof over their head.\n  We understand from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that \nmany of these 6.4 million low-income and disabled Medicare \nbeneficiaries would pay more for their prescription drugs, possibly \nmuch more because they would be moved from Medicaid for low-income \nseniors--where many only have a one-dollar copay for their \nprescriptions--to a system where they would be paying more. In addition \nto that, there are certain drugs now that seniors need or the disabled \nneed that they receive under Medicaid that may not be available under \nthe private insurance plans.\n  So when they move this system to private plans, which is the intent \nas much as possible--where there is one or more private insurance \nplans, plus an HMO or PPO--when they move in that direction, they \npossibly limit the prescription drug choices of our seniors.\n  So under this bill, if you have folks who have a bill of $5,100, they \nstill pay $4,020 of it. On top of that, they may be one of the folks \nwho loses all of their benefits. And they may be one of the folks who \nactually ends up paying more and having less choice about the \nprescriptions they will receive.\n  On top of that, what do folks get? Well, they get the pleasure of \nknowing there is no new competition put in this bill to lower prices. \nThere, in fact, is language which is stunning to me, absolutely \nstunning, that prohibits Medicare from bulk purchasing, group \npurchasing, and negotiating on behalf of all Medicare beneficiaries to \nlower prices.\n  So no wonder the pharmaceutical lobbyists are thrilled. I have spent \na lot of time on this floor talking about how there are at least six \ndrug company lobbyists for every one Member of the Senate. They earned \ntheir pay in this bill, that is for sure. I am sure they are high-\nfiving it all the way to the bank because what has been done in this \nbill is lock in a whole new group of customers, millions--39 million \ncustomers potentially--locked in at the highest possible prices. That \nis what we get.\n  So on top of continuing to get very little prescription drug \nbenefit--and you could pay more; you could lose your coverage, but you \nmight get some; you might get $1,000 out of about a $5,000 drug bill--\nbut you are hooked into the highest prices because of the inability to \nnegotiate as broadly as possible to lower prices, the inability to go \nto Canada.\n  For Michigan that is a pretty big deal. That is 5 minutes across the \nbridge and the tunnel, and you can drop the prices in half--or 60 \npercent or 70 percent. We have, for years, been saying: Let the local \npharmacists be able to do business to bring back safe FDA-approved \ndrugs, with a closed supply chain so all the safety is there, to bring \nthem back to the local pharmacies just as the drug companies do every \nsingle day. We are not talking about mail order. We are not talking \nabout the Internet. We are talking about licensed pharmacists bringing \nback lower priced drugs, many of which we have helped to pay to make, \nto the local drugstores to lower prices.\n\n  So we are not seeing that. We are not going to see that in this bill. \nThe prohibition continues. We are not going to see a strong bill to \nclose patent loopholes, to be able to allow more generic drugs on the \nmarket to increase competition. There is some language, but it has been \nweakened. We actually have in the bill a prohibition on Medicare using \ntheir clout to lower prices.\n  The VA uses its clout for our veterans, and we do not pay retail for \nour veterans for prescription drugs. We get a 30- to 40-percent \ndiscount because, on behalf of the veterans, we use our clout, through \nthe VA and the Federal Government, to negotiate a group price.\n  Well, the drug companies do not want that. I understand that. Their \nsole mission is to make sure their profits and their prices stay as \nhigh as possible, that they stop any competition and keep the prices \nhigh. I understand that. That is not our job. That is not our job. The \nseniors in this country, the families, the workers, the businesses that \nwould benefit by more competition to lower prices--the taxpayers expect \nus to be fighting for them. When I look at this bill, it is shocking \nthe extent to which that is not the case.\n  So we have a situation where one out of four people could lose their \ncoverage. In a State such as mine, where we have a lot of retirees who \nhave good benefits, this is a big deal. We have very low-income \nseniors, the poorest of the poor, living on Social Security, with no \npension, trying to make it. They could pay more. Many of them will pay \nmore. And we have everybody locking in to these high prices so that \nmore and more we will see the Medicare dollars--the precious dollars we \nhave--going for those high prices rather than helping more people on \nMedicare.\n  Then, to add insult to injury, in 2010--which is not that far away, \nmuch as we would like to think it is; basically, 6 years away or so, 7 \nyears--this plan opens up a Pandora's box. It allows the beginning to \nexperiment with privatizing Medicare.\n  It says--even though when folks, who had a choice between picking a \nprivate plan and traditional Medicare, 89 percent of them said, I like \nmy Medicare, I am going to stay right where I am, only 11 percent \npicked private plans--even though that is the case, this bill now moves \nto put more people in the 11 percent.\n  This bill even says: We are going to take precious money from \nMedicare and give it to HMOs and insurance companies and we are going \nto actually\n\n[[Page S15547]]\n\npay them so they can compete with traditional Medicare. We are going to \npay them more. We are going to spend more over here to get people over \nhere.\n  Now, that would not seem to make sense if you are trying to look at \nthe fact, as many have lamented, that we have a financial crisis with \nMedicare. We have a concern about not enough dollars under Medicare. \nWhy would we set up a system that would cost more rather than less? Why \nwould we set up a system that people have said they do not want? That \ndoes not make any sense, either.\n  This, starting in 2010, begins the process. It is called a pilot, but \nit begins a process where--instead of being in this column, where you \ncan pick your own doctor and you know what you are going to pay, and \nyou know what the copay is, and you know what the premium is; it does \nnot matter where you live, you can have access to Medicare; in Michigan \nyou can be up in Iron Mountain or Marquette or Houghton or Escanaba or \nSault Sainte Marie in the upper peninsula or in northern Michigan or \nDetroit or Three Rivers or Lansing or Grand Rapids; you know you have \nMedicare; you know you can go to the doctor of your choice, the \nhospital of your choice; and you have health care coverage--now what \nthey are putting in place, starting in 2010, is a system where the \nfolks who look at analyzing this have said, for those who go into this \nprivatizing process, you would be given, essentially, a defined \ncontribution instead of a defined benefit.\n  You would be given what some call a voucher, some call it a \ncontribution, X amount of money that you could then purchase between a \nprivate plan, an HMO, or traditional Medicare. It would begin to \ndiffuse and pull people out into different kinds of plans. Some people \nhave asked: What is wrong with that?\n  Unfortunately, what happens is that if you are healthy, you are a \nyounger senior, you are going to get a better rate going to a private \ninsurance company or into an HMO. So you may go in that direction. And \ngradually what happens is that they all have different rates, different \ncosts, cover different things, cover different doctors. In some, you \nhave your own doctor; in some, you can't have your own doctor.\n  What happens with traditional Medicare? Those who are the sickest, \nthe most elderly, the most disabled, who can't get a good rate outside \nof traditional Medicare, will stay. The experts tell us the cost of \nMedicare will go up; because there are sicker, older, more disabled \npeople here, and we are going to see increases. It has been estimated \nthere will be a 25-percent increase over time in those costs.\n  What happens in the long run in that system? Gradually Medicare will \nhave more and more costs, fewer and fewer people, and we will have what \nNewt Gingrich said he was hoping would happen or he expected to happen; \nthat is, Medicare will wither on the vine.\n  It will take a few years. We can say: We are not going to be around \nthen. It doesn't matter to me.\n  But what we vote on in the next couple days will begin a process that \nwill unravel what has been one of the greatest American success stories \never--Medicare. That is what we are seeing happen here. Someone like \nmyself, who cares so deeply about Medicare, who cares so deeply about \nproviding prescription drug coverage and lowering prices, has to say, \nno way, no way will I support this.\n  I understand that there is a major philosophical difference--I \nrespect that--between those who never supported Medicare, who view it \nas a big government program. I know that. I know that when Medicare \noriginally passed, there were only 12 Republicans who supported it. \nThere is a big philosophical difference.\n  I say Medicare is a big success story, so is Social Security. Other \ncolleagues say: Big government program, it needs to be privatized or \neliminated. Let folks go to the private sector. Let them buy insurance.\n  Prior to Medicare, half the seniors couldn't find or afford health \ninsurance. They couldn't find it or afford it. Ask folks today, ask a \nsmall business person who is trying to find or afford health care, ask \nsomebody who is a single entrepreneur or in a small nonprofit or single \nbusiness person in their own private consulting business how easy it is \nto find and afford health insurance. We need to be addressing those \nissues.\n  I find it ironic that when we need to be addressing that and creating \nbigger insurance pools so that we can actually lower prices and create \nmore access to health care and work with the business community to do \nso, this bill does exactly the opposite. It unravels the only piece we \nhave had that has worked because it takes 39 million people, puts them \nin one plan--the sick, the healthy, the older, the younger. Because it \nspreads the costs and the risks in such a large pool, they have been \nable to keep the administration down, keep the growth in the program \ndown. It has worked.\n  On the face of it, we would say: Why in the world would we want to \nchange that? Why in the world would we want to create a system where it \ncosts 2 percent right now to administer Medicare; private HMOs, it \ncosts 15 percent? And we would set up a way to begin to move to this?\n  If we have a financial crisis with Medicare, I would argue it is \nbecause of a self-inflicted set of decisions. The tax cuts passed 2\\1/\n2\\ years ago were paid for by Medicare and Social Security. We would \nhave dollars to be able to take care of everything we want to do with \nMedicare right now, and Social Security, if it were not for a decision \nthat was more important--to give to those who already have great \nopportunity and have done well with it. It was decided it was better to \ngive to them and hope it would trickle down to everybody else rather \nthan keeping our promises to Medicare and Social Security.\n  So now folks say: We have to change it because the resources are \ngone. Well, the resources are a problem because of decisions made by \nthis Congress and this President.\n  Even with that, if you say, well, we can't sustain Medicare as we \nknow it, why would you then say, I have an idea: because Medicare is in \ncrisis and because there is going to be a problem down the road funding \nit, let's make it more expensive? That doesn't make any sense. It \ndoesn't make any sense at all.\n  It only makes sense in two ways: One, if you just consider Medicare a \nbig government program and you believe everything should be done in the \nprivate sector, then from your standpoint, paying 15 percent instead of \n2 percent is OK. But I think there is a broader issue at stake. The \nunderlying focus, unfortunately, is that the folks who want to move us \naway from Medicare are the folks who benefit by this system. And even \nmore than the insurance companies and the HMOs, that are going to have \nto be paid more to entice them into this, the folks who are benefiting \nare in the pharmaceutical industry.\n  What this battle has always been about is making sure that if we are \ngoing to provide prescription drug coverage, we are not doing it under \none plan where all 39 million seniors are in one plan and they can get \ntogether and have the clout to force a group discount.\n  That is what all this is about. All of it is about the pharmaceutical \nindustry that fought for years to try to make sure we would not have a \nprescription drug benefit because we could then get a group discount.\n  But then a couple years ago they changed their strategy. They said: \nOK, well, if we are going to have a benefit--because it is clear that \nseniors need help and we are not going to be able to stop it because \nseniors need help, something is going to happen--let's change our \nstrategy and make sure that this is a plan that is putting seniors in a \nlot of different pots, lot of different insurance and HMO pots, so they \ncan group purchase a little bit but they won't have the clout of 39 \nmillion people, they will have the clout of just a few, a little bit \nhere, a little bit here, a little bit here; and let's make sure we \ndon't allow any new competition; and if we were really good, we would \neven write in the bill that Medicare can't negotiate on behalf of \neveryone for a group discount.\n  I am sure that was their big wish list. And, lo and behold, in this \ngreat big bill, most of which has nothing to do with prescription drug \ncoverage, they got it. They got it.\n  Because they got it, someone like me, who wants more than anything to \nsee seniors helped in paying for their\n\n[[Page S15548]]\n\nmedicine, has to stand up and say, no, no way, no way is this thing a \ngood deal for the seniors of this country.\n  (Mr. BOND assumed the Chair.)\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly to one thing \nthat I believe in the bill is a good deal. There are positive things. I \ndon't think it is all a negative bill. I think there are positive \nthings in it. I know there are people who have worked hard, including \nour occupant of the chair, who led efforts to work in a bipartisan way \nand tried hard to get the right thing done.\n  On balance, there is no way I can support this bill, but there are \nsome good provisions in it. I believe there are provisions in this bill \nthat, right now, we could pass overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan basis, \nif we were to pull them out, take away all the bad provisions, and \nstart over on prescription drugs.\n  I would simply say that to have no bill is better than to have a bad \nbill. Let's go back to work and get it right for our seniors. \nAbsolutely, they have waited too long. They have waited so long to get \nthis, and they are saying, I waited so long and this is what I got? So \nlet's go back to the drawing board. We can do it quickly if we want to \nand get it right--lower prices, real prescription drug coverage.\n  But there is one section I believe we have a tremendous sense of \nurgency on right now. I know that my distinguished colleague in the \nchair has been a leader in this effort, and that is our rural providers \nand what happened with our hospitals, home health agencies, and \ndoctors, and the cuts they have had to take. I want to speak to the \nfact that I am frustrated that we have not, before now, been able to \nhelp our providers.\n  I was in the House of Representatives in 1997 when we passed the \nbalanced budget agreement at that time, putting into place certain \nreductions for providers. Unfortunately, since that time, they have \nseen cuts of twice as much as was originally suggested would happen at \nthat time. It is the health care delivery organizations that will lose \nreimbursement. Frankly, the citizens of Michigan, indeed the citizens \nof the country, lose care when our providers are not given the \nassistance--the dollars to cover the care they need to be able to \ndeliver.\n  I have been working since that balanced budget agreement in 1997 to \nturn that around. In fact, the very first amendment I offered on the \nfloor of the Senate to the budget bill was to stop the 15 percent cut \nin home health care that was scheduled to take place. We have known \nabout this latest round of cuts since December of 2000. We knew it was \ncoming. At that time, we enacted a Medicare relief package, but we knew \nthere was going to be another 15 percent cut in home health or a $1,500 \ncap on physical therapy services.\n  Unfortunately, there were a number of cuts that were just postponed \nat that time. We have known for 3 years that these cuts were coming, \nand there is no question that the portion of the bill that deals with \nhelp for our rural and urban hospitals, help for our doctors, nursing \nhomes, home health agencies, physical therapists, all of the other \nproviders of Medicare services need to be addressed. We need to fix \nthat. We need to stop the cuts that are stopping services from being \nprovided.\n  If health care providers are not able to get reimbursed for their \nservices at a reasonable rate, we know they are going to simply decide \nnot to serve Medicare recipients. Too many of them have made that \ndecision--not because they wanted to but because they felt they had to. \nWe know patients cannot simply decide not to seek care. It is our \nresponsibility to make sure that providers are available in every \ncommunity, every rural community, urban, or suburban area.\n\n  In the past 5 years, the numbers of physicians accepting Medicare \npatients has declined by 10 percent. I know there is a sense of \ndesperation now as we look at this package. I have physicians saying to \nme: We know in the long run that this is not a good deal for seniors, \nnot even a good deal for us; but we are so desperate for something that \nwe feel we have to say yes to this package and then come back and fix \nit.\n  Of course, I say to them, I don't know if we can fix it. If we cannot \nget it right now, I have no confidence that we can come back and get \nthe votes to fix this later and stop the bad things that I talked about \nearlier.\n  But I know that there is a sense of desperation. I know the annual \nincreases in Medicare payment rates from my State of Michigan are less \nthan the rate of inflation. In 2000, more than half of Michigan \nhospitals lost money helping Medicare patients. One of the things that \nhappens when Medicare is cut and not covering the costs, as well as \nMedicaid, is that those costs--what it takes to care for people--is \nshifted to people who have insurance. So the providers are private \nsector providers now, and they are saying now that they have a stake in \nmaking sure that hospitals and doctors and other providers are \nreimbursed at a fair rate, covering their costs, so that those costs \ndon't shift over onto our large businesses, small businesses, and so \non. So we all have a stake in making sure that Medicare is paying a \nfair rate. Certainly our small businesses, which have seen their \ninsurance rates at least double in the last 5 years, have a stake in \nthis.\n  In my State, our big three automakers and other manufacturers \nstruggle with issues of health care. So I am deeply concerned that the \nprovisions in the bill that deal with our providers be passed.\n  This next round of cuts in 2004 to Michigan providers would be about \n$69 million to our hospitals; $53 million to teaching hospitals; $70 \nmillion to nursing homes; $120 million to physicians; and for \nindependent home health care agencies, $16 million. Altogether, it is \nabout a $329 million cost.\n  My concern is that these desperately needed funds are being held \nhostage in this bill. If we were addressing this package independently, \nI believe we would have overwhelming bipartisan support, if not \nunanimous support, for these provisions. They are long overdue. Many of \nus have been saying now for 3 years that this needs to get fixed. Our \nhospitals desperately need help, as do doctors, home health agencies, \nnursing homes, et cetera. And we need to do this now. But I am \nconcerned that it is put in the middle of a bill that is not in the \nlong-term best interest of these same providers.\n  I spoke a minute ago about how the highest possible pharmaceutical \nprices are locked into this bill. Because the highest possible prices \nare locked into this Medicare bill, as soon as the increases to \nproviders are done with in this legislation, and because of the \nincreases in pharmaceutical prices every year--we are seeing 12, 13, \n14, 18 percent increases every year--I believe our providers will be in \ngreat jeopardy of being cut significantly once again, because an \nexplosion in prescription drug prices will not have any accountability. \nThere will be nowhere to go but back to the doctor to cut, back to the \nhospital, back to the home health agency, back to the nursing home, the \nphysical therapist, the cancer services. There will be no place else to \ngo. So even though my good friends, who are desperate, feel they have \nto support this package, which they know is not good for them a few \nyears down the road, I believe we can do better by pulling that \nlanguage out and today making it clear that we are not going to hold \nthose who provide health care to seniors and the disabled hostage in \nthis legislation.\n  We are not going to hold them hostage to a broader bill where there \nis such disagreement and controversy. I believe it is up to us to pass \nthis legislation today.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1926\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 1926, which is cosponsored \nnot only by myself but Senators Graham, Clinton, Murray, Leahy, \nDaschle, Pryor, Levin, Cantwell, and Schumer--this is a bill to restore \nMedicare cuts to providers--that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that the bill be read a third time and passed; and that \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee that has jurisdiction over the legislation, and I want to \ntake a good look at it, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I may take another moment, that is\n\n[[Page S15549]]\n\nvery disappointing to me. I believe our providers need help now. We can \ndo this in a bipartisan way. My legislation would allow that to happen \nimmediately. I will continue to work to make sure that happens.\n  In conclusion, I say to all of my colleagues, we can do better for \nour seniors than what is in this bill. I would like very much if we \nwould all vote no and go back to work and get it done right. I thank \nthe Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as this debate goes forward, it is \nbeginning to take on somewhat of a formulae pattern with one side \nsaying, There are some good things in this bill, but it is so bad that \nwe must do nothing, and the other saying, We have problems; there may \nbe some bad things in this bill, but we have to move forward. Both \nsides agree the bill is not what individual Senators might prefer, but \nthe way the argument comes down on one side or the other as to the \nbalance.\n  I am reminded of the statement my father used to make when he served \nin this body. He said: We legislate at the highest level at which we \ncan obtain a majority. With the Senate as equally divided as this one, \nwith only a one-vote margin between the parties, obtaining a majority \nis very difficult. I pay tribute not only to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, but to the ranking member of the Finance Committee \nwho, in a bipartisan fashion, obtained a majority within that committee \nand brought a bill that has now obtained a majority in the House of \nRepresentatives, however close that was, and is on its way to obtaining \na majority in the Senate.\n  As the debate has gone on, those who are saying, No, this bill is \nmore bad than it is good, seem to have another mantra that I have heard \nover and over again. That mantra is this: This bill will destroy \nMedicare. Indeed, there are some who have gone so far as to say that it \nis the motive and purpose of the Republicans in this matter to destroy \nMedicare. I have had some say the Republicans have hated Medicare ever \nsince it was established, and they want to kill it, and this bill is \nsomehow a Trojan horse aimed at killing Medicare from the inside.\n\n  I reject the notion that the Republicans are trying to kill Medicare. \nI think that is ridiculous. I don't think there is any indication that \nis the case, never has been, but it is part of the political mantra \nthat we hear over and over again.\n  More importantly, I want to address the question of the present \nhealth of Medicare absent this bill. We hear over and over again: \nMedicare is wonderful; we can't tinker with it in any way. The best \nthing we could do is just take a prescription drug program and put it \ninto the present Medicare mix. Some of the provisions that are in this \nbill are innovative. Some of the provisions that are in this bill \ntinker with this wonderful program that everybody loves.\n  I would suggest to those who have that particular point of view that \nthey should go out and spend some time dealing with Medicare as it \npresently is constituted, not in the theory of a committee hearing, but \non the firing line with providers. Let me give you a few anecdotes out \nof the real world that have convinced me that while I believe the \nFederal Government should have the responsibility that it has adopted \nwith respect to Medicare, I do not believe that the present Medicare \nsystem is so wonderful that it should not be tinkered with.\n  Example No. 1: As I have held town meetings around my State, people \ncome to me and talk about their problems. I am sure every Senator has \nthe same experience. Very often, the problems they talk about have to \ndo with Medicare.\n  A woman came to me and said: I have finally figured out how to deal \nwith Medicare.\n  It struck me as a little bit strange that she should be talking about \nMedicare because she didn't strike me as being old enough to worry \nabout Medicare. Then she made it clear; she handles her mother's \nfinancial affairs.\n  So she said: On behalf of my 85-year-old mother, I handle all of her \nrelationships with Medicare. She said: Again, I finally figured out how \nto handle it: I throw away everything unopened, and then once a month, \nI call the Salt Lake Clinic and say: How much do I owe you? She said: I \nam a professional. I am a college graduate. I am an educated woman. I \nam probably at the top of my powers in terms of my career. I cannot \nunderstand anything that comes from Medicare. I open these envelopes, \nand I try to read what it has to say. It is absolutely impenetrable, \nand I spent time trying to figure it out; I spent time trying to work \nit through and finally I adopted my present strategy. Once again, I \nthrow away everything unopened. I don't even bother to look at it, and \nthen at the end of every month, I call the Salt Lake Clinic--which is \nwhere her mother gets her health care provided--and I say: How much do \nI owe you? They give me a number, I write out a check, and life is \nsimple.\n  She said: I may be overpaying, I may be underpaying, but who knows? \nIndeed, I don't think there is anybody on the planet who knows how much \nthe bill really should be. She said: I decided that the peace of mind \nthat comes from being able to handle this in this kind of fashion is \nworth whatever financial discrepancies there might be.\n  That does not sound to me like a program that is working so well that \nwe can't do a little tinkering with it or a program that is going so \nsmoothly that we can't try some innovation.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle are so horrified that this \nbill calls for some health savings accounts. I say to them: What are \nthey afraid of? That they will work? Are they afraid the health savings \naccounts might demonstrate that there is a different way to deal with \nthis, a way that is a little more straightforward, a way that does not \ninvolve the mountains of paperwork and the tremendous bureaucracy \nconnected with it?\n  Example No. 2: I have a daughter of whom I am enormously proud who \nhas a master's degree in speech therapy. After she graduated with that \ndegree from George Washington University, she went to work in a nursing \nhome. This daughter is a very enthusiastic young lady. Some might even \nsuggest she is a little bit excitable. I would not, as her father, make \nthat kind of a charge, but I have heard some who have suggested she \ngets excited.\n  She had been on the job, I imagine, a week, maybe a week and a half. \nShe called me. The call came in as calls from my children usually do: \nJust as I am getting ready to go to bed.\n  I am so delighted to hear from my children that I do not resent the \nfact that they prevent me from getting the amount of sleep I would \nnormally like. They can call any time. When she called and I answered, \nshe said: Dad, you are a Senator. You have got to fix Medicare.\n  I said: OK. Calm down. Tell me what you are talking about.\n  Then she described the details of the difficulty she was having in \nher first job in this nursing home trying to provide therapy for \nseniors who were having serious problems with respect to Medicare. She \nmade this fascinating statement to me. She said: Dad, do you know who \nthe highest paid person in this facility is?\n  Well, I would have assumed it would be the administrator.\n  No.\n  Well, if it is not the administrator, then the most skilled doctor. I \ncan see that a doctor might be paid more than an administrator.\n  She said: No. The highest paid person in this facility is the woman \nwho is in charge of handling Medicare regulations.\n  I stopped to think about that for a minute. That means the skill \nrequired to understand all of the regulations relating to Medicare is \nin shorter supply and therefore can command a higher salary than the \nskill necessary to administer an entire facility or the skill necessary \nto provide medical services from a skilled physician.\n  She gave me an example. She said there was a senior in that facility \nwho was having some problems swallowing. The doctor looked at it. The \ndoctor said, I do not understand what the problems are, and called the \nspeech therapist. My daughter, the speech therapist, came in and said: \nYes, I understand the problems connected with this. It is fairly \nstraightforward. It is fairly normal among seniors. Here is the way you \ndeal with it. She needs this kind of therapy to deal with her \nswallowing problems. They are not just minor problems. They could \naffect her ability to eat and ultimately her ability to live because \nshe needs the nourishment.\n\n[[Page S15550]]\n\n  So my daughter said: This is what needs to be done.\n  Well, the relatives of the woman who had the swallowing difficulties \nsaid: Absolutely not, until we are sure Medicare will pay for it. We \ncannot have this kind of procedure and therapy prescribed unless we are \nsure it is covered by Medicare. If Medicare will pay for it, then \ngrandma can have it, but if Medicare will not pay for it, we are not \npaying for it, no.\n  My daughter, in her innocence, first time on the job, said: Let me \nfind out. So she made the inquiry, Will Medicare cover this particular \ntreatment? Three days later, she gets an answer. It took that long to \nwade through all of the regulations, and all of the rest of it, by this \nperson who was the highest paid person in the nursing home, to figure \nit out.\n  My daughter has had the tragic experience of having patients die on \nher, patients whom she believed she could have helped but was unable to \nhelp because of the delays built into dealing with all of the \ncomplexities connected with Medicare.\n  She said, again: Dad, you are a Senator. Fix it.\n  I said: Well, it takes a little more than one Senator to fix this.\n  Then she made a very interesting statement. She said: I cannot admit \nto any of my coworkers in this facility that my father is a Senator \nbecause they will be so outraged that my father is a Senator and is not \ndoing anything about fixing Medicare.\n  So I suggest to those who say Medicare is so sacrosanct that we \ncannot try anything new, they ought to spend a little time dealing with \npatients and providers to discover that Medicare has become a \nbureaucracy of incredible impenetrability and needs to be addressed.\n  This bill addresses some of those problems. The most significant one, \nof course, is the fact that Medicare as it currently stands does not \nprovide reimbursement for prescription drugs. Now that is a scandal. \nEvery other health program in this country immediately recognized, as \nit came along, the shift in the way medicine is practiced in this \ncountry, but because Medicare is written by the Congress, it is not \nflexible enough to make that kind of shift.\n  We now have prescription drugs that prevent hospitalization, that \nprevent the necessity for operations and surgical procedures, but \nMedicare will not reimburse for that even though ultimately it would \nsave tremendous amounts of money. The reason: Medicare is the best Blue \nCross/Blue Shield fee-for-service indemnity plan of 1965 frozen in \ntime.\n  It is almost like a bad movie, a Woody Allen movie where he sleeps \nfor awhile and comes back 40 years later. Medicare has not kept up with \nthe changes in the way medicine is practiced. It has not kept up with \nall of the things that happen outside of Medicare, in the private \nworld, that happened just because the administrators of the plan look \nat what is happening in the practice of medicine and say we need to \nchange the plan to adapt to the way medicine is practiced.\n  Medicare cannot because it has to be changed by Congress, and every \ntime Congress comes along and says we need to try to make some of these \nchanges, we run smack into the political reality that there can be some \npolitical hay made by standing up to defend Medicare, by saying the \nother side is trying to destroy Medicare. The scare tactics of this \nkind of campaign are something with which we are all familiar.\n  One of my colleagues on this side described a conversation she had \nduring the 2000 election with her aunt who was in her nineties. Her \naunt said: I am not sure I can vote for George W. Bush.\n  The Senator said: Why not?\n  She said: Well, he is going to destroy my Social Security.\n  Wait a minute, said the Senator. Governor Bush has not talked in any \nsense about your Social Security. He is talking about the future. He is \ntalking about the teenagers. He is talking about the 20-somethings who \nare just coming into Social Security.\n  Oh, no, said the woman in her nineties, he is going to destroy Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Because she had seen television ads that \nsuggested that any attempt to try to improve, modernize, change, or \nhelp either Social Security and Medicare meant destroy, meant we are \nagainst it.\n  We are hearing those same kinds of arguments today. Any attempt on \nthe part of the Finance Committee to improve, change, innovate, \nexperiment, or move in any direction other than the 1965 model is \nsomehow an attempt to destroy.\n  Well, it is not. I think we all understand that. But that makes for a \ngreat bumper sticker. It makes for a great television 30-second sound \nbite to attack anybody who wants to try anything new as being against \nthe old and, therefore, trying to destroy the whole program.\n  I have problems with this bill, as does every other Member of this \nbody one way or the other. There are lots of things in it that I do not \nlike and lots of things in it that I think will make the problem I have \njust described worse, make Medicare even more impenetrable than it is \nnow, but I intend to vote for it. I intend to vote for it with \nenthusiasm, and I ask my colleagues to do the same thing, because for \nthe first time since 1965, it is at least willing to break down some of \nthe walls that have been built around this program. For the first time \nsince 1965, it is at least willing to try and see if we can get a \nlittle experience with a few things that can move us into the 21st \ncentury.\n  I am sure I will be attacked in my election this November as being \none who voted to destroy Medicare by virtue of this vote, by those who \nwill want to continue to raise the specter that any kind of innovation \nor change is an attack at the fundamental program.\n\n  But let us understand the most important thing we are faced with \nhere. Let us understand if we do nothing, if we preserve this program \nas it currently exists, it will destroy itself. This is not a partisan \nstatement, this is not some conclusion Republicans have come to and \nDemocrats dispute. The demographics are irresistible. What is happening \nin our country as we become older and older, as the good health care \nthat we are receiving makes us live longer and longer, that \ndemonstrates a financial situation that is unsustainable.\n  If we do nothing with Medicare in the name of preserving Medicare, we \nwatch Medicare self-destruct. That is inexorable. There is no way \naround it.\n  I would have suggestions that would go far beyond what this bill does \nin moving us away from the present paradigm of Medicare into a world of \ninnovation, change, and experimentation, not because I want to destroy \nMedicare but because I want it to survive. If you leave it on its \npresent course, it is not going to survive.\n  There are a few halting steps in the right direction in this bill. We \nneed more of them. We cannot stop with this bill. The Congresses of the \nfuture will have to deal with this problem, and it will only get worse \nthe longer we delay taking those steps.\n  So I say let's take those steps now. Let's start with this bill with \nthe full understanding, and with eyes wide open, that the future is \ngoing to bring us back to this issue again and again. The demographics \nare inexorable. They are going to require changes in the next Congress \nand in the Congress after that and in the Congress after that. They are \ngoing to force us to get out of the mindset that we have had since the \n1960s, and that has nothing to do with who is in the White House or who \ncontrols the Senate in a partisan fashion. Those demographics are \nthere. They are bearing down on us. The quicker we can understand that \nand begin to think in new ways, begin to experiment with new methods, \nthe sooner we will solve the problem, not only for our existing seniors \nbut, perhaps more important, for the baby boomers who are becoming \nseniors. We have to think in a new fashion or they will run into a \ndemographic brick wall that will see this program self-destruct \nregardless of what we do.\n  So, as I say, for that reason, with all the problems I see in the \nbill, I am going to vote for it, and I am going to hope that future \nFinance Committees and Ways and Means Committees will move us in the \ndirection of innovation and experimentation so we can boldly begin to \nfind solutions to the problems that we face.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding, on the Democratic \nside, the speaking order has been set for the next few speakers. Is \nthat true?\n\n[[Page S15551]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Who would they be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators Harkin and Boxer.\n  Mr. REID. Following Senator Boxer, I ask that Senator Clinton be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I believe that is all we have at this stage, Mr. President.\n  For tomorrow, whatever time we come in, I ask on our side the \nDemocratic leader be recognized first, I be recognized second, that \nSenator Graham of Florida be recognized third, and Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts be recognized fourth--that is for Sunday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Was the request just in the order on the Democrat side?\n  Mr. REID. Unless there is some change by the leadership, I assume we \nwill do the same thing tomorrow we are doing today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the order will be that \nstated by the Democratic whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I do have quite a lengthy statement. I had \nestimated it might take me upwards of about 45 minutes. I know others \nwant to speak. I am going to try to collapse it as much as I can, but I \nhad a number of things I wanted to say. Hopefully, I can get them said \nwithin a certain amount of time. I don't mean to drag it out, but I did \nhave a number of things I wanted to point out about this bill.\n  We are debating an issue of utmost importance--the health and \nsecurity of this Nation's elderly and disabled. To repeat what has been \nsaid, Medicare was created 40 years ago with the purpose of providing \nthis Nation's aged and disabled with a safety net to protect them from \ndebt and destitution. For years, seniors have counted on health \nsecurity in their golden years thanks to Medicare. This program stands \nas a social contract between the American Government and the American \npeople, a social contract between one generation and the next.\n  The contract is simply this: After a lifetime of work, when you turn \n65 you are promised health insurance covering doctors visits, \nhospitals, and many other health costs. But there has been one \nexemption from this social contract--no coverage for prescription \ndrugs.\n  It is not possible to overstate what Medicare means to a citizen of \nmodest means who has worked hard for a lifetime, who doesn't want to be \na burden on the rest of his or her family. It is really kind of hard to \noverstate what it means. Medicare has been a rock-solid, reliable, \nguaranteed lifeline for a great number of America's senior citizens.\n  I think back to my father's own experience, my own family's \nexperience in the days before Medicare. In 1958--I just pick that year \nbecause I was a senior in high school at that time--my father at that \ntime was 74 years old. He had worked most of his life in coal mines, in \nIowa. A lot of people don't know it, but we had a lot of coal mines in \nIowa. He had a number of accidents in those mines and elsewhere. He \nsuffered from what was then called miner's lung. That is what they \ncalled it at that time, miner's lung. Today we call it black lung \ndisease.\n  As I said, he had several chronic injuries as well and he was in \npretty tough shape. Keep in mind, my father only had an eighth grade \neducation, and all of his work life basically had been prior to Social \nSecurity coming into existence.\n  My father's total income in retirement was less than $1,500. Again, \nthank goodness during World War II, even though he had been old then, \nhe had worked for a while and was covered under Social Security. Other \nthan that, he had no assets, he had no money, no stocks, no bonds. He \ndid own a small house in Cumming, IA. Oh, yes, he had a model A Ford \nthat was 30 years old. That was the only car he ever owned.\n  Of course, in 1958 he had no Medicare because the program didn't \nexist. This meant that my father couldn't afford the luxury of seeing a \ndoctor. But every year, like clockwork, my father would get sick in the \nmiddle of wintertime. He had this terrible chronic lung problem, black \nlung, miner's lung. My mother had passed away 8 years prior to 1958. He \nwas on his own and basically taking care of us. As I said, I was a \nsenior in high school at the time.\n  Every year he would catch a cold, he couldn't get over it, he would \ncome down with pneumonia, and a neighbor of ours who had a car would \nrush him to the hospital in Des Moines.\n  He would arrive at the hospital in Des Moines. They would take care \nof my father. They would put him in an oxygen tent. They would give him \nhis antibiotics and send him home in a week or two.\n  How could he afford to do that if we were so poor and had no income? \nMy father was 74 years old. Did we have a rich uncle? No. So what \nhappened? I will tell you how we afforded it. We thanked Sisters of \nMercy at the Mercy Hospital in Des Moines who gave us charity care \nbecause our family didn't have any money. That is the only way that my \nfather got health care.\n  We forget. Those of us who are young perhaps forget that 45 years ago \nthat was the status of elderly health care in America. My father was \nnot unique. Our family was not unique. In my little town of 150 people, \nit was all the same. All my father's brothers, his sisters, our \nfamily--of all who were that age, none of them had any health care. \nNone of them had any money. If it wasn't for the charity of the \nCatholic Church and the Sisters of Mercy, my father would have had no \nhealth care whatsoever.\n  Had my father had any money or health insurance, he could have seen a \ndoctor. He could have had annual checkups. He could have prevented long \nstays in the hospital. But in the absence of anything like Medicare, he \nended up in a dire situation, in effect, in the emergency room. For \nmany uninsured in this Nation, things are still that way. But \nfortunately, Medicare has offered a better alternative for our Nation's \nelderly and disabled.\n  I can remember as though it were yesterday. After I left high school, \nI went to Iowa State University. I had a Navy ROTC scholarship. I was \nin the Navy. I was flying planes. And I can remember coming home on \nleave once. It was Christmas of 1966. I came home, and my father, who \nwas nearing his 81st birthday, still with his bad lung problems--I \nremember coming home and I remember when he proudly showed me his \nMedicare card. He said: Now I can go to see a doctor. I can go to the \nhospital, if I have to. But I can see a doctor. We don't have to take \ncharity anymore.\n  I think of the impact that Medicare card had on my father, and the \nimpact it had on my family and what it meant to my father to be able to \nget health care without accepting charity. What a tremendous \ndifference. I often think about what my father's later life would have \nbeen like had he had Medicare. I think about how much healthier he \ncould have been with good preventive care, and how much more he could \nhave enjoyed his later years if he had had decent health care.\n  Today, seniors rely on Medicare. It means everything to them. If you \ndo not have your health in your older years, you just do not have much \nof anything.\n  Unfortunately, back in 1966, we weren't nearly as sophisticated about \nmedicine and health care as we are now. Surely, if we were creating the \nMedicare Program today we would include coverage of prescription drugs. \nWe know that drug breakthroughs and innovations have made it possible \nto prevent illness, control illness, and keep people out of the \nhospital. For many in this society, modern prescription drugs have been \na lifesaver and a life sustainer. Here we are today debating a proposal \nthat was originally supposed to accomplish one simple goal: To fill in \nthe gap that was left in Medicare--to right the wrong in Medicare by \nproviding coverage of prescription drugs and simply to make \nmedicine more affordable to seniors.\n\n  That is what we started out to do.\n  I deeply regret that in writing this bill Congress has strayed from \nthat straightforward objective. This bill got hijacked, and it got \nhijacked by the corporate special interests, insurance and HMOs, and it \ngot hijacked by the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n[[Page S15552]]\n\n  We have forgotten who we are supposed to be helping--our Nation's \nseniors. Instead of a straightforward drug benefit, we now have a \nMedicare privatization proposal that threatens to undo the entire \nMedicare Program that seniors and the disabled rely on each and every \nday--seniors like my father who relied upon the stability and the \naffordability of Medicare in his later years, and seniors like him back \nin my home State of Iowa who simply want and need affordable medical \ncare. That is all they want.\n  But what they are offered in this bill is something else entirely. \nThis bill totally violates the spirit and substance of the original \nMedicare Program. I call it the ``Big Medicare Gamble.'' It is a \nroulette wheel. If you know anything about odds in roulette--I don't. I \njust learned this: The odds are tremendous against you. Roulette--that \nis what they are playing with Medicare. This bill threatens to unravel \nMedicare as we know it. Seniors are being told to head to the back of \nthe line because the special interest drug companies and HMOs are more \nimportant than they are.\n  Seniors are being told there isn't enough money for a full drug \nbenefit. That is because we have already squandered our surpluses in \ntax cuts worth trillions of dollars for the wealthy.\n  I heard someone the other day say: Look, we can't do any more in \nMedicare than we are doing now because we are limited by the $400 \nbillion that was put in the budget. So all of you people want all of \nthis stuff, but we can't do that, you see. We can't do it. We simply \ndon't have the money. The very same person saying that voted for the \ntax cuts in 2001 and in 2003.\n  I am saying: Well, fine. If you vote for the tax cut, fine. But then \ndon't say we don't have enough money to have a good meaningful \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare. What you are saying is you \nhad different priorities. Your priority was to give tax breaks to the \nwealthy. That is your priority, and the seniors and elderly who need \nprescription drugs, they can go to the back of the line someplace else.\n  We had the amount of money--I will continue to say this because it is \ntrue--that we gave up in the tax breaks. If you spread that out over 75 \nyears, that money is three times more than what we need to make Social \nSecurity and Medicare whole for 75 years--three times. So don't tell me \nwe don't have the money. People just have different priorities on how \nto spend the money.\n  Once again, the well heeled on Wall Street are more important to this \nadministration and to the supporters of this bill than the elderly and \nthe disabled on Main Street.\n  What we have before us today is a bill drafted behind closed doors in \nthe dark of night that amounts to a bonanza for special interests. \nDon't take my word for it. Look at what others are saying. Here is the \nLos Angeles Times: ``Deal Would Alter the Essence of Medicare.''\n\n       As Congress prepares to vote on the final $400 billion \n     Medicare prescription drug bill, there is one thing on which \n     most lawmakers agree. The legislation would over time change \n     the essence of the 38-year-old health insurance program for \n     the elderly and disabled.\n\n  We are doing that and we are told that we have 2 days to debate it--2 \ndays, Saturday, today, and tomorrow--and we are going to vote on \nMonday. My prescription for this bill is to put it out in the \ncountryside, send it out across America, let us get out of here, go \nback home for Christmas, go back to our constituents, get it out among \nthe elderly, let us see what they say about it, and come back here as \nwe are going to do on January 20 and take it up in February. Let's hear \nwhat the American public has to say about it before we pass it. It does \nnot go into effect until 2006, so what is the rush? If it does not go \ninto effect until 2006, why not take a couple, 3 months to put it out \nthere and let people think about it? No, no, we have to debate this \nSaturday, Sunday, and vote on it Monday.\n\n  Here is my own Des Moines Register editorial:\n\n       This legislation is a big, sloppy kiss to the \n     pharmaceutical and insurance industries.\n\n  From the Albany Times Union:\n\n       This is not only an imperfect bill. It may also be a \n     disastrous one.\n\n  That is what others are saying about it.\n  Another one, from the New York Times, on the 19th:\n\n       . . . gift to pharmaceutical companies and insurers and a \n     threat to elderly Americans.\n\n  From the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       Deal would alter Medicare's core.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       If a comprehensive bill on prescription drugs passes, the \n     government program will become a massive subsidized insurance \n     market.\n\n  That is what we are doing. It is not just the media. Here is what \nconservative organizations are saying. Here is the Cato Institute, a \nmore libertarian institute, perhaps, than conservative. I am not \ncertain if it is conservative or libertarian:\n\n       The Medicare prescription drug bill to be voted on by \n     Congress is a terrible mistake that will dearly cost our \n     children and grandchildren. This is not a Medicare reform \n     bill. This is barely a Medicare prescription drug bill. This \n     is a bill for politicians and special interests. Sometimes \n     the better part of valor is recognizing when you have made a \n     mistake. Congress should recognize this bill as a mistake and \n     go back to the drawing board.\n\n  That is Cato director of health and welfare studies Michael Tanner.\n  From the Heritage Foundation:\n\n       The agreement contains an unworkable and potentially \n     unpopular drug benefit with millions of Americans losing part \n     of their existing coverage.\n\n  That is not just me, a Democrat, saying that. It is the Heritage \nFoundation. They go on to say:\n\n       More than four million seniors with existing private \n     coverage are bound to lose it or have it scaled back. \n     Meanwhile, the politically engineered premiums and \n     deductibles coupled with their odd combination of ``doughnut \n     holes'' or gaps in coverage are likely to be unpopular with \n     seniors.\n\n  That was November 17, 2003, Heritage Foundation.\n  From the American Conservative Union:\n\n       The Medicare prescription drug benefit bills that have \n     passed the House and Senate would drive up costs for millions \n     of senior citizens.\n\n  They go on:\n\n       Millions more would lose their current coverage under \n     private medigap insurance and employer-provided plans. The \n     House-Senate conference committee should reject the current \n     bill and start over with a bill that includes real Medicare \n     reform.\n\n  That was the American Conservative Union, August 21, 2003.\n  It probably seems odd for this progressive Democrat to be agreeing \nwith conservatives, but sometimes they get it right, and they are right \non this.\n  This bill would provide billions of dollars in subsidies--make that \nbribes; they say subsidies, it is bribes; call it to what it is, \nbribes--to private plans and HMOs. It would ensure billions of dollars \nin profits, a projected $139 billion in profits to pharmaceutical \ncompanies.\n  It speaks volumes that on Wall Street this week, drug and health \nindustry stocks have surged up on the news of this big money, special \ninterest bonanza. I often pointed out that during the deliberations on \nthis so-called prescription drug bill, you never saw any pharmaceutical \ncompanies around here. I can tell you one thing. I have been here 29 \nyears, and I have seen times in the past whenever we had bills dealing \nwith drugs or pharmaceutical companies, if it is something that is \ngoing to cost the pharmaceutical companies one penny, they are here. \nThey are in the halls. Their private jets are parked out at the \nairport. They are calling; they are phoning; they are in our offices. \nIf there is any legislation that is going to take a nick out of the \npharmaceutical companies, believe me, you see them up here.\n  I never saw a one, not one during this entire debate and development \nof this bill, which indicates to me they love it. Why wouldn't they, \nwith a projected $139 billion in profits?\n  Now, I don't mind pharmaceutical companies making profits. They have \na right to it. They provide good drugs. They do good research. But what \nI mind is that the $139 billion in profits they are getting are coming \nout of taxpayers' pockets--not to buy drugs, just as a subsidy, a \nblatant subsidy. It is not something they are making in the \nmarketplace; it is a funnel from taxpayers to the taxing power of the \nGovernment and giving it right back out to the pharmaceutical \ncompanies.\n  One of the oldest statements in medicine goes back to Hippocrates: \nThe first thing in medicine is ``do no harm.'' That is the oath that \neach doctor takes in this country: First do no harm.\n\n[[Page S15553]]\n\n  We have to look at this bill. It does tremendous harm. Most \negregiously, this legislation seeks to privatize Medicare, despite the \nfact that 89 percent of seniors are in traditional Medicare, and that \nis what they have chosen.\n  I listened to the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow. She pointed \nout we offered seniors a choice in this country in 1997. It is called \nMedicare+Choice. They could stay with traditional Medicare or they \ncould join an HMO. Guess what, 89 percent of the seniors in this \ncountry stuck with Medicare and 11 percent went with HMOs. It seems to \nme they have already stated what they want.\n  Despite the fact that traditional Medicare is less expensive to \nadminister--this is something else that a lot of people do not \nunderstand--they say private industry can do it cheaper than Medicare. \nThe fact is, since we have had Medicare for over 40 years, we have good \ndata. We know. We can look at the figures. This is not something on \nwhich you have to guess. So we look at the figures, and what do we \nfind? We find that the average administrative expense in Medicare is 2 \nto 3 percent. In other words, for every $1 that goes to a Medicare \nrecipient, 2 to 3 pennies are used in administration. In private plans, \nit is 15 percent. For every $1 that goes through a private plan in \nhealth care, 15 cents is used in administration; only 2 to 3 pennies in \nMedicare.\n  Why is that? With traditional Medicare, we do not have to spend \nmillions on corporate CEO salaries or give them the private jets in \nwhich they fly all over the country. How about all the big page ads \nthey take out in USA Today, New York Times, and Newsweek magazine? \nThose cost a lot of money. Medicare does not do that. So we have very \ncheap administrative expenses.\n  Despite the fact that administrative costs are 2 to 3 percent in \nMedicare and 15 percent in the private sector, they want to privatize \nMedicare. Despite the fact that under Medicare+Choice, which I just \nmentioned--they came in a few years ago in the late 1990s. HMOs have a \nhistory of dumping seniors. They get signed up, they are not making \nenough money, they leave town, and they dump them. But, still, we want \nto privatize it. They want to privatize it despite the fact that \nMedicare expenditures are growing at a slower rate than private plans. \nThis is fact. This is not something we are guessing at. We have the \ndata, how much Medicare has grown expenditures percentage-wise compared \nto private plans. We have the data. No one on that side will ever \ndispute it because it is factual. Medicare expenditures are growing at \nabout 9.6 percent a year; private plans, 11.1 percent. Their \nexpenditures are growing faster than Medicare.\n  They want to privatize Medicare despite the fact that private plans \nare concerned first with what? Profits. I do not say that as a bad \nword. That is their business. They are in business to make money for \nthemselves and their shareholders. So their first concern is profit.\n\n  Senior citizens and the sickest are not profitable. The elderly are \nnot profitable. The sickest and the disabled are not profitable for \ninsurance companies.\n  Despite the clear wishes of senior citizens in this country, they \nwant to privatize Medicare. The conferees have chosen to ignore all of \nthese facts. Instead, they have concocted a witch's brew--a witch's \nbrew--of seemingly appealing schemes which are designed to let Medicare \nwither on the vine, and to set the stage, next year and beyond, for \nattacking Social Security. Make no mistake about it; that is what this \nis designed to do. And I will have more to say about that in a minute \nbecause of what Newt Gingrich stood for.\n  The ideological experiment that we have confronting us is the result \nof what I call private sector worship. It is sort of a faith-based \nnotion among some of our colleagues and administration officials that \nthe private sector will take care of everything. It is a blind faith \nthat free markets solve every problem. But this private sector worship \nflies in the face of past experience.\n  The entire reason we have Medicare today is because there is no \nprivate sector market for health insurance for sick seniors--none, \nzero, zip, nada--no private sector market because there is no money to \nbe made in insuring the sick, the elderly.\n  The free market works just fine when you are talking about \nautomobiles and airplanes and TVs, and widgets, et cetera. But the free \nmarket is not stupid. It cares about profit, not people. So by its very \nnature the free market shuts out people with disabilities, people with \nmental illnesses, people in the last years of their lives--in short, \npeople who are not profitable.\n  So I have news for my colleagues who believe the free market is the \nanswer to everything. The free market did not break down barriers to \npeople with disabilities in our country.\n  When the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990 and \nsigned into law, it was not the free market that did that. It was \nGovernment. It was us, the elected officials here in the Congress, \nworking with the President, who did that. It was our free Government \nthat had to step in to ensure that opportunities and openness in our \ncountry was there for people with disabilities. In the survival-of-the-\nfittest free market, these folks are just simply left behind.\n  Another example: We have been fighting in this Congress for years now \nto pass a bill ensuring mental health parity. But people with mental \nillnesses are not a profitable group. So the free market, left to its \nown devices, will have nothing to do with mental health parity in \ninsurance. That is why I hope, as soon as we get back in our session \nnext year, we can get to work passing the Paul Wellstone mental health \nparity bill because when we leave it up to the free market, folks with \nmental illness simply get left behind.\n  Another prime example of those left behind is simply the elderly. The \nelderly are not a profitable group of people to include in an insurance \nrisk pool. They are sick. They are older. They have chronic illnesses. \nThey are expensive to treat. On this score, the proof is all around us.\n  It is impossible to imagine private insurers fighting and competing \nwith one another for the privilege of covering the elderly. That is why \nthis bill has to bribe these companies with billions of dollars in \nsubsidies to participate in this wrong-headed scheme we have before us.\n  As I said in my opening comments today, I have seen this proof \nfirsthand. Now, back in 1958, when my father, as I said, was then 74, \ngetting sick every year, going to the hospital, relying upon the \ncharity of the Sisters of Mercy, we had insurance companies. There were \na lot of insurance companies in those days.\n  Why weren't those insurance companies rushing out to Cumming, IA, \nwith a population of 150 people, knocking on our door and competing \nwith one another to cover my father with health insurance? Because they \nwould never make any money off my dad. He got sick all the time. And he \ndid not have any money.\n  Where was the free market? Where was the free market to cover my \nfather in his time of need when he was elderly? The only market that \nwas there was the charity market. Somehow I get the uneasy feeling that \nthose promoting this bill see that as, once again, sort of the last \nkind of stopgap to helping our elderly, relying on charity once again, \nrelying upon your kids, relying upon your families.\n  So do not tell me the private sector will solve every problem. I have \nlived through its failures firsthand. And I know that many elderly in \nmy State of Iowa and around the country are in the same situation. They \ndo not want to be let to not-so-tender mercies and whims of HMOs.\n  Now, it may sound like I have a real case against insurance \ncompanies. I do not. In fact, in my State of Iowa I think we are proud \nthat we are the second largest domiciliary of insurance companies in \nthe Nation, next to Connecticut, I believe. We are proud of our \ninsurance companies in Iowa. They employ a lot of people. They are good \ncorporate citizens. And they provide a very valuable commodity: \ninsurance.\n  What the heck, I have a lot of insurance. I have life insurance, \nhealth insurance, car insurance. I probably have more insurance than I \nknow what to do with, but it is a good tool, and I can afford it.\n  Insurance has been good for us ever since the first insurance scheme \nstarted about, I think it was, 3,000 years ago, in China, when Chinese \nfarmers\n\n[[Page S15554]]\n\nwere sending their barges down the Yangtze River, down to the ports, \ndown to the cities. They found the storms would come up, and they would \nlose some of the barges, so a few of them got together and they decided \nto pool--to pool--their risks so that if one barge went down, that one \nperson would not be totally wiped out. They found out by doing that, \nthey could cover one another. Thus began the whole idea of insurance--\nrisk pool, sharing the risk, spreading the risk around.\n  So, no, I have a great deal of respect for insurance. I think it \nprovides a very valuable, meaningful commodity for all of us. But it is \nnot adaptable here in health care for the elderly. It is just not \nadaptable.\n  Many of my colleagues prefer the free market over Government \nintervention. In many cases this is a wise preference. But in other \ninstances it is a misplaced faith that the free market can do anything. \nThere is a time and a place for the Government to step in where the \nprivate sector either fears to tread or fails to tread because it is \nnot profitable. No question, this is the case when it comes to helping \npeople with disabilities, people with mental illnesses, and seniors \nwith serious health problems.\n  We hear the claim that private sector competition will drive down \ncosts and save Medicare.\n  Come on, let's get real about this. The only competition in this bill \nwill be the competition for healthy seniors. That is where the \ncompetition will come.\n  It says right here in the Washington Post: ``Medicare Deal Likely To \nSpark More Health Care Competition.'' When you read that, you say that \nis good, that is what you want. Except when you read in here, it says:\n\n       \"This could be like the wild west out there,'' Hayes said. \n     ``If suddenly there are five or six or seven plans out there, \n     the insurance companies will be pricing their product to make \n     a profit, as they are obligated to do. If the consumer is \n     kind of shooting in the dark because of the complexity of \n     this--and the darkness is deepened by age or disability--\n     you'll have a customer primed for exploitation. We're real \n     concerned that people could get ripped off.''\n\n  If you are sick and you are a senior, you are going to be shunned. If \nyou are a senior and you are healthy, you are going to have people \nfighting for you. Why? Not on a free-market basis, but that is where \nthe subsidies go. We are going to give them subsidies to do this.\n  We hear the claim that Medicare should compete with the private \nsector, but they don't want an even playing field. This bill will give \nbillions of extra dollars to the private plans so they can compete and \nmake profits. That is not competition, that is simply another excuse to \nshovel taxpayers' dollars to the special interests. In fact, this bill \nwill pay private plans 9 percent more than traditional fee-for-service \nMedicare.\n  But that is not the end of it. On top of that, the conferees have \ncome up with what they call a stabilization fund, which amounts to a \n$12 billion slush fund for private plans.\n  Once again, the writing is on the wall. Privatization costs everyone \nmore money. So understand this: They say they will pay the private \nplans 9 percent more, but when you add the $12 billion in this \nstabilization fund, it is more like 26 percent more. In other words, \ntaxpayers of this country are going to pay, out of our tax dollars, 26 \npercent more to the private plans so they can compete with Medicare. \nWhat a sweetheart deal that is; what a sweetheart deal. And then they \nsay that is competition, that is fair competition. It is nothing more \nthan a scheme to give money to special interests.\n  We hear the claim that seniors should have a choice. Many people have \nsaid seniors should have a choice as we Members of Congress have. I can \ntell you this: When they find out what is in this bill, they are going \nto be disappointed to find out their options are nothing like our \noptions.\n  Yes, I believe the seniors of this country ought to have what we \nMembers of the Senate and Congress have. But they aren't going to get \nit under this bill.\n  Many seniors could actually end up with reduced choice with this \nlegislation. Under this plan, if there are two private health plans, \nsay an HMO and a PDP--I know, aside from a few people probably around \nhere, no one has ever heard of a PDP. And why not? Because they don't \nexist. They have just been conjured up out of this witch's brew. It is \ncalled a prescription drug plan. There is no such animal out there now. \nIn a particular area, if a senior wants drug coverage, that senior will \nbe forced to get their drug coverage through one of those private \nplans, not Medicare. That senior will not be allowed to get their drugs \nthrough traditional Medicare. So they can go to the PDP or the HMO.\n  Well, they don't want to go to an HMO. Eighty-nine percent of seniors \nhave already said they don't want to join an HMO. They want their \nchoice of doctor. They want fee-for-service. So they can join a PDP, \nbut we don't know what they are like because no one has ever built one. \nBut once the senior goes in this private plan, they could face \nrestrictions on what doctors they can see. The plan can change the \ndrugs that are available to them. You could be on one drug and they \ncould say: Well, we aren't going to cover that drug; we are going to \ncover another drug.\n  Now, why would they switch from one drug to another? Well, maybe they \nare getting a kickback from the pharmaceutical manufacturer that is \nmaking the drug. Maybe they get a bigger kickback on one drug than they \ndo another. So they tell you: We are not going to cover that drug. So \nseniors could be forced to change drugs in midstream.\n  This is not competition. This is another excuse to shovel money to \nthe special interests. I don't call that choice. That is not choice at \nall.\n  There is a lot of rhetoric surrounding this bill that doesn't match \nreality. This administration has said many times that seniors deserve \nchoice, that seniors deserve what Members of Congress have. I am all \nfor that. But let's put our money where our mouths are.\n  Right now, as a Senator, I pay about 25 percent of my drug costs, \nperiod--a heck of a deal. But the prescription drug plan put before \nseniors today won't even come close to this. Instead, it is a \nconfusing, convoluted maze that--mark my words--will leave our seniors \nfeeling betrayed and bewildered once they find out about it.\n  I say to my colleagues, if you like our seniors' reaction to the \ncatastrophic health insurance plan of 1987, you are going to love their \nreaction to this grossly inadequate prescription drug plan.\n  In 1987, I was here. We all voted for a catastrophic health plan for \nthe elderly. The AARP supported it and said it was wonderful. Guess \nwhat. We came back a year later and had our heads handed to us by \nseniors in our States. I know I had mine handed to me. We came back a \nyear later and undid it.\n  I can barely lift the bill that we have before us. It got delivered \nto us sometime this morning or last night. I didn't see it last night \nwhen I went home so it must have been sometime during the night or this \nmorning this was handed to us. I am not going to kid anybody. I haven't \nread this. I have been here all day. I haven't read this. I am not \nabout to. I will have my staff look it over, and we will try to get \nthrough it. But no one is going to read this prior to the vote on \nMonday.\n  How many seniors in the country will go through this before Monday \nand be able to tell us what they think about it? Yet we are given 2 \ndays--today and tomorrow--and we vote on Monday. A bill such as this, \nthat is this big, that could have disastrous effects, is a bill that \nought to be out there, around the countryside. Let's go home for \nChristmas and Thanksgiving. Let's let it out there. Let's get people \nlooking at it, talking about it. See what the effect is going to be in \nyour State and mine, urban and rural, wealthy, poor. Come back in \nFebruary and let's take it up and see how we feel about it then. To me, \nthat is the way democracy works.\n  This President wants to bring democracy to Iraq. I sure hope they are \nnot watching this. I sure hope they are not watching this exercise. \nThey might think democracy may be something they may not want if they \nwatch this.\n  Look at what our seniors are going to be faced with. Once a year, we \nin our plan, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, get an open \nseason in which we can leave the plan we are in and pick another one. \nHere are all the books I get once a year to look through to decide \nwhich plan I want.\n  I get 30 days, or something like that, to look through them and \ndecide which\n\n[[Page S15555]]\n\none. Here is MD Individual Practice Association; here is GEHA; here is \nNALC; here is the Mail Handlers Benefit Plan; here is BPP and PPP--\nnever heard of that; here is Kaiser Foundation; here is APWU--on and on \nand on. You get my point.\n  So we are now going to say to the seniors that every year you get a \nchange and you will get all these wonderful books, like we do, to read, \nand you go through them and decide which plan you now want to be in. \nGive me a break. Maybe a person out there is sick and just hanging on, \nand they are supposed to decide by looking at these books. I suppose \nmaybe they will have to go out and hire somebody to look at them. They \nwill have to give a subsidy to somebody else. Maybe we will give a \nsubsidy to the trial lawyers to help them decide which one to choose. \nEvery single year. Who knows what drugs will be covered or what \ndoctors? It is convoluted, bewildering. Every year they can bounce them \naround; you can be in a different plan.\n  At the end of the year, the plan can say: I am not making enough \nmoney, so I am out of town. Nothing in this bill stops them. Nothing in \nthe bill says: We don't care if you don't make any money, you have to \nstay. If you are not making money, you can get out of there, and the \nsenior is dropped, period.\n  Let's talk about what Senators are going to pay with this. They are \ngoing to find out, to their dismay, what they are going to have to pay. \nAside from being confused and bewildered, being able to be dropped \nevery year, let's see what they have to pay. Seniors who have an annual \nincome above $13,470 per year--that is right, $13,470 a year--that is \nnot a lot of money. If they have an income above that, they pay a \nyearly deductible of $250 before their coverage kicks in. They will pay \n$35 a month in premiums. Can I tell you also that this $35 is not fixed \nin law; it is estimated. It could go up every year. It could be $40, \n$42, $45, or who knows? There is no guarantee it is going to be $35. So \nnow you have about $420 a year. As I said, the number could change \nevery year. When a private plan is not making enough profits, they can \nincrease the premiums every year. So seniors end up paying more.\n  So after seniors put at least $670 upfront into the program, they can \nstart receiving some benefits. You might say, well, $670 is not a lot \nof money. If you are making $14,000 a year, or $13,470 a year, that is \na lot of money. That is asking a lot. Then, after they pony up the \n$670, they pay 25 percent of their drug costs up to $2,250. At $2,250, \nthe senior hits the gap--what we call the donut hole--at which point \nthey pay 100 percent of their drug costs until they hit the \ncatastrophic amount, even though they are still paying monthly premiums \ninto the program.\n  So during the course of the year, a senior could have coverage one \nday, and the next day they could go to the pharmacy and be charged the \nfull sticker price for the prescription drugs. That is the donut hole. \nIt is not fair. It is outrageous.\n  Look at what they are paying now: Part A premium, zero. Part A \ndeductible, for hospitalization, $876 per benefit period; Part B \npremium for doctors, $66.60 a month. The deductible is $100 a year with \ndoctor visits. The cost share for doctor visits is 20 percent. That is \nstraightforward, simple, and easy to understand. There are not income \nlimits, asset tests, or anything else. It is just very straightforward. \nSeniors who have annual drug costs of $500 actually pay more into the \nprogram than what they receive. They would pay $500 for drugs, but they \nwould pay $751.25 into the program. Tell me how fair that is. A senior \nwith $1,000 in drug costs would pay $876.25. At the higher end, a \nsenior with $5,000 in drug costs would pay nearly $4,000 for his or her \ndrugs. What a deal. And for that, they get to read all these books \nevery year. They get all these, I say to my friend from California, \nevery year. And they have to try to decide. They can get bounced every \nyear from one plan to another. For that, they pay $5,000, or they pay \n4,000. It should not come as a surprise.\n\n  It is estimated that seniors, over the next 10 years, will have $1.8 \ntrillion for prescription drugs costs, but we are allocating $400 \nbillion to pay for it. Where did that money go? Well, it went to tax \ncuts. Hopefully, the people who voted for the tax cuts now will not \nbemoan the fact that we don't have the money. They voted to blow the \nmoney on tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  Now, let's look at one other thing. To make things even messier, this \nprogram would create several tiers of class under Medicare. Right now, \nyou have one class. Everybody knows what he or she has to pay. Under \nthe new program, we are going to classify you and have a lot of \ndifferent strata here. There are different low-income benefits for \nthose under 135 percent of the poverty level--$12,123, single--and \nanother set of benefits for those under 150 percent of poverty--\n$13,470.\n  On top of that, to receive the low-income benefits, a senior has to \nundergo an asset test. Again, hang on here, folks. We will see if we \ncan understand this. We will have a little test afterward. For those at \n135 percent of the poverty level and below, the asset test is $6,000 \nfor a single person, $9,000 for a couple. For the group at 150 percent \nof poverty and below, the asset test is different. In this group, a \nperson cannot have more than $10,000 in assets, or $20,000 for a \ncouple. Follow me?\n  So what you are going to have is this. I predict this is exactly what \nis going to happen. You are going to have seniors at the senior citizen \ncenter, or at the local McDonald's having a cup of coffee; and old Bob \nis going to say: You know, this thing they passed is a pretty good \ndeal. I am getting all my free drugs and stuff like that. His friend, \nSue, is sitting there and she might say: What are you talking about? I \njust took a job at the local supermarket bagging groceries or stocking \nshelves; I am retired and have Social Security, but I need to make ends \nmeet and pay for my drugs. Because I took that extra job to help make \nends meet, to pay for heating bills, to meet my drug costs--I took this \njob that doesn't pay a heck of a lot--minimum wage--but because I got \nbumped up a little, I don't get the same benefits you get, Bob. And \nMargaret, who is sitting there, thought she was going to get the low-\nincome benefits, but she filled out her forms and found out she had too \nmuch life insurance, over $10,000 in life insurance. She cannot afford \nher medicine, but her life insurance is considered an asset.\n  If you are going to go to McDonald's in the morning and you are \nsitting and having coffee, they are going to talk about this. But for \nthe spread of $25 a year--maybe $50 a year--one person will get great \nbenefits and the other person won't. You tell me if this is not a \nformula for an uprising among the elderly. It is not rich and poor. I \nam talking about people who make $13,470 a year, or they make a little \nless than that.\n  Or $12,123 versus $12,150. That is the kind of difference you are \ngoing to have, and that is going to decide what you get. Then they are \ngoing to say: You know, old John over there is getting those low-income \nbenefits, but, by gosh, he is cheating because I know he owns something \nelse. He owns a better car than what he said or he has a little \nsomething stashed away someplace. How do we get those low-income \nbenefits? We know he has more than that.\n  It is going to arouse suspicion among the elderly: Why do you get a \nbetter benefit than I get? We are both in the same boat, and you make \n50 bucks more a year than I do and you get all these benefits and I \ndon't.\n  Hang on to your hats. It is going to happen.\n  How are they going to know where they fit in? You will have several \npeople who make nearly the same amount of money each year and they \nreceive drastically different benefits. This is a formula for confusion \nand confrontation among the elderly.\n  Right now, there is only one group. When you have Part A deductible, \nyou all pay. When you have a Part B premium of $66.60, everybody pays \nit. When you have deductible of $100, everybody pays it. When you have \na Part B cost share of 20 percent, everybody pays it.\n  When they sit around McDonald's having their coffee in the morning, \nBob isn't suspecting that Joe is getting away with something or that \nSue maybe has a little something extra, and Margaret who took that job \nat the supermarket to have a little extra money doesn't feel as if she \nis discriminated against because she has a little extra pocket change. \nThey all pay the same.\n\n[[Page S15556]]\n\n  Wait until this program heads south. You just wait. You just wait and \nsee what happens.\n  I don't know, did the authors of this bill deliberately design a \nsystem that is going to fail, that does more harm than good? There were \na thousand pages delivered to us on Thursday. The drug and health \nindustries are spending millions to ram this bill through immediately, \neven though seniors across the Nation don't know what is in it.\n  What is the rush, I ask again? It doesn't go into effect until 2006. \nWhat is the rush? Why must we pass this bill before seniors have had a \nchance to examine the provisions and voice their views?\n  I saw this cartoon in a newspaper from Newark, NJ. This is the \ncartoon. Here is the pharmacy and the pharmacist. This, obviously, is a \nsenior citizen who has come in. She has a prescription to fill out. The \npharmacist represents Congress. He is saying to her: Have a seat. It'll \nbe ready in 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  That is what we are saying: Have a seat; in 2\\1/2\\ years, this will \nbe ready. Why do we have to rush it through right now? Why do we have \nto fill the prescription now if she doesn't get it for 2\\1/2\\ years? \nMaybe we ought to write the prescription later on, next year after we \nhave had a chance to really look at it.\n  I think seniors in this country deserve more. They deserve to be put \nfirst in the process. They have been given short shrift in this process \nby the corporate special interests who have a very different view about \nthe direction of Medicare. As I said earlier this week, the stocks of \npharmaceutical companies and health insurance stocks have gone up.\n  Maybe a lot of seniors assume that AARP would stand up for their \ninterests; that AARP would come in here and stick up for them. But \nAARP, the American Association for Retired Persons, has brazenly \nbetrayed the wishes of its members on this issue. Seniors with whom I \nhave spoken from all across Iowa do not like this bill.\n  AARP came to Iowa late this summer and had three big town meetings on \nthis drug bill. Several hundred people showed up. I was told when AARP \npresented it, they presented the House version and the Senate version, \nas we passed them, in a straightforward manner without editorializing \nwhether one was better or worse or good or bad.\n  After presenting this to several hundred Iowans in three different \nlocations, at every meeting, they asked the 200 to 250 people who \nshowed up, all senior citizens: How many of you would sign up for this \nplan? Do you know how many hands were raised? Zero. Not one hand went \nup. Not one hand. Now AARP is saying this is a great bill. I don't know \nwith whom they talked. When they talked to the elderly in Iowa, they \ndidn't get any takers.\n  My constituents want an affordable, reliable benefit under the \ntraditional Medicare Program. Seniors across the country agree. A poll \nreleased this week found that almost two-thirds of seniors view this \nbill unfavorably. Most of them identify themselves as AARP members. \nAmong those, only 18 percent said Congress should pass the bill; 65 \npercent said Congress should go back to work on this bill. They need to \nknow the direction Medicare is taking and whose side AARP is on.\n  It says everything about this bill that Newt Gingrich is urging \nRepublicans to vote in favor of it. For those of you who have forgotten \nwho Newt Gingrich is, he was Speaker of the House and was the one who \nuttered the famous phrase: It was his desire to let Medicare ``wither \non the vine.''\n  Mr. Gingrich is one of those ideologs who insists the private \nmarketplace will solve all the problems. It would make his day to see \nMedicare dismantled through privatization, and that is exactly why he \nis pulling out the stops in lobbying for this bill--because under this \nbill, Medicare not only withers on the vine, it is cut away from the \nvine.\n  This bill is a realization of Newt Gingrich's fondest dream: to end \nMedicare as we know it. I might also say that Newt Gingrich made no \nbones about it. He wanted to privatize Social Security--privatize it, \nput it out on the stock market. That is next. But he sees this as the \nfirst step to that privatization.\n  The newspapers have been full of accounts of Mr. Gingrich's ``pull \nout the stops'' lobbying for this bill. He says:\n\n       Every conservative Member of Congress should vote for this \n     Medicare bill.\n\n  I submit, if Newt Gingrich is for this bill, that is a serious red \nflag. That ought to raise a lot of questions because, as I said, Mr. \nGingrich has made no bones about it--I give him marks for honesty--he \nhas said time and time again that Medicare ought to wither on the vine; \nwe ought to privatize Social Security. Not only does it privatize \nMedicare, it is a bonanza for Mr. Gingrich's corporate friends, the big \nmoney corporate interests.\n  This bill is like Christmas in November for Mr. Gingrich's corporate \nfriends. It allows people to sock away thousands of dollars a year in \ntax-free medical savings accounts. Of course, the people from where I \ncome don't have money for tax-tree accounts. It will be used mostly by \nthe wealthy, not low-income seniors. Newt Gingrich is ecstatic. This \nMedicare bill is yet another tax cut bill with the benefits flowing \noverwhelmingly to the wealthy.\n  Here is more of what Mr. Gingrich has to say about this Medicare \nbill:\n\n       I think this is one of the great historic moments in moving \n     the Nation in a conservative direction.\n\n  He said--get this--this is Newt Gingrich:\n\n       If you are a fiscal conservative who cares about balancing \n     the Federal budget, there may be no more important vote in \n     your career than one in support of this bill.\n\n  I guess as a supply-side zealot, he believes that the tax-cut \nprovisions in this bill will help us balance the budget. That is \nbizarre. That is just bizarre. They just want to privatize Medicare. \nThat is all they want to do.\n  They want to privatize Social Security. Mr. Gingrich claims that the \nshift towards medical savings accounts would be ``the largest change in \nhealth policy in 60 years.''\n  He made this claim to a gathering of his right-wing anti-tax \nenthusiasts at the Americans for Tax Reform headquarters in Washington. \nOf course, the head of Americans for Tax Reform, Mr. Grover Norquist, \nis famous for saying, ``My goal is to cut government in half, to get it \ndown to the size where we can drag it in the bathroom and drown it in \nthe bathtub.''\n  That includes Medicare and Social Security. That is part of his \ngovernment. That is what he wants to drown in the bathtub.\n  So it is no wonder that Mr. Gingrich and his right-wing friends love \nthis bill. Not only does it undermine a Government program that they \ndespise; even better, it serves up another fat tax cut for the rich. \nOnly the wealthy and healthy will benefit from this bill.\n  Mr. Gingrich is outspoken in his belief that pharmaceutical companies \nare getting unfair treatment and they are punished by their success. \nWell, Mr. Gingrich, that is wrong. This bill does not ask one penny \nfrom the pharmaceutical companies. In fact, it protects drug companies \nfrom Government efforts to negotiate lower costs. I am the first to \nsupport drug research and development, but the Medicare burden should \nnot be taken solely out of the pockets of seniors and taxpayers.\n  In closing, I would have to ask: Exactly why are Newt Gingrich and \nAARP in the same bed? That seems odd. What are they up to? AARP's \nslogan is ``the power to make it better.'' They claim to represent \nAmerican seniors. However, millions of seniors are furious that AARP \nhas endorsed this lousy bill. As I said earlier, a Peter Hart poll \nfound almost two-thirds of seniors viewed the bill unfavorably, and \nmost of those were AARP members. Among AARP members, only 18 percent \nsaid we should pass this bill, while 65 percent said we had to go back \nto work on it.\n  Yesterday, AARP members from Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania \ntore up their membership cards in front of their organization's \nWashington headquarters. AARP's Web site community message board is \nfilled with outraged comments. Members are accusing William Novelli, \nCEO of AARP, of selling out to conservatives and Newt Gingrich.\n  Now, where, I wonder did they get that idea? In fact, the \nrelationship between Newt Gingrich and the bigwigs at AARP goes way \nback. William Novelli, executive director of AARP, wrote the preface to \nNewt Gingrich's book, ``Saving Lives, Saving Money.''\n\n[[Page S15557]]\n\nIn that preface, Mr. Novelli states that: Newt's ideas are influencing \nhow we at AARP are thinking about our national role in health promotion \nand disease prevention and in our advocating for systems change. That \nis Mr. Novelli's preface in Newt Gingrich's book.\n  Well, I have to ask: Which of Newt's ideas are ``influencing how we \nat AARP are thinking''? Is it Newt's fond wish that Medicare ``wither \non the vine''?\n  No wonder members of AARP feel so betrayed. I too feel betrayed that \nAARP's leaders have chosen to endorse the right-wing principles of this \nMedicare bill and endorse Newt Gingrich's ideas of how to undermine and \nprivatize our Nation's health care system.\n  AARP's endorsement is disturbing for another reason. They have a \nflagrant conflict of interest in this matter. Bear in mind AARP \nreceives vast revenues from the sale of insurance to seniors. Royalties \nfrom such arrangements include deals with United Health Care Insurance \nCompany, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and Advanced PSC Pharmacy \nBenefit Management, accounted for more than one-third of AARP's $636 \nmillion in revenues last year, according to AARP's 2002 annual report. \nThere we have it. AARP is looking at the insurance end of it, of \ncourse.\n\n  American seniors deserve better from the AARP and from Congress. They \ndeserve a bill that includes an affordable prescription drug plan, that \nstrengthens Medicare, that does not penalize the sickest and the \npoorest in our Nation.\n  This bill reflects the priorities of this Republican administration \nand of Newt Gingrich who have been hostile to Medicare since its \ninception. This bill needs to be written by individuals and groups that \nbelieve in Medicare, not those who want to undermine it. Seniors know \nthat this bill is a betrayal. They know who the winners and losers are \nwith this bill.\n  Under premium support, HMOs, PPOs, and pharmaceutical companies, they \nwin; seniors and the disabled lose. Under cost containment, the private \ncompanies win; the seniors and disabled lose. Under drug coverage, \npharmaceutical companies win; seniors lose. Under health savings \naccounts, the wealthy HMOs win; seniors and disabled lose. Under the \nso-called stabilization fund, this slush fund, HMOs, PPOs, and \npharmaceutical companies win; seniors and the disabled lose. Under so-\ncalled competition--boy, there is a misnomer if I have ever heard it--\nHMOs, PPOs, and pharmaceutical companies win; seniors and disabled \nlose.\n  The seniors know this. Again, it is a question of priorities. This \nadministration rammed through this Congress $1.6 trillion in tax cuts. \nNow they say they cannot take care of the elderly who have worked their \nentire lives, contributed to their communities and served this country. \nOnce again, the administration has made a clear choice. They have \nchosen the folks on Wall Street over the folks on Main Street.\n  It is a big deal. I got to thinking the other day. I talked about how \nmy father, during the Depression--I was born November 19, 1939. I just \nhad my birthday this week. In 1939, my father was out of work. He had a \nwife, five kids, and one on the way. I was the sixth one. He had no \nmoney. He had an eighth grade education. My mother was an immigrant who \nhad no formal education. They lived in a small house in a small town in \nrural Iowa, and my father had no hope. He was already 54 years old, had \nworked in the coal mines most of his life, and the only thing they had \nwas this tiny little house in this small town.\n  As I walk out of my door every day, I have on my wall a little framed \norange piece of paper. It is dated July 19, 1939, 4 months to the day \nbefore I was born. On that orange piece of paper, it is printed and it \nsays: You, Patrick F. Harkin--that is my father--are to report to work \nat once as a laborer on a project, $48.30 a month. It was signed by \nsomebody, and then my father signed it--4 months to the day before I \nwas born. It was his WPA form when my father went to work on a WPA \nproject.\n  Now, I look at that because I remember once George Bush, when he was \na candidate for President, said: Government cannot give hope to people. \nEvery day when I walk out of my office and I look at that piece of \npaper, I say: Mr. Bush, you are wrong. If it had not been for Franklin \nRoosevelt and the New Deal, I do not know what would have happened to \nmy family and my father. They gave him a job. They gave him hope.\n  Years later, when I was in high school, my father took me to some of \nthose projects he built. One of them was at Lake Okoboji. It is still \nin use as a recreational facility in Iowa; a high school in Indianola \nis still being used today built by WPA. Why do I say that? Because I \ngot to thinking about the new deal and I got to thinking, it was a \nGovernment program, Roosevelt's New Deal. Who was the benefactor? The \nunemployed. To my father, who had no hope, it gave him hope and it gave \nhim a job.\n\n  Then we had Truman's Fair Deal, and who benefited from that? The \nuninsured and low-wage workers.\n  Today we have a new Government program that they are trying to push \non us, Bush's Big Deal. Not the New Deal, not the Fair Deal, but the \nBig Deal. Who wins? The HMOs, big pharmaceutical companies and private \nhealth plans. I call it the Big Deal because the bigger you are, the \nbetter the deal. Compare that to Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and \nHarry Truman's Fair Deal, that reached down and helped bring people up. \nNo, today we have the Big Deal: the bigger you are the better the deal.\n  This is a radical departure for Medicare. It changes the nature of \nthis program as an entitlement. The conferees set an arbitrary cap on \nhow much Medicare money can be spent. Instead of a cap, we ought to \njust be spending the money more wisely. We ought to be spending less on \nHMO subsidies, less on subsidies to the pharmaceutical companies, and \nmore on preventive health care, keeping our seniors more healthy, \ngetting them better diets and better exercise--more preventive health \ncare to keep them healthy.\n  This is an article called ``Entitlement Change Is Inevitable, Key \nAdministration Officials Say.'' They went on to say: ``In the long run, \nSocial Security cannot meet its commitments.''\n  That seems to be the constant refrain we hear from this \nadministration. Social Security cannot meet its commitments. Of course \nnot; we just took the huge surplus that had been built up under the \nClinton administration and we squandered it on tax breaks for the \nwealthy.\n  I say again, the amount of money going out in tax breaks to the \nwealthy in our country that was passed in 2001 and 2003, over the next \n75 years, is three times more than what is necessary to ``save Social \nSecurity and Medicare.'' Don't tell me that the money is not there and \nthat Social Security can't meet its commitments. It can't meet its \ncommitments now because we squandered all the money on tax breaks for \nthe wealthy. Sure, Medicare is headed for a train wreck, but it is a \ntrain wreck planned and plotted by this administration.\n  You can be sure as soon as this bill is out of the road they are \ngoing to start on Social Security. Headline: ``Bush Pushes For Expanded \nPrivate Role in Medicare.'' That is what it is all about.\n\n       ``The foundation of this . . . compromise--is a level \n     playing field between Medicare and private plans,'' said \n     Senator Edward Kennedy. ``What conservative Republicans are \n     now trying to do is rig the system in a way that would coerce \n     senior citizens away from Medicare and into private plans.''\n\n  Senator Kennedy said it right.\n  To be fair it is not just Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Bush who are hostile \nto the Medicare Program. Many others share their views.\n  The junior Senator from Pennsylvania and third ranking Republican, \nMr. Santorum, said--I believe this is a direct quote:\n\n       I believe the standard benefit through the traditional \n     Medicare program has to be phased out.\n\n  That is the third ranking Republican on that side of the aisle.\n\n  The junior Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, has said:\n\n       Medicare is a disaster. Medicare will have to be \n     overhauled. Let's create a whole new system.\n\n  Tom Scully, head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid, the top \nMedicare official in the Bush administration, said this about Medicare; \nhe called it ``an unbelievable disaster'' and a ``dumb system.''\n  Medicare is not a disaster or a dumb system in the eyes of millions \nof seniors who rely on it every single day. As\n\n[[Page S15558]]\n\nI said, this is too big an issue to address in a day or 2 days.\n  We have to act now, we are told.\n  Nonsense. The provisions in this bill don't kick in until 2006. We \nreceived the bill on Thursday, this right here. We received it this \nmorning on our desks. We didn't have time to look at it. We ought to \nwithdraw the bill, get it out to the public, and bring it back for \nconsideration in February. That will allow time for seniors back home \nto analyze it, discuss it, and share their views with Members of \nCongress. Then we can take an informed vote on this bill, taking into \nconsideration the views of seniors in our respective States.\n  This is the Senate, supposedly the world's greatest deliberative \nbody. We can take more time, as we did last week, in going all day and \nall night and all day and all night, talking about four judges who were \nheld up--we can take more time to do that than we can to debate and \ndiscuss this profound change in Medicare in the United States. What \ndoes that say about the state of affairs in the Senate today? Oh, yes, \nwe can deliberate over four judges--168 that got approved and 4 that \ndidn't. We can talk about that for days or weeks on end. But, no, to \ndiscuss this profound change in Medicare we take Saturday and Sunday \nand vote on Monday.\n  The Senate has ceased being the world's most deliberative body. It is \nnow the world's most rushed body: Rush it through, stampede it, and get \nit done. This is a complex, confusing, bureaucratic nightmare of a \nbill. It is a bad bill procedurally.\n  This bill contains untested experimental privatization plans that \nespecially threaten seniors in rural areas. To top it off, it offers \nyet another big tax break for wealthy Americans.\n  There is supposedly a fix in this bill for the disparities. There is \nsupposed to be fairness, in terms of addressing the disparity between \nthe States, in reimbursement for Medicare on a per beneficiary basis.\n  I have taken the floor many times to talk about how Iowa is No. 50 in \nthe Nation in the per beneficiary reimbursement for Medicare. So Iowa \nhas been 50th out of 50 States.\n  This bill was supposed to have a fix in it to make it more fair. So \nthey put, I think, $25 billion into this bill to make it more fair over \nthe next 10 years. Right now, the per beneficiary reimbursement in \nLouisiana is $7,336. In Iowa it is $3,053. In Virginia it is $4,611.\n  I say to the occupant of the chair, the citizens of Virginia pay the \nsame Medicare taxes as anybody else in this country. Yet the seniors in \nVirginia get back $4,611 per beneficiary, the seniors in New York get \n$6,924; the seniors in Texas get $6,539; the seniors in Maryland, right \nnext-door, get $6,301, but in Virginia they only get $4,611 per \nbeneficiary. In Iowa it is $3,053. Yet we pay the same Medicare taxes.\n  So we have been fighting for a long time to try to straighten this \nsystem out and make it a little bit more fair.\n  They put some money in the bill. But guess what they did--they made \nit worse because what they basically did is they kind of gave a \npercentage increase. You know how that works.\n  If you get $100 and I get $10 and we get a 10-percent increase, you \nget a lot more money than I get. Right now, Iowa, we are 50th. \nLouisiana is first in terms of how much money they get per beneficiary. \nNow we are 50th. The disparity in payments for seniors between Iowa and \nLouisiana is $4,685. In other words, a beneficiary in Iowa gets $4,685 \nless. We get less in reimbursement per beneficiary than it cost \nLouisiana. Under this bill, supposedly meant to fix this, Iowa is still \nlast. We are number 50th. The disparity has gone from $4,685 per \nbeneficiary to $5,017 per beneficiary. It is worse. This was supposed \nto be fairness?\n  There are some who will say that Iowa, in terms of the beneficiary \nand the amount of money they got, is 13th. That is all right. It may be \n13th. But other States are more.\n  As you can see, it increases the disparity rather than lessening it. \nThat is what we want to do--lessen the disparity in the States.\n  Lastly, the Washington Post this morning said it all. ``2 Bills Would \nBenefit Top Bush Fundraisers.''\n\n       At least 24 Rangers and Pioneers could benefit from the \n     Medicare bills as executives of companies or lobbyists \n     working for them, including 8 clients affected by both bills.\n\n  Meaning the Energy bill. ``Pioneer'' is someone, I guess, who raises \n$100,000 for the President, and ``Ranger'' is someone who raises \n$200,000 for the President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               2 Bills Would Benefit Top Bush Fundraisers\n\n                         (By Thomas B. Edsall)\n\n       More than three dozen of President Bush's major fundraisers \n     are affiliated with companies that stand to benefit from the \n     passage of two central pieces of the administration's \n     legislative agenda: the energy and Medicare bills.\n       The energy bill provides billions of dollars in benefits to \n     companies run by at least 22 executives and their spouses who \n     have qualified as either ``Pioneers'' or ``Rangers,'' as well \n     as to the clients of at least 15 lobbyists and their spouses \n     who have achieved similar status as fundraisers. At least 24 \n     Rangers and Pioneers could benefit from the Medicare bill as \n     executives of companies or lobbyists working for them, \n     including eight who have clients affected by both bills.\n       By its latest count, Bush's reelection campaign has \n     designated more than 300 supporters as Pioneers or Rangers. \n     The Pioneers were created by the Bush campaign in 2000 to \n     reward supporters who brought in at least $100,000 in \n     contributions. For his reelection campaign, Bush has set a \n     goal of raising as much as $200 million, almost twice what he \n     raised three years ago, and established the designation of \n     Ranger for those who raise at lest $200,000.\n       With the size of donations limited as a result of the \n     campaign finance law enacted last year, fundraisers who can \n     collect $100,000 or more in contributions of $2,000 or less \n     have become key players this election cycle. The law barred \n     the political parties from collecting large--sometimes \n     reaching $5 million to $10 million--``soft money'' \n     contributions from businesses, unions, trade associations and \n     individuals. This has put a premium on those who can solicit \n     dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of smaller contributions \n     from employees, clients and associates.\n       The energy and Medicare bills were drafted with the \n     cooperation of representatives from dozens of industries. \n     Power and energy company officials; railroad CEOs' \n     pharmaceutical, hospital association and insurance company \n     executives; and the lobbyists who represent them are among \n     those who have supported the bills and whose companies would \n     benefit from their passage.\n       The Medicare bill was scheduled to be acted upon by the \n     House late last night. If passed, it will go to the Senate. \n     The first comprehensive revision of energy policy in more \n     than a decade passed the House this week, but in the Senate, \n     the measure ran into a roadblock yesterday when opponents \n     stopped it from coming to a vote. Sponsors promised to make \n     further efforts to get the 60 votes to break the filibuster.\n       The energy bill provides industry tax breaks worth $23.5 \n     billion over 10 years aimed at increasing domestic oil and \n     gas production, and $5.4 billion in subsidies and loan \n     guarantees. The bill also grants legal protections to gas \n     producers using the additive methyl tertiary-butyl ether \n     (MTBE), whose manufacturers face a wave of lawsuits, and it \n     repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA), a \n     mainstay of consumer protection that limits mergers of \n     utilities.\n       The bill has been the focus of a bitter ideological and \n     partisan fight for three years. A leading sponsor, Rep. W.J. \n     ``Billy'' Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and \n     Commerce Committee, praised the legislation, saying, ``All \n     Americans can look forward to cleaner and more affordable \n     energy, reliable electricity and reduced dependence on \n     foreign oil for generations to come.''\n       Public Citizen, which has tracked the legislation and \n     correlated patterns of contributions to members of Congress \n     and to Bush, denounced the bill as ``a national energy policy \n     developed in secret by corporate executives and a few members \n     of Congress who are showered in special interest money.''\n       Perhaps the single biggest winner in the energy bill, \n     according to lobbyists and critics, is the Southern Co. One \n     of the Nation's largest electricity producers, it serves \n     120,000 square miles through subsidiaries Alabama Power, \n     Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah \n     Electric, along with a natural gas and nuclear plant \n     subsidiary.\n       The repeal of PUHCA, for example, would create new \n     opportunities to buy or sell facilities; ``participation'' \n     rules determining how utilities share the costs of new \n     transmission lines that are particularly favorable to \n     Southern; two changes in depreciation schedules for gas \n     pipelines and electricity transmission lines with a 10-year \n     revenue loss to the Treasury of $2.8 billion; and changes in \n     the tax consequences of decommissioning nuclear plants, at a \n     10-year revenue loss of $1.5 billion, according to the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation.\n       At least five Bush Pioneers serve as a Southern Co. \n     executive or as its lobbyists: Southern Executive Vice \n     President Dwight H. Evans; Roger Windham Wallace of the \n     lobbying firm Public Strategies; Rob Leebern of\n\n[[Page S15559]]\n\n     the firm Troutman Sanders; Lanny Griffith of the firm Barbour \n     Griffith and Rogers; and Ray Cole, of the firm Van Scoyoc \n     Associates.\n       The railroad industry also has a vital interest in the \n     energy bill. For years, it has been fighting for the \n     elimination of a 4.3 cent-a-gallon tax on diesel fuel, and, \n     at a cost to the Treasury of $1.7 billion over 10 years, the \n     measure repeals the tax. Richard Davidson, chairman and CEO \n     of Union Pacific, is a Ranger, and Matthew K. Rose, CEO of \n     Burlington Northern, is a Pioneer.\n       Among the major lobbying firms in Washington, Akin Gump \n     Strauss Hauer & Feld has been one of the most successful \n     collecting fees for work on the energy and Medicare bills. In \n     the first six months of this year, Akin Gump, which has two \n     partners who are Prioneers--Bill Paxon and James C. Langdon \n     Jr.--received $1.6 million in fees from medical and energy \n     interests.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I apologize to my fellow Senators. I have \ntaken a long time. I have taken over 1 hour and 15 minutes, I believe. \nBut I believe we ought to take a lot longer than that. I think we ought \nto get this bill out of here, send it into the countryside, let people \nsee it, and come back in February rather than taking Sunday, Monday, \nTuesday. Let us, as I said, take a week or two to get into this bill, \ndebate it, discuss it, and yes; and amend it if we need to, rather than \nbeing ramroded through as they are doing.\n  If the seniors reject it, then we can reject it and go back to the \ndrawing board. We should not at the eleventh hour when people want to \ngo home for Thanksgiving be stampeded to support a bad bill, a bill \nthat will destroy Medicare as we know it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri is anxious to speak. He is going to visit his son who is \ncoming home on leave from the Marine Corps.\n  I will be very quick. Following the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer, our next speaker will be Senator Lincoln. Tomorrow, the \nDemocrats, other than those we have already lined up--the last Member \nwe lined up I believe was Senator Kerry--would be Senators Wyden, \nLevin, Kennedy, Murray, Dorgan, Corzine, and Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nask a question. In the process of reserving the right to object, I want \nto know how much time has been used on the respective sides.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the Parliamentarian. The \nopponents of this legislation have approximately 2 hours left tonight \nbefore 11 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 3 hours 57 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Nevada, the assistant Democratic \nleader, is correct in his estimate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following Senator Akaka, we would like to \nhave Senators Johnson, Dayton, Bingaman, and Bill Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the Chair is \nprepared to rule.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may go out of \norder to speak for 5 minutes prior to Senator Hatch, and then Senator \nHatch may be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am most grateful to my colleagues. I have \nbeen here on the floor for 3 scintillating hours, and I have other \ncommitments that I have to make.\n  Early this morning the House passed historic bipartisan legislation \nto improve and strengthen the Medicare program and give all seniors \naccess to prescription drug coverage. Seniors will finally receive the \nprescription drug coverage they need and the health care security they \ndeserve.\n  This Medicare conference report is a compromise in the truest sense \nof the word. It is not perfect--some on the far left don't like it and \nsome on the far right don't like it either. But I will tell you who \ndoes like it: The AARP--this agreement has been endorsed by the leading \nvoice for older Americans--representing 35 million members nationwide \nand 743,000 members in my home State of Missouri. As well as the \nhospitals, doctors, other health care providers and employers.\n  Why do these groups support this bill? Because in AARP's own words, \n``This is about getting vital help to people that need it most.''\n  Before I talk about some of the strengths on this bill I wanted to \ntake this opportunity to address some of the criticism from my friends \non the other side of the aisle. I have heard some Members say that this \nbill ``keeps drug prices high.''\n  That is untrue. Seniors will realize significant savings off their \ncurrent drug bills under this bill. In 2004-2005, senior citizens will \nreceive a Prescription Drug Discount Card that the Department of Health \n& Human Services--HHS--estimates will cut drug costs by up to 25 \npercent.\n  In 2006, the prescription drug benefit is added to Medicare that HHS \nestimates will help seniors currently without coverage save up to half \noff what they're paying today. For the typical senior who spends $1,285 \na year on prescription drugs, more than $640 they get to keep in their \npocket translates into significant savings.\n  Lastly, the bipartisan Medicare plan also ensures generic drugs, less \nexpensive than brand-name pharmaceuticals, are moved to market much \nfaster to help hold down costs.\n  I have heard some members say that this bill will ``cause two to \nthree million retirees to lose drug coverage.'' This bill contains $88 \nbillion worth of employer incentives to help protect retirees' private \ncoverage. This bill will actually strengthen the safety net for seniors \nby providing financial incentives for employers to continue offering \nprescription drug coverage for their retirees.\n  This marks the first time that Medicare will provide a federal \nsubsidy of 28 percent of beneficiaries' drug costs between $250 to \n$5,000--up to $1,330 per beneficiary. This subsidy is excluded from \ntaxation, providing another incentive for employers to offer coverage.\n  Lastly, qualified retiree plans have maximum flexibility on plan \ndesign, formularies and networks, and allows employers to wrap-around \nMedicare coverage options. That is why the AARP and major employer \ngroups, such as the National Association of Manufacturers, Employers' \nCoalition on Medicare, Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable, \nendorse the bipartisan Medicare plan. Some Members have said this bill \nis ``bad for seniors'' and cited a recent Consumers Union report.\n  Truth is this Medicare bill provides help to the two groups that need \nit most--low income seniors, and seniors with high drug costs. Even \nConsumers Union acknowledges that low-income seniors ``will be eligible \nfor substantial subsidies for their prescription drugs.'' Consumers \nUnion also acknowledges that seniors with catastrophic drug \nexpenditures get ``measurable relief'' under the bill, which will cover \n95 percent of a senior's drug costs over $3,600. In other words, the \nMedicare bill provides help to the two groups that need it most--low \nincome seniors, and seniors with high drug costs.\n  And finally some have claimed that this Medicare bill will destroys \nMedicare as we know it and privatize the whole program. That is one of \nmy personal favorites. Bottom line is the AARP would never endorse a \nbill that privatizes or in any way destroys the Medicare program \nperiod.\n  I will support this bill because it is the first major upgrade to \nMedicare in 38 years, providing help to the two groups that need it \nmost--low income seniors, and seniors with high drug costs.\n  For nearly four decades, Medicare has provided peace of mind and \nhealth care security for millions of seniors. Yet, increasingly this \ncherished program is no longer meeting the security needs of our \nseniors. Medicine has advanced exponentially since 1965, but the \nMedicare Program has not kept pace. When Medicare was launched 38 years \nago, modern medicine meant surgery and hospitalization--and that is \nwhat Medicare covers.\n  Today, doctors routinely treat their patients with prescription \ndrugs, preventive care and groundbreaking medical devices--but Medicare \nhas not kept pace with these changes.\n  For example, today Medicare covers only about half of the typical \nseniors'\n\n[[Page S15560]]\n\nhealth care costs. Medicare lacks good preventive coverage, wellness \ncare, and chronic disease management. It doesn't even cover the costs \nof an annual physical. It does not protect against large, catastrophic \nhealth costs should serious illness strike. And we all know that it \ndoes not cover outpatient prescription drugs.\n  Additionally, the program faces serious financial and demographic \npressures in the coming years. Between now and 2030 the number of \nseniors will nearly double from 40 million to 77 million. The program's \ncosts will more than double to nearly $450 billion annually, even \nbefore we add prescription drug coverage or improve other benefits. And \nthe number of taxpayers paying into the system to finance health \ncoverage for seniors will drop from 4 today to 2.4 by 2030. This \nunderscores the need to act and the need to act responsibly. We need to \nimprove the program for today's seniors but we also need to put in \nplace a more stable structure that will provide health care security \nfor generations to come.\n  My goal is and has always been to give seniors the best, most \ninnovative care. This will require a strong, up-to-date Medicare system \nthat relies on innovation and competition, not bureaucratic rules, \nprice controls and regulation.\n  The bill before us takes a bold new step and is an important \nachievement in the effort to strengthen and improve Medicare and \nprovide meaningful prescription drug benefits to seniors. This bill \noffers beneficiaries a meaningful and reliable drug benefit through the \nprivate sector, with reasonable and fair cost-sharing. Beneficiaries \nwill have the ability to receive the drugs of their choice without \ngovernment interference and with better coverage options.\n  Most importantly, it will provide prescription drug coverage at \nlittle costs to those who need it most--people with low incomes. It \nwill provide substantial relief to those with very high drug costs and \nrelief to millions more. In a country as prosperous as ours, we can no \nlonger tolerate situations where seniors have to split their pills in \nhalf or cannot fill necessary prescriptions because they can't afford \nthe vital drugs they need.\n  This bill ensures access to drug benefits for beneficiaries who live \nin rural areas. Reliable coverage will be available everywhere in \nMissouri--wherever there is Medicare coverage, there will be \nprescription drug coverage.\n  As we work to implement this new Medicare benefit, this bill will \nprovide immediate prescription drug assistance for beneficiaries \nthrough a temporary drug discount card available to seniors 6 months \nafter the bill is signed into law.\n  This discount card is expected to yield a savings of between 10 and \n25 percent. Some of our most vulnerable seniors would receive an \nadditional $600 subsidy annually to assist with the purchase of \nprescription drugs. This drug card would be available until the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit is fully implemented in 2006. Adding \nvital prescription drug coverage is not the only thing that we are \ndoing to improve Medicare coverage for seniors.\n  Medical experts long ago learned that preventive care extends and \nimproves quality of life. The bill before us today adds vital \npreventive care, wellness services, and chronic care management. This \nlong overdue step will keep seniors healthy and will save money and \nmost importantly save lives.\n  This bill also includes $25 billion in new assistance to ensure \npatient access to hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, \nespecially in rural areas. The Medicare bill corrects existing rural \ninequities by infusing billions of dollars over the next decade into \nrural and small towns as well as small hospitals everywhere.\n  Admittedly I remain concerned about the magnitude of the reductions \nin payments for cancer care included in the bill. I hope to work with \nthe Senate leadership as well as Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus \nmoving forward to ensure that these cuts do not threaten access to \ncancer care for patients in Missouri and across the country.\n  We must bring Medicare into the 21st century: add a prescription drug \nbenefit, expand coverage, improve services, and give seniors more \ncontrol over the health care they receive.\n  This week we are poised to make historic changes with bipartisan \nsupport to improve the Medicare Program, to strengthen it for seniors \nand to preserve and protect it for future generations.\n  I want to say why I am in favor of this Medicare conference report. I \nthink that Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus, in a bipartisan \ncoalition, came up with a great compromise. Nobody should be surprised \nthat it makes enemies left and right. That is what a compromise or a \nmoderate proposal does.\n  I will tell you one group that is for it. That is the AARP, with 35 \nmillion members nationwide. There are 743,000 seniors in my State who \nhave been deeply involved in the preparations of this legislation. They \nsay it is a good deal because it is about getting the vital help to \npeople who need it most.\n  I was a little amused hearing some of the folks on the other side of \nthe aisle condemning AARP. Generally, AARP may side with the Democrats, \nbut in this instance we have worked with them and on a bipartisan \nbasis. It isn't just Republicans. Now that they endorse a bipartisan \ncompromise, rather than going with the Democrats, they condemn them.\n  Let me just talk about a few of the misconceptions I have heard in \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ hours: Drug prices will be high. There will be a senior \ncitizen discount card with a 15 to 25 percent reduction; $600 for low-\nincome seniors the next couple of years. HHS estimates in 2006 the \ntypical senior will save approximately half of what he is paying today. \nThis plan also ensures the less expensive generic drugs will get the \nmarket faster, helping to hold down the cost.\n  Some have said this is bad for seniors. The truth is that the \nConsumers Union acknowledges it will help the two most needy groups--\nthe low-income seniors and those seniors with high drug costs. These \nare the people who really need the help.\n  Finally, this is the favorite charge: Some have said this is going to \ndestroy Medicare; that it is going to privatize it. That is really one \nof my personal favorites.\n  I think the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, did a wonderful job of \npointing out some of the demagoguery we hear when people talk about \ndestroying Medicare.\n  There are problems in Medicare with the way it is administered. \nSenator Bennett outlined quite a few of those. We can tell you about a \nlot of problems. I have staff people who work all the time helping \npeople sort through Medicare.\n  To say that the Republicans and the Bush administration want to \ndestroy it is a big, fat, flat lie. No matter how many times you repeat \nit, it is not true.\n  The whole purpose of this is to assure that there is a reliable drug \nbenefit and health care benefit for seniors now and in the future. We \nare asking the next generation to pick up the ball for a $400 billion, \n10-year plan that is going to continue to grow, and we owe them the \nsolid viable Medicare program that is still in operation when they \nreach Medicare-eligible age.\n  One of the problems that Senator Collins of Maine discussed which she \nand I have been fighting with the former Health Care Financing \nAdministration, HCFA, is they were ordered to save some money in \nMedicare. They squeezed it down so tightly that instead of saving $16 \nbillion a year, they cut the cost by $64 billion a year, and they threw \none-third of the home health care agencies out of business in Missouri.\n  Seniors could not get the home health care they needed because of \nHCFA. Somebody said the costs are not going up. The problem with \nMedicare is fewer and fewer doctors and hospitals can afford to take it \nbecause the Federal bureaucracy has ground down the reimbursements.\n  Then someone said Newt Gingrich wanted to abolish Medicare or have it \nwither away. That is absolutely flat wrong. Members cannot use that \nform of demagoguery in this body and expect to get away with it. Former \nSpeaker Gingrich said HCFA is a problem. Frankly, I can show case after \ncase after case where HCFA and the bureaucracy were a problem. He \nwanted to change the system so that seniors got good health care and \nyou did not have a bureaucracy ratcheting down\n\n[[Page S15561]]\n\nand controlling prices so rural hospitals such as a hospital in my home \nState could not afford to take seniors and doctors had to say: We \ncannot take any more Medicare patients because we are getting \nreimbursed from Medicare less than it costs us and we cannot give \nbalanced billing so we have to arbitrarily ration on health care to the \nelderly because of the way Medicare is implemented.\n  That is wrong. That is what this bill is going to improve. I hope my \ncolleagues will look at the significant improvements this $400 billion, \n10-year bill will bring to improving health care for seniors and giving \nthe seniors now better health care and assuring that seniors in the \nfuture--the current generation will be paid for--have the health care \nwhen they need it.\n  I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \ncloture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the Chair directs \nthe clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 1, the Medicare Prescription Drug \n     and Modernization Act, an act to amend Title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act to provide for a voluntary prescription \n     drug benefit under the Medicare Program and to strengthen and \n     improve the Medicare Program, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Charles Grassley, John Ensign, Ted Stevens, \n           Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Jon Kyl, John Cornyn, \n           Orrin G. Hatch, Larry Craig, Craig Thomas, Robert F. \n           Bennett, Olympia J. Snowe, Jim Bunning, Christopher \n           Bond, John Warner.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the live \nquorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I regret that it has become necessary to \nfile a cloture motion on this bipartisan legislation being considered \non the floor of the Senate. However, it appears that at this juncture \nwe have no option.\n  I do want to express my deep disappointment that the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has stated he intends to filibuster this landmark \nlegislation. I seriously hope he will reconsider these intentions. His \ndecision is particularly disappointing because it is clear to those of \nus who have followed this debate for the last several months, indeed, \nover the course of the day, that there is a strong bipartisan majority \nin this body in favor of this Medicare prescription drug legislation.\n  I am equally disappointed because it really points to what is going \nto happen to 40 million seniors in America today.\n  They have waited 38 years for what we are about to accomplish, and \nthat is access, affordable access to prescription drugs. Prescription \ndrugs are not a part of Medicare today for those 40 million Americans, \nand they will be once this legislation is passed. They are just moments \naway from what they desperately need, desperately have asked us for, \nand what we have a responsibility to deliver.\n  Senator Kennedy has said that he intends to block the vote or do \neverything within his power to block an up-or-down vote; that he will \nobstruct a bipartisan Senate majority, and that he will stand in the \nway of health care security for these millions of seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  In my own State of Tennessee, there are nearly a quarter million \nseniors who have no prescription drug coverage. There are millions all \nacross the United States for whom this legislation means the difference \nbetween life and death. They simply cannot afford to wait any longer.\n\n  This generation that will be served by this legislation has survived \nthe Depression, has fought in World War II, has helped make the United \nStates into the prosperous Nation that we have. Again and again, they \nhave answered the call. Now is the time for us to fulfill our duty to \nthat generation, many of whom, as we all know, are sick and poor. Now \nis the time for us to answer their call. That is what this legislation \ndoes.\n  Those who would support a filibuster of this bill would hold our \nparents and grandparents, 40 million seniors, hostage to Washington \npolitics. Our seniors simply deserve better.\n  In 1965, when President Johnson signed that Medicare bill into law, \nhe said:\n\n       No longer will this Nation refuse the hand of justice to \n     those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and \n     labor to the progress of this . . . country.\n\n  Let us not stay that hand of justice now. Let us not turn our back on \nAmerica's seniors and individuals with disabilities.\n  Once again, I regret this cloture motion is necessary, but we do need \nto protect our seniors. As I have said, for many this is a life-or-\ndeath issue. They simply cannot wait for help. I hope that, working \nwith the minority leader, we can move toward vitiating this cloture \nmotion at the appropriate time and, working together, schedule an up-\nor-down vote on this vital measure.\n  I implore the senior Senator from Massachusetts to listen to his own \nwords of November 5 this year when he said:\n\n       Senior citizens want help and they want it now. They don't \n     want a partisan deadlock.\n\n  I think he was right then. I believe he is wrong now.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from Utah. If the \nSenator will allow me to ask a couple questions, through the Chair, I \nappreciate the majority leader coming in an hour earlier tomorrow. We \nhave 15 speakers lined up on our side for tomorrow. We are going to try \nto work out some kind of time arrangement. I say to the staff \nlistening, what we would like to do on our side is limit the time to a \nhalf hour each. If anybody has any objection to that, they should call \nhere as soon as they can. Otherwise, it is unfair to people who are at \nthe bottom of the list.\n  I also say to the majority leader, we have gotten a number of calls \ntoday about this being the last item of business before we go home \nuntil January. I know the majority leader is working on that. I hope \nthat is the case. Some of our folks are willing to give up time and do \nvarious things as a result of family obligations they have at home. If \nthey have to come back again after Thanksgiving, I think their family \nobligations will become so paramount that they may not be as \ncooperative as we would like them to be.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Democratic leader and the leadership on \nboth sides of the aisle have been in conversation throughout the day. \nOur intention is to continue to address Medicare aggressively and I \nhave a feeling we will be here for a while tonight to give people an \nopportunity to speak.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to start earlier, and we will run as late as \nnecessary to give people the opportunity to speak.\n  Regarding Monday, I want to warn people a little bit because people \nwho want to speak, I encourage them to come tonight, tomorrow, or \ntomorrow night. Monday, I have a feeling everybody is going to come \nback in and say: I want to speak.\n  In order to complete Medicare on Monday and to address the \nappropriations bills we are working together on, we can address that on \nMonday and Tuesday--to finish business and be gone for good, which is \nwhat we are working toward, so we don't have to come back after \nThanksgiving. That is the objective of both sides of the aisle. It \nmeans we have to continue doing what we have done all day today, \ntomorrow, and Monday. We need to stay focused, keep our remarks short \nenough so everybody can participate. With that, I intend not to have to \ncome back after the Thanksgiving holiday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, briefly, I appreciate very much the majority \nleader mentioning that. We have had people say they want to speak \nMonday. What I have said is that we can have 90 minutes per side on \nMonday. That is my understanding, having spoken to the two leaders. \nPeople will only have very short periods of time because the managers \nwill need to make the paramount arguments on Monday. You are absolutely \nright. For people wanting to come back, the time is going to be very \nminimal. I appreciate that from the majority leader.\n\n[[Page S15562]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have sat here for hours now and listened \nto some of the comments by our colleagues on the other side. They must \nnot have paid any attention to what this bill is all about or any \nattention to what the conferees, who worked day and night, did to put \nthis bill together in a bipartisan way. They must not have paid any \nattention to the words in the bill or paid any attention to their \nrespective caucus meetings where we discussed the aspects of it.\n  When a Senator said this bill is being ramrodded through, I want to \nmake it clear that we have been trying to improve Medicare for 40 \nyears, especially in the last 10, 15 years. That is hardly ramrodding \nit through.\n  This is it. This is the last chance to have prescription drug \nbenefits for our seniors. It is amazing to me how many on the other \nside just want to say no to anything: No to judges. No to prescription \ndrug benefits unless they are way out of sight as far as expenses go. \nNo to any possible private sector improvements that might possibly \nwork. No to all the ideas that Democrats and Republicans have worked \non, 7 o'clock in the morning meetings, 3 o'clock to midnight, in the \nafternoons, day after day after day, week after week. We were not doing \nthat for our fun. We were not doing that for political reasons. We were \nnot doing that to try to hurt one side or the other or to make \npolitical points on one side or the other.\n  We were doing it the best we could to try to come up with a bill that \nwould improve Medicare and get prescription drugs to our seniors who \nneed them, who do not have drug coverage right now, or who do not have \naccess to drugs because they cannot afford to pay for them.\n  We take care of beneficiaries from 150 percent of poverty or less. If \nI had my way, the whole $400 billion would have gone to those at 200 \npercent or 250 percent or less and we would not have made any benefits \nfor people such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, billionaires who can \nafford their own prescription drugs. But no, there is a desire by some \non the other side to have what is called ``universal'' health care. \nThat is, the Federal Government controls everything, pays for \neverything, and we have socialized medicine. Not many people who think \nit through want to go to that extent. That is why they are not getting \ntheir way so they will continue to moan and groan. One of the most \noffensive things of all is the people whom AARP basically have \nsupported through all these year, the Democrats, and some of these \nDemocrats condemning AARP for supporting this legislation.\n  I have seen Democrats stand on the floor and put the AARP's number up \nand tell people to call AARP and tell AARP they are wrong.\n  We are here to make decisions as to what should be done. The \ndecisions cannot always be no, no, no.\n  I have to admit I was irritated with my party in times past because \nwe seemed to say no to everything the Democrats wanted. I will state \nwhat is really behind this. Many of our colleagues who are against this \non the other side just plain do not want President George Bush to get \nany credit for this Medicare reform bill. They cannot tolerate that \nthis President has called for this, has fought for this, has provided a \nclimate for this, has a bureaucracy working for this, has his staff \nworking for this, has helped us every step of the way. Health and Human \nServices Secretary Thompson, as tough as it was to sit in those \nmeetings, said virtually every one of these meetings was tough on him. \nThere were a lot of tough discussions.\n  They are so afraid President Bush might get some credit for enacting \na prescription drug law. President Bush will probably be the last one \nto take credit for it, although he deserves credit for it because he \nhas been a leader who has helped to bring this about. And he would \ndeserve the credit. But so would every Democrat who votes for this. \nAbove all, Senators Baucus and Breaux, who sat through every one of \nthose meetings. They deserve a lot of credit for not letting politics \ndistort their worldview of what should be done and for standing up for \nthis bill. It is one of the reasons the AARP is for this bill.\n\n  Another reason happens to be our two leaders: Speaker of the House \nDenny Hastert, and of course our majority leader in the Senate, Dr. \nFrist, who has worked with these problems his whole professional \nlifetime. He has wanted to get this done as much as, if not more than, \nanyone else. And Senator Grassley worked day and night on this with his \nstaff. We could not have a better person.\n  Then we have cheap politics because they know former House Speaker \nNewt Gingrich has not always been the most followed person in this \nworld even though he is one of the brightest people with one of the \nbrightest political minds in America today. So what do they do? They \ndistort what former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said--not only distort \nit, they do it downright offensively. I am frustrated by the continued \nreferences to the alleged comments by the former Speaker of the House \nabout the ``Medicare Program,'' and those who insist that the former \nSpeaker wanted Medicare to wither on the vine. We have heard it all day \nlong by these people who are against everything. They are sadly \nmistaken. They are misrepresenting his remarks.\n  What the former Speaker said was that the agency that controlled \nMedicare, HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, which has \nevolved into CMS, said that HCFA should wither on the vine because that \nbureaucracy was so filled with command-and-control bureaucrats who were \nmore concerned about redtape than seniors' health.\n  That is a far cry from condemning Medicare, which is the way they \nwould present it. I personally resent that kind of distortion of what \nthe former Speaker of the House had to say. Gingrich believed these \nbureaucracies were strangling Medicare. If anything, he was standing up \nfor Medicare. He was arguing against large bureaucracies and for \nseniors to have more individual control over their health care dollars.\n  So do not believe this gibberish coming from some on the other side. \nThat is exactly what it is.\n  I have heard Democrats who were opposed to everything with regard to \nMedicare, unless it is an $800 billion to $1 trillion program, and even \nthen would be opposed to some of the approaches here.\n\n  They argue that 25 percent of seniors will be worse off than they are \ntoday because of this bill. That is pure, unmitigated bunk, and they \nknow it. It is not true.\n  First of all, we are adding $400 billion to the Medicare Program in \nnew spending for drug benefits and Medicare improvements--$400 billion. \nThat is not chickenfeed. So how can anybody say they are going to be \nworse off?\n  Secondly, we take care of those who are in lower income brackets and \nthose who have high drug costs. That is what this bill ought to do, and \nit does, and they are better off.\n  Very important to me, to Senator Grassley, to Senator Baucus, and \nvirtually all of us who have rural States, is that we improve access to \nquality care in rural areas--something that just has not happened under \nthe old Medicare system, under traditional Medicare. We improved it. \nThis bill does a lot towards helping those in rural America who have \nbeen shortchanged for years.\n  I do not see how anybody standing up from a rural State, with lots of \nfarmers, can have the gall to come on this floor and say they are going \nto be worse off with this bill when we put very strong language in with \nregard to rural health care. Yet we have had some Senators from the \nother side doing that.\n  Unlike the 1988 catastrophic bill, which I virtually argued against \nat the time--it was a mandatory bill--but unlike that bill, this is a \nbill where you have a choice of whether you go into this program or \nnot. You do not have to do it. You can stay right where you are in \ntraditional Medicare if that is what you want. I do not think most \npeople are going to do that, but who knows? But they have a right to do \nso. It is not like the 1988 catastrophic bill which was mandatory. And \nwhen the people found out they had to pay for it, yes, they rebelled \nbecause they did not want us telling them they had to pay for the \nbenefit. Today, we are not telling them they have to participate. In \nfact, the two bills are quite different.\n\n[[Page S15563]]\n\n  The Government is going to pay 75 percent of the cost of drugs for \nMedicare beneficiaries over 150 percent of poverty. Now, tell me that \nis not better than the current system.\n  The Democrats do not seem to understand the fact that a lot of \ncorporations are dropping health care coverage because they cannot \nafford it anymore or they do not want to pay for it anymore.\n  I will never forget, I had a conversation with the head of IBM a few \nyears back. He said: We are paying $7,000 per employee for health care. \nIf it goes up any more, we are just going to turn around and give them \nthe $7,000 and say, go get your own health care. He said: We just can't \nafford to keep going in this direction.\n  Well, before this bill, it was estimated that the corporations were \ngoing to drop the health care of 37 percent of retirees. Now it is \nestimated that the drop out number will be below 20 percent, probably \ncloser to 15 percent. We have made some strides in trying to solve that \nproblem.\n  This bill contains Hatch-Waxman reforms. For those who do not \nunderstand this, let me explain it as the author of the Hatch-Waxman \nbill in 1984.\n  Hatch-Waxman created the modern generic drug industry that is in \ncompetition with the pioneering companies and has brought drug prices \ndown $10 billion in consumer savings every year since 1984. It is \ncalled, even by my friends on the other side, one of the greatest \npieces of consumer legislation in the last century, and rightly so, \nbecause it has saved billions and billions of dollars for consumers.\n  But there was a gaming of Hatch-Waxman by some companies, and we have \ncorrected that in this bill, which is a pretty important thing. These \nreforms will prevent gaming of the system, and they will provide \nseniors with less expensive generic drugs more quickly.\n  I get so tired of the demagoguery against the pioneering companies; \nthat is, the PhRMA companies; that is, the large pharmaceutical \ncompanies. The generic companies know that if the large pharmaceutical \ncompanies do not spend their $30 to $35 billion every year in research \nand development, there will not be any drugs for them to take off into \ngeneric form. If these large companies spend that kind of money, then \nthey have to find a way of recouping that money. Because of our current \nFDA system, it takes up to 15 years of patent life.\n  If you develop a gizmo, you have 20 years of patent life, or what you \ncall market exclusivity, to sell your gizmo. In the case of \nprescription drugs, you might only have 5 years to recoup the moneys \nyou have put in. And just for people's understanding, it takes up to \n6,000 scientific misses, in other words, experiments--up to 6,000 of \nthem--to arrive at a marketable drug, at a cost of around $1 billion \nper drug.\n  You wonder why companies have to charge as much as they do to get \ntheir money back? If they do not get their money back, they cannot \nconduct more research and development on future pharmaceutical products \nwhich are really saving our seniors and causing them to be able to live \nlonger lives today.\n  I will talk a little bit more about drug reimportation in a few \nminutes. But in all honesty, that is an overblown, demagogued position, \ntoo. Our pharmaceutical industry in this country is one of our great \nindustries. It is one of the reasons we have a balance of trade \nsurplus. The pharmaceutical industry and the entertainment industry are \nabout the only two that provide balance of trade surpluses.\n  What I hear from the other side that we have to have price controls, \nwhich is what Canada has; it is important to remember that Canada no \nlonger has a pharmaceutical industry. The reason is that you cannot \nafford to do what it takes to get these drugs developed when you have \nprice controls. Now, these are things that just are demagogued here on \nthe floor, and I am personally getting tired of it.\n  There is so much I would like to say that would refute the \ndemagoguery I have heard from some on the other side. Let me just take \na second on AARP because it is amazing to me. The AARP has basically \nsided with the Democratic Party on almost everything with regard to \nseniors, and with the more liberal Republicans. They have been involved \nin this intimately for years. And here we have Democrats trashing the \norganization that has been one of their mainstays of support because \nall of a sudden the AARP is thinking for itself and doing what is right \nfor seniors, and not keeping seniors under the thumb of Government \nregulation. So AARP has to be trashed here on the floor of the Senate \nby some of our friends on the other side.\n  I find it ironic that my friends on the other side of the aisle are \ncriticizing the AARP for supporting legislation that will provide \nAmericans access to drug coverage through Medicare. It is the first \ntime this is going to happen, and they are trashing AARP?\n  What a difference a year makes. Last year, AARP could do no wrong as \nfar as the Democrats were concerned. This year, it seems the AARP can \ndo nothing right. That is because the more liberal Democrats, who are \nopposed to this bill because it is not socialized medicine, are up in \narms that the AARP has finally decided to do what really is a \nbipartisan approach.\n  AARP made a courageous decision by endorsing our drug plan, a bill \nthat I predict will soon be signed into law. And maybe my friends are \njust upset because they are on the losing side on this issue for a \nchange, and they just do not want President Bush to get any credit for \nit.\n  Well, I also want to stress that the so-called slush fund I have \nheard mentioned on the other side, that my friend from Iowa raised, is \nno slush fund at all. This is a stabilization fund that is important \nfor rural States such as Utah and Iowa. It is crucial to our States. \nUtah did not benefit from Medicare+Choice because it just did not work \nin my state. Health plans told me that the payments were too low.\n  So this stabilization fund provides assistance to those States, such \nas Iowa and Utah, that may not have regional PPOs, preferred provider \norganizations, or local plans that provide coverage they would offer to \nthese beneficiaries living in rural areas.\n\n  Of course, look at what happened to Medicare+Choice. In Utah, the \nMedicare+Choice plans left the State, leaving my beneficiaries with \nnothing because Medicare+Choice plans could not survive in rural Utah. \nThis bill will help to solve that problem. The stability fund will be \nused to encourage plans to enter rural States such as Utah and Iowa and \nstay there once and for all. It is not a slush fund.\n  This is a fund designed to help give rural beneficiaries choice and \ncoverage through the HMOs, PPOs, and stand-alone drug plans. It helps \nseniors in rural areas. I find it disconcerting that someone from Iowa \nwould criticize that aspect of this program. That shows he has not read \nthe bill, does not understand the bill, has not listened to Senator \nGrassley, who has read the bill, does understand it, and helped to \nimplement it, and who is probably rural America's strongest advocate in \nthe Congress. This is no exception.\n  Let me tell you what this legislation does for my folks in Utah. I \nthink you can extrapolate this into every State in the Union, but let \nme talk about my State because I want my folks in Utah to realize this \nis a good bill.\n  The bipartisan agreement provides all of my 219,973 beneficiaries in \nUtah with access to a Medicare prescription drug benefit for the first \ntime in the history of the Medicare Program, beginning in January of \n2006. Beginning in 2006, the bipartisan agreement will give 55,538 \nMedicare beneficiaries in Utah access to drug coverage they would not \notherwise have and will improve coverage for many more.\n  Within 6 months after this bill is signed, Utah residents will be \neligible for Medicare approved prescription drug discount cards which \nwill provide them with savings of between 10 and 25 percent off the \nretail price of prescription drugs, of most drugs. That is something \nthey do not have now but they will have.\n  Beneficiaries with incomes of less than $12,123 or $16,362 for \ncouples who lack prescription drug coverage, including drug coverage \nunder Medicaid, will get up to $600 in annual assistance to help them \nafford their medicines along with a discount card. That is a total of \n$53,619,525 in additional help for 44,638 Utah residents in the years \n2004 and 2005.\n  Mr. President, beginning in 2006, all 219,973 Medicare beneficiaries \nliving in\n\n[[Page S15564]]\n\nUtah will be eligible to get prescription drug coverage through a \nMedicare approved plan in exchange for a monthly premium of \napproximately $35. Seniors who are now paying the full retail price for \nprescription drugs will be able to cut drug costs roughly in half. In \nmany cases, they will save more than 50 percent of what they pay for \nprescription medicines, and those at less than 150 percent of poverty \nbasically will have their drugs for free.\n  Mr. President, 63,560 beneficiaries in Utah, who have limited savings \nand low incomes, generally below $12,123 for individuals and $16,232 \nfor couples, will qualify for even more generous coverage, as I have \nsaid. They will pay no premium for prescription drug coverage, and they \nwill be responsible only for a nominal copayment, no more than $2 for \neach generic drug or $5 for brand name drugs. Now, 17,613 additional \nlow-income beneficiaries in Utah, with limited savings and incomes \nbelow $13,470 for individuals and $18,180 for couples, will qualify for \nreduced premiums, lower deductible, and coinsurance, and no gaps in \ncoverage.\n  Additionally, Medicare, instead of Medicaid, will now assume the \nprescription drug costs of 17,739 Utah beneficiaries who are eligible \nfor both Medicare and Medicaid. This will save Utah $51 million over 8 \nyears on prescription drug coverage for its Medicaid population.\n  This is a bill that will help every State. I cite Utah just to show \nthat in a State the size of mine, which is smaller in population than \nmany other States but fairly substantial, there are substantial \nbenefits that will come from this bill.\n  I want to make it clear that this is the last train out of town. We \nhave been trying to do this for years and years. I listened to at least \nfour of my colleagues on the other side who, in my opinion, were \ndemagoguing this issue all day long. Frankly, they are wrong in most of \ntheir assertions, and they act as if all we have to do is take this \nback to committee and work it through again. If people had sat through \nthose meetings we held in the conference committee, they would realize \nwe went through every word, every aspect of this legislation. We had a \nheck of a time putting together a total bipartisan package such as this \nas it was. If you look at it, it barely passed the House--but it did \npass the House. I hope it will pass the Senate because our seniors will \nbe better off with the choices this bill gives them than with current \nlaw.\n  Yes, I wish we could have done more to reform Medicare; I wish we \ncould have done more to put more private sector capability in this \nbill. I think over the long run that would really pay off. I wish we \ncould have done more in a wide variety of areas that would have cost a \nlot more money. But I have to say, under the circumstances, the \nconference committee members really worked hard, and I think we did a \ngood job.\n  So I rise to express my strong support for the final conference \nagreement on H.R. 1, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and \nModernization Act. Over the years, countless Medicare beneficiaries in \nUtah have written to me to express their desperation over the fact that \nCongress has not added a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nProgram. Time after time, session after session, in Congress after \nCongress, we have tried to answer their pleas. Fifteen years ago, we \nalmost made it. The plan was so flawed that it had to be repealed. Last \nyear, I thought we might make it with the tripartisan initiative. I was \none of the five tripartisan Senators, as was Senator Grassley who is \nsitting in the chair now, and Senators Snowe, Jeffords, and Breaux. The \nfive of us have come up short each and every time we have tried--except \nthis year. I think if we had not had Presidential support this year, we \nprobably would have come up short again.\n  We cannot afford to fail America's seniors. We cannot afford to fail \nAmerica's disabled. I am dismayed to hear many colleagues preparing for \nus to fail again. Not if this Senator can help it. To me, it is \nunconscionable to let this opportunity pass us by out of a concern that \nthis is not a perfect bill. I spent years working on this issue. Unlike \nsome on the other side, who have been complaining about the issue, I \nhave worked on every health care program in the last 27 years, and a \nnumber of them have my name on them. I believe I know the issues as \nwell as anybody in this body. I worked hard on the conference committee \nas well.\n  Let me tell you, in all the experience of 27 years, I can tell you \nsomething I know is categorically true: We cannot have a perfect bill.\n  The intersection of Medicare, Medicaid, and responsible public policy \nis about the most complex pathway Congress has ever negotiated. On the \none hand, we want to provide as many seniors and disabled with as \ncomprehensive and affordable coverage as possible. On the other hand, \nwe want to minimize Government and its attendant bureaucracy and cost. \nThe two are in inherent conflict. So we do the best we can--and we did.\n  Since Congress first enacted Medicare nearly 40 years ago, we have \nseen miraculous breakthroughs in medicines that have allowed for \ndiseases, conditions, to be treated by innovative prescription drugs. \nAs seniors and the disabled have gained access to many treatments, many \nare faced with the choice of splitting pills or missing meals in order \nto afford their vital prescription drugs.\n  This is simply unconscionable. Providing access to these vital \ntreatments is the right thing to do for our seniors and the right thing \nto do for our children. It will make our society more healthy, and it \nwill save countless medical expenses. Seniors will live longer, as they \nare doing now, because of these inroads we have made.\n  Is there anyone who doubts that greater access to preventive medicine \nwill save our Medicare system in the long run perhaps by tens of \nbillions of dollars?\n  My constituents have been waiting for close to 40 years for this day \nto come. The time is here; the time is now. We are about to pass \nhistoric legislation that will make the most significant changes to the \nMedicare Program since it was created in 1965.\n  I say to my colleagues, Monday will be a momentous day in the Senate, \nand I hope we will invoke cloture so we can proceed with this bill. If \nwe invoke cloture, we will pass this bill and millions and millions--40 \nmillion--of our senior citizens in this country will benefit. The whole \ncountry will benefit. Medicare beneficiaries will finally be offered a \nprescription drug benefit plan.\n  Medicare will offer beneficiaries more choice in coverage, and \nMedicare's fiscal solvency will be preserved for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  This bill has countless extra benefits. We have made improvements in \nthe way health care is delivered to rural America, as I mentioned. \nBeneficiaries, like so many in the State of Utah, will receive quality \nhealth care. Providers in these areas will be reimbursed appropriately \nand have incentives to give good care.\n  Overall, we cannot escape the conclusion that this is a good bill. \nWhenever I go back home to Utah, the Medicare Program is the one topic \nthat comes up in almost every conversation I have with constituents. No \nmatter where I go--Salt Lake City, St. George, Beaver, Ogden, Cedar \nCity, you name it, from the north to south, from east to west, the \nquestion is still the same: When will drugs be covered by Medicare? I \nhave looked forward to this day for a long time--the day when I will be \nable to answer: Now.\n  I would like to read a letter, one of many I have received, from a \ndifferent kind of constituent. For the past several years, Medicare \nproviders, especially those in rural Utah, have complained about their \ninsufficient Medicare reimbursement in Utah. As a result, many have \nthreatened to leave the State if Medicare payments are not increased. \nLet me give you a quote from Dr. Beth Hanlon, a Utah physician, who is \ncomplaining about unfair reimbursement rates. Here is what she had to \nsay:\n\n       My patient population is 30 to 40 percent Medicare. I \n     cannot continue to see our senior patients if rates drop \n     further. My overhead costs continue to increase; I cannot \n     provide the same services I did a year ago because of lower \n     reimbursements. I will have to refer patients to consultants \n     and the emergency room for problems I could previously have \n     managed in my office. This is so distressing, as our \n     population ages and we see more doctors planning retirement.\n\n  Dr. Hanlon, we have good news for you. We took your concerns \nseriously, and this bill takes the necessary steps to increase your \nMedicare reimbursement rates.\n\n[[Page S15565]]\n\n  Let me talk a little bit about the process and how we got to this \nhistoric place in the annals of the Senate. As I said, I was privileged \nto serve as a member of the House-Senate Medicare conference committee. \nI served on many conferences during my 27 years in the Senate, but this \nwas probably the most complex and technical conference I have ever \nencountered, and it was a difficult conference to be on.\n  Every Senate and House conferee--especially conference Chairman Bill \nThomas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Cochairman Billy \nTauzin of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and conference Vice \nChairman Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee--did a great \njob, a fine job of guiding members to this final agreement. It was no \neasy task, and it took several months and many long hours to complete \nour work.\n  Other conference members made significant contributions to this \nhistoric conference report, and I would like to take the opportunity to \nrecognize all of these members for their diligence and commitment to \nthe process.\n  They certainly include Senate majority leader, Bill Frist; Senate \nminority leader, Tom Daschle; Senate Finance Committee ranking member, \nMax Baucus; Senator Don Nickles; Senator Jay Rockefeller; Senator Jon \nKyl; and Senator John Breaux; House majority leader, Tom DeLay; the \nSpeaker of the House, Denny Hastert; Ways and Means Committee ranking \nmember, Charlie Rangel; Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member, \nJohn Dingell; Ways and Means Health Subcommittee chairwoman, Nancy \nJohnson; and Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee chairman, Mike \nBilirakis.\n  These are all the people who were concerned about this bill. Most of \nthem worked to try to work out the differences between the House and \nSenate bills. Some of them did not, and some of them are complaining to \nthis day.\n  I also wish to take this opportunity to recognize the staff who \nworked literally around the clock on this conference agreement for \nseveral months. They are: Dr. Mark Carlson, who was my legislative \nfellow this year; Colin Rosky; Leah Kegler; Jennifer Bell; Ted Totman; \nAlicia Ziemiecki; Liz Fowler; Bill Dauster; Russ Sullivan; Judy Miller; \nJon Blum; Pat Bousliman; Andy Cohen; Danial Stein; Diana Birkett; \nJoelle Oishi; Jenny Wolff; Allison Giles; Julie Hasler; Patrick \nMorrisey; Chuck Clapton; Patrick Rowan; Jeremy Allen; Dean Rosen; Liz \nScanlon; Eric Ueland; Sarah Walter; Michelle Easton; Paige Jennings; \nLauren Fuller; Stacey Hughes; Don Dempsey; Diane Major; Lisa Wolski; \nJane Lowenstein; Kate Leone; Susan Christianson; Bridgett Taylor; Amy \nHall; John Ford; Cybele Bjorklund; and Terry Shaw.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like, though, to recognize the hard work of \nour Senate Finance Committee staff, especially Linda Fishman, Mark \nHayes, Liz Fowler, and Jon Blum; and the staff of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, John McManus, Deb Williams, Madeleine Smith, and Joel White; \nand staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, especially \nPatrick Morrissey and Chuck Clapton.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the work of my own staff: Pattie \nDeLoatche, Trish Knight, Bruce Artim, and others who worked very hard \nin this area.\n  I wish to acknowledge the work of the Senate and House legislative \ncounsel staff, Jim Scott, John Goetcheus, Ruth Ernst, Ed Grossman, \nPierre Poisson, and Pete Goodloe.\n  They have been the unsung heroes in this process and have given up \nsignificant time with their family in order to draft this legislation.\n  Another organization that deserves special recognition is the \nCongressional Budget Office. The staff of Steve Lieberman worked \ntirelessly for us, and it was a continuous process.\n  Finally, the Department of Health and Human Services, especially the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services staff, led by Administrator \nTom Scully and Rob Foreman, worked around the clock to provide us with \ndetailed information on questions we had about the Medicare \nlegislation.\n  I thank all of these fine people for a job well done.\n  I have been involved in this issue for more than a decade, as I \nmentioned--actually for most of my Senate career. I worked closely with \nmy Finance Committee colleagues to get this bill through the Finance \nCommittee and the Senate earlier this year. I was also one of the \nauthors of the Senate tripartisan Medicare bill which was considered \nlast Congress and shot down because of nothing more than politics, \nsomething that appears to be rearing its ugly head right now.\n  In addition, I was lead sponsor with our colleague, Senator Bill \nRoth, of the legislation establishing the Bipartisan Medicare \nCommission, which was included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Both the Medicare tripartisan bill and the Bipartisan Medicare \nCommission, which was chaired by my friend and colleague, John Breaux, \nlaid the groundwork for the agreement we are currently considering.\n  We have learned from those efforts, and that has only improved the \nlegislative effort that is before us today. That is why this bill \npresents the best opportunity that we will ever have to provide our \nseniors with the drugs they need so desperately.\n  Of course, the bill is not perfect. No compromise ever is to any one \nperson. But after all these years, considering all the policy \ndifferences and all the differing views on entitlement programs and how \na drug benefits should be delivered, we now have a bill that can pass.\n  With all of those differences, we finally have a bill that represents \nthe best possible compromise. There will most certainly never be \nanother opportunity like we have when we vote this Monday.\n  There is a lot of misunderstanding about what is in this bill. There \nis a lot of misinformation. I have mentioned some of it in my earlier \nremarks, but I would like to take a few more moments to clear up some \nof this.\n  First, I would like to explain one of the most important components \nof this legislation to my colleagues at this time, which is the drug \nbenefit. Many Utahns are under the mistaken impression that they will \nbe forced to participate in this new drug program, and that is simply \nnot true. So I want all of you out there who are listening and watching \nand those who will read comments in the papers to note these comments \nby some of my colleagues, such as ``you don't have any choice,'' are \nwrong. You have a choice whether you want to be in this program or not. \nNo one will be forced into the new drug plan. No one is going to be \nforced into an HMO. No one will be forced to leave traditional Medicare \non which they have come to depend.\n  I simply cannot stress enough that this is a voluntary benefit. If \nMedicare beneficiaries do not want drug coverage, they do not have to \nparticipate. I hope that point is clear to everyone across the country \nlistening to this debate, especially senior citizens.\n  Second, in one word, this bill provides choice. Seniors will be able \nto choose the drug benefit that best suits their needs rather than be \nforced into a one-size-fits-all Government handout.\n  (Mr. ALLARD assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Everyone will be offered a Medicare-endorsed drug discount \ncard in April 2004. This will cost no more than $30 per year.\n  These drug discount cards will immediately provide our seniors with \ndrug savings ranging from 10 to 25 percent. Right off, that's a benefit \nyou don't have now.\n  In addition, this is a fair bill and a fair provision.\n  We have targeted the lion's share of this benefit to those seniors \nwho have the greatest need. Those under 135 percent of the federal \npoverty level will receive $600 per year to buy their prescription \ndrugs and will not be required to pay enrollment fees. That's a total \nof $53.6 million in additional help for 45,000 Utah residents in 2004 \nand 2005.These low-income beneficiaries would only be required to pay \ncoinsurance between 5 and 10 percent for each prescription drug. That \nis a tremendous change from today.\n  The prescription drug card program concludes when the larger benefit \nkicks in on January 1, 2006.\n  Beginning in 2006, 220,000 Medicare beneficiaries will be offered \naccess to the new standard prescription drug program. Standard coverage \nincludes a $35 monthly premium, a $250 annual deductible, beneficiary \ncoinsurance of 25 percent up to $2,250, and protections against high \ndrug cost once out-of-pocket spending reaches $3,600.\n\n[[Page S15566]]\n\n  While individual drug plan sponsors may change some of the \nspecifications, every beneficiary who participates will be guaranteed a \ndrug benefit that is at least equal in value to the standard benefit.\n  Those wishing to remain in traditional Medicare will have access to a \nstand-alone prescription drug plan.\n  Beneficiaries who want private, integrated health coverage may \nreceive their drug benefits through local or regional Medicare \nAdvantage plans. No one--not one senior or person with a disability--\nwould be forced to give up the coverage that they receive from \ntraditional Medicare. And this bill will provide 56,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries in Utah with access to drug coverage that they would not \notherwise have.\n  This bill also has additional coverage for 63,000 Utahns with low-\nincomes.\n  For the dual-eligibles 18,000 in Utah--who are below 100 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level, there would be no monthly premium, annual \ndeductible, or gap in coverage. These individuals will merely have \ncopayments of $1 for generic drugs and $3 for brand name drugs. Once \nthe catastrophic limit is reached, there would be no beneficiary \ncoinsurance for these individuals.\n  But there's even more help for our low-income beneficiaries. Those \nbelow 135 percent of poverty, there will be no monthly premium, annual \ndeductible or gap in coverage. These individuals would have copayments \nof $2 for generic drugs and $5 for brand name drugs. Once the \ncatastrophic limit is reached, there will be no beneficiary coinsurance \nfor these individuals.\n  For those below 150 percent of poverty, there will be a sliding scale \nfor monthly premiums, a $50 annual deductible, and up to 15 percent \nbeneficiary coinsurance on the out-of-pocket spending. Once the \ncatastrophic spending limit is reached, there will be beneficiary \ncopayments of $2 for generic drugs and $5 for brand name drugs.\n  Let me illustrate how this would work.\n  Evelyn, a widow from Sandy, Utah makes $35,000 annually. She has \ndiabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis and her annual drug \nexpenditures are close to $5000. Evelyn decides to join the Medicare \nprescription drug plan. It's her choice.\n  Under the bipartisan Medicare agreement, her out-of-pocket spending \non drugs will be reduced from $4800 per year to approximately $2400 \ncutting her prescription drug expenditures significantly. Factoring in \nher monthly premiums, she will save almost $2000 per year.\n  I continue to hear arguments on the floor about seniors being in \nworse shape if this bill becomes law.\n  Would Evelyn think saving $2000 puts her in worse shape? Not on your \nlife.\n  This conference agreement provides additional assistance to the \npoorest and the sickest beneficiaries--that has always been my goal--to \nprovide assistance to those beneficiaries who need the most help.\n  Who can argue against that?\n  It gives beneficiaries something that they have wanted for 40 years--\nprescription drug coverage--and it is strictly voluntary.\n  H.R. 1 also improves the traditional Medicare program by enhancing \npreventive services offered to beneficiaries.\n  The conference agreement includes a Welcome to Medicare preventive \nphysical examination, cardiovascular and diabetes screening, and \nimproved payments for mammography.\n  The new benefits will be used to screen Medicare beneficiaries for \nmany illnesses, and in most cases, if these illnesses are caught early \nthey may be treated. Conditions like diabetes, heart disease and asthma \nwill be treated far more effectively due to this one-time physical \nexamination. Would patients think they are worse off because their \nconditions are detected earlier and treated more effectively? Not on \nyour life.\n  This conference agreement also establishes Health Savings Accounts, \nbetter known as HSAs. HSAs are tax-advantaged savings accounts which \nmay be used to pay for medical expenses, and they have worked in \nnumerous other forms in the private sector. They are open to everyone \nwith a high deductible health insurance plan; however, the annual \ndeductible must be at least $1,000 for individual coverage and at least \n$2,000 for family coverage, and the out-of-pocket expense limit must be \nno more than $5,000 for individual coverage and $10,000 for family \ncoverage.\n  Employee HSA contributions are not included in the individual's \ntaxable income. In addition, contributions by an individual are tax \ndeductible. Also, the accounts are allowed to grow tax free and there \nis no tax on withdrawals for qualified medical expenses. Boy, does that \nmake sense. But that is sticking in the craw of a number of those who \nwant Government to pay for everything and don't want people to have to \nsave for their own health care. I mean, that is in my view.\n  HSAs are portable, like an individual retirement account (IRA), the \nHSA is owned by the individual, not the employer. If the individual \nchanges jobs, the HSA travels with them. In addition, individuals over \nage 55 may make extra contributions to their accounts and still enjoy \nthe same tax advantages. In 2004, an additional $500 can be added to \nthe HSA. By 2009, an additional $1,000 can be added to the HSA.\n  The inclusion of these new accounts is a significant part of the \nagreement that made this conference report possible. Yet some on the \nother side, because it is giving people a choice to save on their own, \ntax free, and pay for their own health care tax free, don't want this. \nIt is easy to see why, if what you want is socialized medicine. The \ninclusion of these new accounts is a significant part of the agreement \nthat made this conference report possible. Allowing individuals to take \ncharge of their own savings for future health care expenses is an \nimportant and necessary change in the direction of our health care \npolicy, and is one I support strongly.\n  In my opinion, the conference agreement made great strides in \nperfecting the Senate-passed language sponsored by Senators Gregg, \nSchumer, and Kennedy pertaining to the Drug Price Competition and \nPatent Term Restoration Act of 1984, better known as the Hatch-Waxman \nAct.\n  The intent of the 1994 law is to provide incentives to develop \nvaluable new drug treatments through patent and exclusivity protection, \nand also to facilitate access to generic versions of the drug after the \ninnovator's patent or exclusivity expires. The CBO estimated that the \nHatch-Waxman Act saves consumers $8 billion to $10 billion each year. I \nwas pleased to be the prime sponsor and to work out every word in that \nAct.\n  In recent years, however, access to generic drugs has sometimes been \ndelayed by litigation. The Judiciary Committee, which I chair, \nhighlighted these problems in a hearing held in May of 2001 and two \nhearings this year.\n  The HELP Committee reported legislation on these matters both last \nyear and this year. The Senate adopted these amendments by wide margins \nboth last year and this year.\n  Although I opposed the specific provisions in these bills, I \nrecognize the sustained efforts of Senators McCain, Schumer, Kennedy, \nCollins, Edwards, and Frist. I want to especially commend Senator Gregg \nfor his leadership in bringing this year's vehicle more in line with \nthe policies that I have long advocated.\n  I also want to commend the leadership of President Bush who took \nregulatory action earlier this year to close a significant loophole in \nthe 1984 law, which will save all Americans an estimated $35 billion \nover 10 years. Secretary Thompson and the Commissioner of Food and \nDrugs, Dr. Mark McClennan, deserve a lot of credit for completing this \nimportant rulemaking in less than one year. The expert advice given by \nthe Chief Counsel for Food and Drugs, Dan Troy, must also be \nacknowldged.\n  Medicare legislation that passed the House and Senate earlier this \nyear included the codification of the new FDA rule modifying the 30-\nmonth-stay provisions of Hatch-Waxman. Enactment of these provisions as \npart of the bipartisan agreement will lower prescription drug costs for \nmillions of Americans by improving access to generic drugs, which are \nsafe and effective and can be much less costly alternatives to brand-\nname prescription drugs.\n  A key component of the bipartisan agreement codify the recent \nregulation that limits drug manufacturers to one and only one 30-month \nautomatic stay\n\n[[Page S15567]]\n\nin patent infringement litigation involving a generic drug \napplication. This is the policy that I advocated in May 2002 testimony \nbefore the HELP Committee and on the Senate floor during the debate of \n2002.\n\n  Although the McCain-Schumer bill in the 107th Congress, S. 812, \ncontained a very different provision with respect to the 30-month stay, \nin time the wisdom of my position on the 30-month stay took hold.\n  Last July, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report that \nrecommended the policy I advocated and became a central feature of the \nFDA rule and the legislation contained in the conference report.\n  I want to commend the sustained effort and considerable expertise of \nFTC Chairman Muris in this area.\n  As well, I would be remiss not to single out such dedicated and \nthoughtful public servants as Mike Wroblenski at FTC and Jarilyn \nDuPont, Amit Sachdev, and Liz Dickinson at FDA, and many others.\n  One of the key provisions of the Greater Access to Affordable \nPharmaceutical Act amendments are those pertaining to declaratory \njudgments. It was this provision that was discussed at our two most \nrecent Judiciary Committee hearings on this legislation in June and \nAugust of this year. The Department of Justice, ably represented by a \nfellow Utahn, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sheldon Bradshaw, \nunderstandably took the position that the Senate declaratory judgment \nprovision was unconstitutional.\n  I am pleased that the conferees fixed the constitutional defect in \nthe Gregg-Schumer-Kennedy language that passed the Senate.\n  The problem with the language, adopted by the Senate by, as I recall, \na 94-1 margin, is that it tried to legislate directly counter to the \n``case or controversy'' requirement of Article III of the Constitution.\n  Before reaching the merits of a case, including declaratory judgment \nactions, a Federal judge must first determine that there exists an \nactual dispute between the parties. Courts are not permitted by our \nConstitution to hear hypothetical cases or cases in which there is only \na possibility of future litigation.\n  As both of the hearings of the Judiciary Committee documented, the \nlaw is settled with respect to the standards that must be met before a \ndeclaratory judgment may be heard in patent litigation. A court may \nonly take a declaratory judgment case if and only if it finds that a \n``reasonable apprehension'' of being sued by the patentee is present at \nthe time the action is brought.\n  This is only common sense because it would be imprudent to allow the \ncourts to be flooded with speculative, time consuming and costly patent \nsuits. As the erudite statements of Mr. Boyden Gray fully documented, \nthe Senate-passed language essentially stood the Constitution on its \nhead by defining the absence of a lawsuit as a statutory basis for \nsatisfying the ``case or controversy'' requirement.\n  I certainly enjoyed reading the several intriguing missives written \non this topic by my former Judiciary Committee General Counsel, \nProfessor John Yoo.\n  But neither his statements nor his surprise visit and testimony at \nour committee hearing have convinced me of either the constitutionality \nor policy wisdom of the declaratory judgment provisions contained in \nS.1. If we only knew Professor Yoo was coming to testify, we would have \ngiven Mr. Gray equal time.\n  In any event, in the provision the Senate considers today, the \nsettled case law of the ``reasonable apprehension'' test remains \nundisturbed and the Constitutional requirements are observed.\n  In adopting this language it is important to note that the presence \nof the two factors referred to in the statute, the filing of an ANDA \napplication with a Paragraph IV patent challenge certification and the \nabsence of a suit filed by the patent-holding innovator firm, do not \nalone satisfy the reasonable apprehension test.\n  Certainly courts should, and in fact, must under the new language \nconsider these two important factors but that should neither be the \nstart nor the end of the inquiry.\n  For example, the result in the case of Dr. Reddy v. Pfizer, commented \nupon by many, including my friend from New York, Senator Schumer, does \nnot appear to be affected by the language in this bill. In that case, \nwhich involved a challenge to patents set to expire three and one-half \nyears later, the court found that the reasonable apprehension test was \nnot satisfied.\n  Refiling the suit more proximate to the patent expiration date may \nyield a different result. That will be a matter for the courts to \ndecide applying the new statute and the existing standards of the \n``reasonable apprehension'' test.\n  I also want to make explicit, the implicit--that nothing in this new \nlanguage pertaining to pharmaceutical patent-related declaratory \njudgments creates a new cause of action separate from the existing \nauthority under title 28.\n  On balance, I believe that the conferees arrived at a fair resolution \non the declaratory judgment provision that is a marked improvement over \nthe Senate language.\n  I want to commend my colleagues in the Senate for recognizing the \nserious flaws in the language of S.1. I want to commend my colleagues \nin the House for recognizing the importance of retaining a strong \ndeclaratory judgment provision so that generic drug firms will be able \nto determine the status of their patent challenge in an appropriate \nfashion.\n  I plan to monitor closely the history of litigation of these new \nrules pertaining to pharmaceutical patent litigation and hope that the \nFTC and other governmental agencies and outside groups will also \nprovide us with their analysis of how well the new provisions work in \npractice.\n  We need to be vigilant in assessing whether we have the proper \nbalance between the interests of patent holders and patent challengers. \nI will expect and request an FTC report, similar to the agency's \nextremely helpful 2002 study, at an appropriate time.\n  There are also additional important provisions in this bill that \naffect Hatch-Waxman, but I would like to reserve my comments for this \ncoming Monday.\n  One other important issue that we have addressed in this legislation \nis the preservation of retiree health coverage. My office has been \nflooded with calls from seniors worried about losing their retiree \nbenefits.\n  And we have seen published reports indicating that rising drug and \nhealth care costs are pushing more and more employers and unions to \ndrop their retiree health coverage.\n  We took these concerns very seriously as we negotiated this \nconference agreement.\n  That is why we have dedicated nearly one-quarter of the spending in \nthis bill to protect retiree health benefits.\n  For the first time, Medicare will provide funding and incentives so \nemployers and union officials will continue retiree health coverage. \nUnder this bill, no beneficiary will be forced to drop retiree health \ncoverage and participate in the new prescription drug program.\n  However, if employers drop health coverage in the future, those \nlosing coverage will be allowed to enroll in the Medicare drug program \nwithout being penalized.\n  In addition, this legislation contains a 28 percent non-taxable \nemployer subsidy for each retiree's annual drug spending between $250 \nand $5000--as high as $1,330 per beneficiary. To qualify, employer \ncoverage must be as generous as, or more generous than, the Medicare \nPart D drug benefit.\n  We have made a lot of progress on this provision--protecting retiree \nhealth benefits was one of the primary goals of the Medicare conference \ncommittee. Let me tell you how much progress we have made--when we \nconsidered S.1 in the Senate this summer, CBO told us that the employer \ndrop-out rate was 37 percent. The last CBO estimate on the conference \nreport's employer drop-out rate is below 20 percent. This is a \nremarkable achievement.\n  The conference agreement is good for rural America. We want to ensure \nthat Medicare beneficiaries will have access to quality health care--no \nmatter where they live--and especially that rural providers, who \nprovide these important health services to beneficiaries, will be \nproperly reimbursed for their services.\n  Si Hutt, the CEO of Ashley Valley Medical Center in Vernal, Utah \nwrote to me asking:\n\n\n[[Page S15568]]\n\n\n       Please vote for the Prescription Drug Bill that came out of \n     the conference committee. It not only assists Medicare \n     beneficiaries with escalating drug costs, but it has key \n     provisions which are important to rural hospitals and \n     physicians.\n       The last data that I looked at actually showed a negative \n     margin for our Medicare business. At the same time, over 50 \n     percent of our patients are Medicare, Medicaid, or self-pay.\n       As you know, Medicare payment is very complicated and has \n     some inequities that are improved with this bill. The bill \n     stops a reduction of physicians' reimbursements--which is \n     crucial in today's horrible malpractice premium situation and \n     rising costs.\n       It also gives a full market basket increase to hospitals \n     for the next couple of years if hospitals participate in the \n     American Health Association's (AHA's) national quality \n     effort. We were among the first to sign up for this \n     initiative.\n       Please vote yes for this bill. Thank you.\n\n  Hospitals across America will receive a full market-basket update as \nlong as they submit appropriate quality data to CMS. Medicare payments \nto hospitals providing services to a disproportionate share of low-\nincome and uninsured patients, typically rural and small urban \nhospitals, were increased from 5.25 percent to 12 percent. It was an \nincrease that was overdue.\n  There also is an increase in Medicaid DSH payments.\n  In addition, the legislation redistributes unused hospital residency \npositions and rural hospitals will be given top priority for receiving \nthese redistributed resident positions.\n  The conference report does several things to assist critical access \nhospitals: namely, it increases payments for these hospitals and eases \nseveral burdensome requirements that have been imposed upon them.\n  Rural physicians benefit greatly under this conference report. We \nincluded legislation I helped develop that relieves Medicare providers \nfrom burdensome regulations and requirements.\n  Physicians will no longer be subjected to a 4.5 percent reduction; \ninstead they will be receiving a slight increase in Medicare \nreimbursement for the next two years. We also modify the geographic \nadjustment for physician Medicare payments, which is extremely \nimportant to my Utah physicians back home.\n  And we reward physicians who are willing to provide care to Medicare \nbeneficiaries who live in scarcity areas--areas that have medical \nshortages.\n  Home health care, skilled nursing facilities and hospice facilities \nin rural areas also receive an increase in Medicare payment. In \naddition, there are no home health care co-payments for beneficiaries.\n  As one of the authors of the home health care bill many years ago, I \nam proud to be able to say we were able to get that done in this \nbill. Finally, ambulance services in rural areas will be rewarded \nthrough increased payments.\n\n  Another issue that is extremely important to me is the reimportation \nof prescription drugs. I mentioned I would talk about this for a few \nminutes. My Utah constituents are deeply concerned about the high price \nof pharmaceutical products. But allowing drugs to be reimported from \nother countries is not the solution. In fact, it makes the problem \nworse because the safety of these drugs cannot be guaranteed by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. The recent Government sting \noperation in one U.S. port discovered that 85 percent of the reimported \ndrugs seized were found to be counterfeit, outdated, or improperly \npackaged, knock-off packages.\n  This is very disturbing to me and an example of why I simply cannot \nsupport the reimportation of prescription drugs. The possibility of \nmistake and deception is just plain too great. People could die. \nAlready the FDA has documented many cases of what appeared to be FDA-\napproved imported drugs that were, in fact, contaminated or \ncounterfeit, contained the wrong product or incorrect dose, were \naccompanied by inadequate distributions, or had outlived their \nexpiration date. These drugs would be, at a minimum, ineffective and \nwould actually be harmful, if not fatal.\n  Those safety concerns are real and those in Congress who advocate \nreimportation ignore them not at their own risk but at the risk of the \nlives of millions of Americans. If we truly care about our seniors and \nothers who depend on prescription drugs, we should not expose them to \nwhat amounts to pharmaceutical Russian roulette.\n  I might add that I will come up with an amendment that will give tort \nliability for local and State governments that encourage reimportation.\n  In addition to these safety concerns, reimported drugs are a threat \nto the innovation that Americans and the rest of the world have come to \nexpect from our pharmaceutical industry. I am author of the FDA \nRevitalization Act that now is providing for, after 10 years, finally \nbuilding the White Oak FDA Central Laboratories with the finest \nequipment and facilities in the world. It will take us another 10 years \nto do it. It should have been done 10 years ago. That should move this \ndrug price problem forward because it would, hopefully, give them the \nfacilities to acquire even better people to work there, tough \nscientists, whom they have not been able to attract for years, who \nbasically will move these drugs through in a more safe and expeditious \nfashion, thus saving costs to those who develop the drugs, and thus \nbring prices down.\n  Canada and other countries with lower drug prices generally import \nsuperior American products but they impose price controls to keep costs \ndown. However, it can cost up to $1 billion, as I have said, to produce \na new drug, test it, win FDA approval, educate doctors, and make the \ndrug available to patients. No pharmaceutical company could go through \nthis without a chance to recover some of its costs, which will not be \npossible if we impose in America, however indirectly, Canadian-style \nprice controls. They do not have a pharmaceutical industry in Canada \nanymore because they basically have thrown their business right out of \nthe country. I don't want to see that happen in our country where we \nhave the greatest pharmaceutical companies in the world. We should be \nproud.\n  I do not believe sacrificing the safety supply of our drugs by \nreimportation is the right answer to the high cost of prescription \ndrugs. The conference committee reimportation provision is similar to \nwhat we passed earlier this year. The Secretary of HHS is directed to \nestablish a program that would allow for the reimportation of drugs \nfrom Canada by pharmacists, wholesalers, and individuals. However, the \nSecretary has the authority to suspend such a program if public safety \nis compromised.\n  The conference agreement directs the Secretary to conduct an \nextensive study that identifies the barriers for implementing a drug \nreimportation program and the potential problems associated with it. I \nbelieve it is imperative that such a study be conducted by implementing \na program that can pose such a serious public health risk.\n\n  Before I close, I take this opportunity to refute some of the \narguments I have heard from the other side of the aisle. In fact, I \nwill repeat some of the things I have said before but, hopefully, make \nthem more clear.\n  My colleagues have said that 25 percent of seniors will be worse off \nwhen this bill passes than they are today. That is simply not true. It \nis false. And it is wrong for them to make these statements. This \nconference agreement provides Medicare beneficiaries with the benefit \nthey have been demanding for close to 40 years, prescription drug \ncoverage and quality health coverage. This week, we are finally going \nto give them what they want. We spend almost $400 billion in new money \nto accomplish that goal.\n  I also heard some say that this is catastrophic all over again and we \nwill be back a year later repealing this legislation just like we \nrepealed the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. There is one \nfundamental difference between the current Medicare conference \nagreement and the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988--although \nthere are other differences as well. Our Medicare benefit is voluntary. \nThe Medicare catastrophic coverage law was mandatory. That is a major \ndifference. No one is forced to participate in this program. But I \nthink virtually everyone will want to.\n  In addition, this legislation offers drug coverage to the 33 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries who do not have coverage today. I have \nmentioned how that benefits folks in my State. The Hatch-Waxman reforms \non generic system drugs get less expensive drugs to the market faster, \nproviding everyone with less expensive drugs.\n\n[[Page S15569]]\n\n  This bill makes significant health care improvements for Medicare \nbeneficiaries in rural America and the health care workers who care for \nthese beneficiaries.\n  Before I close, I make an observation about the endorsement of this \nlegislation from the AARP. Regarding the American Association of \nRetired People, I have not always been in agreement throughout the \nyears, but I have a new regard for that organization because it made a \ncourageous decision by putting seniors first. I respect the AARP for \ntaking such a positive stand on this legislation. I personally resent \nsome of the irresponsible attacks that have been made against them. If \nwe are going to attack AARP, make sure we are right in doing so and do \nnot use phony arguments because you are losing in the Senate.\n  In conclusion, passage of this Medicare conference agreement is the \nright thing to do for our seniors, especially those who currently do \nnot have prescription drug coverage because they cannot afford it. I am \npleased I have had an opportunity to play an important role in making \nthis dream a reality for 41 million Medicare beneficiaries across the \ncountry. I am pleased I was able to work with such fine members of the \nconference committee, every one of them. Every one of them worked well. \nEvery one of them deserves credit. Every one of them played a specific \nrole. There were hardrock conservatives who made this bill passable in \nthe House. There were those who were more liberal who made this bill \nacceptable to many in the Senate, if not the vast majority. There were \nmany in the middle who were trying to make sure we got this thing done \nright and did the very best we could to do achieve that goal.\n  Again, I have mentioned the people who basically deserve most of the \ncredit for working on this bill. Everyone on those conference \ncommittees worked long, hard hours.\n  So I resent some of the comments that were made by those who did not \nparticipate or, if they would have participated, would have done \nnothing but complain throughout the process and would have stalled the \nprocess. They are complaining because they did not have their way and \nwe will not go towards a socialized medicine approach. They want \nGovernment to handle all these problems. We think Government can do a \ngood job if it has some competitive aspects with the private sector as \nwell. The vast majority of this is government, but in a reformed way, \nwith new programs that do a lot of good for every senior citizen who \nwants to participate in them. It will be a sea change advantage to all \nas we go forward.\n  I hope my colleagues will pass this bill. This is a historic \nopportunity for to us do what is in the best interests of our senior \ncitizens in this country. It is the only opportunity that has been \nbrought to both floors of Congress and the only opportunity for us to \npass legislation. This bill is important. This bill should not be \nsubject to petty partisan politics, a superabundance of which I have \nseen through this process, but particularly yesterday and today. I hope \nall of our colleagues will vote for this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, could I do just a little bit of wrap-up?\n  Mrs. BOXER.

(413 U.S. at 34);\n       Whereas the Supreme Court in Paris Adult Theatre I v. \n     Slaton, 413 U.S. 49 (1973) recognized that there are \n     legitimate governmental interests at stake in stemming the \n     tide of obscene materials, which include--\n       (1) protecting ``the quality of life and total community \n     environment'' (413 U.S. at 58);\n       (2) protecting ``public safety'' (413 U.S. at 58);\n       (3) maintaining ``a decent society'' (413 U.S. at 59-60);\n       (4) protecting ``the social interest in order and \n     morality'' (413 U.S. at 61); and\n       (5) protecting ``family life'' (413 U.S. at 63);\n       Whereas Congress, in an effort to protect these same \n     legitimate governmental interests, enacted legislation in \n     1988 to strengthen federal obscenity laws and in 1996 to \n     clarify that use of an interactive computer service to \n     transport obscene materials in or affecting interstate or \n     foreign commerce is prohibited;\n       Whereas the 1986 Final Report of the Attorney General's \n     Commission on Pornography found that ``increasingly, the most \n     prevalent forms of pornography'' fit the description of \n     ``sexually violent material'' (p. 323) and that ``an enormous \n     amount of the most sexually explicit material available'' can \n     be categorized as ``degrading'' to people, ``most often \n     women'' (p. 331);\n       Whereas the Internet has become a conduit for hardcore \n     pornography that now reaches directly into tens of millions \n     of American homes, where even small children can be exposed \n     to Internet obscenity and older children can easily find it;\n       Whereas a national opinion poll conducted in March 2002 by \n     Wirthlin Worldwide marketing research company found that 81 \n     percent of adult Americans say that ``Federal laws against \n     Internet obscenity should be vigorously enforced'';\n       Whereas a May 2 report from the National Academies' \n     National Research Council stated that ``aggressive \n     enforcement of existing antiobscenity laws can help reduce \n     children's access to certain kinds of sexually explicit \n     material on the Internet'';\n       Whereas vigorous enforcement of obscenity laws can help \n     reduce the amount of ``virtual child pornography'' now \n     readily available to sexual predators; and\n       Whereas it continues to be the desire of the People of the \n     United States of America and their representatives in \n     Congress to recognize and protect the governmental interests \n     recognized as legitimate by the United States Supreme Court \n     in Paris Adult Theatre I v.

This bill, as amended and passed by \nunanimous consent in the House, will improve the Department of \nJustice's Public Safety Officers Benefits program by allowing survivors \nof public safety officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or strokes \nwhile participating in nonroutine stressful or strenous physical \nactivities to qualify for Federal survivor benefits.\n\n[[Page S15571]]\n\n  I want to pay special thanks to Congressman Bob Etheridge, the author \nof the House companion bill, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman \nSensenbrenner for their leadership and fortitude while negotiating this \nlegislation. Without their perseverance and willingness to find \nbipartisan compromise language, passage of this bill in the House would \nnot have happened.\n  I also commend Congressman Coble, Congressman Bobby Scott, the \nFraternal Order of Police and the Congressional Fire Services Institute \nfor working with us on bipartisan compromise language so that we could \npass the Senate bill through the House. I look forward to working with \nSenate Judiciary Chairman Hatch, Senator Lindsey Graham, the lead \nRepublican cosponsor of this bill, and Senate leadership to quickly \npass the Senate bill, as amended by the House, and send it to the \nPresident's desk for enactment into law.\n  Public safety officers are our most brave and dedicated public \nservants. I applaud the efforts of all members of fire, law enforcement \nand EMS providers nationwide who are the first to respond to more than \n1.6 million emergency calls annually--whether those calls involve a \ncrime, fire, medical emergency, spill of hazardous materials, natural \ndisaster, act of terrorism, or transportation accident--without \nreservation. Those men and woman act with an unwavering commitment to \nthe safety and protection of their fellow citizens, and forever willing \nto selflessly sacrifice their own lives to provide safe and reliable \nemergency services to their communities.\n  Sadly, that kind of dedication can result in tragedy, which we all \nwitnessed on September 11 as scores of firefighters, police officers \nand medics raced into the burning World Trade Center and Pentagon with \nno other goal than to save lives. Every year, hundreds of public safety \nofficers nationwide lose their lives and thousands more are injured \nwhile performing duties that subject them to great physical risks. And \nwhile we know that PSOB benefits can never be a substitute for the loss \nof a loved one, the families of all our fallen heroes deserve to \ncollect these funds.\n  The PSOB program was established in 1976 to authorize a one-time \nfinancial payment to the eligible survivors of Federal, State, and \nlocal public safety officers for all line of duty deaths. In 2001, \nCongress improved the PSOB regulations by streamlining the process for \nfamilies of public safety officers killed or injured in connection with \nprevention, investigation, rescue or recovery efforts related to a \nterrorist attack. We also retroactively increased the total benefits \navailable by $100,000 as part of the USA PATRIOT Act. Survivors of \nfirst responders killed in the line of duty now receive $267,494 in \nPSOB.\n  Unfortunately, the issue of covering heart attack and stroke victims \nunder PSOB regulations was not addressed at the time.\n  Service-connected heart, lung, and hypertension conditions are silent \nkillers of public safety officers nationwide. The numerous hidden \nhealth dangers dealt with by police officers, fire fighters and EMS \npersonnel are widely recognized, but officers face these dangers in \norder to serve and protect their fellow citizens.\n  The intent of the legislation Senator Graham and I introduced earlier \nthis year was to cover officer who suffered a heart attack or stroke as \na result of nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activity. As \ndrafted and passed by the Senate by unanimous consent on May 16, \nhowever, members of the House Judiciary Committee felt the bill's \nlanguage would cover officers who did not engage in any physical \nactivity, but merely happened to suffer a heart attack while at work. \nChairman Sensenbrenner, Congressman Etheridge, Congressman Coble, \nCongressman Scott, FOP, CFSI and I worked out a substitute amendment to \naddress those concerns.\n  The substitute amendment to S. 459 will create a presumption that an \nofficer who died as a direct injury sustained in the line of duty if \nthe following is established: That officer participated in a training \nexercise that involved nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical \nactivity or responded to a situation and such participation or response \ninvolved nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical law enforcement, \nhazardous material response, emergency medical services, prison \nsecurity, fire suppression, rescue, disaster relief or other emergency \nresponse activity; that officer suffered a heart attack or stroke while \nengaging or within 24 hours of engaging in that physical activity; and \nsuch presumption cannot be overcome by competent medical evidence.\n  For the purposes of this act, the phrase ``nonroutine stressful or \nstrenuous physical'' will exclude actions of a clerical, administrative \nor non-manual nature. Included in the category of ``actions of a \nclerical, administrative or non-manual nature'' are such tasks \nincluding, but not limited to, the following: sitting at a desk; typing \non a computer; talking on the telephone; reading or writing paperwork \nor other literature; watching a police or corrections facility's \nmonitors of cells or grounds; teaching a class; cleaning or organizing \nan emergency response vehicle; signing in or out a prisoner; driving a \nvehicle on routine patrol; and directing traffic at or participating in \na local parade.\n  Such deaths, while tragic, are not to be considered in the lien of \nduty deaths. The families of officers who died of such causes would \ntherefore not be eligible to receive PSOB.\n  For the purposes of this Act, the phrase ``nonroutine stressful or \nstrenuous physical'' actions will include, but are not limited to, the \nfollowing: involvement in a physical struggle with a suspected or \nconvicted criminal; performing a search and rescue mission; performing \nor assisting with emergency medical treatment; performing or assisting \nwith fire suppression; involvement in a situation that requires either \na high speed response or pursuit on foot or in a vehicle; participation \nin hazardous material response; responding to a riot that broke out at \na public event; and physically engaging in the arrest or apprehension \nof a suspected criminal.\n  The situations listed above are the types of heart attack and stroke \ncases that are considered to be in the line of duty. The families of \nofficers who died in such cases are eligible to receive PSOB.\n  Heart attacks and strokes are a reality of the high-pressure jobs of \npolice officers, firefighers and medics. These are killers that first \nresponders contend with in their jobs, just like speeding bullets and \nburning buildings. They put their lives on the line for us, and we owe \ntheir families our gratitude, our respect and our help. No amount of \nmoney can fill the void that is left by these losses, but ending this \ndisparity can help these families keep food on the table and shelter \nover their heads.\n  I urge the Senate to take up and pass the Hometown Heroes Survivors \nBenefits Act, S. 459, as amended and passed this morning by the House, \nand show its support and appreciation for these extraordinarily brave \nand heroic public safety officers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/22/senate-section/article/S15571-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15571-S15572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 IN MEMORY OF JUDGE RAYMOND J. PETTINE\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, on Monday, November 17, 2003, Rhode \nIsland, the judicial community and the entire Nation lost a great \njurist, a great scholar and a great man. U.S. District Court Judge \nRaymond J. Pettine passed away leaving a legacy of protecting \nindividual liberties and constitutional rights.\n  Judge Pettine was born July 6, 1912 on America Street in Federal \nHill, one of the original Italian neighborhoods in Providence; a \nfitting place to be born for someone who would champion the \nConstitution that distinguishes this country, America, from so many \nothers. His father was a wigmaker in Italy who immigrated to these \nshores to find a better life for his family and to make a better \nAmerica through his labors and his sacrifice. Judge Pettine was \nsustained and inspired by the example of these good people, his mother \nand father. The hard work, the great patriotism, the unwavering decency \nand integrity, the deep respect for both family and faith, the gracious \nmanners of a true gentleman were learned in that home on America \nStreet.\n  Early in his life, Judge Pettine became fascinated with the law. As a\n\n[[Page S15572]]\n\nchild of eight, he scrawled a note to the Dean of Harvard Law School \nand asked him, ``What do you have to do to become a lawyer?'' The Dean \nwrote in reply ``study hard, be a good boy, always have a dream.'' His \ndream led him to Providence College and Boston University Law School. \nSoon after graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served on \nactive duty from 1941 until 1946 rising to the rank of major. He later \nwould be promoted to colonel in the Judge Advocate General Corps as a \nreservist.\n  After his discharge from active duty and a brief stint in private \npractice, Judge Pettine began a 13-year career as a prosecutor in the \nRhode Island Attorney General's office. Like every task he undertook, \nhe brought great passion and determination to this endeavor. He \nunderstood that our adversarial system of justice requires that both \nthe prosecution and the defense must bring the full weight of the facts \nand the law before the jury so that they may have the benefit of \nprincipled and forceful advocacy to make their decision. He was a tough \nand uncompromising prosecutor determined to enforce the law.\n  His reputation and his record as a prosecutor earned him appointment \nas the Federal Attorney for the District of Rhode Island is 1961. His \nservice as Federal Attorney won him the praise of Attorney General \nRobert F. Kennedy as one of the nation's top three federal prosecutors. \nAnd, this prosecutorial experience would help make him a superb judge \nupon his appointment to the bench in 1966 by President Johnson. Judge \nPettine recognized that the role of a judge was different than that of \na prosecutor or defense counsel. He was charged with something greater \nthan simply enforcing the law or arguing for a client. He was charged \nwith seeking justice, that delicate balance that rests on fairness and \na keen understanding of the nature of people as well as the tenets of \nthe law. He was also charged in a special way with defending the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. He recognized that our democracy, \nin his words, ``prizes itself in having a Bill of Rights designed to \nprotect us against despotic abuse of authority by the government.''\n\n  There was no more courageous, forceful or principled defender of the \nConstitution than Raymond Pettine. In 30 years on the Federal bench, \nand as chief judge from 1971 to 1982, Judge Pettine staunchly guarded \nthe individual rights enshrined in the Constitution. He said the \nConstitution should be interpreted in ways that ``give meaning to the \nheart and soul of what it's all about: a kinder, more understanding \nConstitution that recognizes the disenfranchised, the poor and \nunderprivileged.''\n  In his rulings, he repeatedly upheld the Bill of Rights' freedom of \nspeech, of religion and of privacy.\n  Pettine stood by the Constitution and showed courage in the face of \ncontroversy when he, a practicing Catholic, ruled that municipalities \ncould not erect Christmas Nativity scenes on public land. As he said, \n``I firmly believe this with great conviction: that there has to be a \nseparation between church and State--that one of the saving graces of \nthis country is the fact that we are tolerant of all religions, and \neven of those who have no religion. And, if we start breaking that \ndown, we are going to be in an awful lot of trouble.''\n  His wise defense of the Constitution and its protections for \nindividual conscience brought him vicious criticism and personal scorn. \nBut, no amount of criticism or scorn could deter him from his \nobligation to extend the protections of the Constitution to the poor as \nwell as the powerful, to the maligned as well as the popular.\n  Judge Pettine embraced his judicial duties with remarkable \ndedication. He became a scholar of the law and, in order to insulate \nhimself from even the appearance of partiality, he led a life focused \non his family and the lonely rigors of his judicial responsibilities. \nNevertheless, he cut a dashing figure in Rhode Island. He was a man of \ngreat culture and erudition who exuded style and panache.\n  Judge Raymond J. Pettine has left a remarkable legacy. His wisdom, \nhis integrity and his selfless devotion to the Constitution made him a \njudge of extraordinary achievement.

A bill to repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to the expansion of the \nadoption credit and adoption assistance programs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of National \nAdoption Day by introducing legislation to repeal the sunset on two \ncurrent-law tax provisions that make adoption more affordable for \nAmerican families.\n  In 2001, this Congress passed and President Bush signed into law the \nEconomic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. This act contains \nmany much needed tax relief provisions for the American people. \nHowever, because of procedural rules in the Senate, this law sunsets \nand expires after December 31, 2010.\n  The legislation I introduce today makes permanent two tax provisions \ncontained in that law, the adoption tax credit and the exclusion for \nemployer-provided adoption assistance benefits. If we do not pass this \nbill and therefore allow these provisions to sunset, then this tax \ncredit will be cut overnight from a maximum of $10,000 to $5,000. \nFamilies who adopt special needs children will no longer receive a flat \n$10,000 credit, and instead, they will be limited to a maximum of \n$6,000. As well, families claiming the credit may be pushed into the \nAlternative Minimum Tax.\n  Today, National Adoption Day, we celebrate the adoption of over 3,000 \nchildren from foster care. There are over 542,000 kids in foster care. \nOf these, more than 125,000 children are waiting to be adopted \npermanently. We here in Congress need to continue to help these \nchildren to find loving homes. We need to make it easier for families \nto adopt, not throw up barriers. If the adoption tax credit is cut to \nthe prior law level of $5,000, many families will not be able to afford \nadoptions. And therefore less children will be welcomed into what they \nwant the most, a permanent family.\n  Last year, the House of Representative passed this permanent \nextension of the adoption tax credit by a vote of 391 yeas to 1 nay. We \nin this Chamber failed to act. I am hopeful that my colleagues in the \nSenate recognize the importance of moving on this legislation to \npermanently extend this tax credit. The children and parents deserve to \nsee this adoption tax credit set into law for good. This is not a \npartisan issue, but something all Americans can agree on. We owe it to \nthem all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1931\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF APPLICABILITY OF SUNSET OF THE ECONOMIC \n                   GROWTH AND TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF \n                   2001 WITH RESPECT TO ADOPTION CREDIT AND \n                   ADOPTION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.\n\n       Section 901 of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2001 is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the \n     amendments made by section 202 (relating to expansion of \n     adoption credit and adoption assistance programs).''.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing this bill to repeal the provisions of the Economic Growth \nand Tax Relief Act of 2001 that sunset the adoption tax credit and \nadoption assistance programs.\n  Under the current legislation, families with adopted children are \ngiven a tax credit of up to $10,000 to cover their adoption expenses \nand families who adopt children with special needs are credited the \nfull $10,000. Providing this type of assistance is important in easing \nthe costs of the adoption process and helping families cover expenses \nincurred by adopting children with special needs.\n  Currently, there are around 550,000 children in foster care. Of this \nnumber, 126,000 are up for adoption. In order to facilitate and \nexpedite the adoption process, I have worked as a member of the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption to encourage and support families \nwho are willing to provide a loving, stable, and permanent home for \nthese children. The Coalition has been active in promoting adoption \naround the country through a number of programs, including the National \nAdoption Day, a day set aside to draw attention to expediting and \nfinalizing adoptions. In fact, Oklahoma held 20 adoptions this week in \ncelebration of the day.\n  I strongly believe that it is critical to repeal the sunset provision \nof the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act and continue to support those \nfamilies who are making it possible for children to grow up in a loving \nand caring environment. As the grandfather of an adopted granddaughter, \nI can say through personal experience that providing a home where a \nchild can be nurtured and given opportunities to become a contributing \nmember of society is one of the greatest and most rewarding gifts we \ncan ever give.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 1933. A bill to promote effective enforcement of copyrights, an \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Enhancing Federal \nObscenity Reporting and Copyright Enforcement Act of 2003, the EnFORCE \nAct. This bill makes three sets of narrow, but important, changes that \nwill build greater flexibility and accountability into our system of \nintellectual property laws.\n  First the EnFORCE Act will expand an existing antitrust exemption to \nconform the law to market realities. Today, an antitrust exemption in \nthe Copyright Act gives record companies and music publishers the \nflexibility they need to negotiate mechanical royalty rates in the \nrapidly evolving market for legal music downloading. These parties now \nneed the same flexibility to ensure that they can negotiate royalties \nassociated with innovative forms of physical phonorecords, like \nenhanced compact disks and DVD audio disks.\n  The music industry has sometimes been criticized for being too slow \nto\n\n[[Page S15574]]\n\nadopt its business models to new technologies. The industry is now \nresponding to such concerns by developing new products and new \ndistribution channels. The EnFORCE Act will ensure that Federal law \nallows the music industry to provide consumers with these innovative \nproducts and services.\n  Second, the EnFORCE Act will also resolve two narrow issues relating \nto statutory damages in copyright infringement litigation. Some accused \ninfringers have tried to avoid liability for statutory damages by \nchallenging the accuracy of the information in copyright registrations; \nthis bill clarifies that courts should resolve such challenges by \napplying the existing judicial doctrine of fraud-on-the-Copyright-\nOffice. In other cases, disputes have arisen about how many ``works'' \nhave been infringed for purposes of computing statutory damages. These \ndisputes are important for the music industry, which has received \ninconsistent adjudications about whether an album consisting of ten \nsongs counts as one or ten works for statutory-damages computation. The \nbill gives courts discretion to conform the law of statutory damages to \nchanging market realities.\n  Third, and finally, the EnFORCE Act will also enhance both the \nenforcement and oversight of federal intellectual property law. The \nbill authorizes appropriations to ensure that all Department of Justice \nunits that investigate intellectual property crimes have the support of \nat least one agent specifically trained in the investigation of such \ncrimes. The bill also requires the Department of Justice to report to \nCongress detailed information about the scope of its efforts to \ninvestigate and prosecute crimes involving the sexual exploitation of \nminors or intellectual property.\n  For the above reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Enhancing \nFederal Obscenity Reporting and Copyright Enforcement Act of 2003. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the \naffected public to ensure that this bill achieves its important \nobjectives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/22/senate-section/article/S15574-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this debate so far has been very \nilluminating, in a way fascinating, to see how different Members of the \nSenate view the bill that is before us. I hope that America's seniors \nare watching this debate. I hope they are listening. I hope they will \nmake up their own minds.\n  There are many groups out there who are going to give their opinions, \nand I respect them all. But I think if you just go to the debate and \nyou listen to all sides of it, seniors will come up with their own \nconclusions. As a matter of fact, I also hope people in their fifties \nand forties are watching this debate because many of the changes that \nwill be made, if this bill becomes law, are going to impact people in \ntheir fifties, people in their forties.\n  Let's face it, Medicare is a program that impacts all families \nbecause the children of senior citizens oftentimes bear the burden, if \nthere are health problems. Of course, they care deeply about their \nfamilies.\n  We know that Medicare is a nationwide health plan for aged and \ncertain disabled Americans, and it was created 40 years ago for seniors \nto offer them access to good quality health care. There was a huge \ndebate at that time about whether this was the right thing to do. But \npeople looked around and saw that our seniors were in trouble. They \nwere spending their money on health care, didn't have anything left, \noftentimes had to move in with their families. Their families had to \npick up their health care bills, and it was very difficult.\n  This program has fulfilled its promise. Is it perfect in every way? \nOf course not. What program is? What corporation is? What person is? \nBut Medicare has saved many lives and has made the golden years golden \nfor a lot of our seniors. That is why they feel so strongly about it.\n  I have been listening to some of the call-in shows. I have heard \nseniors identify themselves as Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents. They are worried about the changes that are about to hit \nthe system, and so am I.\n  The one thing I think everyone agrees on is that there ought to be a \nprescription drug benefit. At least I think most of us believe that \nfrom both sides of the aisle. We know this cost is heavy on our \nseniors. We know drug prices are skyrocketing because, unfortunately \nand very sadly, we don't allow drug reimportation from places like \nCanada and Mexico, although I have to tell you that in my State, people \nare going to Mexico.\n  I received a letter from a constituent of mine from San Marcos, CA, \nearlier this year. She told me that her annual cost for prescription \ndrugs this year will top $10,000. Think about that, $10,000. How do our \nseniors deal with this when they are retired?\n  A retired physician from Marina del Rey told me that a pill he takes \nfor his heart disease went up 600 percent, from $15 a month to $85. For \nseniors who have to take an assortment of medicines to manage their \nchronic diseases, the costs really start to add up.\n  Very sad to say, in this bill there is virtually no cost containment. \nEven though the House version said reimportation from Canada was a good \nidea, this has not happened. We will continue to pay the highest drug \nprices in the world. It is very sad, indeed. The provisions on generic \ndrugs were watered down a bit. We have some in there but not what they \nshould be.\n\n  For all the reasons that I talked about--the fact that I feel deep \ncompassion for my constituents who have to pay these huge sums for \nmedicines--I voted for the Senate bill. The Senate bill left here. I \nthought it made some sense. So let's look at what the Senate bill did \nfor our seniors.\n  It had about six things that it did that I thought were really \nimportant.\n  First, there was a modest benefit for seniors that were hardest hit \nby the costly prescription drugs. That benefit was a lot better than \nthe benefit that is currently before us. I will go into the \ndifferences. The benefit that is before us is so weak, it barely has a \npulse. It is barely worth filling out the forms. It is barely worth \nyour time. You could probably do better if you become friendly with \nyour pharmacy down the road. They will probably give you a better deal.\n  The benefit before us, unlike the benefit we voted on, is this: If \nyou have $5,100 worth of drug costs, you will pay $4,020 for those \ndrugs. In the meanwhile, you will have to figure out what are your \ndeductibles, what are your copays, filling out the forms, being \nnervous, getting notified that you no longer have the drug benefit \nbecause there is a benefit shutdown, which I will get into later. So \nthink about it. You have a $5,000 drug bill, and you are paying $4,000. \nAnd you are going through probably bureaucratic hell to get that \nthousand dollars off.\n  So the benefit, when we got the bill, we voted it out. I voted for \nit. I wanted it. It was a modest benefit but a decent benefit. It was \nmuch better than this one. We will get into that later.\n  Secondly, all seniors were guaranteed a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit if they didn't have two private plans in their area. So you had \na good fallback. If you didn't have two private drug plans competing \nfor your business, could you say: Forget this. I can go to Medicare.\n  Third, Medicare could have bargained for lower prescription drug \ncosts. Now, why is this important? Just look at the\n\n[[Page S15575]]\n\nVeterans' Administration. They can get way lower costs for the drug \nbenefits for their veterans because they represent millions of \nveterans. Therefore, they have bargaining power. It is not like if I \nwalked into a pharmacy myself and said: Hi, I am a veteran, can you \nlower my drug prices. And the pharmacist looks at me and says: Well, \nno. But if I bring millions of people into the store, the pharmacist is \ngoing to say: You know, now I can talk to you about some bargain \nprices.\n  That is what we have done with the VA. In the original bill that came \nout of the Senate, Medicare could have bargained. We will talk about \nthe current bill in a minute.\n  Then, No. 4, there were steps to privatize Medicare, but they were \nminor steps. They were balanced by a $6 billion sum that was added to \nMedicare. So while they gave the private plans $6 billion in the Senate \nbill to ``encourage'' them to stay in the Medicare business, I didn't \nagree with that. When I think about competition, I don't think about \npaying people to compete. I didn't think that is what capitalism is. I \nwas a stockbroker. That is news to me. To me competition is what it \nsays. You come in, you see you have a chance to make a profit, and you \ncompete.\n  Well, we were giving them $6 billion. I wasn't happy about it, but I \nfelt that, all in all, because we balanced it and gave $6 billion to \nMedicare to add prevention and some other very important benefits, it \nwas worth it.\n  So just sum that up. I want to be clear here. I supported the \nMedicare prescription drug bill that was before the Senate because it \nwas a decent benefit for seniors. It gave them about a third off their \ndrugs. So it gave you a third off of your drugs. I thought that was a \ngood benefit. You paid two-thirds and you got a third off. Again, I \nthought it should have been better. It was modest. I wasn't thrilled \nwith it. I tried to have amendments to close the benefit shutdown, to \nbring the benefit up to 50 percent, but I did not succeed in that \neffort.\n  All seniors were guaranteed a Medicare drug benefit, that fallback, \nif they didn't have two private drug plans competing. Frankly, I wanted \na Medicare fallback for everybody. I remember the debate. But they \nconvinced me to compromise. I wasn't thrilled, but I voted for it. \nMedicare could have bargained for lower prices for drugs. I assumed \nthat would be part of what we would do. We didn't prohibit it. The \nsteps to privatize Medicare, to incentivize HMOs to stay in the \nMedicare business, were balanced by $6 billion added to Medicare for \nsome important new benefits.\n  The last thing is, for the lowest income seniors, they got \nprescription drugs at no cost. That was a wonderful thing in the Senate \nbill. The poorest of the poor people who worked all their lives and \nfound themselves in a horrible situation today would have gotten drugs \nat no cost. For all those reasons, I was very pleased in the end that I \nwas able to move that bill forward.\n  I want to show you something I hope you can appreciate, as I hold \nthis bill up for a minute. The bill itself that has now come back to us \nis very heavy. Here it is. This is the bill that is before us today. \nThis bill I am holding is 678 pages. How much of this is the \nprescription drug benefit? It is 181 pages. What does that tell you? It \ntells you that most of this bill has nothing to do with prescription \ndrugs. Think about it. We sent a prescription drug bill into the \nconference committee to come back to us, and here it is. This yellow \ntab shows me where it is. This is the prescription drug benefit. It is \n181 pages. The balance of this bill is way more, 5 times more.\n  Think about it. If the folks who brought you this bill were sincere \nabout giving you a prescription drug benefit, why did they then use \nthat as an excuse to begin changing Medicare--changing Medicare in ways \nthat are perplexing, that are going to be difficult to understand, and \nthe rest?\n  Now, I am not, generally speaking, someone who is paranoid about \nthings. But I have to tell you, I am when I hear Newt Gingrich, \npraising all 600 pages of this bill, who said in 1995:\n\n       Now, we don't get rid of it [Medicare] in round one because \n     we don't think that that's politically smart, and we don't \n     think that's the right way to go through a transition. But we \n     believe Medicare is going to wither on the vine, because we \n     think people are voluntarily going to leave it.\n\n  Voluntarily. If you mess up Medicare and you make it confusing and \nstart doing the things that they do in this bill, Newt Gingrich will be \nproven right. Why do you think he went over to the caucus on the other \nside, in the House, and talked to the Republicans who didn't like the \nbill? Because they thought it was too good to seniors.\n\n  He said: No, it is not. Trust me. Would I lead you astray?\n  That is Newt Gingrich. The senior citizens in this country, in my \nview, are the smartest of the folks when it comes to Medicare. They \nknow it. They get it. They understand Social Security and they \nunderstand Medicare. They understand when Newt Gingrich said that \nMedicare should ``wither on the vine,'' and that this isn't something \nthey want to see happen.\n  Well, folks, please listen. ``We don't have to get rid of it in round \none,'' Newt said, ``because we don't think it's politically smart.'' So \nwhat did they do? They take a prescription drug benefit that is \npopular--by the way, it is voluntary, but I will talk about that \nbecause it is not voluntary if you are on Medicaid, and it is not \nvoluntary when you find out that your pension plan has dropped your \nprescription drug coverage because then you will have nothing. You will \nbe forced into it. It is not voluntary for those folks.\n  But I can tell you that this is just what Newt Gingrich planned. You \ncannot do it all at once. Not in round 1. We have to go through a \n``transition.'' Remember that word because it shows up in this bill--\n``transition.'' So here is prescription drugs, and here is the \nwithering on the vine.\n  A lot of the people who fought Medicare in the beginning are \nembracing this bill. Do you think they had a change of heart? Do you \nthink those of us who built our careers on protecting seniors have \nsomehow gone wacko on you by saying that this bill does more harm than \ngood? Think about the Senators who are standing up here and extolling \nthe virtues of this bill. One of them was here before and he said that \npeople on the other side are saying we are trying to destroy Medicare. \nHow ridiculous, he said. That's crazy. We would never do that. Then he \nlaunched into a harsh criticism of Medicare and how it needs to change.\n  Another, I thought, belied his point of view when he stood up and \nsaid--it is on the record from this afternoon--we need to get away from \nthe ``command and control'' of Medicare.\n  Well, I have news for the Senator from Texas, who said that. In \nMedicare, do you know who is in command and control? The senior \ncitizens. That senior citizen can go anywhere--to the doctor of choice. \nThat is the beauty of the Medicare system. They are in command and \ncontrol.\n  What this bill does is start the unraveling of that command and \ncontrol and gives it to a whole new system that is so confusing that I \nwould assure you, when you begin to hear the words and the acronyms \nassociated with this new system, if you went up to any Senator and \nasked him or her a question about it, not one of them would pass the \ntest of understanding every acronym--not even close. So the Senate bill \nbenefited seniors. What we have before us is quite different.\n  To me, the saddest thing about this bill is that it turned a modest, \nbut decent, benefit for seniors into an enormous benefit for the \nlargest pharmaceutical companies and HMOs in America. Here is what we \nhave now in the bill. This is what we have now. The bill benefits drug \ncompanies and HMOs.\n  First of all, the bill sets up a slush fund of $14 billion for HMOs. \nI have to say something here. The deficit that we are facing in our \ncountry today is nothing short of an abomination. From the minute this \nPresident took over until today, we have seen deficits as far as the \neye can see and balanced budgets turn into $500 billion-a-year deficits \nevery year. But the folks in the conference committee found $14 billion \nto give to those profitable corporations in America. Why do you think \nthat is the case?\n\n  There is an article today in the Washington Post that tries to \nexplain it. This is the headline on the front page:\n\n       2 Bills Would Benefit Top Bush Fundraisers. Executives' \n     Companies Could Get Billions.\n\n\n[[Page S15576]]\n\n\n  This is the selling of America. I want to quote from this article.\n\n       More than three dozen of President Bush's major fundraisers \n     are affiliated with companies that stand to benefit from the \n     passage of two central pieces of the administration's \n     legislative agenda: the energy and Medicare bills.\n\n  We stopped the Energy bill. I don't know how long we will be able to \nhold that, but the Energy bill is a clear-cut case. We talked about \nthat the other day, and now there is the Medicare bill.\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       The energy bill provides billions of dollars in benefits to \n     companies run by at least 22 executives and their spouses who \n     have qualified as either ``Pioneers'' or ``Rangers''--\n\n  That is what they call the big fat cats, Pioneers or Rangers----\n\n       as well as to the clients of at least 15 lobbyists and \n     their spouses who have achieved similar status as \n     fundraisers. At least 24 Rangers and Pioneers could benefit \n     from the Medicare bill--\n\n  Twenty-four Rangers and Pioneers, and those are the people who give \nthe most money----\n\n       could benefit from the Medicare bill as executives of \n     companies or lobbyists working for them, including eight who \n     have clients affected by both bills.\n\n  Talk about hitting the lottery. They benefit from the Energy bill and \nthis bill. We know where the money is going. It is going out of the \nFederal Treasury to the fat cats. Face it. Unfortunately for the folks \naround here, we know now. We have it.\n  How about this?\n\n       Hank McKinnell--\n\n  He may be a lovely man; this is not a personal attack on him----\n\n     chairman and CEO of Pfizer, has pledged to raise at least \n     $200,000 for Bush's reelection, although he is not yet listed \n     as a Pioneer or Ranger. Pioneer Munr Kazmir, who runs a \n     direct-mail drug company called Direct Meds Inc., estimates \n     that he has about 100,000 customers on Medicare who will have \n     more money to buy drugs from his company. ``We know the \n     patients, we know how important this bill is,'' he said.\n\n  Follow the money. Dress it up any way you want. Talk about how great \nthis bill is. Follow the money. I hope seniors are watching this \ntonight. They will make up their own minds. They are calling my office. \nMy phones are overwhelmed. What are they running on this? About 1,000 \ncalls to 200 calls against this bill. For every 100 yeses, there are \n1,000 nos. Seniors are smart.\n  They trust the AARP. Now they are finding out that the head of the \nAARP wrote the foreword to Newt Gingrich's book. Now they are finding \nout that the AARP gets 60 percent of their funds from selling \ninsurance. Now they are finding out that the head of the AARP \nrepresented big drug companies. Follow the money.\n\n  There is a $14 billion slush fund for HMOs at a time when we don't \nhave money to fully fund education. We can't fully fund education, but \nwe can find $14 billion for a slush fund for HMOs. They don't call it a \nslush fund. They call it a few other names--a stabilization fund. They \ncall it a stabilization fund.\n  Over 7 years, HMOs get $14 billion. This includes $10 billion in \ndirect subsidies to HMOs handed out at the discretion of the head of \nthe agency overseeing Medicare. How would you like to be that guy? At \nhis whim, this bureaucrat can write checks to HMOs to bribe them to \nparticipate in Medicare.\n  In addition, there are nearly $4 billion of payments to the HMOs that \nalready participate in Medicare just to bribe them to stay in Medicare. \nWhat kind of capitalism are we living in this country when we have to \npay the private sector extra money when they went in the business in \nthe first place? Things have changed. When I was a stockbroker, it \nwasn't that way. We didn't give corporations the kind of welfare we are \ngiving them today. This is corporate welfare. Follow the money to the \nPresidential campaigns and you will get a very interesting story.\n  This $14 billion slush fund is particularly egregious when you \nconsider that Medicare already pays HMOs more than the per-patient cost \nof traditional Medicare. Let me repeat that.\n  HMOs are getting paid more than the traditional Medicare. Do my \ncolleagues know why? The overhead in Medicare is very small. Do we know \nexactly--is it 2 or 3 percent? Anyway, we do not pay CEOs millions and \nmillions of dollars. They are taking that money right off the top and \nlining their pockets. Oh, but why not? They are nice people, give them \n$14 billion.\n  It is not that they are so great, these HMOs. People get the \nrunaround. They do not get the care they need. People want their \ntraditional Medicare.\n  Remember what I said. The bill I voted for in the Senate gave $6 \nbillion to HMOs. I was not happy with that at all, but at least it gave \n$6 billion to traditional Medicare to help us do more prevention. Guess \nwhat happened. It is gone. The conference committee took it away. But \nthey have added it on to the $6 billion already there. They added $6 \nbillion that was going to go to Medicare. They put it in the HMOs, and \nthey added $2 billion just in case it was not enough money for their \nfriends.\n  Secondly, this bill benefits drug companies and HMOs. There is a gag \nrule on Medicare price negotiation. I talked a little bit about that \nbefore. Medicare has all of these clients. Think about the clout \nMedicare could have when they call a drug company and say that their \ndrug X, Y, Z is a drug for arthritis and our patients like it; we are \ngoing to buy a lot of it for our patients; please give us a deal.\n  Oh, no, the conferees said, Medicare has a gag rule. Watch out. They \nmay do it to the veterans next. The VA can bargain, but Medicare cannot \nbargain. The drug companies and the HMOs can bargain explicitly. They \ncan bargain, and they can pocket some of the profits that they bargain, \nbut not Medicare. Medicare cannot bargain. There is a gag rule on \nMedicare.\n  They will stand up on the other side and say: We are not trying to \ndestroy Medicare; we think it is a great program. Just remember Newt \nGingrich: Let it wither on the vine.\n  Seniors are expected to spend $1.6 trillion in prescription drugs \nover the next decade. By the way, there are a lot of pharmaceutical \ncompanies and a lot of wonderful research companies in my State. I have \na great relationship with them. I support them getting an R tax \ncredit; in other words, a tax credit for every penny they put into \nresearch and development. Why? Because I think that is important. I \nsupport their patents--reasonably support their patent rights. I \nsupport research through the NIH very strongly, and a lot of that \nbenefits the drug companies as well. So I work very closely with my \nbiotech companies, with my pharmaceutical companies, but, by God, I do \nnot believe in giving them welfare.\n  Fourteen billion dollars? Is that because we have so much money? Is \nour deficit not big enough? It is only up to $500 billion in 2\\1/2\\ \nyears or 3 years. Gee, we could do better. Why do we not make it $600 \nbillion? Do I hear $700 billion?\n  I do not know what has happened, but it is not good. It took us 8 \nyears to balance that budget. The other side said: We want a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. And our side said: \nLet's just balance it. Why do we need to amend the Constitution? Let's \nbalance it. And President Clinton did that with us over 8 years.\n  Now it is gone. Now we have $14 billion to add to the deficit, and we \nare not going to let Medicare negotiate for us because, for whatever \nreason, they are tying Medicare's hand. I think it is because they want \nMedicare to wither on the vine. That is what Newt Gingrich said. That \nis the only thing I can come up with.\n\n  We know the cost of drugs could be lowered if Medicare negotiated \nthose drug prices. One might say, well, maybe, Senator Boxer; that \nwould be highly unusual for Medicare to negotiate with the drug \ncompanies. I would say, not at all. Medicare negotiates payments to \nhospitals. They have done that for years. When the bill left the \nSenate, there was no prohibition, but now there is. Why? Because they \ndo not want the Medicare drug plan to be able to offer lower prices. \nThey have given the right to negotiate to the private sector. They are \ngoing to push seniors into those plans.\n  Just remember where I started from. Just remember, ``wither on the \nvine,'' and ``follow the money.'' These are some simple concepts. At \nthe end of my statement, just put a little ribbon and tie the bow and \neveryone will get the picture as to why we are going down a very \ndangerous path.\n  In this bill, we are going to be giving to HMOs payments above their \nstated cost to deliver service. Has anyone ever heard of anything like \nthat in their entire life? A firm bids on a contract.\n\n[[Page S15577]]\n\nThey say: We can supply you with X number of widgets for a thousand \ndollars. On the dot, you get it. You deliver the thousand widgets, I \ngive you $1,000.\n  Here, HMOs are saying: We can deliver health care for patients at a \ncost of X dollars per patient. In this conference committee, they said: \nWell, we are going to give them more money than they say they need. It \nis called a lot of different names, such as premium support. It is \npayment above and beyond what they said it would cost. So put together \nthe slush fund and the payments above their cost of service and you are \nscratching your head, saying, maybe I ought to get into this business.\n  I say to people all over the country, small businesspeople who work \nhard in their business, be it retail or wholesale, you do not have a \ndeal like this. You open up your doors, you go into business, and \nsuddenly Uncle Sam is knocking on the door: Hey, I got a check for you \nHMOs, $14 billion over 7 years just to stay in the business; and, by \nthe way, we love you so much, we are going to give you dollars above \nand beyond what you say it costs. And, by the way, no one will catch \non. We are going to call these names different things. We are not going \nto call it a slush fund.\n  So the bill left the Senate. It was a good benefit, a decent benefit, \nbut a modest benefit. It was not perfect, but at least it was a bill on \nprescription drugs. It came back a benefit for drug companies and HMOs. \nSomebody said to me there was a hostile takeover in the conference \ncommittee of the Medicare bill, that the Senate passed, by the HMOs and \nthe prescription drug companies.\n  If we look at Wall Street, follow the money. Look at the prices of \nthese stocks. They are going out of sight because people know this is a \ndeal of a lifetime, that is for sure.\n  The last point I want to make is that this bill hurts our seniors. I \nam going to be specific. First, it hurts all our seniors, and in the \nend I am going to show you how it hurts my seniors in California, the \nlargest State in the Union.\n  These are facts. We have gotten them from the staff that worked on \nthis conference bill. Six million seniors will pay more for \nprescriptions than they do now. Let me tell you who these people are. \nSix million low-income and disabled beneficiaries currently receive \nprescription drug benefits from the Medicaid Program, which is a \nmatching Federal-State program administered by the State. These \nprograms are more generous in coverage than the proposed bill that is \nbefore us because they serve our very sickest Americans.\n  For example, a Medicare/Medicaid-eligible person in California can, \nbut does not have to, pay a $1 per prescription copayment. The \ncopayment is voluntary. A dollar may sound like zero, nothing, to \npeople. But if you are an inch away from owning nothing, every dollar \ncounts.\n  Under the conference bill the same person will now be required to \nmake a copayment, maybe, up to $5. Some will pay premiums of $50 and be \nsubject to a strict asset test. Studies have shown that even small \ncopayments for prescription drugs can make essential medicines \nunaffordable for low-income seniors, resulting in an 88-percent \nincrease in hospitalizations and deaths, and a 78-percent increase in \nemergency room visits.\n  So they say to my State, now you can't help these poorest of the \npoor. Sorry. They gave that a name, too, which we will get into later. \nThey give it a nice name, but the bottom line is the people, the \npoorest of the poor, the States that help them can no longer help them \nonce they get into this program.\n  The copayments to these poorest of the poor are indexed for \ninflation. So they can and they will go up. Remember, most of these \npeople don't make any money. When you get hit with inflation and you \nare on a fixed income, that bites. That takes food off the table. So we \nknow there will be an increase in hospitalizations. That was in the \nbackground information, that 88-percent increase in hospitalizations \nand deaths because people will not take their medicine.\n  States are prohibited from covering the out-of-pocket costs of these \ndual eligibles, and the bill prohibits States from establishing more \nexpansive drug lists for the mentally ill, disabled, and other groups.\n  That is important. They may be taking a drug that isn't covered on \nthis formulary.\n  I want to talk about people with AIDS. We have a high number in our \nState. People are suffering. Many of them are dual eligibles. They are \neligible for Medicare disability and Medicaid. For them this bill is \ncatastrophic. My phones are ringing off the hook with calls from them, \ntheir parents, their families. It is likely that they may not have \naccess to or be able to afford all the drugs they need. So this is why \nthis bill is opposed by the AIDS Medicare Project, San Francisco; AIDS \nProject, Los Angeles; Project Inform, San Francisco; San Francisco AIDS \nFoundation. But let's face it, it is not just AIDS patients who are \ngoing to be harmed. Anyone with a life-threatening illness runs the \nrisk of not having coverage for the drugs they need. If they are denied \ncoverage for these drugs under Medicare, they can appeal the decision, \nbut this doesn't mean they can afford them.\n  So when it comes to my State, I will show you later the numbers of \npeople who will be worse off. It goes in the hundreds of thousands--the \nhundreds of thousands.\n  Now there is a very cruel asset test. When I voted for the bill in \nthe Senate that the Senator from Iowa worked so hard on with the \nSenator from Montana, that was a good bill. That bill would have \nallowed low-income seniors to receive assistance without forcing them \nto sell a car because it was worth over $4,500 or a ring that maybe was \ntheir most precious possession from their loved one or a family \nheirloom.\n  The conference bill imposes a Draconian asset test of $6,000 per \nperson, $10,000 per couple, for the poorest of the poor. As a result, 3 \nmillion low-income seniors nationwide, and 300,000 in California, will \nbe deprived of assistance that would not only help them with their \nprescription drugs but help them pay the premium so they could receive \nthe coverage in the first place.\n  In other words, the bill that is before us has some generosity \ntowards the poorest of the poor, but they have added an asset test into \nit so if you have a family heirloom or you own a car worth more than \n$4,500 or you have a diamond ring and a gold wedding band that your \nhusband may have given you when you were married, you have to sell it. \nYou have to get rid of it. Otherwise you don't get the benefit of this \nprescription drug benefit.\n  I don't get that. I am sad the conferees didn't go with the bill that \nmost of us voted for in the Senate.\n  Now you come to seniors who are forced into demonstration projects \nthat penalize them for staying in Medicare. That happens in 2010. You \nsay we are just in 2003. We are almost in 2004--that is 6 years away, \nbig deal. One thing I have learned, as long as I have lived, is that \ntime goes fast. Six years will be here. If you are in one of those \ndemonstration projects, what is going to happen is plain and simple: \nYour premiums are going to go up if you stay in Medicare--bottom line. \nEven though people say you are not forced into these other plans, the \ncosts may force you into these other plans.\n  One in six Medicare beneficiaries will be forced to participate in \nthis experiment. In California, 12 of its metropolitan statistical \nareas will qualify for these demonstration projects. Let's say two of \nthe largest are chosen; one is in L.A. and the other is in San \nFrancisco. So what we will have is my seniors in those areas will have \nto make a very tough choice. Do they stay in Medicare and pay more \nmoney or do they go into an HMO and lose the choice of their doctors?\n  We have already had some experimentation. We know the healthy people \nwill choose the HMOs because they are cheaper. After all, they are \nhealthy so they are not worried about getting messed up by an HMO. If \nthey are not sick, you know, it is not a problem.\n  But the sicker seniors would be left in Medicare, and we know that we \nwill see costs spiral out of control because there will be a sick pool \nof seniors, rather than spreading the risk, which is what insurance is \nall about.\n  Now we have a situation where premiums for middle and upper class \npeople are going to go up. My colleagues say they are only going to go \nup if you earn $80,000 a year. I understand that is\n\n[[Page S15578]]\n\nquite a bit. That is not that many people. But this is the problem. \nThis number of $80,000 a year is not indexed for inflation. So it looks \nlike it is a lot now, but in the future it will not look like it is \nthat big.\n  For example, if this provision, the one that my colleague from Iowa \nsupports, was in place in 1980, the equivalent level of income would be \n$33,000, and the person at that level would have to pay much more for \ntheir Medicare. So the fact is, they have done an interesting thing: \nThey have not indexed this, so in the end you will have people of very \nmoderate incomes paying huge premiums to Medicare.\n  Now what is going to happen? It will wither on the vine because \npeople will say: I don't want anything to do with this. It is too \ncostly. I don't need it. I will just go out and buy a catastrophic \npolicy elsewhere.\n  I will tell you, if you take that fact, along with the fact that this \nbill sets up health savings accounts for the wealthiest people, you are \ngoing to have middle-income people and wealthy people walk away from \nMedicare, and you will lose the class you have when you have a larger \npool. That is just a fact of life. That is why we have had a successful \nprogram--because insurance needs a very big pool.\n  I am going to put up a chart that I hope all of you who might be \ncrazy enough to be watching this will remember. I know this isn't \nexactly prime-time television. But I want to show you a chart of ``Fear \nand Confusion.'' This is a Barbara Boxer homemade chart. This is the \nchaos and confusion that our seniors are going to be facing.\n  If any of you are watching this tonight, I am telling you to take \nnote. I am telling you to call the AARP. Senator Durbin gave you the \nnumber. I do not know it. I want you to take notes and ask them to \nexplain each of these concepts they have endorsed in this bill. Then I \nwant you to call everyone who votes for this bill, if this bill passes, \nand call your Senators and ask them to explain what all of this means. \nI am not going to tell you what it means tonight because we would be \nhere all night. These are the terms that have been thrown around in \nthis bill. You are going to have to understand this if you are going to \nunderstand what Congress is about to do to you. You will have to \nunderstand this.\n  Confusion and fear--some of them you know; HMO, you know that one. \nThere is fear there, but it has nothing to do with the fact you don't \nknow what Health Maintenance Organization stands for.\n  Risk corridors: I want you to learn what risk corridors mean; \ncopayments, plan retention funding, MA-prescription drug plans, or MA-\nPD plans; donut hole. No, it is not what you buy in the store that is \nso good. I am on a diet. I haven't had one of them in a while. But a \ndonut hole is something you had better understand because it is going \nto cost you when you get to it.\n  Here is another one: MA-Regions; catastrophic, premium support, \nassets test. I explained that one to you. That is one where you have to \nsell your wedding band, if you are poor, in order to qualify for \ngetting your drugs free.\n  Average weighted premium; MSP, Medicare Secondary Payment; \ncoordination requirements; initial coverage limit; CMS, you had better \nknow that because the man who is the head of it is the one who is going \nto control the slush fund for HMOs.\n  Here is one which is kind of my favorite because I actually \nunderstand it: Claw back. That is a new word for you. That expresses \nwhat happens if you are a State and you have helped your poorest people \npay for their Medicaid. You no longer can help them, but you can't keep \nthe money. You have to send it to Uncle Sam. That is a claw back.\n  Transitional assistance, MSA. That stands for Metropolitan \nStatistical Area. If you are in one of those, you are forced into a \ndemonstration project even if you do not want to be.\n  Benefit shutdown: This is one I know very well. After you buy a \ncertain amount of drugs--around $2,000--you get a letter in the mail \nfrom your company that is giving you this drug benefit, and they say: \nSorry, sir, your benefits shut down until you go past $5,100. Benefit \nshutdown is not a good thing.\n\n  Risk adjustment premiums--you all know what that means; Part D, \nincome relating, SA-wraparound; national bonus payment. But don't get \nexcited. It doesn't go to you. Comparative Cost Adjustment Program; \nStabilization Fund--that sounds as if it is a good thing. If you are an \nHMO, that is the money you get to keep you in business.\n  I tell you, if something happens to me and I am not back here after \nmy next election, which could happen to anybody, I am going to consider \nhelping one of these big HMOs. I understand half of this. I may help \nthem.\n  Medicare advantage competition, wraparound--we did that--MA-regional \nplans; MA-prescription drugs; annual out-of-pocket threshold. Watch out \nfor that one. Annual out-of-pocket threshold is what you have paid for \nyour drugs out-of-pocket before you can get the benefit. However, if \nyour drug isn't on the formulary, it doesn't count. So don't count on \nit too soon.\n  Return disclosure: This has to do with your tax return. You are going \nto have your tax return sent to the IRS from the Health and Human \nServices Department if you are an upper income senior. They want to \nknow what you earn. Before, Medicare never asked that because it is an \ninsurance program. Now, do you know in this bill that the people who do \nnot like taxes are making sure the IRS receives from the Health and \nHuman Services Department information about your tax return?\n  Deductible: Again, very tricky. You have to understand that.\n  PDP sponsors, Prescription Drug Plan sponsors; monthly benchmarks. I \nam not sure about that one myself. But monthly benchmarks, we have to \nbe careful about those.\n  Fallback: The fallback is in the prescription drug plan. In the \nSenate bill that I voted for, if you didn't have two plans come in to \ncompete, you could always fall back to Medicare. Now it is basically \none plan.\n  I told you about fallback. I went over all of it. MSP; average \nweighted premium--I think I pretty well went over this; coverage gap; \nplan retention funding.\n  The way I have done this chart, it looks kind of chaotic. It is to \nmake a point. I don't even have half of the terms that are in this \nbill. I am going to work on this so that after the cloture vote when we \nhave a little more debate, I will be able to get a better list.\n  But there is no secret why seniors are calling up our offices. They \nare smart. They are the smartest folks around. They have lived a long \ntime. They are smart. They know what Newt Gingrich said: Let it wither \non the vine. And then he endorses this. They weren't born yesterday.\n  The one thing I was interested in with C-SPAN is the people who were \ncalling were Republicans and Democrats, and they all sounded alike. One \nout of 10 said they liked the deal. So this bill hurts seniors. We know \nthat for sure.\n  Confusion and fear, large benefit shutdown, which is daunting and \npenalizes innocent seniors.\n  I told you before. You get to a certain point, and your benefits \nstop. A couple of thousand dollars, and then it starts up again at \n$5,000. Name for me one other drug program that does that. I checked it \nout. There are hundreds of them. Maybe there was one other that had a \nsmall benefit. I have never seen it. We don't have that in our plan. We \njust go in the pharmacy and give them our Senator's health card. We get \na good deal. They never shut us down. Why should we shut you down? It \nis a bad thing. It is not right. If I was a local pharmacist, I would \nsay to my seniors, I can do better than this plan. Come into my store, \nbuy your drugs here, and I will give you a discount card.\n\n  Seniors will have to worry about filling out this form, filling out \nthat form, is this drug on the formulary, and so on--fear and \nconfusion. The bill hurts seniors.\n  Now we will look at what it does to my State's seniors. This is the \ndirect impact on my State's seniors: 867,000 sick low-income seniors \nwill have worse Medicaid prescription drug coverage. Boom. This starts \nin 2006 when 867,000 sick low-income seniors will have worse Medicaid \nprescription drug coverage than now.\n  Mr. President, 250,000 retirees will lose their more generous \nprescription drug coverage even after we give payments to the \nemployers. I supported that. That was a good move. But even\n\n[[Page S15579]]\n\nwith that, they are dropping coverage once they know their retirees \nhave another option. Wait until those people get the clue that is \nhappening.\n  Years ago we passed a catastrophic medical bill and I remember \nseniors were attacking Congress people. Wait until they hear they get \ndropped--retirees who worked all their life, who like their plan and \nthey get dropped. They do not have a choice. If they want prescription \ndrugs they have to come with this plan. Wait until they have to deal \nwith benefit shutdowns.\n  Mr. President, 296,000 fewer low-income seniors will qualify for low-\nincome protections than under the Senate bill because of the assets \ntest that I talked about and lower-qualifying income levels. The \npoorest of the poor--when compared to what we did in the Senate, the \nbill I voted for--are worse off. These numbers are huge because I \nrepresent a big State. And 230,000 Medicare beneficiaries will pay \nhigher Part B premiums because they are upper middle income and \nwealthy. That will happen to them.\n  Also, because they are in the MSA or metropolitan statistical area, \nthat demonstration project, 1.4 million could be forced into them as we \nprojected because we have the big metropolitan areas, or be penalized \nfor staying in traditional Medicare because the people who are healthy \nwill go into those private plans and the people who are sick will stay \nin Medicare and the costs will go up.\n  We have fear and confusion. I don't know how many of these figures \nare double-counted, so I cannot just add them up. Some of these figures \nmay fit into more than one category, but I can state with certainty a \ncouple of million of my 4 million people on Medicare are going to be \nworse off with this bill, much worse off. That is a very bad thing to \ndo.\n  I don't know where the votes are. I think they have the votes to pass \nthis. But if seniors across this country got a couple of days--there \nare about 48 hours to pick up your phone, call your Senator and say: \nSenator, maybe you are right. But this thing is confusing. I am \nfearful. Give me a little more time.\n  The bill was just printed and we saw it for the first time the day \nbefore yesterday. This bill is bigger than I am, and we got it the day \nbefore yesterday.\n  I have shared some of the new bureaucratic ``wordspeak'' in the bill \nand I have just had a couple of days to look it over. At the least, we \nshould say to our colleagues, put this thing off. We are going to come \nback in January. This Congress goes 2 years. That is the beauty of it. \nIf it was next year, the legislation would die. But we have 1 more year \nof this session. What is the rush? Tell your Senator, maybe Senator \nBoxer is wrong when she says this will hurt me. I am not sure, but she \nhas raised some issues.\n  Change, if it is positive change, is something we all want. But \nchange could be negative, could be disruptive, could cause us to be \nconfused or fearful. What is the problem in taking a little while \nlonger? To be honest, I would love to have the Christmas holiday recess \nto read every line of this bill. I started to do that. That is how I \ncame up with all of these words, by reading the bill and trying to \nunderstand all of this. I did not even scratch the surface.\n  This Senate voted down an Energy bill which I felt, frankly, was in \nmany ways a giveaway for a lot of special interests. And the good that \nwas in it--and there were good things in it--was outweighed by the \nspecial interest provisions. We should be here for the public \ninterests, for the people we represent.\n  I remember one of my colleagues saying to me, when someone asked a \nquestion about oncology, because there has been some concern about how \nthe oncologists are being treated--someone in the room said, just look, \nthere is a company being traded, a health care company that deals with \noncology, and the stock is shooting up. It must be that oncologists are \nbeing treated fairly.\n  I used to be a stockbroker. It is not of any interest to me to do \nthings that make the stock of a company go up. Do you know what I want \nto go up? The stock of the American people, the lives of the American \npeople, the quality of life of the American people, the quality of life \nof grandmas and grandpas and their families.\n  This is truly not a partisan issue. It is an issue of how do we give \na prescription drug benefit to our senior citizens and keep Medicare \nstrong and not make this bill a giveaway to the largest HMO and \npharmaceutical companies and insurance companies in the country. They \nare doing very well. This debate has been a good debate so far. We have \nserious disagreement. I am sure I will be back in the Senate after we \nhave a cloture vote, one way or the other, just to add more terminology \nto my fear and confusion chart.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are waiting with \nbated breath to see my next version of this fear and confusion chart \nbecause I know they understand every single one of these terms. It is \ninteresting to look at these terms and to realize how far reaching and \nhow bureaucratic this new bill is.\n  I will say one last thing and then I will leave the floor, much to \nthe delight of the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Montana. I \nsay to any senior citizen, any human being who is within the reach of \nmy voice, and there may be a few at this late hour, if you feel we need \nmore time to see whether Senator Boxer is right or Senator Grassley is \nright or Senator Baucus is right or Senator Kennedy is right or Senator \nDurbin is right or Senator Hatch is right, if you think you need more \ntime to take a look at this bill, to get this bill analyzed, this bill \nthat weighs a lot, this bill that is over 600 pages, call your Senator, \ne-mail your Senators and tell them to take some more time, to put this \nthing over until after the first of the year and we can come back here \nand have the whole year to work on this bill, which is really rewriting \nthe Medicare Program.\n\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think the place for me to start is \nwhere the Senator from California left off; that is, the impression \nthat is left that this bill is going to confuse the seniors of America, \nand almost that the purpose of it might be to confuse seniors.\n  But let me make very clear to all the seniors who are listening, and \neverybody else who is listening, one of the keystones of this \nlegislation is to say to the seniors of America: If you do not want to \ndo anything, if you do not want anything to do with this, you do not \nhave to have it. This is strictly voluntary.\n  For any senior in Iowa or California who comes to their respective \nMembers of Congress and says: Congressman so and so, or Senator so and \nso, just leave my Medicare alone; I am satisfied, each of us can say to \nthem: If you do not want to worry about all this that we are talking \nabout--prescription drugs or anything new about Medicare--you do not \nhave to because you can keep traditional Medicare as you have known it \nfor the last 35 years. Just keep it as is, if you are satisfied with \nit.\n  But for those who might not be satisfied, we give them several \noptions. They have a right to choose. They have a right to keep \ntraditional Medicare with a prescription drug program that they can \nchoose to go into, or they also have the right to choose a new \nMedicare--preferred provider organizations--that is very close to what \nbaby boomers now have in the workplace. They can choose that with an \nintegrated drug benefit plan.\n  So we are not trying to confuse anybody. We are trying to give \nseniors the right to choose. We are trying to give seniors who are \ntotally satisfied with what they have right now an opportunity to just \nstay where they are right now. It is the right of seniors to choose.\n  I think I better be very clear because so much of the opposition to \nthis bill today has come from the other side of the aisle, mostly \nDemocratic Members of the Senate.\n  We are here today with a piece of legislation because over the years \n2001 and 2002--after Senator Jeffords switched from being a Republican \nto being an independent and casting his lot with the Democrats, so they \nwere a majority during the remainder of 2001 and all of 2002--there was \nan effort early on to develop a bipartisan approach to a drug benefit \nduring the last Congress.\n  When that was developing, there was a fear that there might be a \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page S15580]]\n\nbill reported out of the Senate Finance Committee, a year ago, and the \nthen-majority leader, now the minority leader, Senator Daschle, decided \nthat this was an issue that ought to be brought to the Senate floor, \nnot worked out in committee.\n  Remember, you develop bipartisanship in the Senate in the committee. \nYou do not do it very often here on the floor of the Senate. You build \ncoalitions.\n  Remember, nothing gets done in the Senate that is not bipartisan--\nunlike the House of Representatives, where partisan things can be \ndone--because, remember, the Senate of the United States is that only \ninstitution in our political system where minority rights are \nprotected.\n  So a year ago, the then-majority party decided that this ought to be \ndebated on the floor. But they also knew that it would be impossible to \nget the bipartisan majority that it takes to get things done. They \ngambled that they needed an issue for the last election rather than a \nproduct. They gambled on an issue that we would not do anything last \nyear, and the way they maneuvered this, nothing was done because \nnothing in a partisan way, even by majority Democrats, can be produced \nout of this body that is not somewhat bipartisan.\n\n  Then there was an election, and they found out that issue did not \nwork for them; that Republicans were put in a majority. This gave, in \nthis new majority, in this new Congress, Senator Baucus and I, the top \nDemocrat and the top Republican on the committee, an opportunity to do \nour magic and put together a bipartisan bill. That bill came to the \nSenate floor and was passed 76 to 21. It went to conference, and came \nout of conference in a bipartisan way. And we are here because the \nmajority Republicans and some sensible Democrats want to produce a \nproduct and not have an issue for the next election. I happen to think, \nfrom the comments I have heard today--all the fault that can be found \nwith this bipartisan product--that there are still too many people on \nthe other side of the aisle who have not learned a lesson: No. 1, how \ndo you get anything done in the Senate? It has to be bipartisan. And, \nNo. 2, they did not learn from the mistakes of the last election when \nthey thought they needed an issue. Do they think if it did not work in \n2002, it is going to work in 2004?\n  So that is why we are where we are because there are Democrats who \nknow that you do not get anything done in the Senate if there is not a \nbipartisan coalition. There are Republicans who have understood that \nfor a long period of time.\n  So that is background to what I want to tell the people of America \nand my colleagues about why this bill should be adopted. During this \nprocess, I am going to correct some of the statements made by my \ncolleagues so far today.\n  I want to correct what my colleague from Iowa said earlier about this \nbill's impact on rural America and on our State of Iowa in particular.\n  The rural health provisions of this bill go further and wider than \nany other legislation that this Congress has ever considered. It enjoys \nthe strong support of the Nation's doctors and hospitals, and it is \nalso strongly endorsed by the Iowa Medical Society and by the Iowa \nHospital Association, two of the strongest advocates for rural equity \nin my State and my colleague's State.\n  I will read an excerpt from each and then ask unanimous consent that \nboth letters be printed in the Record.\n  This is from the Iowa Medical Society president, Tom Evans, M.D.: \n``[P]assage of the bill,'' meaning the bill before us, ``is critical \nfor rural states like Iowa.'' ``He said: ``In addition to providing \nseniors with prescription drug coverage''--and I want to emphasize this \npart of his statement--``this legislation fixes many of the \nreimbursement issues that have unfairly penalized rural States. \nCongress must pass this legislation before the Thanksgiving [Day] \nrecess.''\n  Now, I go to the Iowa Hospital Association, which in 2001 circulated \nstatistics, already referred to, showing Iowa in last place in per-\nbeneficiary spending. The Iowa Hospital Association: ``The Iowa \nHospital Association strongly endorses passage of this legislation.'' \n``In an evaluation of the per-beneficiary increase, this legislation \nprovides Iowa hospitals with the second largest percentage increase per \nMedicare beneficiary of any state in the Union. This amounts to a per-\nbeneficiary increase of $583, which is the thirteenth highest increase \nof any state in the Union.\n  Mr. President, beyond those quotes, I could give a lot of evidence, \nbut I think those quotes speak volumes about our rural package. That \npackage in this legislation speaks for itself. It brings real \nimprovements and equitable payments to hospitals and doctors in Iowa \nand way beyond.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Iowa Hospital Association\n\n                                    Des Moines, IA, Nov. 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Congratulations in reaching an \n     agreement on a conference report that directly and \n     significantly impacts the issue of equity and fairness for \n     hospitals and physicians in rural America and particularly \n     for Iowa. Just this morning, the entire Iowa Hospital \n     Association Board was briefed on the impact of your Medicare \n     legislation and on a unanimous vote endorsed the pending \n     legislation.\n       In an evaluation of the per-beneficiary increase, this \n     legislation provides Iowa hospitals with the second largest \n     percentage increase per Medicare beneficiary of any state in \n     the Union. This amounts to a per-beneficiary increase of \n     $583, which is the thirteenth highest increase of any state \n     in the Union.\n       The Iowa Hospital Association strongly endorses passage of \n     this legislation and will today ask its entire membership to \n     weigh-in on behalf of the legislation with the entire \n     congressional delegation of Iowa in an effort to support your \n     work to achieve passage of this legislation before the \n     Thanksgiving holiday. It is our hope that when Congress \n     completes its work and you return to Iowa for the holidays, \n     that all Iowa providers will have an opportunity to \n     congratulate you for successful passage of this historic \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kimberly A. Russel,\n       IHA Board Chair.\n     Kirk Norris,\n       President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Iowa Medical Society Strongly Supports Passage of Medicare Reform \n                              Legislation\n\n       The Iowa Medical Society (IMS) announced today its strong \n     support for the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization \n     Act of 2003 conference report.\n       IMS President Tom Evans, MD, said passage of the bill is \n     critical for rural states like Iowa. ``In addition to \n     providing seniors with prescription drug coverage, this \n     legislation fixes many of the reimbursement issues that have \n     unfairly penalized rural states,'' he said. ``Congress must \n     pass this legislation before the Thanksgiving recess.''\n       Evans said the bill protects Iowans' access to physicians \n     by replacing a 4.5 percent payment cut scheduled for 2004 \n     with two years of modest payment increases. The bill also \n     fixes a component of the reimbursement formula that deals \n     with geographic practice cost adjustors that causes huge \n     reimbursement swings from state to state.\n       ``If this legislation isn't passed, the American Medical \n     Association estimates that a 4.5 percent cut in reimbursement \n     will take $30 million away from Iowa's health care system in \n     2004,'' he said. ``Now add to this the fact that Iowa already \n     receives among the lowest payment rates in the country, and \n     you can see how Medicare is threatening our ability to care \n     for our patients.''\n       Evans also thanked Senator Charles Grassley for his work on \n     this bill as Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and he \n     urged Iowa Senator Tom Harkin and Iowa's Congressional \n     Representatives to support the Medicare conference report.\n       The Iowa Medical Society is the professional association \n     representing over 4,600 MDs and DOs. The IMS core purpose is \n     to assure the highest quality health care in Iowa through its \n     role as physician and patient advocate.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Now let me speak to what this bill does for Iowa's \nseniors. The bipartisan agreement provides all of the 485,042 \nbeneficiaries in Iowa with access to Medicare prescription drug \nbenefits, as I have stated previously, on a voluntary basis. It does it \nfor the first time in the history of the Medicare Program. That begins \nJanuary 2006. Beginning in 2006, the bipartisan agreement will give \n142,297 Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa access to drug coverage they \nwould not otherwise have and will improve coverage for many more.\n  Within 6 months after this bill is signed--in other words, during the \nyear 2004--Iowa residents will be immediately eligible for Medicare \napproved prescription drug discount cards which\n\n[[Page S15581]]\n\nwill provide them with savings between 10 percent and 25 percent off \nthe retail price of most drugs. Beneficiaries with incomes of less than \n$12,123, or $16,362 for couples, who lack prescription drug coverage, \nincluding drug coverage under Medicaid, will get up to $600 in annual \nassistance to help them afford their medicine along with a discount \ncard. That is a total of $100,840,345 in additional help for 84,034 \nIowa residents during these years of 2004 and 2005, as this interim \nprogram is in place, helping Medicare recipients with drugs until we \nget the permanent program put in place. Then beginning in the year \n2006, all 485,042 Medicare beneficiaries living in Iowa will be \neligible to get prescription drug coverage through a Medicare approved \nplan.\n  In exchange for a monthly premium of about $35, seniors who are now \npaying the full retail price for prescription drugs will be able to cut \ntheir drug costs roughly in half. In many cases, they will save more \nthan 50 percent on what they pay for their prescription medicines. One \nhundred thirty-three thousand beneficiaries in Iowa who have limited \nsavings and low incomes--and this would generally be those below \n$12,000 for individuals and $16,000 for couples--will qualify for even \nmore generous coverage. They will pay no premiums for their \nprescription drug coverage, and they will be responsible for a nominal \ncopayment. That copayment would be no more than $2 for generic drugs \nand $5 for brand name drugs.\n  We have 41,300 additional low-income beneficiaries in Iowa with \nlimited savings, and incomes below $13,500 for individuals and $18,000 \nfor couples, qualifying for reduced premiums and a reduced deductible \nof $50 and a Medicare that will cover 85 percent of their prescription \ndrug costs with no gap in coverage.\n  Additionally, Medicare, instead of Medicaid, will now assume the \nprescription drug cost of 50,000 Iowa beneficiaries who are eligible \nfor both Medicare and Medicaid. These seniors generally will pay $1 and \n$3 per prescription and those in nursing homes will pay zero dollars \nfor their prescriptions. This will save Iowa $175 million over 8 years \non prescription drug coverage for its Medicaid populations.\n  I have tried to address for my colleagues, but particularly for my \nresidents and constituents in Iowa, how this program will impact them \nas individual beneficiaries of the prescription drug part of our bill. \nAnd I have tried to inform my colleagues and my residents of Iowa how \nthe rural equity package will help provide quality care for Iowans \nbecause we are increasing the reimbursement for our hospitals and for \nour doctors in rural America.\n  Now I will address several of the most egregious misconceptions about \nthe bill that have been spoken on the floor of the Senate today. First, \nI will address the issue of protecting retiree drug coverage. This \nwould be those people who have, for the most part, coverage from places \nwhere they used to work that also continue to cover people with health \nbenefits and prescription drugs after they leave employment.\n\n  During the debate on S. 1, when this bill passed the Senate the first \ntime in June of this year, it passed by a 76-to-21 bipartisan vote. At \nthat time, even though we had that high bipartisan majority, my \ncolleagues raised concerns about what they referred to as the high \nlevel of employers that would drop their retiree prescription drug \ncoverage should we enact the prescription drug benefit into the \nMedicare Program.\n  At that time, the Congressional Budget Office told us that 37 percent \nof the seniors who have drug coverage--that is roughly one-third of the \nseniors under Medicare--would lose that coverage if we passed the bill. \nI think I ought to say that there was another group, the Employer \nBenefit Association, that studied the same issue and said it would be 3 \npercent to 9 percent who would lose coverage. So we probably have an \nintellectually honest difference of opinion by the Congressional Budget \nOffice on the one hand and the Employer Benefit Association on the \nother hand. But we in the Congress are stuck, as we determine the cost \nof programs, with what the Congressional Budget Office says. We would \nrather--and it would be easier--if we could just go by what the \nEmployer Benefit Association says, but we go by CBO because they are \nGod when it comes to saying what something costs. So we had to live \nwith that 37 percent.\n  Well, as we all know, however, employers have been dropping or \nreducing prescription drug coverage for many years. So this is really \nnothing new. If we were not even talking about this bill today, some \nboard of directors of some corporation in America could come to the \nconclusion that they couldn't afford to cover their retirees anymore \nand drop them. What could Congress do about that? Nothing. But it is \nnice to have a program when that happens for people to fall back on. \nThat is one of the reasons for this legislation.\n  Of course, we want to take care that we can do everything possible to \nmake sure that corporation X doesn't do that. In just the past 2 years, \nretiree health care coverage has dropped by 22 percent. That was with \nthis Congress not doing anything, not considering this legislation.\n  We know these days employers are finding it harder and harder to \ncontinue to voluntarily provide health insurance coverage. That is due \nto a lot of factors, including rising health care costs overall. Now, \nas we were in conference between the House and the Senate, we took this \nmarketplace dynamic of company XYZ, ABC, or whatever corporation--that \nthey could do this. This is a dynamic we had to take very seriously. So \nwe went to great lengths to improve employer participation in drug \nbenefits to keep employers in the game; to keep their retirees covered, \nas retirees would expect to be covered, but sometimes they are \nsurprised when they are not.\n  Our conference report reflects this. It includes remarkably better \npolicies for employers than those that were in either the bill that \npassed in the Senate 76 to 21 or that passed the House in June as well. \nSo I am saying to you we brought back a conference report that was \nbetter in regard to employee-retiree coverage than either passed the \nSenate or the House in the first place.\n  So what happens when we do that good work? The policies in this \nconference report have led to major corporate plans endorsing our \nconference report. So the people on the other side of the aisle, with \ntheir charts, who are saying bad damage is being done by this \nlegislation, what would they have us do? Pass nothing? If corporation X \ndecides to drop, and there is nothing there for their employees, do you \nthink those same people are better off if Congress does zilch? Where \nwere they when they voted in the first place, complaining about S. 1 or \nH. 1, the House bill, when we passed them in June?\n  Here we are bringing back a conference report that is being endorsed \nby these corporate plans. Doesn't that mean anything to any of you? \nUnder this conference report, employers will be given an enormous \namount of flexibility and options--employers that already provide \nretiree benefits beyond Medicare coverage. This legislation will help \nmake it more affordable for these employers to continue providing these \nbenefits. We do that by a direct subsidy worth 28 percent of their drug \nspending between deductibles and the coverage gap.\n  I should add, too, this conference report makes this 28 percent \ncompletely excludable from taxation, so that instead of doing 65 \npercent good because of a 35 percent tax bracket that corporations are \nin, it does 100 percent good, bringing down the number of people who \nmight lose coverage.\n  Now, some people would say, what is this corporate welfare all \nabout--Congress giving money to corporations to do something they have \nbeen doing forever. Some people might say, well, when you buy a \nChevrolet, you pay for these retirement plans. How many times do you \nhave to pay for them? You pay for them when you buy a car and when you \npay a 28 percent subsidy. We are cautious about the fact that some do \nthat.\n  So I tell my colleagues over there--each of them who are complaining \nabout this--this 28 percent subsidy is something you ought to be glad \nto have. Sometimes when we give corporations something, you condemn us \nfor giving corporations something; but you cry when we do it and you \ncry when we don't do it because they might dump their retirees. In the \nfinal analysis, we are also doing it to protect the\n\n[[Page S15582]]\n\ntaxpayers and the Medicare Program because it is better to encourage \nthese employers to keep their retirees in these plans at a 28 percent \nsubsidy, which is about $750 per person, instead of having those \ncorporations dump those plans on the Medicare Program, and it is going \nto cost about $1,250. So that is why we do that.\n\n  Now, besides this 28 percent help, we also say that employers can use \nthe flexibility this legislation provides to structure plans that \ncomplement Medicare's new drug benefits and provide them even enhanced \nbenefits for their retirees. They can even do better than they are \npresently doing because of this flexibility we have in the legislation.\n  These new choices and options will do much more to help and, \nconsequently, not threaten employer-sponsored health care coverage for \nthose who currently receive it.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that the so-\ncalled drop rate--in other words, the rate by which corporations will \ndrop their retirees--is now 17 percent because of the changes that were \nmade in conference. In other words, we listened to our colleagues over \nthere complain about a 37 percent potential drop rate because of the \nway S. 1 was written. But it goes to conference and it comes back from \nconference with, instead of 37 percent, 17 percent, and you folks are \nstill complaining. I don't understand it. And these 2.7 million \nretirees will still be better off with Medicare coverage, likely paid \nfor by their former employees. In other words, the 2.7 million people \nwho would have been dropped, according to CBO, because of what we did \nin the conference--that is better than either bill when first passed in \nJune; 2.7 million people are still going to be in their corporate \nretiree plan.\n  So I say to my colleagues--I hope you hear this--we have come a long \nway since June, when 76 people, in a bipartisan way, voted for this. \nHalf of you over there voted for it. I believe company plans have a lot \nto be happy about under this conference agreement.\n  All seniors deserve health care benefits. All seniors deserve access \nto prescription drug programs. This compromise between the House and \nSenate provides that, and it makes certain that good sources of \nexisting coverage remain intact. I urge my colleagues to embrace the \nstrong employer provisions we have agreed to and vote for this \nconference report.\n  We have also heard from a lot of them over there that somehow we are \ntrying to privatize Medicare. How many times do I have to say it? This \nprogram is voluntary. Nobody has to go into anything in this bill if \nthey don't want to. If they want to keep traditional Medicare, keep it. \nBut this issue has been brought up. Do you know why? Because these \nfolks over there, my colleagues over there--every one of them--like to \nscare seniors. You know, it is called Medicare, but you like to make \nMedicare into ``medi-scare.''\n  You know, it is easy to scare seniors. I have my town meetings around \nIowa. I hold town meetings in each of the 99 counties every year so I \ncan keep in touch with my constituents. There are people--the older, \nthe more so--but seniors come up to me and they actually believe what \nis said on that side of the aisle when people say somebody is going to \ntake their Medicare away from them. They believe that ``medi-scare.''\n  They are really nervous. Some of them even have tears in their eyes. \nI tell them, if you just knew as seniors how you have a hook on \nCongress, that Congress is scared to death of you, you would be \nlaughing at me instead of being scared of something we might do. That \nis how the concerns of the seniors of America are taken into \nconsideration by people in the Congress of the United States.\n  Maybe we ought to have a little more of an independent view than be \nso concerned about the electoral power of the seniors, but they have \ntremendous influence on Congress. Maybe some people say too much \ninfluence. Regardless, it is wrong for people over here to ``medi-\nscare'' our seniors.\n  I wish to address this issue of privatization, but the easiest answer \nis that if you are satisfied with what you have--traditional Medicare--\ndon't worry. Also, if you like other provisions in this bill, they are \nvoluntary. You don't have to do them.\n  This bill before us today brings Medicare into the 21st century \npractice of medicine. It does not privatize traditional fee-for-service \nMedicare. Overall, this conference agreement relies on the best of the \nprivate sector to deliver drug coverage, supported by the best of the \npublic sector to secure consumer protections and important patients' \nrights. This combination of public and private resources is what \nstabilizes the benefits and helps keep costs down.\n  Seniors will be able to purchase prescription drug coverage on a \nvoluntary basis as part of Medicare's traditional fee-for-service \nprogram or be part of a new Medicare-approved private plan where the \ndrug benefit is integrated into broader medical coverage. These \nMedicare-approved plans have the advantage of offering the same \nbenefits of traditional Medicare, including prescription drugs, but on \nan integrated, coordinated basis. This creates new opportunities for \nchronic disease management and access to innovative new therapies.\n  Let me comment on chronic disease management. That is very important \nif we are going to keep costs down in the future. We won't have to \nsqueeze seniors at all. In fact, seniors will have a better quality of \nlife under chronic disease management because 5 percent of the seniors \nare responsible for 50 percent of the cost of Medicare. The reason for \nthat is that we only pay doctors to make people well after they get \nsick. We never pay enough to keep them well in the first place.\n  We can concentrate on this 5 percent in chronic disease management, \nand by so doing, we are going to provide a better quality of life \nbecause they will not be in and out of the hospital as much, and we \nsave money there. But also their quality of life is going to be better, \nand it protects the taxpayers in the process and preserves the \nlongevity of Medicare.\n  Unlike Medicare+Choice, we set up a regional system where plans will \nbid in a way that doesn't allow them to choose the most profitable \ncities and towns. Cherry-picking cannot take place. Systems like this \nwork well for Federal employees, such as the postmaster in New \nHartford, IA, my hometown. He has a choice of several plans. We want to \ngive that same choice to his parents who today only have traditional \nMedicare. They have no right to choose.\n  We provide an alternative plan for people who want to try something \nnew, something that is probably close to what baby boomers have for \nhealth plans where they work. We have set up preferred-provider \norganizations. Are they right for everyone? We give seniors the right \nto choose. Our bill sets up a playing field for preferred-provider \norganizations to compete for beneficiaries. We believe preferred-\nprovider organizations can be competitive and offer a stronger, more \nenhanced benefit than traditional Medicare, assuming seniors want to \nchoose that. They have that choice.\n\n  Let me be clear, no senior has to go into a preferred-provider \norganization. My policy has always been to let seniors keep what they \nhave if they like it with no changes. All seniors, regardless of \nwhether they choose a PPO or not, can still choose prescription drug \ncoverage if they want to, to go along with their traditional Medicare, \nbut it is their right to choose.\n  I can't mention preferred-provider organizations without correcting \nthe record regarding the preferred-provider organization stabilization \nfund that the other side has called a slush fund. It is no slush fund. \nIt is something that those of us who live in rural America know we have \nto have. We learned a lesson from Medicare+Choice because in 1997, I \nworked hard to bring greater reimbursement to rural America through \nMedicare+Choice so that people in Iowa would have the same options that \n40 percent of the people in Miami have chosen: to go into an HMO. It is \na voluntary choice. If they don't like it, they can get out tomorrow. \nGet in today; get out tomorrow. In rural America, we enhanced greatly \nthe reimbursement for them, but they have not come because of cherry-\npicking.\n  We want the preferred provider organizations to serve all of America, \nrural as well as urban. The stabilization fund is so those of us in \nrural America have an opportunity to get the same benefits as people in \nNew York City or Los Angeles or Miami.\n\n[[Page S15583]]\n\n  The bipartisan agreement on a final Medicare bill establishes this \nstabilization fund. It was not in the Senate bill. Some people say the \nKyl provisions were similar to that, but Senator Kyl will tell you he \nhad a whole different idea in mind. His idea is not even in this bill, \nbut we did take a stabilization fund to accomplish something he wants \nto accomplish. He wants his entire State of Arizona to be served by \nPPOs, not just Phoenix. We did this in an effort to expand access to \nprivate health plans in all areas of the country and, additionally, to \nmaintain existing health care choices in areas where health plans face \nparticularly difficult challenges.\n  My colleagues on the other side who find fault with this conference \nreport are always talking about this slush fund as benefiting some \norganization's profit motive.\n  Every one of them has rural areas. My colleagues ought to want the \npeople in the rural parts of their State to be served the same way as \npeople in the urban parts of the State.\n  The reality is that this is not a slush fund, but it is to help \nbeneficiaries have equal services, whether they live in rural America \nor urban America, and that will be helped by this stabilization fund. \nIt is targeted and its plans are held accountable. Resources will be \ndistributed from the stabilization fund only when specific conditions \nare met. Moreover, in instances where these conditions are met, then \nhealth plans will be accountable for using these funds only to promote \naffordable health coverage to beneficiaries, not for profit. Under no \ncircumstances will plans then be permitted to use these funds to pad \ntheir bottom line.\n  It expands choices and ensures access in rural areas. The fund is \ndesigned to expand and preserve beneficiary choices and benefits in \nareas where it is most difficult to provide private health plans and to \nget them to participate in this program.\n  The stabilization fund will ensure that millions of additional \nbeneficiaries, including many in rural areas, will have access to \nhealth plans offering high quality, comprehensive benefits, and low \nout-of-pocket costs. If the stabilization fund is not successful, the \nworst case scenario is that the funds will be returned to the U.S. \nTreasury.\n  Now I will speak about the accurate explanation of how this bill \nhelps low-income seniors. We did something in the conference report \nthat the House did so the Senate receded to the House on this point, \nand that is where we in the Senate decided to leave dual eligibles who \nwere covered by Medicaid. That is the way it passed the Senate. The \nHouse wanted to have one program for seniors, a totally Federal \nprogram, so dual eligibles in the House bill were taken away from \nMedicaid and put in Medicare. We accepted what the House wanted to do, \nas a matter of equality I suppose. We had other motivations for doing \nit in the Senate.\n  In fact, most of the support for doing that--that was one of the \nshortcomings that Democrats said about the Senate bill in June. Now we \nare hearing complaints from them about aspects of this dual eligible, \nhow it impacts seniors, particularly on asset tests. That is one of the \nreasons we tried to avoid putting dual eligibles under Medicare in the \nSenate bill, because we wanted asset tests to be the same for this \ngroup. Now they are complaining, I think inaccurately, which I will \nprove in a minute, about it negatively impacting people with less \ncoverage than they presently have.\n  We have heard from the other side how 6 million low-income eligible \nseniors will be worse off under this conference report. That is \ninaccurate. It is a lot of talk, and I want to tell the American public \nthe truth about this issue. Beneficiaries are not hurt by this bill. \nThey are helped. This bill provides generous predictable coverage to \n6.4 million dual eligibles, but it does not stop there. It provides \ncoverage to an additional 7.7 million low-income seniors. Madam \nPresident, 14.1 million seniors are eligible for low-income subsidy, \nnearly 36 percent of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  So who are these dual eligibles? They are the 6.4 million who are \nenrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid.\n  This conference report for the first time provides drugs to dual \neligibles through Medicare rather than Medicaid. This is a great help \nfor the States that have budget problems, and Medicaid is a growing, \nbiggest part of State budgets.\n\n  As I said, the Senate bill left dual eligibles in Medicaid. That \npolicy allowed the Senate to provide generous coverage for low-income \nseniors. S. 1 focused on providing drug coverage to seniors who did not \nhave any coverage whatsoever, and duals did have that coverage. So in \nthe spirit of compromise, the Senate conferees changed the policy in \nthe Senate bill.\n  The conference report provides prescription drugs for dual eligibles \nthrough Medicare. It is not exactly the same, but in general policy it \nis the same way they were treated in the House bill. Providing drugs \nfor dual eligibles through Medicare was a cornerstone issue for House \nconferees.\n  The conference report covers duals in the Medicare Program. The \ncoverage is designed to benefit as many low-income seniors, including \nduly eligibles, as possible, given the budget constraints of $400 \nbillion in our budget.\n  This bill comes out at about $395 billion. Blanket statements about \nthe reduction of benefits for the dual eligibles in the conference \nreport are not accurate. We have heard some of those inaccurate \nstatements this Saturday as we have debated this bill. This bill is \ngenerous and does not leave 6.4 million seniors worse off. I will bet \ntomorrow those over on the other side will be putting those signs up \nagain that say that. Well, don't do it.\n  For instance, unlike the Senate bill or the current Medicaid Program, \nthe conference agreement does not have cost sharing above the \ncatastrophic limits for the dual eligibles. That is right. There is no \ncost sharing. I hope my colleagues on the other side get that.\n  I will put this in perspective, then, from the State level. According \nto the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \ncurrently charges $2 for every prescription filled by dual eligibles. \nThere is no catastrophic limit for duals in that Medicaid Program in \nthat State, just a requirement for beneficiaries to pay $2 for every \nsingle prescription.\n  Like many Medicaid Programs, this bill establishes copayments for a \nmajority of the dual eligibles who are either equal to or less than \nthose required by most State Medicaid Programs. So let's get that \nstraight. These copayments are no more than, and in some cases less \nthan, those required in most State Medicaid Programs.\n  More specifically, today 25 States have copayment levels for generic \nand brand-name drugs set at $1 or higher for dual eligibles enrolled in \ntheir Medicaid Programs. In this conference agreement, dual eligibles \nwith incomes below 100 percent of poverty will be responsible only for \na copayment between $1 and $3 for their Medicare drug benefit. Taking a \nstep back, it seems to me that this level of cost sharing is very \nsimilar to what the duals pay for in Medicaid coverage.\n  In fact, in South Dakota, duals pay $2 per prescription. That policy \nis on par with the coverage offered through this bill. This conference \nreport contains a generous drug benefit, then, for dual eligibles. \nThere is no donut, or no loss of coverage, no gap in coverage, for low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries. But my colleagues on the other side \nwould lead us to believe otherwise.\n  The bill guarantees all 6 million dual eligibles access to \nprescription drugs. Under the conference report, dual eligibles will \nhave better access through Medicare than they do today, specially since \nState Medicaid Programs are increasingly imposing restrictions on \npatients' access to drugs because of budget problems that 45 of our 50 \nStates have.\n  Further, States have the flexibility to provide coverage for classes \nof drugs, including over-the-counter medicines that might not even be \ncovered by the Medicare Program.\n  This bill ensures appeal rights for dual eligibles. Under the \nagreement, duals will maintain appeal rights, such as those that they \npresently have in the Medicaid Program. The dual eligibles are a \nfragile population and are well taken care of in this bill. The \nconference report recognizes and provides generous coverage to these 6 \nmillion beneficiaries and in fact goes further by providing full drug \ncoverage to 7.7 million more low-income seniors.\n  So I turn now to highlighting what this bill does to protect Medicare \nin\n\n[[Page S15584]]\n\nthe long run. I have heard some Members trying to assert that this $400 \nbillion expansion of one of the most successful social programs in our \ncountry's history is going to destroy traditional Medicare; you have \nsaid it, ``Medicare as we know it.'' That is another one of your \n``medi-scare'' tactics.\n  I know Members are tired. I know we are nearing the closing of our \nfirst session of the 108th Congress. Many Members are using these \nwornout lines because they would rather not take a serious look at the \nbipartisan Medicare agreement we put together and really assess whether \nor not those scare tactics are true. I am here to tell all my \ncolleagues and the people of this country that the allegations that \nthis Medicare bill destroys traditional Medicare are falsehoods.\n  This Medicare bill strengthens and improves traditional Medicare in a \nnumber of ways. We are not talking about just Medicare as it has been \nfor the last 38 years. We are talking about some improvements we made \nin traditional Medicare that seniors will have the choice, the right to \nchoose to stay in if they want to. I will discuss just three.\n  First, we add new preventive program benefits. For the first time \never, every new Medicare enrollee will receive a ``Welcome To \nMedicare'' physical; they go to the doctor when they go into Medicare, \nget a benchmark physical. Hopefully, nothing is wrong. But if something \nis wrong, we know about it right away and it is part of our effort to \nsee that we zero in on keeping people well, as opposed to waiting until \nthey get sick and it costs a heck of a lot more. It is part of our \nprogram, of a quality of life for our seniors. It is part of our \nprogram of zeroing in on the 5 percent of the people who, because of \nnot having chronic care management, are costing us 50 percent of the \ntotal costs.\n  Seniors are going to have physicals that will help them--maybe their \nlifestyle, like getting their weight checked, but more seriously, the \nheart; receive cancer, diabetes, and bone mass screenings. It is very \nimportant to have an initial physical because, as we say in Iowa, an \nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n  Consider these statistics. In 2000, 6.2 percent of the U.S. \npopulation had diabetes. Heart disease and stroke are the first and \nthird leading causes of death in the United States. In 2003, 1.1 \nmillion Americans will have a heart attack. Diabetes, heart disease, \nand other chronic conditions exact an awful toll on our seniors. By \ngetting an initial physical, seniors can get valuable information on \ntheir health status. They can enroll in weight loss programs, start a \nblood pressure medicine, or know whom to call if something goes wrong.\n  We have also eliminated the deductibles and the copays on screening \ntests for heart disease and diabetes, so beneficiaries do not incur any \ncosts. There is an extent to which that cost today may inhibit them or \ndivert them from having needed tests, so this is an additional \nincentive, particularly for those with limited resources who might not \notherwise access these benefits. Adding preventive benefits is just one \nway we have improved traditional Medicare.\n  A second way we have improved the fee-for-service program is by \nproviding access to disease management. It is a common option available \nto younger people in health insurance. If you have a chronic health \ncondition such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, you can get extra \nhelp managing your condition. You may be taking a lot of medications \nand seeing several doctors. Disease management programs help patients \ntake responsibility for their health care and better control of their \nlives, but they also involve health professionals in that process, to \naid you.\n  When this Medicare bill becomes law, seniors with access will have \naccess to these services. It will be a voluntary program and one that \nwill improve the quality of life for millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Another improvement is this bill provides an additional $25 billion \nfor rural health care providers. That is new money to strengthen our \nNation's hospitals, physicians, ambulance riders, and dialysis clinics, \njust to name a few. This is the biggest funding boost Congress has ever \npassed for our rural health care system. This is going to help fee-for-\nservice, traditional Medicare because in some places in this country \nthere is not an adequate number of health care providers. Providers in \nrural States such as mine, Iowa, practice some of the lowest cost \nmedicine in the country. Yet health care providers in rural areas lose \nmoney on every Medicare patient they see. This Medicare bill takes \nhistoric steps toward correcting geographic disparities that penalize \nrural health care providers.\n  So when I hear people in Washington say this bill is going to destroy \ntraditional Medicare, I suggest that each of them take a closer look at \nthis legislation. Providing new preventive benefits, allowing seniors \nto access state-of-the-art disease management programs, and mending the \nrural health care safety net will help millions of seniors with these \nthree important ways we are strengthening Medicare.\n  I would like to turn now to a subject that is important to me, to the \ntaxpayers, and to the seniors, and that is the issue of curbing waste, \nfraud, and abuse. You just read in your news releases from HHS, $11.5 \nbillion of waste, fraud, and abuse within health care. If we can save \nthat money, we are going to make Medicare strong for a long time in the \nfuture.\n  When it comes to reimbursements for many of the items and services \nthat Medicare covers, the price, historically speaking, has not been \nright. That goes, for instance, for doctors and hospitals in rural \nareas who are paid too little, and some drugmakers and equipment \nsuppliers, to name a few, who are paid too much.\n  This conference agreement makes great strides toward correcting both \nthe underpayment and the overpayment that plague the Medicare Program. \nI have already talked about the underpayments to rural States such as \nIowa and how this bill corrects that through the $25 billion of new \nmoney we are injecting into making Medicare reimbursements equitable.\n  But I want to talk now about just the opposite. There are \noverpayments in Medicare. Overpayments eat away at Medicare's reserves, \neating away at its solvency slowly, like a cancer. Overpayments are bad \nfor taxpayers, they are bad for beneficiaries, both of whom deserve to \npay a fair price. In certain areas of Medicare, in many payment systems \nthere are few fair prices.\n  Fee schedules pay too much, providers play games with complex rules \nand regulations, and beneficiaries pay a higher copay as a result. The \nsad fact is that Medicare's price is often far higher than the \nmarketplace price. This conference agreement begins to change that in \nsignificant ways.\n  My colleagues should read title III of the conference report, and \nthat is entitled, ``Combating Waste, Fraud, and Abuse.''\n  Our bipartisan initiative in this bill will end overpayments, reduce \nfraud, and cut down on opportunities for abuse to the tune of $31.3 \nbillion as scored by the Congressional Budget Office. That is \nsignificant.\n  These measures in this bill directly reduce Medicare's spending on \noverpriced, wasteful, fraudulent items, and services to the tune of \n$31.3 billion over 10 years.\n  Throughout my time in Congress, I have worked hard to combat fraud \nand waste in Federal programs. In 1986, I successfully passed False \nClaims Act improvements that give whistleblowers new rights and \nprotections under Federal law. In just the last year alone, civil fraud \nrecoveries have tallied a record $2.1 billion, the Justice Department \nannounced just last week. This is a 75-percent increase over the prior \nyears' recoveries of $1.1 billion, and brings total recoveries to over \n$12 billion since I got that bill passed. Of the $2.1 billion, $1.4 \nbillion is associated with suits initiated by whistleblowers.\n  While the False Claims Act is one of our best weapons in the war on \nfraud and abuse, our policies in this new language of the title III \nconference agreement adds still more weapons to our arsenal.\n  First, we make important technical clarifications to existing law \nthat strengthen and improve what is known as the secondary payer \nstatute. The purpose of the statute is to ensure that Medicare pays \nfirst for seniors' medical needs when other sources should be, in fact, \npaying instead of the taxpayer paying.\n\n[[Page S15585]]\n\n  These other sources include, for instance, employer coverage. In \naddition, when a Medicare beneficiary is injured by wrongful conduct of \nanother entity, that entity's liability insurance or the entity itself, \nif it has no insurance, or it might be self-insured, is always required \nto pay first instead of having the taxpayers pay. The provisions in \ntitle III do not change existing law in this area but, in fact, clarify \nthe intent of Congress in protecting Medicare's resources.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, these clarifications \nalone promise to restore Medicare over $9 billion out of that $31 \nbillion.\n  Second, we change the way Medicare pays for durable medical \nequipment, first by slowing the spending growth in these areas for 3 \nyears, and then by instituting a competitive mechanism that will \ndeliver a fair market price for seniors.\n  While I have concerns about the impact of such a new system on very \nmany small businesses across America, the supply of high-quality \nequipment especially in rural areas, I am confident that good \nprotections are in this conference agreement for small business and for \nour seniors as well.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these changes will \nsave Medicare $6.8 billion out of that $31 billion.\n  Next, title III institutes what we call market pricing mechanisms for \ndrugs administered in the doctors' offices that both the Office of \nInspector General and the GAO have concluded are priced far higher than \ntheir actual costs.\n\n  In addition to the financial toll these overpayments take on the \ntaxpayers, they also affect Medicare's beneficiaries who are often \nrequired to pay dramatically higher copayments for the drugs they rely \non. In some instances, these copayments can even exceed the actual \nprices the doctors paid for the drug.\n  In recommendations to Congress, the GAO urged Medicare to take steps \nto begin paying doctors for Part B-covered drugs and related services \nat levels that reflect the doctor's actual acquisition costs--not some \ninflated cost. And they use information about actual market \ntransactions prices to bring that about.\n  I am pleased that our conference agreement accomplishes this first by \nreducing the so-called average wholesale price by 10 percentage points, \nand then instituting a new payment system based on manufacturers' \nreported average sale price--or ASP reporting--which will be closely \nscrutinized by the inspector general on an ongoing basis ensuring its \naccuracy.\n  Errors or abuse of the system will be corrected swiftly so that \nMedicare will never again pay an unfair price.\n  These changes result in Medicare savings of approximately $11 billion \nout of that $31 billion total.\n  Finally, title III takes similar steps to correct overpayments for \nrespiratory medicine which the Office of Inspector General has said are \npriced far in excess of their actual costs. These drugs will be reduced \nby 10 percentage points in 2004, and then priced on a similar average \nsale price system, as others I just mentioned, and that will begin in \nthe year 2005.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that this policy alone will save \nMedicare $4.2 billion of that $31 billion total.\n  I have listed three or four examples of how you save that $31 \nbillion.\n  I believe all of these changes have been carried out in a \ncompassionate fashion with twin goals of protecting both the Medicare \nProgram's resources and our senior citizens' access to those services. \nWe have done both.\n  Our market-based improvement Part B drug payments are accompanied by \nsweeping changes in payments for clinical services associated with \ndelivering them.\n  We worked closely with oncologists to ensure that access to cancer \ncare was not harmed.\n  Similarly, we went to great lengths to ensure that seniors who rely \non medical equipment supplies will be able to rely on them as they do \ntoday.\n  Finally, to my colleagues who talk about cost containment and the \nneed for Medicare to curtail its spending, I say this: It starts right \nhere. Cost containment begins by ensuring that the costs to Medicare \nand to the taxpayers who finance it are, in fact, fair.\n  The conference agreement starts us down the road. The sum total of \n$31.3 billion of savings, and the market prices we are imposing on \nfuture spending in this area, are in my view, the most significant cost \ncontainment policies in this conference agreement.\n  In the months and years ahead as Medicare spending increases with the \nexpansion of benefits that we are going to pass here shortly, our focus \non cost containment will obviously increase. The best thing that \nCongress can do is to be vigilant. We all need to watch Medicare's \noutlays closely, and to listen to whistleblowers who are patriotic \ncitizens telling us when there is fraud and crying for government to do \nsomething about it.\n  We also need to pay attention to other private individuals who have \ninside information on wrong doing. We need to heed the warnings of the \nOffice of Inspector General, and, most of all, insist that Medicare \nnever pay more than market price. Taxpayers, on the one hand, and the \nseniors' Medicare services, on the other hand, deserve nothing less.\n  I want to conclude by talking about the views of very many \norganizations that support the conference report.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to quote from some.\n  As you know, I have a chart up here talking about the AARP. All of \nyou colleagues on that side of the aisle have been saying to me all day \nhow dastardly it is that the AARP is backing this legislation. Some \nMembers have even spoken of them becoming a political organization. \nThey cannot become a political organization or they will lose their \ntax-exempt status. But you accuse them of being a tax-exempt \norganization.\n\n  It is funny, last year when they did not come out for the bipartisan \nbill that several Members brought out, that the Democrat majority did \nnot want to let pass because they wanted an issue in the last election \ninstead of a product, the AARP was not backing what I, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Breaux, and Senator Hatch wanted to do. Ours \nwas a bipartisan effort, or a tripartisan effort, with Senator Jeffords \nbeing an Independent, to get a bill through because you cannot get \nthrough anything in this body if it is not bipartisan. The AARP did not \nlike what we were doing. They did not discourage us but they did not \nhelp us. They actually sent letters out to support what Senator Kennedy \nwas trying to do a year ago.\n  I did not accuse the AARP of being a tool of the Democrat Party like \nMembers on the other side are accusing the AARP of being in bed with \nthe Republicans. They are not in bed with the Republicans. They are in \nbed with a bipartisan group of this body who want to do something for \nseniors of America. It is funny how the AARP is OK when they are \nhelping Senator Kennedy but they are not OK if they are helping a \nbipartisan group led by Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus.\n  I would say they are discretionary in what they do. They may not be \nconsistent, but thank God they are not consistent because they would \nnot be representing the diverse group they represent.\n  Here is what the AARP says in their endorsement:\n\n       AARP believes that millions of older Americans and their \n     families will be helped by this legislation.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       This bill provides prescription drug coverage at little \n     cost to those who need it most: People with low-incomes, \n     including those who depend on Social Security for all or most \n     of their income. It will provide substantial relief for those \n     with very high drug costs and will provide modest relief for \n     millions more.\n\n  The last sentences I will read:\n\n       An unprecedented $88 billion will encourage employers to \n     maintain existing health retiree benefits. The legislation \n     will help speed generic drugs to market and add important new \n     preventive and chronic care management services. This \n     legislation protects poor seniors from future soaring \n     prescription drug costs.\n\n  All the Members complaining about the AARP, put that in your pipe and \nsmoke it.\n  Then we have the National Council on the Aging:\n\n       . . . we find it too difficult to again say to millions of \n     vulnerable seniors in need: Sorry, come back in a few years \n     and maybe there will be some help for you then.\n\n  Another sentence:\n\n\n[[Page S15586]]\n\n\n       We urge Congress to pass the Medicare bill so that millions \n     of seniors with greater needs will receive long-awaited and \n     badly-needed prescription drug coverage.\n\n  Are Members trying to tell me the National Council on the Aging does \nnot know what is good for seniors when they see it? Put that in your \npipe and smoke it.\n  The Alzheimer's Association says:\n\n       This is a historic accomplishment that may potentially \n     provide meaningful relief to the 4.5 million Americans \n     dealing with Alzheimer's disease--many of whom also suffer \n     other health issues.\n\n  That is from Sheldon Goldberg, president and CEO of the Chicago-based \nnational organization for the Alzheimer's Association.\n  Are Members telling me the Alzheimer's Association cannot make a \njudgment if this bill is good for their members?

Put that in your \npipe and smoke it.\n  We have a statement by Advancing Health in America, AHA, saying:\n\n       It provides prescription drug benefits to the elderly and \n     provides needed Federal relief to hospitals, particularly \n     rural hospitals.\n       The legislation includes important provisions that help \n     patients by providing hospitals the resources necessary to \n     continue caring for America's seniors.\n\n  Tell me an organization called Advancing Health in America does not \nknow what is good for their Members.\n  From the American Medical Association:\n\n       Congress listens to America's patients and physicians who \n     serve it.\n       The status quo is unacceptable to patients and their \n     physicians. The Medicare conference agreement includes \n     numerous provisions that will improve seniors' access to \n     medical services.\n\n  Tell me the American Medical Association does not know what is good \nfor their members or what is good for their members' patients.\n  The Arthritis Foundation says:\n\n       The Arthritis Foundation supports a Medicare Prescription \n     Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act for 2003 that for \n     the first time would provide coverage for prescription drugs \n     and biologicals for persons with arthritis.\n\n  Can Members tell me the Arthritis Foundation does not know what is \ngood for their members, know a good piece of legislation when they see \nit?\n  We have the American Pharmacists Association:\n\n       . . . APhA supports this as an important, long-overdue step \n     toward providing Medicare beneficiaries greater access to \n     medications and critical pharmacist services.\n       The proposal creates a comprehensive benefit that provides \n     coverage for drug products and pharmacist services, and \n     provides seniors their choice of pharmacists and ensures any \n     willing pharmacist can participate in a plan and incorporates \n     important administrative efficiencies.\n\n  Those Members who oppose this bill, are you trying to tell the people \nof America that the American Pharmacists Association does not know a \ngood piece of legislation when they see it and that they cannot speak \nfor not only their membership but also their patients and clients they \nserve?\n\n  From the College of American Pathologists:\n\n       This legislation will improve Medicare coverage for seniors \n     and protect access to the physicians and services upon which \n     they rely for quality of care.\n       The conference agreement also preserves critical health \n     care services provided by independent laboratories in to \n     hospital patients, especially in smaller and rural \n     communities.\n\n  Are Members telling me, as they criticize this legislation, that the \nCollege of American Pathologists would support legislation that is not \ngood for their patients and the people they serve?\n  The Federation of American Hospitals:\n\n       This agreement does more to improve Medicare coverage for \n     seniors than any legislation since its program inception.\n\n  That is 38 years.\n\n       The Federation of American Hospitals commends President \n     Bush, the Congressional leadership, and members of the \n     Medicare Conference Committee for their great efforts in \n     bringing these vital improvements to the Medicare to \n     fruition.\n       H.R. 1 would greatly enhance the ability of hospitals to \n     provide necessary care medical care to Medicare \n     beneficiaries. It would make important strides in ensuring \n     that all hospitals have sufficient funding to meet the \n     medical needs of this nation's seniors and would particularly \n     aids though hospitals that serve seniors in rural areas.\n\n  Every Member has rural areas in their State. And we have a major \nhospital association supporting this legislation because it is \nparticularly going to serve seniors in rural America.\n\n  Now, tell me that they do not know a good bill when they see it.\n  Here is something that answers complaints that were heard late this \nmorning or early this afternoon. One of the first speakers on the other \nside of the aisle, the Senator from Illinois, was complaining about \nthis not doing enough for generics. But here we have the Generic \nPharmaceutical Association:\n\n       The Generic Pharmaceutical Association today called the \n     Medicare Conference compromise on generic drugs a tremendous \n     victory for all consumers that will ensure timely access to \n     affordable pharmaceuticals. . . .\n       The House and Senate conferees have met the challenge of \n     eliminating some of the most serious barriers to generic \n     competition by closing loopholes that have unnecessarily \n     delayed the timely introduction of affordable \n     pharmaceuticals--and American consumers, young and old alike, \n     will be the winners.\n\n  Now, how many of you speaking today have complained about this \nlegislation not doing anything about the cost of drugs? And we know \nthat putting generics on the market sooner is one of the ways to bring \ndown tremendous drug costs.\n  Now, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association supports this \nlegislation, and yet you do not recognize that they understand a good \npiece of legislation when they see it.\n  We have the United Seniors Association:\n\n       We commend the Senate and House Conferees on their historic \n     step to benefit every senior in America. Partisan politics \n     and rhetoric-without-results on prescription drugs are simply \n     unacceptable. Years of hard work by many in Congress and \n     years of heartache for America's seniors have led us to this \n     point. The whole senior world is watching and Congress must \n     not collapse so near the finish line.\n\n  Are you trying to tell me that the United Seniors Association looks \nat this legislation and sees it is good for their members, and yet you \ncannot see that?\n  We have The 60 Plus Association:\n\n       The bill makes available much needed assistance to millions \n     of seniors who lack any prescription drug coverage. \n     Significantly, those who can least afford to pay will get the \n     most help [from this legislation].\n\n  From the Rural Hospital Coalition:\n\n       We support your efforts to modernize Medicare and give \n     senior citizens a prescription drug benefit that they \n     deserve. . . . [T]his bill strengthens health care in rural \n     America.\n\n  From the National Rural Health Association:\n\n       This bill is a big boost for the rural healthcare system. . \n     . . A stronger healthcare system will help revitalize rural \n     economies which will positively impact rural Americans \n     throughout the country.\n\n  We have the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization:\n\n       NHPCO strongly supports these provisions and believes these \n     changes will improve the quality and timeliness of hospice \n     and palliative care for seniors and their families.\n\n  From the Mayo Clinic, 150 miles from my home in Iowa:\n\n       Mayo Clinic supports the compromise Medicare \nreform legislation that has emerged from a congressional conference \ncommittee.\n\n  We have NAMI, The Nation's Voice on Mental Illness:\n\n       This conference agreement does represent an improvement for \n     Medicare beneficiaries living with mental illness. . . . NAMI \n     feels strongly that it is time for Congress to end partisan \n     stalemate over this issue and take advantage of the $400 \n     billion available this year to spend on a new drug benefit.\n\n  This is kind of a partisan statement I am going to read to you, but \nit does represent a group of people who are impacted by what we do here \nwith dual\n\n[[Page S15587]]\n\neligibles. It is from the Republican Governors Association:\n\n       Medicare will provide first-time access to prescription \n     drug coverage to many of our seniors. The agreement also \n     assists states with the costs related to the dual eligible \n     population. Assistance to low income persons as well as \n     critical protection against high out-of-pocket drug costs are \n     essential components of this legislation. . . . [T]he \n     preventive benefits found in this measure will keep our \n     constituents healthier.\n\n  From the Alliance For Aging Research:\n\n       With this act the millions of Medicare beneficiaries will \n     no longer have to wait from 15 months to 5 years for access \n     to new state-of-the-art medicines and life-saving and life-\n     enhancing technologies. In addition, and most importantly, it \n     targets those with the greatest need by providing significant \n     low-income subsidies for prescription drugs that will assist \n     millions of Medicare beneficiaries living longer and \n     healthier lives. . . . This will be a giant step toward \n     expanding and modernizing Medicare, while preserving the \n     power of science and technology to improve and enhance the \n     lives of our people in the future.\n\n  Lastly, we have the American Benefits Council, a news release. The \nheadline: ``Medicare, prescription drug reform bill represents \nhistoric, positive achievement.''\n\n       We urge swift enactment of the legislation. . . .\n\n  I have quoted these statements from these outstanding organizations \nfor the Record because they speak louder than any Member of this Senate \ncan about what is good about this legislation.\n  I would hope that you folks on the other side of the aisle would take \nthese statements into consideration, particularly tomorrow, when I am \ntold 15 of you are going to speak, probably most of you against this \nlegislation. I would appreciate you taking into consideration what \nthese major groups have said.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I realize the hour is late. This body \nhas been discussing the issue of Medicare legislation for close to 12 \nhours now on this Saturday.\n  I want to speak briefly this evening about the legislation that is \nunder consideration in the Senate and its impact on senior citizens in \nmy home State of Alaska as well as around the Nation.\n  We have heard a great deal today on the floor about the need for \nreform, about what we need to provide for our senior citizens.\n  We must keep in perspective what we owe our seniors. This is the \ngeneration of Americans who paid most dearly to protect the freedoms we \nenjoy. Many of our older Americans today went through the Depression \nand have very personal, truly gut-wrenching memories of the hunger that \nthey perhaps went through at the time. They were the generation who \nsettled the frontier areas of America, including my State of Alaska. \nThey remember the horror and the stories from Pearl Harbor. We owe this \ngeneration of Americans many things, not the least of which is honesty.\n  Since Medicare was enacted in 1965, it has provided health security \nto millions of America's seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare \nis that promise of health security we must always keep.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like \nAmericans to believe that the bill in front of us today is designed to \nkill those promises made in 1965. I remind my colleagues that Americans \ndeserve more than the rhetoric and the scare tactics we have heard \nsaturating the airwaves from here. Earlier this evening in listening to \nthe debate, one of my colleagues made reference to the fact that \nseniors are going to have to sell their wedding rings in order to meet \ncertain levels for low-income subsidies for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I thought, wait a minute, that can't be true. That is not a part of \nthis legislation. Seniors will not have to do that. So I said: Show me. \nLet me know for sure that, in fact, this is not the case.\n  We pulled it out and looked at the application of the asset test. It \nvery clearly states those resources that are not counted for an asset \ntest, excluded resources, include, and No. 3 on the list is memorabilia \nsuch as a wedding ring. For us to stand here on the Senate floor and \nsuggest to a senior citizen that in order to meet certain requirements \nto keep your Medicare benefits you might have to give up your wedding \nring, I sure hope my 84-year-old next-door neighbor was not hearing \nthat because I know she wouldn't sleep well knowing that that could be \ntrue.\n  We have to be real. We have to be honest with our statements, and we \nhave to talk the truth about what is and is not contained in the \nlegislation before us.\n  Americans deserve to know that this bill, while not perfect--I don't \nthink any of us would suggest it is perfect--will provide good drug \ncoverage for any senior citizen who wants to enroll. Americans deserve \nto know that this bill doesn't force seniors to join HMOs to get \nprescription drugs.\n  This legislation is designed to provide choice, not coercion. If \nseniors want to add prescription drug coverage to the Medicare plan \nthat they have right now, they would have that option. Their benefits \nwould not be reduced, would not be taken away. If they don't want the \ndrug coverage or if they are happy with the coverage they have now \nthrough their retirement plan, they don't have to accept the voluntary \nMedicare benefit.\n  The incentives for employers to keep offering their own prescription \ndrug benefits: The Employer Benefit Research Institute indicates that \nthey expect between 97 percent and 99 percent of beneficiaries won't \nhave any change in benefits. We need to clearly repeat these \nprovisions.\n  The bottom line is this: If you like Medicare the way it is today, \nyou can keep it that way because it is designed to be a voluntary \nbenefit.\n\n  The problem is for many Americans, including those in Alaska, \nMedicare has not been living up to its promises. It will only pay for \nyour drugs if you have been hospitalized. And for many, it does not pay \nfor the health care professionals. Essentially, this program is still \nstuck in the 1960s mindset of reactive care rather than the kinds of \nproactive care we expect today.\n  Several months back I had an individual up in the State who was \nmeeting with me and going out to senior centers. We were talking about \nthe Medicare legislation in front of us at that time. She made the \nanalogy that Medicare is like the telephone. In 1965, the telephones \nthat we had in our homes were the black rotary dial. They came in one \ncolor and one style, and that was it. And that was how we talked.\n  Now in the year 2003, we talk on cell phones, by fax, e-mail, on \ncolored phones. The technology has changed incredibly, but we are still \ndoing the talking.\n  Medicare is essentially the rotary dial system of health care that \njust hasn't been ramped up.\n  Americans need to know that Medicare still doesn't provide full \ncoverage for preventive care, including cancer, diabetes screenings. It \ndoesn't offer protection against catastrophic medical costs, these \nthings that can rob our seniors of their hard-earned savings. There has \nbeen a lot of rhetoric about the drug benefit. But if you cut all \nthrough it, if you do the number crunching, you get to the indisputable \nfact that the average senior citizen, after paying their premium, is \ngoing to see a savings in the cost of their drugs--we estimate about a \n63-percent savings in the cost of drugs.\n  For those seniors with limited income and limited savings, which is \nabout half of Alaska's senior citizens, half of Alaska's senior \ncitizens are in this lower income bracket, they will have closer to 90 \npercent of their drug costs covered, and this is not a skimpy benefit.\n  The bill also adds important preventive benefits that are many years \noverdue. In order to combat our Nation's No. 1 and No. 3 killers, which \nare heart disease and stroke, Medicare would be required to cover \nscreening blood tests with no cost to the senior. This bill helps the \nmillions of Americans who struggle daily with the chronic diseases such \nas asthma and diabetes. The bill adds principles of disease management \nto Medicare which will help the seniors navigate the oftentimes \nconfusing health care system and get them\n\n[[Page S15588]]\n\nthe access to vital specialty care and educational resources.\n  While we all seem to agree that it is important to add preventive \nbenefits to Medicare, there has been a lot of discussion about whether \nto allow government-regulated private plans to offer these Medicare \nbenefits. I have to step back a little and wonder if perhaps I am the \nonly one who finds it ironic that we would use taxpayer-funded \nsubsidies to give each one of us in Congress a choice of health plans, \nbut yet we would deny our senior citizens that same choice.\n  The bill before us rejects this philosophy of ``big Government knows \nbest,'' and tells our seniors: You have the right to select a benefit \nthat meets your needs. If you don't need drug coverage, you don't have \nto enroll. You can keep Medicare the way it is today. If you don't want \nto join a private plan, you don't have to. If you don't want to change \nanything about Medicare, you don't have to.\n  I also want to address a comment that a number of Members--primarily \non the other side of the aisle--have made characterizing Medicare as \ngood the way it is now. I have even heard a number claiming that the \nMedicare Program today gives seniors such things as a choice of \ndoctors. While I agree with them that Medicare is a good program, and I \nbelieve we need to make sure it still exists for our children's \nchildren, I need to let my colleagues know that the way the current \nMedicare Program does business, it hurts those in my State who have \nbeen promised care.\n  Every week, Senator Stevens, Congressman Young, those in the Alaska \ndelegation, and I come to work and we are faced with a huge stack of \nmail, e-mail, phone calls, and the like from Alaskans about the \nproblems they are having with Medicare. I mentioned earlier that this \nsummer, back in my State, I held a senior citizen forum in the \ncommunity of Chugiak. What I learned may actually surprise some of my \ncolleagues who seem particularly enamored with the way Medicare is \ntoday. Seniors in Alaska are not only being denied a choice of doctors, \nbut in many cases they don't have the ability to see a doctor at all. \nThis is because doctors, or health care providers, in Alaska are paid \njust about 37 cents on the dollar for the care they provide to seniors \non Medicare. Medicare is a price-fixer. So what we have is somebody in \nBaltimore sitting in a cubical, and they are deciding how much to pay \nfor medical care in the community of Delta Junction, in Alaska; or take \nthe community of Bethel, not on the road system, completely cut off \nfrom the rest of the world. If the payment the folks in Baltimore have \nsaid we are going to be charging is less than the cost of actually \nproviding the care, Medicare basically tells our doctors: Tough, you \nare out of luck. This price-fixing causes problems not only in the \nrural areas of the State--as I mentioned, in a place such as Bethel or \nDelta, where you would expect these problems--but the sad truth is that \neven seniors in the urban centers of Alaska, in Anchorage and \nFairbanks, cannot find a doctor who will accept new Medicare patients.\n  Perhaps I need to go a little further in explaining to my colleagues \nhow much of a problem this is in my State. When a senior in the lower \n48 cannot find a doctor in their community to help them, they can hop \ninto their car and drive to the next town and find a doctor--just go to \nthe city. But when seniors cannot find a doctor in Fairbanks--and the \nwhole State knows seniors in Anchorage are having the same problem--\nthere are two options for them. The first one is that there are few \nthings you can do. Second, there are bad things you can do.\n  The simple fact is that for many of my constituents, their choice for \na doctor is limited to those who are practicing in the emergency room. \nWho is the doctor on call that night? That is their choice of doctors.\n  The only other choice is--and this is probably a choice only for a \nfew--to fork over the $1,400, or whatever the price of the airplane \nticket is, to make the 8-hour roundtrip flight to Seattle and try their \nluck with doctors there.\n\n  Just 2 weeks ago, I had a constituent in my office who told me she \nflies to Virginia every year to see her doctor. She lives in Alaska. \nShe flies to Virginia to see her doctor. She does this because she \ncannot find one in Anchorage who will accept new Medicare patients. The \ncost for the ticket alone, not counting her lodging and meals while she \nis there, is about $1,500. Unfortunately, these situations in Alaska \nright now are not the exception; they are the rule.\n  We have somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 senior citizens in \nAnchorage alone who cannot find a doctor who is willing to treat them. \nThe situation in Fairbanks is not much better. We recently called up \nthe State to one of the larger clinics there that accepts Medicare \npatients. We asked them: Are you accepting new Medicare patients, and \nwhen would the first available appointment be? We were told mid-July. \nThis is not choice when it comes to your doctor.\n  How is this situation keeping the promise we made to our senior \ncitizens in 1965 when we established Medicare? What kind of treatment \nare you advocating for when you keep Medicare the way it is? We can \ncome up with grand plans here in Washington and we can talk about \nMedicare reform, but if we don't have doctors who can write the \nprescriptions, if we don't have access to physicians, we have not done \nanything to fix the problem with Medicare.\n  Keeping Medicare as we know it in Alaska means Alaskans will go to \nthe emergency room for primary care. It means making Alaskans pay to \nfly across the country by themselves to go find a doctor, and it means \nmaking Alaskans go without preventive screening.\n  Medicare as we know it doesn't give patients a choice of providers or \naccess to the care of their choice, as some of my colleagues have \nstated. Medicare isn't working perfectly and desperately needs reform. \nI believe the legislation we have in front of us is a good compromise. \nIt includes provisions that will ensure that senior citizens around the \nNation and in Alaska will be able to find a doctor somewhere other than \nin the emergency room.\n  We owe our seniors a little more honesty in this debate. They deserve \nto know clearly that the prescription drug is voluntary. They deserve \nto know they will not be forced to join a program they don't want to \njoin. They deserve to know the average senior citizen who joins will \nsave somewhere around 63 percent on the cost of their prescription \ndrugs. They deserve to know low-income seniors will pay no deductible, \nno monthly premium, and have no gap in coverage; and Medicare will pay \nabout 90 percent of their drug costs. They deserve to know the group \npurchasing power we are giving to seniors is going to make the drug \ncompanies work for their business.\n  Mr. President, those who stood defending our freedom deserve more \nthan the partisan rancor that has been sailing around this Chamber. \nThey deserve to know more than some of the half-truths that have been \ntold. Medicare, as we know it, should provide seniors with access to \nvital health care services and the physician of their choice. I believe \nthis bill does those things, and I believe it will meet the needs of my \nconstituents.\n\n  We have come a long way toward making good on our promise to our \nsenior citizens, and that is to the credit of the administration and to \nthe leadership of this Congress, certainly to the leadership of the \nSenator who is presiding this evening. We do need to strengthen \nMedicare, and seniors do need access to vital prescription drugs.\n  Many who are now on Medicare fought for the freedom that we enjoy \ntoday, and Monday we will, hopefully, have the opportunity to keep our \npromise to seniors and to fight on their behalf by providing them with \na voluntary prescription drug benefit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/22/senate-section/article/S15588-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15588-S15589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2003\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.
