At \n11:45, the Senate will vote on the Campbell nomination. Immediately \nfollowing that vote, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the nomination of Victor Wolski to be a judge of the \nU.S. Court of Federal Claims. Therefore, the first vote will occur at \n11:45 and that vote will be the first of two back-to-back votes.\n  For the remainder of the day, the Senate will resume debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 11, the Patients First Act. A cloture motion on \nthe motion to proceed to the bill was filed yesterday and that cloture \nvote will occur on Wednesday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following disposition of the Wolski \nnomination, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed to \nS. 11.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nmajority leader if there were not a vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on Wolski, would the distinguished majority leader consider \nallowing several hours this afternoon to debate Wolski? If cloture is \ninvoked, of course, we would have 30 hours. It would seem to me that \nfor the people who have been seeking this vote, we could vitiate the \ncloture vote and the leader could give us, say, 3 or 4 hours to debate \nWolski and then vote.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would certainly entertain that. I ask if \nI might have a discussion with Chairman Hatch, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, before committing to that, and I will get back \nshortly with the assistant Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to speak in morning business \non the issue that is pending before the Senate, which is the motion to \nproceed on S. 11. This is a bill relative to an important issue that \nreally we have to grapple with in this country, and that\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\nis the question of medical malpractice. It is an issue which has come \nat us in so many different ways. Unfortunately, the bill that is before \nus, S. 11, which we are now considering under a motion to proceed, \nlooks at the issue of medical malpractice from only one narrow \nperspective, and from my point of view a very ineffective perspective.\n  What the bill before us would suggest is if you or a member of your \nfamily or one of your children is a victim of medical malpractice, \nthere would be a strict limitation in this bill of how much you could \nrecover in court for what is known as noneconomic losses, pain and \nsuffering. That strict limitation would be $250,000.\n  To many people, $250,000 seems to be a very substantial sum of money, \nand it is until it is put in the perspective of the injuries we are \ndiscussing. Yesterday, in the course of the debate, I told the story of \na 6-year-old boy in my home State of Illinois who went to a downstate \nclinic with a high fever. Unfortunately, he did not receive appropriate \nmedical care and a jury decided he had been a victim of medical \nnegligence. The doctors who had treated him did not perform the type of \nmedical procedures necessary to monitor his serious condition. As a \nresult of that, this poor little boy at the age of 6 became \nquadriplegic and uncommunicative. It is now 11 years later. He is 17 \nyears old. He needs care around the clock. He cannot respond to \nstimulus that ordinary people do. He certainly cannot communicate. His \nsituation for the past 11 years is, frankly, what he will face as long \nas he is alive.\n  That is a harrowing prospect for his family and it means they are \ngoing to have to dedicate the rest of their lives, as mother and \nfather, to try to make his life on Earth as bearable as possible. So \n$250,000 in that context has to be taken from a different perspective. \nIt goes beyond his medical bills, of which he will receive \ncompensation, to the question of pain and suffering for him and \ncertainly for his family.\n  If this young man, now at the age of 17, is going to live 20, 30, or \n40 years, what is $250,000 worth? That $250,000 turns out to be a very \nsmall amount when we consider that the injuries he suffered and the \nproblems he has endured are going to be there for a lifetime. So for us \nto say we will decide in the Senate in S. 11, the bill that is before \nus, that this little boy and his family will never receive more than \n$250,000 regardless of the circumstances facing him for the rest of his \nlife, I think is totally unfair.\n  In fact, it is a dramatic departure from where we have been in the \nUnited States for so long. We have said, first, that this is an issue \nto be decided by each State. Each State should decide if there is going \nto be a limitation on how much money someone can receive if they are a \nvictim of a certain injury or malpractice.\n  Secondly, we have said historically this is an issue not to be \ndecided by 100 Senators, men and women sitting in Washington, but \nliterally by 12 of this family's neighbors and friends who live in the \ncommunity, who will try to reach a fair amount of compensation when in \nfact they find fault on the part of the doctor and the hospital. That \nis the jury system. It is a system we have believed in in America from \nthe start of this Nation. It really is a system which parallels free \nelections in America where we say we entrust our Government to the \npeople of this country.\n\n  In the courtroom, we entrust these decisions to the people of \nAmerica, 12 of them chosen at random to come to a fair conclusion. \nThose who are pushing this bill today say we can no longer trust the \njury system in America; we cannot trust 12 of this little boy's \nneighbors and friends and people in the community to come forward and \nreach a fair verdict.\n  I think that is a terrible condemnation of a system of justice which \nhas really been the bedrock of American principles and American values.\n  It is curious to me that many of the same people who decide today \nthat the jury system consists of people who cannot be trusted will \nreadily trust the jury system when it comes to questions of criminal \npenalties, penalties as severe as the death penalty. If we trust a jury \nof 12 to decide the life or death of a criminal defendant, is it not \nalso fair to say we would trust them to decide a fair amount of \ndamages, a fair amount of compensation, for this child and his family?\n  Well, no. S. 11, offered on the Republican side of the aisle, says \nthe opposite. It says, we will make the decision here. We are smarter. \nWe know what is fair, and $250,000 is adequate compensation for this \nlittle boy who will face a lifetime now of care on a daily basis, \nminute by minute, whose mother has had to quit her job so she can stay \nhome and tend to this 17-year-old boy who was a victim of medical \nmalpractice.\n  Let me also add that equally unfair and unjust in S. 11 is the \ntreatment of people who are senior citizens, who have been the victims \nof medical malpractice, because what this bill compensates are medical \nbills and lost wages, and limits any other recovery to $250,000. So if \none happens to be a senior citizen who has no active income, perhaps a \nlittle retirement and the money they derive from their savings, and \nthey are a victim of medical malpractice, they are limited to $250,000 \ncompensation.\n  I will come back later today and talk about a couple who were \nvictimized frankly because a blood bank gave them blood that was \ntainted with the HIV virus, which resulted in this 70-year-old couple \ncontracting that HIV infection, ultimately dying of AIDS. It was a sad \nsituation and one that was graphic in terms of the malpractice \ninvolved. But because they were not wage earners, their compensation \nunder this bill would be virtually nothing.\n  The medical care which they would receive, of course, would be \ncompensated, but it would only be $250,000 for pain and suffering.\n  Let's go to the root cause of this debate. Why are we even talking \nabout medical malpractice on the Senate floor? It is because we do have \na serious national challenge. In many States, including my own, for \nmany specialities of medical practice we have seen medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums increasing at an alarming rate. When we have asked \nthe General Accounting Office and private firms to analyze why this has \nhappened, they have said there is a variety of reasons that have led up \nto it. Yes, in fact, there are more settlements in cases involving \nmedical malpractice than there have been in the past, and in some \nmarginal cases more verdicts. It is an indication of the fact there is \nmore medical negligence being discovered, and even the Department of \nHealth and Human Services gave us testimony a few weeks ago that we are \nfacing medical negligence and medical errors across America, in their \nwords, of epidemic proportion. So now we have this huge wave of \nexposure and liability coming at the medical profession, and naturally \nthere are more lawsuits that are being filed to reflect this wave, this \nepidemic, of medical negligence.\n  What has happened on the insurance side to protect the doctors? \nSadly, this has been, frankly, a casino mentality among many of the \nmedical malpractice insurers. Back in the Clinton administration, when \nwe had a strong, vibrant, growing economy, when the Dow Jones index was \ngoing up regularly and people saw their retirement incomes growing and \ntheir savings growing, many people were investing in the stock market \nand doing well and many insurance companies did as well, too.\n  In the case of medical malpractice insurers, they would collect the \npremiums from the doctors, invest them in the stock market or in bonds \nand do very well.\n  Now what has happened? In the last 2\\1/2\\ years under this \nadministration, we have seen the economy in recession; we have lost \njobs; we have lost businesses; we have seen people lose their life \nsavings; they have made new decisions on whether they have to continue \nto work.\n  Business investment, as well, has not been as profitable. These \ninsurance companies that thought they had a winning formula are \nstarting to lose. The premiums collected from doctors, invested in \nbonds and the stock market, have not been as profitable. Because of \nthis, many of these companies have gone out of business or raised their \npremiums because of anticipated exposure for medical errors. Those \nraised premiums have caused real hardship among doctors in America.\n  Senator Daschle came to the Senate floor yesterday--and I tried to \nmake the point, also--to say we understand\n\n[[Page S9003]]\n\nthis issue is serious. On the Democratic side of the aisle, we have \noffered to the Republican side of the aisle to come together on a \nbipartisan basis to deal with the malpractice insurance crisis and the \nmalpractice crisis in America. But we cannot resolve this issue by \nintroducing a bill, S. 11, that only goes after one discrete part of \nit--limiting the recovery of medical malpractice to victims.\n  This drastic response is not going to solve the underlying problem. \nWe need to come together on a bipartisan basis as we did on terrorism \ninsurance after September 11. We found a way to do it. But we can only \ndo it if we engage the three elements that can lead to success. Those \nelements are: First, the medical profession itself. We have to bring \ntogether those doctors of good will across America who want to work \nwith us to reduce medical errors, to bring more safety to the practice \nof medicine, to take away from the practice of medicine those doctors \nand practitioners who are largely responsible for medical malpractice. \nFifty percent of the medical malpractice claims in America can be \nattributed to 5 percent of the doctors. We need to make certain the \nmedical profession is more vigilant in taking these doctors out of the \npractice of medicine, are changing the way they practice medicine so \nfewer innocent victims emerge from this experience.\n  Second, we need to bring in the insurance industry. I know this is a \nsacred cow in the Senate, to talk about insurance companies and holding \nthem accountable for the way they are treating doctors across America. \nBut you cannot have an honest conversation about dealing with medical \nmalpractice premiums without talking about the insurance industry. We \ncould cap recoveries across America in every courtroom for every victim \nof medical malpractice with no guarantee that medical malpractice \npremiums are going to decrease for doctors across America.\n  Here is what I think we should do. First, we should eliminate the \nantitrust exemption for insurance companies across America. To think we \nallow these companies to collude, to come together and share pricing \ninformation to the detriment of their customers--in this case, their \ndoctors--is indefensible. The McCarran-Ferguson Act should be repealed \nso the antitrust exemption is removed from the U.S. industry.\n  Second, we need to look at the whole question of reinsurance. Most of \nthese malpractice insurance companies only protect doctors up to a \ncertain amount--perhaps $1 million or $2 million--in terms of their \nexposure to liability. Then they sell off the additional exposure--\n$2 million to $10 million, $2 million to $20 million--and buy insurance \nto cover it. There are five major companies selling reinsurance in the \nmedical malpractice area. Four are offshore and not regulated by any \nState or Federal regulation in the United States. We have no oversight \nof the way they are treating malpractice insurers in America. That is a \nguarantee that, no matter what we do in the Senate, there will still be \nultimate vulnerability by the medical profession to unreasonable and \nexcessive malpractice premiums.\n\n  The solution involves: Bringing together the medical profession to \nreduce medical errors, to reduce medical injuries; bringing the \ninsurance industry in to make certain that we have some accountability \nand fairness in the premium charges; and, finally, bringing in those in \nthe legal profession to make certain that any lawyer filing a frivolous \nmalpractice lawsuit is going to be held accountable for the costs and \nattorney fees, initially, and ultimately, if he or she continues doing \nso, banned from filing future lawsuits; also making certain that \npunitive damages would be eliminated in virtually all medical \nmalpractice cases. All of these factors will move us toward a solution \nto this problem.\n  This week, we are going to be visited by many doctors from across the \nUnited States. They will come and tell us of their legitimate concerns \nabout malpractice premiums that are hurting their profession and \nlimiting the availability of good medicine and good doctors across \nAmerica. I do not quarrel with their premise that they have a problem \nthat needs to be resolved, that we need to face squarely and honestly.\n  But this morning, at 11 o'clock, I will hold a press conference in \nwhich we will have five victims of medical malpractice. They will tell \ntheir heartbreaking stories, how they went to the doctor, they went to \nthe hospital, and came home so injured and so changed that their lives \nwere never the same. The $250,000 being offered by the sponsors of S. \n11 is totally inadequate to the injuries they suffered. The limitation \nof $250,000 would make them wards of the state and dependent on \ngovernment and charity for the rest of their life. That is what is \nbeing offered on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  The last point I make is this: When you read S. 11 closely, you will \nfind it is not only about doctors and hospitals, it is also about \nprotecting from liability HMO insurance companies and health care \norganizations, the makers of medical devices, and those pharmaceutical \ncompanies that are found to have been negligent in the sale of their \nproducts.\n  I cannot understand how the medical profession can allow itself to be \nused by the sponsors of this bill so that those who are coming in to \nrepresent these special interest groups--the HMOs and managed care \norganizations, the pharmaceutical companies, and the medical device \ncompanies--get protection, using as their argument the sympathy that is \nbeing generated on behalf of doctors who are struggling with \nmalpractice premiums. That is unfair to the doctors; it is unfair to \nthe hospitals; it is unfair to the Senate, that we would include in S. \n11 that type of limitation.\n  Finally, this bill, S. 11, allows for punitive damages in the most \nlimited circumstances. It requires that there be a deliberate act on \nthe part of a doctor for punitive damages to apply, as well as \nmalicious intent being another option under punitive damages.\n\n  When I made an inquiry yesterday as to what it would mean if a doctor \nwere intoxicated or an addict to drugs and, because of that \nintoxication or addiction, performed some medical procedure which \nharmed a person for life, I was told that punitive damage section would \napply. I have to say quite honestly it does not because the language of \nthe section is only about deliberate and intentional conduct, not about \nthe kind of gross negligence involved in addiction and intoxication.\n  As we look at S. 11, we owe the medical profession as well as the \npeople of America more than is being offered. To bring this bill on a \ntake-it-or-leave-it basis, to say we will have no committee hearings, \nno amendment process in committee, no opportunity for an exchange of \ninformation, is not fair to the people of America. I hope we can do \nbetter--I think we can--that when the vote takes place tomorrow on the \ncloture motion, we will see a number of Senators are going to come \nforward and ask that we try to resolve this difference in a fair way, \nin a balanced way, rather than this unbalanced and unfair way being \noffered.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. As I listen to the Senator today--and I am aware of what \nthe Senator talked about yesterday--is the Senator saying he is not \nopposed to our doing something regarding medical malpractice?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly true. The Senator's home State, the State \nof Nevada, was a classic example of serious problems that were \nultimately addressed last year by legislative action when the State of \nNevada accepted its responsibility.\n  We need to deal with this through each State, and we need to find \nways on the Federal level to try to make certain we do not have States \nin crisis, as mentioned yesterday, because of malpractice premiums.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. In Nevada, the Governor, \nRepublican Gov. Kenny Guinn, called a special session of the Nevada \nLegislature to address this problem which was created by one insurance \ncompany that decided to take a powder when the stock market fell, as \nthe Senator aptly described.\n  The Senator, who previously served in the House of Representatives, \nalso said during his statements in the Senate that if we are going to \nmove important legislation such as this, there should be committee \nhearings discussing the legislation. It is true, is it not, that we \nhave had no hearings on this legislation?\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Nevada, that is accurate. \nIn fact, we had a limited hearing last February on the issue but not on \nthis bill. Senator Coleman of Minnesota had a hearing in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to talk about the general issue of \nmedical malpractice, where the administration testified we are facing \nan epidemic of medical malpractice in America. But no one has sat down \nto measure whether this bill will actually reduce malpractice premiums. \nThe only studies that have been done by the General Accounting Office, \nas well as by a group known as the Weiss Institute, have come to the \nconclusion that limiting the recovery of victims in medical malpractice \nlawsuits is no guarantee of malpractice premiums coming down. In fact, \nin many cases of States with caps on the recovery, limitations on \nrecovery for malpractice victims, the malpractice premiums for doctors \nhave gone up.\n  There is no linear connection or guarantee that limiting the recovery \nfor victims is going to help the doctors, yet that is the only solution \nthat is before us on the floor today.\n  Mr. REID. It is also true, is it not, I say to the Senator from \nIllinois, that the two studies of the Weiss and the General Accounting \nOffice are not studies that have been paid for, were involved with or \ndirected by attorneys? Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly right. I would say to the Senator from \nNevada, it is true the medical profession feels very strongly on one \nside and the trial bar on the other. But what I have tried to do is \ngather information from those who have no axe to grind, people who are \ntrying to analyze this problem honestly. The conclusions they have \nreached suggest to me this is a much more complex problem than what we \nsee today.\n  Unfortunately, S. 11 I think is a political answer to a much more \nserious problem. If this is a question about whether the White House is \ngoing to take on the trial bar in some sort of confrontation for the \nnext election, that is one thing. It is an interesting political \nbattle. It is not going to solve the problem, not in my State or any \nother State. We have to deal with it honestly by saying the medical \nprofession, the insurance industry, as well as the legal profession \nhave to come to the table. We need to have not only committee hearings \nso we can see publicly what this issue is all about, but we need to \nhave a good-faith effort. We can do it.\n  I think the Senator from Nevada recalls after 9/11 we had a problem \nwith terrorism, of course, and the threat of terrorism. That had an \nimpact on the construction industry and on investment. So people came \nto us and said: We can't get people to invest in building new buildings \nunless we do something about terrorism insurance.\n  We sat down on a bipartisan basis and worked it out. Senator Daschle \ncame to the floor yesterday and said: Use the same model on \nmalpractice. Bring us together, Republican and Democrat alike, and try \nto find common ground and a solution. If it is not through a committee \nprocess, let it be through an honest to goodness, good-faith \nnegotiation, but we can achieve that goal.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware, is he not, the reason terrorism \ninsurance was held up for so long is that Republicans wanted absolute \ntort reform, everything involving medical malpractice, slips and falls, \nrear-end automobile accidents--everything. We said: Why don't we just \ndeal with terrorism insurance? We finally prevailed, and we have done a \ngood job. There is construction going on all over America today, and \nthey are able to go forward because they can get terrorism insurance \nbased upon the legislation we passed.\n\n  The Senator, as I understand it--I want to make sure I am correct in \nthis--believes reform is needed?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. No. 2, you believe we should do it through the ordinary \nprocess, have committee hearings.\n  Finally, you believe the insurance industry should be involved in \nthis because the McCarran-Ferguson Act, named after Senator Pat \nMcCarran of Nevada, was passed to give a few years of relief to the \ninsurance industry so they could gather together during the Depression \nand not be involved with the Sherman Antitrust Act, and now, some 70 \nyears later, they are the only business other than major league \nbaseball that is not subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act. So the \nSenator believes they should be like other businesses in America, \nsubject to the Antitrust Act.\n  If we did some reform here and we involved the committee structure \nand we involved the insurance industry, I think we could move the bill \npretty quickly. Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator.\n  One other thing that needs to be part of the record: Even if we \nenacted S. 11, which is the cap on recovery for medical malpractice \nvictims--children, elderly people and families alike--there is no \nguarantee medical malpractice insurance premiums will come down. In \nNevada, significant reform legislation was passed but, as I understand \nit, the premiums did not start coming down for some period of time, if \nat all.\n  Mr. REID. It is absolutely true. The fact is, if you look around the \ncountry, insurance rates have not gone down where these medical \nmalpractice reforms have been initiated.\n  But another thing it doesn't take into consideration is the \ntremendous harm done to people who have no ability to move forward when \na doctor does something wrong to them.\n  I think the Senator indicated there are about 100,000 people killed \nbecause of medical malpractice in America every year. But that doesn't \ntake into consideration the people who are paralyzed, people who are \ninjured and damaged in many other ways. With this cap, these cases \nsimply do not go forward.\n  So it is really not fair to analyze what goes on in those States \nbecause you don't take into consideration the damage, the harm, the \npain and suffering of these people who have no way to recover their \nexpenses as a result of a direct negligent act by a physician.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree. I say to the Senator from Nevada, I do not \nprofess to be an expert, but I did, in my private practice as an \nattorney before I came to the Congress, have several malpractice cases. \nIn some I defended doctors and in some I sued doctors for what I \nbelieved to be malpractice. Those are heartbreaking cases and should \nnot be dismissed easily by the Members of the Senate until they sit \ndown and talk to families.\n  I can recall a family who brought in an infant girl to my office. She \nhad gone to the doctor for her ordinary baby shots, which I am sure the \nSenator from Nevada and my family have done; we have brought our \nchildren in for them without any real concern. This poor little girl, \nbecause she had a condition known as roseola, a form of measles that \nwas undetected before the administration of the baby shot, ended up \nwith a serious reaction to the pertussis vaccine for whooping cough and \nliterally became a quadriplegic. This little girl was going to live the \nrest of her life in a virtual coma-like state and need constant care.\n\n  What we hear from the other side of the aisle is that that is not \nworth more than $250,000.\n  I would say, if I were the parent of that little girl, I would view \nthis a lot differently. I would want to have a jury of my peers to \ndecide what it is worth, what is the value.\n  But S. 11 takes away the authority of the jury to make that decision \nand decides we will make the decision here for every case in America--\nno matter how serious the injury to the infant or the person who is the \nvictim of malpractice, no matter what the circumstances--to strictly \nlimit it to a $250,000 recovery.\n  I think that is unfair. I think the Senator from Nevada has made the \npoint.\n  The last point I will make on this issue is that I think we need to \ngive the doctors immediate relief on malpractice premiums. I am going \nto introduce legislation with Senator Graham of South Carolina that \nwill provide an immediate tax credit, in addition to the deductibility, \nan immediate tax credit of up to 20 percent for relief to the \nspecialties that are hardest hit by these increases in premiums for \nmalpractice insurance--neurosurgery, OB/GYN, trauma surgeons. I really \nbelieve we need to do something quickly.\n  S. 11 does nothing but change a law which may or may not, in 3 or 4 \nyears,\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\nresult in premiums going down. It is far better for us to do something \non an immediate basis, an emergency basis. I hope the medical \nassociation and societies across America will take a hard look at this \nbill--it is being offered in good faith to deal with the immediate \ncrisis--rather than penalize the victims of medical malpractice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say one thing--I know the \nDemocratic leader is in the Chamber--I have the highest respect and \nadmiration for my colleague from the State of Nevada, Senator John \nEnsign, who has introduced this legislation. He is passionately \ninvolved with doing something to solve this medical malpractice crisis. \nAs I have indicated, I have supported his efforts to do something about \nit. He and I tend to disagree on how to do it. But I want the record to \nbe spread with the fact that I have great respect and admiration for \nhis moving forward on this problem.\n  I only wish there had been full committee hearings on his \nlegislation. I think it would have improved it before it reached the \nfloor. I think he has been shortchanged by not having his legislation \nbrought before the appropriate committee, had hearings, and then \nbrought here. I think with some changes in this legislation it is \nsomething we could all support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment again, as I did yesterday, \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois for his great work on this \nissue and for beginning this educational process that I think has to be \na part of the debate at this time.\n  I also want to thank, as is always the case, the distinguished \nassistant Democratic leader for his involvement in these discussions as \nwell.\n  I have concerns about where we are with regard to this issue on at \nleast two counts.\n  First of all, the procedural count: I wish I had $1 for every \noccasion when Republicans would lament the fact that the committee \nprocess was bypassed. Yet here we are. There has been no hearing. There \nhas been no markup. There has been no committee consideration at all of \nwhat is one of the most complex and extremely controversial issues to \nface the Senate and the country. To bypass the entire committee process \nand bring the bill straight to the floor does an injustice to the \nissue.\n  As Senator Reid has noted, a bill of this magnitude deserves careful \nconsideration, deserves the opportunity to be heard, and deserves the \nchance to have some debate in the committee among the experts who know \nthis issue. I think it would be very helpful.\n  It is interesting that the president of the Tort Reform Association \nsaid don't count on insurance premiums going down if this legislation \npasses. I think Senators need to know that. If the president of the \nTort Association of America says, look, don't expect any relief, what \nis it we are doing? This isn't from some trial. This is a person who \nadvocates tort reform, but he is in the name of real honesty saying: \nLook, this is not the reason we are arguing for tort reform today. It \nis not going to bring down insurance premiums.\n  I think procedurally we have a real concern about the reason we are \nhere today. I think that is something that ought to be considered very \ncarefully. This is an important bill. It deserves the kind of careful, \nsubstantive attention that only committees can bring.\n  Second, of course, is the issue itself. As the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois has said so ably, we understand how important it is to \naddress the seriousness of insurance premiums. We have two approaches \nbefore us: The one offered by the Senator from Illinois, and the one \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina which will give immediate \nrelief. We are talking within the next couple of weeks, if this went to \nthe President's desk, immediate relief for meaningful insurance cost \nreduction.\n  When I go home that is the issue about which doctors tell me they are \nconcerned. They can't afford to pay the premiums. There is no better \nway to reduce the premiums than to give them the immediate relief \noffered in the Graham-Durbin bill. But I must say this is also a \nrecognition of the concern.\n  There has to be a way to address the problems created when mistakes \nare made. Tommy Thompson himself--certainly no advocate of the status \nquo--has recognized that last year, the year before that, and the year \nbefore that 100,000 people died as a result of mistakes made in \noperating rooms, in clinics, and hospitals across the country. That is \nnot my figure. That is not some special interest figure. That is the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services--100,000 people died.\n\n  I oftentimes find myself equating numbers with Vietnam and Vietnam-\nera veterans. We lost 58,000 people in Vietnam. We are losing almost \ntwice that number every year due to mistakes made in operating rooms \nand in hospitals.\n  What I find perplexing--interesting--is that our Republican \ncolleagues, who say the States know best how to govern, are saying: \nWell, in this case we don't think that is the case. In this case what \nwe think is we know better. Washington is going to dictate to the \nStates what the laws with regard to tort will be. Not only are we going \nto set the cap at $250,000, but we are actually, under the legislation \nbefore us today, going to preempt every single State law except the \ncap.\n  We are going to tell the States we know better and we are going to \ndictate to the States what it is they are going to have to abide by \nfrom here on out--total Federal preemption of State law. It is amazing \nthat is coming from our Republican colleagues.\n  I would also say I am concerned because I can probably even consider \nlooking at caps if there was any conclusive evidence that caps work. \nThere is a very respected analytical group that made, with some \nfanfare, a decision a couple of years ago to examine this whole \nrelationship between caps and premiums. They announced when they \nstarted the study that they did not know how it is was going to turn \nout. It could be pro-cap or it could be anti-cap. They didn't know. But \nthey believed an objective review of the available information ought to \nbe considered. They studied it. They looked at every single State. They \nreleased their findings about 3 weeks ago.\n  Do you know what they found? They found that there is no \nrelationship. In fact, what they found is, in those States where there \nare caps, insurance premiums went up more than in those States that \ndidn't have caps.\n  They are not arguing that caps had anything to do with it. But it is \nan interesting fact. Those States today with caps have actually seen \nhigher insurance premiums than those without caps, according to this \nvery respected independent study just released.\n  Both on the substantive as well as on the procedural issue, we have \ngreat concern with the fact that we are here today. We have a solution. \nI would argue to anyone on the other side who really wants to resolve \nthis issue that we go back to what we did last year with terrorism \ninsurance. That, too, was a tort reform question. Member after Member \ncame to the floor and said unless we deal with tort reform we will \nnever solve the terrorism insurance question. We sat together in a \nbipartisan fashion--Republicans and Democrats--worked out a reinsurance \nconcept and passed it on the Senate floor, finally, after a great deal \nof tribulation and negotiation, with a large margin.\n  If you go to New York or to Chicago or to the hometown of the Senator \nfrom Illinois or a lot of other places, you will find that the \nterrorism insurance bill worked. I would argue it worked in part \nbecause procedurally we decided to come together and resolve it and \nsolve it. I think it worked in partly because we addressed the issue \nwith real solutions. We didn't get hung up on all of this tort reform \nbecause that wasn't the issue there either.\n  Today, we still celebrate a success story. We celebrate a success \nstory here, too. We have a bipartisan Graham-Durbin bill. It might not \nbe everything. Maybe we can figure out a way to make it an even better \nbill. I think we have to deal with reinsurance. I think we have to find \na way to deal with reinsurance reform. We have to provide immediate \nrelief and the tax credit relief proposed by the Senator from Illinois. \nWe can do that. I think it is important that we do it. I think it is \nimportant that we recognize unless we do it that way we are not going \nto solve this issue.\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\n  Cloture will not be invoked tomorrow--not because we don't want to \nsolve this problem but because we don't want to have a bill that is \npoorly conceived and will not solve the problem and which will be \nrammed down the throats of the country. We can find a better way to do \nthis.\n  I would just implore my colleagues on the other side to work with us \nto make that happen.\n  Let me again thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois for his \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for his \ncomments and for his leadership on this issue. I think he has shown a \ngood-faith effort in the past to deal with issues and with the \ncomplexity of terrorism insurance. And that opportunity is still here \ntoday.\n  This week in Washington, many representatives of the medical \nprofession will come to visit us and talk about the seriousness of this \nissue. They don't need to convince me; I am convinced.\n  The question is, How do we resolve it fairly and not just for doctors \nbut for the victims of medical malpractice. We can do this. But I don't \nbelieve S. 11 is the way to approach it.\n  If we are going to allow this to disintegrate into a political face-\noff between the White House and the trial lawyers of America, perhaps \nwhen it is all over someone will have bragging rights for a 30-second \nad. It will not help the doctor with whom I met who is serving \nPrimbrook Township, south of the city of Chicago about an hour-and-a-\nhalf drive. You will find some of the poorest rural towns in America in \nPrimbrook Township. This doctor is literally giving his life to the \npoor who need medical care. He said to me 2 weeks ago in Washington: \nSenator, I am here to receive this Jefferson Award, and I am proud of \nit, but I need help with malpractice insurance. I want to help him.\n\n  Limiting the recovery by malpractice victims may ultimately give \nsomeone some satisfaction that they have scored a political victory \nover the trial bar, or perhaps their limitation of victims' recovery \nwill give them some satisfaction, but it is not going to help that \ndoctor. It is not going to reduce his premiums. It is not going to give \nhim an opportunity to continue his practice.\n  So I say to my friends in the medical profession--and this doctor is \na good example--we honor and respect what you do. We need you. We need \nto work with you. Do not get so caught up in a political agenda \ninvolving the White House and the trial lawyers that you overlook the \nfact there are many people of good faith and good will who want to sit \ndown and help.\n  We believe this can be done. It can be done in a way that is not \ngoing to deny the parents and the family of the small child, who, as I \nmentioned earlier, is going to live a lifetime of medical dependency \nbecause of medical malpractice. It is not going to be done in a way \nthat is going to deny a woman who went in for simple cosmetic surgery \nand ended up with horrific burns on her face that required a dozen \noperations and years and years of suffering. That is not the way to \nresolve this.\n  Do this in a fair way for doctors; do it in a fair way for medical \nmalpractice victims. Do not be afraid to call in the special interest \ngroup, the insurance companies, and tell them they have to be part of \nthis conversation. We have the power in Congress to bring them in. We \nhave the power to change the laws to make sure they treat doctors and \nhospitals fairly and to make certain the medical profession comes \nforward.\n  It is interesting to me that as I have discussed the issue of medical \nmalpractice with doctors in my State and across the Nation, they have \nbeen of one mind and one voice and they have agreed: We need to do more \nto make certain we reduce the incidence of medical errors.\n  A doctor, who is a friend of mine, in Decatur, IL, also works on the \nboard of a local hospital. He said he went to the hospital pharmacy \nwhere they literally write thousands of prescriptions each year for the \npatients who come through that hospital and they wanted to find out how \nmany errors had been made in the prescriptions that had been written. \nThey came up with a handful of examples. The doctor said to me: \nSenator, I know better, and you know better. We're not doing a good \nenough job here to make certain that mistakes are not made in the drugs \nthat are prescribed and the prescriptions that are written.\n  We can do a better job--and we should--to have medical safety. \nDoctors want the best results. They do not want bad results. Certainly, \nthe families and patients do not, either. We can work together to try \nto improve medical care in America in a professional way.\n  The bill I am going to introduce is going to allow for the transfer \nof information, data on medical safety, and the transfer of information \nwithout legal liability, so a doctor who would report an incident at a \nhospital that may lead to a change in a procedure or perhaps to a \ndisciplining of a doctor is not going to be held legally responsible \nfor having come forward with this information.\n  I think that is the only fair and honest way to deal with this issue. \nBut if we are going to deal with it, let us look at each of those \ncomponents: the medical profession, the insurance industry, as well as \nthe legal profession.\n\n  What I do not want to see occur is what S. 11 really mandates; that \nis, instead of a jury of 12 in communities across America taking a look \nat each individual case to decide what a fair, reasonable verdict and \noutcome might be, we would have a jury of 100, 100 Senators, men and \nwomen elected here, who would sit in judgment of every single case in \nAmerica involving medical malpractice.\n  We are not going to hear the story of the parents, who are going to \ncome from that downstate community in Illinois, who took their little \nboy in with a high fever, who expected medical care--which each of us \nwould expect as parents bringing in our baby with a fever to a clinic--\nand did not receive it because no temperature monitor was in place and, \nas a consequence, that little boy's high fever led to complications, \nquadriplegia, and the fact that he now has a lifetime of medical \ndependence on his parents. He will never enjoy the simple things in \nlife which each of us takes for granted.\n  We are not going to hear that story in the Senate as a jury would \nhear in a courtroom. We will not hear the details of his life and what \nit means now: the pain and suffering he goes through every single day. \nNo, we will not hear those facts. We will not make a decision based on \nthe reality of the malpractice that this family and boy endured.\n  Instead, we will make a decision, under S. 11, that says $250,000 is \nthe maximum amount that boy and his family will ever receive for the \ninjuries which they have suffered when it comes to pain and suffering. \nThat isn't fair. We should not stand as a jury and make that decision. \nWe ought to trust a jury system that has been part of American justice \nfor a long time, a system that we rely on every single day in thousands \nof courtrooms across America.\n  I think a sensible approach is to say that we do have a problem; we \nwill work with the doctors; we will work with the insurance companies; \nand we will work with the legal profession to find a reasonable \nalternative to it. S. 11 is not that alternative.\n  If, in fact, the cloture motion is defeated tomorrow, which means we \ndo not proceed to the bill, I make this offer, not only to the sponsors \nof that bill but to all who are interested in this issue, that I will \npersonally engage myself in trying to find a reasonable, good-faith \nalternative that reduces malpractice rates, premium rates, particularly \nfor those doctors who have no experience of wrongdoing--now, there are \nsome doctors paying high rates who, frankly, have to pay them because \nthey have been found guilty of malpractice--but for the innocent \ndoctors, who have given their lives to medicine and who come forward \nevery single day in a valiant effort to save and improve lives, I will \nstand on their side to make certain that they are treated reasonably \nand fairly.\n  Please do not turn to S. 11 as your only recourse because S. 11, \nbeing offered on the floor today, is one bill which is as unfair to \nmalpractice victims as the insurance premiums are unfair to doctors in \nmany places in America today. Let us work together--\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\nas we can; as we did under the terrorism insurance legislation--to find \na reasonable alternative.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for about 15 minutes on an upcoming judicial nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All remaining time is on the majority side. Is \nthere objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I was scheduled to make a statement on the \nmedical liability bill, and I am prepared to do that at this time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator how long he intends to \nspeak.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Probably 10, 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from \nNevada finishes his remarks, I be recognized for 15 minutes on the \nnomination of Mr. Wolski on which we will vote at 11:45 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was the Chair's understanding there would \nbe a substitute in the chair so he could make a statement on the \nRepublican time following Senator Ensign's speech and that the debate \nwould begin at 11:30 a.m. on the judges.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, are you saying there is no time between \nnow and 11:30 a.m.?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time has been reserved on the \nRepublican side.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have come to the Chamber to talk about \nthe legislation we are going to be discussing for the next couple of \ndays. It is very important legislation that affects people in virtually \nevery State in the country.\n  We have patients today being denied access to medical care in many \nStates across the country, and we are going to explore why that is \nhappening and what I believe the solution should be. Several States are \nlosing medical professionals at an alarming rate, leaving thousands of \npatients without a health care provider to serve their needs.\n  In Bisbee, AZ, the town's only maternity ward closed. Today expectant \nmothers must drive more than half an hour to have their babies \ndelivered. In Mississippi, 11 out of 21 obstetricians terminated \nservice in four rural counties. In my home State of Nevada, our only \nlevel 1 trauma center closed for 10 days, leaving every patient within \n10,000 square miles unserved by a trauma unit.\n  The bottom line is patients cannot get care when they need it most. \nBy definition, this is a crisis. This crisis boils down to two factors: \naffordability and availability of medical liability insurance for \nproviders.\n  The States in red are currently in crisis. A number are new States in \ncrisis. We can see they have been added, including the Chair's State of \nWyoming. My State has been in crisis for quite some time now, and it \nhas led to a lot of the national press, but it is certainly not alone. \nThe States indicated in yellow are the States that have problem signs. \nThe States that currently seem to be OK are indicated in white, and we \ncan see that very few States are in pretty good shape. Most of those \nStates have enacted medical liability reform that has been in place \nlong enough to stabilize the rates on medical liability insurance.\n  On affordability, the American Medical Association found that in the \nyear 2000, medical liability insurance rates increased at least 30 \npercent in 8 States and by at least 25 percent in more than 12 other \nStates. In this past year, the physicians in my State would be pleased \nif the rates had only gone up that much. These rates are forcing more \nphysicians, hospitals, and other health care providers to limit their \npractices or to leave the profession altogether.\n  Anecdotally--and obviously this hospital would not want this word to \nget out--at this time of the year when they get applications for new \nresidents, they normally get about 18 to 20 residents applying for \nslots at that hospital. That is an average of 18 to 20 each year. This \nyear they have received zero applications, and that is because of the \nmedical liability crisis that is occurring in my State.\n\n  Rates are forcing so many physicians and hospitals into a situation \nthey did not want to be in. They went into these practices because of \nthe compassion they felt for patients, and they are not being able to \ndeliver the services because of the out-of-control costs of medical \nliability insurance.\n  On the issue of availability, thousands of doctors nationwide have \nbeen left with no liability insurance as major insurers are either \nleaving the market or raising the rates to astronomical levels.\n  Why are insurers raising rates or leaving the market? Because there \nis no stability in the marketplace for providing medical liability \ninsurance. Why is that the case? Because our health care system is \nbeing overrun by frivolous lawsuits and outrageous jury awards. This \nexcessive litigation is leading to higher health care costs to every \nAmerican and an unstable peace of mind for our health care providers.\n  This chart shows the average payment in red from the year 1989 to the \nyear 2001 and the median payment. We can see the dramatic increase, \nespecially in the last few years, and if this chart continued out, it \nis continuing that trend up to the point where the average being paid \nin jury awards is continuing to skyrocket, and it is doing that because \nof the number of over $1 million awards being made by juries.\n  This is a chart reflecting the median jury award. We can see this is \nthe $1 million line, and we can see what has happened. It has gone up. \nThis, unfortunately, has created a situation where doctors, hospitals, \nand health care providers cannot afford to buy the insurance they need \nto continue practicing.\n  This excessive litigation is leading to higher health care costs for \nevery American and an unstable peace of mind for our health care \nproviders. Health care professionals are forced to practice defensive \nmedicine by ordering unnecessary tests just to avoid being sued for \n``underdiagnosing'' their patients. A study by the Department of Health \nand Human Services found defensive medicine is costing the Federal \nGovernment an estimated $28 billion to $47 billion in unnecessary \nhealth care costs.\n  Who else pays for these unnecessary costs? Every American with health \ninsurance in the form of higher premiums and, obviously, the American \ntaxpayer. Too often costs are so great that employers have to stop \noffering coverage altogether, thereby increasing the number of \nuninsured Americans. A lot of those uninsured Americans are younger, \nhealthier people. So the people who are left in the health care field \nare a higher risk pool, which drives up the cost even more, which \ncauses more and more people to not be able to afford health care \ninsurance; therefore, more uninsured. It is a vicious cycle that goes \non and on. This cycle has to be stopped. We can do that by passing \nnational medical liability reform right now.\n  Comprehensive reform is critical on a national level because every \nAmerican patient should have access to affordable and high quality \nhealth care. Likewise, every responsible, meritorious member of the \nhealth care community should not be afraid to provide such care because \nof the fear of litigation.\n  To achieve these reforms, I have introduced the legislation that is \nbefore us today, known as the HEALTH Act. It has several key reforms. \nIt includes a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, joint liability, and \ncollateral source improvements, and limits on attorney's fees according \nto a sliding scale award.\n  In addition, my legislation includes an expert witness provision to \nensure that relevant medical experts serve as trial witnesses instead \nof the so-called professional witnesses who are used to further abuse \nthe system today. If one talks to physicians, there is literally a \nwhole industry that has been created of these ``professional \nwitnesses.'' It would make sense that if somebody\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\nwas testifying in a case involving neurology, that the person should \nhave expertise in the field of neurology. I think that makes incredible \ncommon sense, but that is not the way it works today. As long as \nsomebody is a physician, they are able to testify and be called an \n``expert.''\n  Our legislation today says that if they are to be called an expert, \nthey must have expertise in the field in which they are testifying. \nOver 50 organizations are in support of my bill, including business \ngroups, medical associates, device manufacturers, and the list goes on. \nI have heard from people all over my State, and not just physicians. \nThis is not a doctors versus lawyers issue. This is about patient \naccess to medical care. That is why we have heard from nurses, physical \ntherapists, and people who work in doctors' offices and understand the \nproblem that is going on. We have heard, of course, from physicians, \nbut we have also heard mostly from the patients who understand; we have \ngotten so many calls from women whose physicians used to deliver \nbabies. The women are now pregnant and their obstetricians no longer \ncan deliver babies because they may be a high risk delivery and they \ncan no longer afford to provide that type of a service.\n  The broad coalition that has come forward to urge meaningful reform \nhighlights that this problem affects a number of industries, not only \nour health care system. Starting the Senate debate with our strongest \nproposal is critical because we must not approve a weak bill that the \nPresident will not be able to sign into law. Doing something weak as a \nBand-Aid would actually make things worse, and that is why we need very \nstrong legislation.\n  Opponents of this legislation ask how I know this approach works. It \nworks because this legislation is modeled after the highly successful \nlegislation that passed and has been in place for over 20 years in \nCalifornia. It is known as MICRA. MICRA has brought about real reform \nto California's liability system. The number of frivolous lawsuits \ngoing to trial has declined dramatically. Injured patients receive a \nlarger share of their rewards because of the limits on the fees that go \nto the trial attorneys. Disciplinary actions against incompetent health \ncare providers have increased.\n  The bottom line is that California's medical liability system works. \nThis is a quote by one of our colleagues from the other side of the \naisle, Senator Dianne Feinstein, January 14, 2003:\n\n       With the California law, we have a time-tested solution. \n     California passed MICRA in 1975, so we have our 27 years of \n     successful experience with the law.\n\n  One important point, neither MICRA nor my legislation limits the \namount of economic damages that an injured patient can recover. As in \nevery other profession, mistakes are made by health care providers. I \npracticed veterinary medicine after graduating from Colorado State \nUniversity. I saw firsthand that mistakes are made.\n  Medicine is an art and a science, and there is a human being \npracticing that very inexact science. Every day somewhere mistakes are \nmade. They are unfortunate. We should do everything we can to limit \nthose mistakes, but we know mistakes will be made.\n\n  Sometimes they are mistakes in judgment. When one looks back in \nhindsight, they can see how they could have made that decision \ndifferently. But when they are faced with it at the time, because the \nhuman body does not read the textbook--this is how the disease is \nsupposed to progress, this is how the injury is supposed to progress--\nthe human body does not read that. So sometimes it reacts differently \nto the way the physician was trained, and so what looks like a mistake \nin a court of law could have actually been a very difficult judgment \ncall. Yet a lot of these are frivolous lawsuits that are going to \ntrial.\n  In our legislation, we are trying to bring some balance back to the \nsystem. We do limit the amount of noneconomic damages, pain and \nsuffering as it is most often referred. People say, how can that be \nlimited? How can losing a leg be limited or how can a dollar figure be \nput on that?\n  Well, a dollar figure can never be put on it. No amount could ever be \njustified to somebody for some of the things that happen to them, but \nwe have to look at the overall good of our system.\n  With the system we have now, we are losing doctors, and we are losing \nthe kind of patient care we need. How does one put a dollar figure on \nthe doctor not being there, on the health care provider not being \nthere, on the hospital closing, on the trauma center closing?\n  We had a press conference several months ago in Washington with a \nwoman whose father was in Las Vegas visiting, and it happened to be the \nweek that our trauma center closed. During that week, unfortunately, he \nneeded our trauma center. I cannot tell my colleagues that he would \nhave lived if it was open, but the reason trauma centers exist is \nbecause they provide intense expertise in the area of trauma. They have \ngreat results, much better than normal emergency rooms. Unfortunately \nfor this family, that trauma center was closed.\n  By the way, the only way we were able to reopen the trauma center in \nLas Vegas was because the State stepped in and said that we are going \nto limit not to $250,000, but we are going to limit to $50,000 any \ninjuries and malpractice that occurs. That is not just noneconomic, \nthat is even economic damages. That is the only way that the trauma \ncenter in Las Vegas was able to open. We are losing all kinds of \nexperts in emergency rooms in other areas in Las Vegas as well.\n  People talk about decreasing the amount of mistakes by physicians, \nand we need to do that. It is very difficult and very complex to do. \nOne of the ways we can do that is to enact legislation to encourage \nvoluntary reporting. The current system actually is a protectionist-\ntype system that if somebody voluntarily reports mistakes, they set \nthemselves up for lawsuits. So we have no way to follow where the \nmistakes are being made and to point out trends so we can correct those \nmistakes.\n  The House has passed patient safety legislation. We are going to be \nworking on that in the HELP Committee, of which I am a member. I hope, \nin a bipartisan fashion, we can craft patient safety legislation that \nwill make the outcomes more of what we all want to see. That means \nfewer mistakes. But understand that there is no way to have a mistake-\nfree environment in such an area where the science is so inexact. We \nhave an opportunity here.\n  We have an opportunity with so many States now in crisis. The States \nin red on the chart are in crisis; the States in yellow show serious \nproblem signs. We have a chance in the Senate--the House of \nRepresentatives has already enacted this legislation--to make a real \ndifference in patients' lives. We can make sure trauma centers do not \nclose. We can make sure when a woman needs access to an obstetrician \nshe can have that access.\n  A friend of mine has Parkinson's disease, lives in Las Vegas, and has \nto go to Loma Linda where his specialist treats him. We do not have \nthat particular field of subspecialty in southern Nevada. He talked his \nphysician into coming to Las Vegas before the crisis hit Nevada. When \nthe crisis hit and we lost our major carrier of medical liability \ninsurance, the rates literally doubled and tripled overnight, and that \nphysician decided to stay in California. Why? Because they have enacted \na law that has kept rates reasonably low.\n  My next chart shows differences in larger cities around the country. \nFirst, OB/GYN in Los Angeles, a well-to-do area that has enacted \nmedical liability reform, $54,000 on average for an OB/GYN; in Denver, \nalso where they have had enacted legislation, $30,000. Then we have New \nYork, Las Vegas, Chicago, with Miami the worst. These are places that \ndo not have medical liability reform. In Miami, rates are over $200,000 \non average for an OB/GYN.\n  People say doctors make plenty of money. Have you talked to an OB/GYN \nlately about their average income? In Las Vegas, the average income is \naround $200,000 for an OB/GYN who goes through 8 years of undergraduate \nand medical school and then a 5-year residency. They come out $250,000 \nto $300,000 in debt minimum and they work about 100 to 110 hours a week \nto make $200,000. And their rates now in Las Vegas are around $130,000 \nto $140,000, up from a couple of years ago around $40,000 or $50,000 a \nyear.\n  Because of managed care they are not able to increase their rates, so \nit comes out of their pockets. That is why a lot of them are leaving \nour\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\nState. That is why a lot of new people are not going into the practice \nof obstetrics and gynecology. Especially for delivery of high-risk \npatients, rates have skyrocketed. Many physicians simply will not treat \nhigh-risk patients.\n  What are the women to do with a high-risk pregnancy? More and more \nwomen today are choosing to have babies later and later in life, and \nmore and more of them have high-risk pregnancies as a result. With \nfewer and fewer doctors able to deliver high-risk pregnancies, this \ndoes not add up. That is why it is so critical to enact this \nlegislation before the Senate today.\n  I know where the politics lie. We will probably not be able to pass \nthis legislation at this point. However, I want people to take a hard \nlook, talk to the patients in your States, find out what is really \nhappening at the grassroots level. This is not a question of how much \nmoney a physician makes. This is not a question of whether hospitals or \ninsurance companies are going to be profitable. This is a question of \nwhether when somebody needs the health care services to save lives or \ndeliver babies, that health care will be there because the provider is \nthere.\n  I am passionate about this issue because people are in jeopardy of \nnot getting the kinds of lifesaving services they need, the types of \nservices that improve the quality of life for so many Americans. That \nis why this legislation is so critical today.\n  As we go forward over the next 24 hours debating this bill, I \nencourage Members to have a healthy debate with an up-or-down vote and \nstart hearing from the American people on this issue. If Senators \nlisten to their constituents, they will hear loudly and clearly we need \nto reform our medical liability system so we can afford to have health \ncare that is so desperately needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business with remaining time \non our side of 4 minutes 21 seconds.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the Democrat leader and I were visiting a \nfew moments ago about our Fourth of July break and what we were doing. \nThat is one of the reasons I am speaking this morning. I thank the \nSenator from Nevada for that courtesy.\n  We all went home during the Fourth of July break to celebrate a \nbirthday, the birthday of our great Nation. We gathered with family and \nfriends. We set off fireworks. Some Members were in parades. It was all \nabout a birthday, the birthday of this great Nation.\n  My wife Suzanne and I were also home in Idaho because of other \nbirthdays. On May 31 of this year, our daughter Shae and her husband \nDavid had twins. Two new grandchildren entered both Suzanne's and my \nlife, a boy and a girl, born on May 31. The little boy's name is Drew \nCalvin Howell and he weighed 5 pounds and 3 ounces. His sister, I am \nsure always to be called the little sister, is Peyton Shae Howell, and \nshe was born at 11:54. Drew was born at 11:32. She weighed 4 pounds and \n1 ounce. They are twins and were premature so they stayed the first 3 \nweeks of their lives in intensive care in a Boise hospital before they \nwere allowed to come home.\n  Here we are, Fourth of July, and they are really home for the first \ntime. It is the first time grandpa had a chance to hold them and love \nthem and see them and be around them. It was a treat for our family but \nespecially for Suzanne and myself to be with our grandchildren.\n  This Fourth of July in Idaho with our family took on special meaning \nas we celebrated the birthday of these grandchildren, these twins, with \nour daughter Shae and her husband David. It is always an important time \nin families when grandchildren enter them. Drew and Peyton are the \nsixth and seventh grandchildren, so we feel very privileged by that.\n  Often we come to the floor to talk about momentous and meaningful \nevents. The Republican Senator from Nevada just spoke about a critical \nissue of reforming health care in our country, and malpractice. But \nprobably there is no more important event than when grandchildren enter \nour lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9009-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The hour of 11:30 having arrived, the Senate \nwill proceed to executive session for the consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 227 until the hour of 11:45, with the time equally divided \nbetween the chairman and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nor their designees.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of David G.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote with respect to the Wolski nomination be vitiated; provided \nfurther that at 2:15 today the Senate resume the motion to proceed to \nS. 11; further, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday the time \nbetween 9:30 a.m. and 11 a.m. be equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees; that at 11:30 the Senate proceed to the \nvote on invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 11; and, \nregardless of the outcome of that vote the Senate then proceed to an \nimmediate vote on the confirmation of Victor Wolski to be a judge of \nthe U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that immediately after the \nconfirmation of the Wolski nomination the Senate proceed en bloc to \nExecutive Calendar Nos. 89, 129, and 130; and, further, that the \nnominations be confirmed and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following that action the \nSenate then proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 77, S. 925, \nthe State Department authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not \nobject--I will make a comment and then pose a clarification.\n  I talked to the majority leader earlier today about the concerns that \nwe have regarding Mr. Wolski. Although it was not our intent to extend \nthe debate indefinitely, it was our view that, given the nature of his \nnomination, it deserved a little additional attention and some specific \ntime for debate beyond that which we were provided this morning.\n  I wish to express my appreciation to the majority leader for giving \nus that opportunity. I hope, if there are breaks in the debate either \ntoday or tonight, that Senators who have an interest in this particular \nnomination use that time in addition to the amount of time that is \nearmarked for the debate on the\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\nnomination tomorrow morning. So we will certainly find a way in which \nto make that part of the schedule.\n  The clarification: As I understand it--and I ask for the majority \nleader's affirmation--Nos. 89, 129, and 130 are the nominations \ninvolving the Federal Claims Court. They are the other nominees whose \nnames are still pending on the Executive Calendar. I ask the majority \nleader if that is, indeed, the case.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is the case, and the understanding as \nput forth in the unanimous consent request is that we proceed to them \nen bloc. They are the other three on the claims court.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for no more \nthan 2 minutes on the nomination of David Campbell upon which we are \nabout to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I advise my colleagues that the person we are \nabout to vote on is one of the smartest candidates for Federal district \ncourt that I have ever seen nominated by a President of either party. \nHis name is David Campbell. He is nominated to be a U.S. District Judge \nfor the District of Arizona.\n  He has a distinguished record in the State of Arizona, primarily with \nthe Phoenix law firm of Osborn and Maledon. He was a graduate of the \nUniversity of Utah Law School in 1979, where he was a note editor on \nthe Law Review and was awarded the Order of Coif.\n  He clerked for both Judge Clifford Wallace for the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit and for U.S. Supreme Court Justice \nWilliam Rehnquist.\n  He has practiced primarily in the civil area but has a broad \nexperience, including a lot of work with the Arizona State Bar \nAssociation's Committee on Rules of Professional Responsibility, and he \nhas been cobar counsel in a majority bar disciplinary case.\n  In addition to his work in the law practice, he has taught as adjunct \nprofessor of law at the Arizona State University Law School and was a \nvisiting professor at the J. Reuben Clark Law School at Brigham Young \nUniversity where he was named Professor of the Year.\n  He has published articles and has had a distinguished career as a \nlawyer in the State of Arizona.\n  I think the Senate will be proud to have confirmed him to the Federal \nbench. He epitomizes what we are looking for in judicial temperament, \nintelligence and integrity, and I think the State of Arizona and the \nU.S. bench generally will be the better as a result of our confirmation \nof David Campbell.\n  I commend the President for his nomination of David Campbell.\n  I also express appreciation to David's wife Stacey and their five \nchildren for putting up with what will now be a career on the Federal \nbench for this very fine candidate, David Campbell.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the confirmation of his nomination to \nbe a U.S. Federal judge.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of David G. Campbell to serve as a judge of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Arizona.\n  David Campbell is an extremely well-qualified nominee with a \nsignificant amount of litigation experience, and he will make an \nexcellent addition to the federal bench.\n  He received his undergraduate degree magna cum laude, as well as his \nlaw degree, from the University of Utah--which, in my view, is a \nreliable and persuasive indication of his excellent judgment.\n  Upon graduation from law school, Mr. Campbell clerked for Ninth \nCircuit Judge Clifford Wallace, and for then Associate Justice William \nRehnquist on the United States Supreme Court.\n  He joined the Phoenix law firm of Meyer, Hendricks, Victor, Osborn & \nMaledon in 1982 and became a partner there in 1986. Since 1995, Mr. \nCampbell has been a partner at its successor firm, Osborn Maledon, \nwhere he practices in the area of general civil litigation. The \nAmerican Bar Association bestowed on Mr. Campbell its highest rating of \nunanimously well qualified in recognition of his outstanding legal \nskills and reputation.\n  In addition to his distinguished legal career, Mr. Campbell has been \na great asset to his community and has donated many hours of pro bono \nservice and volunteer time to help individuals and families in need in \nhis community. His volunteer service has included building homes for \nthe homeless in Mexico, providing Christmas supplies to crises \nnurseries, and providing back to school clothing for disadvantaged \nchildren. He was also named Professor of the Year in 1991 by the J. \nRueben Clark Law School at Brigham Young University for his service as \na visiting civil procedure professor.\n  I am confident that David Campbell will be a model jurist, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of David G. Campbell, of Arizona, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Arizona?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, throughout the West, and all over the \ncountry,\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\nmore and more physicians are closing up shop and moving their practices \nout of State because they can no longer afford their medical liability \ninsurance premiums in States that don't have some kind of a control \nover the amount that can be awarded.\n  Whenever I go home for a town meeting or when I visit with \nconstituents, I hear story after story about people who are facing the \nloss of the sole option for health care in their towns because of the \nskyrocketing premiums their doctors must pay.\n  One constituent told me about her family physician in Newcastle, WY. \nShe had to close her doors because the cost of insurance premiums made \nit impossible for her to provide obstetrical services to the pregnant \nwomen of the town. She said: Telling a pregnant woman I won't be there \nto deliver her baby was one of the hardest things I had to do as a \nfamily physician.\n  She then joined two other doctors in Newcastle to announce as of July \n1 they would be unable to deliver babies because of a more than 50-\npercent increase in their liability insurance premiums. That means \npregnant women in the Newcastle area will now drive 30 to 90 miles when \nit comes time to deliver their babies. This is a problem for the people \nof Newcastle, but it is one that also faces the people who live in a \nlot of towns throughout my State of Wyoming and many other States.\n  Take Jackson, WY, for instance. A surgeon there paid $16,000 for \nliability insurance in his first year in practice. He is now facing an \nincrease in his rates that will place his premium at $164,000. That is \na jump of $148,000 in 1 year. Emergency room and trauma doctors are \nfacing similar jumps in the cost of liability insurance. An emergency \nroom doctor in Rawlins, WY, nearly closed his practice after his \ninsurance company announced it would no longer provide coverage for \nemergency room services. Fortunately, his hospital was able to find him \ncoverage at the last minute, but this is merely a temporary solution to \na critical problem.\n  Recruiting physicians to practice in rural States such as Wyoming is \na difficult job. The high cost of medical liability premiums is making \nit nearly impossible. These examples highlight the problem we are \nfacing. This problem is not just about lawsuits and insurance rates, it \nis about people who cannot get the medical attention they need. It is \nabout communities without doctors to serve them. It is about a health \ncare system in crisis.\n  The cost of medical liability insurance and the role of medical \nlitigation raise very complex issues, but the focus is not and should \nnot be on doctors or trial lawyers or insurance companies fighting \namong themselves. Our focus should be on patients and on ensuring \naccessible and affordable health care for all Americans. In Wyoming, \nensuring access to affordable health care is a persistent challenge. We \nprobably would have a shortage of health care providers even if our \nmedical liability system worked perfectly, but the costs of medical \nlitigation and of medical liability insurance are taking matters from \nbad to worse for the people of my State.\n  In fact, a study released yesterday by the Agency for Health Care \nResearch and Quality found that States that limit pain and suffering \nawards in medical lawsuits have more physicians per capita than States \nsuch as Wyoming that have no such limits.\n  Here are some other examples of the impact this crisis is having on \nWyomingites:\n  Two physicians who practice internal medicine in my hometown of \nGillette have been notified that their medical liability insurance will \nbe canceled as of July 31--not increased, canceled. If they are unable \nto find insurance coverage to replace their canceled policy in 2 weeks, \nthey will be forced to close their practice in a town that is already \nexperiencing a shortage of primary care doctors.\n\n  Another doctor in Casper, WY, was barely able to find insurance \ncoverage for this year. The doctor delivers more than 350 babies each \nyear. Nearly half of the mothers are covered by Medicaid. He also \nperforms nearly one-half of the gynecological surgeries in the Casper \narea. The only insurance he was able to find cost him $140,000 per year \nwith an additional $69,000 to purchase ``tail'' coverage in case he is \nsued for something that happened before his new insurance took effect.\n  In Wyoming, a physician who delivers a baby can be sued any time \nuntil the child's eighth birthday. So this ``tail'' is quite long, \nwhich means the premium could be quite high. In addition, this coverage \nis a short-term policy only good for 1 year, and he expects his cost of \ninsurance will increase substantially again next year. Without his \nservice, many pregnant mothers will find it difficult to obtain \nimportant prenatal care, especially expectant mothers in low-income \nfamilies.\n  Earlier this year, a doctor in Wheatland, WY, went to a high school \nbasketball game between the Wheatland Bulldogs and the nearby Douglas \nBearcats. At the game, he announced he would not be delivering any more \nbabies in Wheatland or Douglas and may be leaving the State because of \nthe cost of liability insurance. The irony is that he had delivered \njust about every player on both teams. This was not somebody new in \npractice.\n  We also have doctors who are being forced to leave Wyoming to find \nrelief from the financial burden of liability insurance. One doctor \nfrom Riverton, WY, grew up there, married a native of Wyoming, and \nreturned to Riverton to raise his family and practice medicine in the \nState he loves. But between paying off student loans from medical \nschool and paying expensive premiums on liability insurance, he is \nbeing forced to move to a State that has limits on pain and suffering \nawards. By moving, he will reduce his premiums by $43,000 a year.\n  The threat of lawsuits is enough by itself to raise insurance \npremiums in a State such as Wyoming. Plus, with so few doctors \npurchasing insurance in the pool, one major payout, whether the doctor \nwas at fault or not, can really send premiums for every doctor right \nthrough the roof. As a result, many doctors in Wyoming are moving to \nStates with larger risk pools and fairer liability laws, just as their \ncolleague from Riverton is doing.\n  People who are truly injured by errors made by health care providers \nought to be compensated fairly for their losses. However, the medical \njustice system today does not achieve this objective. If fair \ncompensation is the standard, our medical justice system falls woefully \nshort of the mark. Most people who are injured as a result of health \ncare errors do not receive any compensation. However, some who are \ninjured receive multimillion-dollar judgments as compensation for a bad \noutcome often without regard for whether the physician or hospital was \neven negligent.\n\n  The unpredictability of our medical justice system really does not \nserve patients or providers well. The only people who come out ahead \nare the personal injury lawyers who happen to find the right case. When \nit becomes impossible for insurance companies to predict their losses \nwith any certainty, premiums go up. It is a fact of the business, and \nit is no different for property insurers or life insurers than it is \nfor medical liability insurers.\n  Yes, people are hurt by health care errors, but skyrocketing medical \nliability premiums are hurting people, too. They are hurting physicians \nand hospitals in my home State by forcing them to curtail services or, \nin the case of doctors, to leave their practices entirely. Those \ndoctors who continue to practice now look at each patient as a \npotential lawsuit. So they order more tests, whether or not the patient \nneeds the tests. They spend less time discussing a course of treatment \nwith the patient so they can spend more time writing a report after the \nappointment to justify the treatment decision in case they get sued.\n  Ordering more tests and writing more reports costs an already \noverworked doctor time with his or her family and time to catch up on \nhis or her sleep. Doctors should not have to make choices between what \nis right for their patients and what is right for themselves, but our \nmedical litigation system does not offer them a real alternative.\n  Most importantly, the medical liability crisis in my State is hurting \ninnocent citizens who are losing their trusted hometown doctors to \nother States that have reformed their medical justice systems.\n  What do we know about our overall system of medical justice in \nAmerica\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\ntoday? We know compensation to patients injured by medical errors is \nneither prompt nor fair. We also know verdicts with huge awards that do \nnot match the severity of injuries or the conduct of the defendants \ndestabilize the insurance markets. This sends premiums skyrocketing, \nwhich forces many physicians to curtail, move, or drop their practices. \nThis leaves patients without access to necessary medical care.\n  Finally, we know litigation does nothing to improve quality or \nsafety. In fact, the constant threat of litigation drives the \ninefficient and costly practice of defensive medicine and also \ndiscourages the exchange of information about preventable health care \nerrors that we could use to improve the quality and safety of patient \ncare.\n  The current medical liability crisis and the shortcomings of our \nmedical litigation system make it clear that this is the time for a \nmajor change. We need a medical justice system that promotes \naccountability and fairness instead of discouraging them.\n  Regardless of how we vote on this legislation before us, we all ought \nto start working toward replacing the current medical tort liability \nscheme with a more reliable and predictable system of medical justice. \nWe need a system that restores rationality to the way in which we \ncompensate the injured and learn from mistakes. We need a system that \nrestores the trust that patients and providers used to have in each \nother. It is incumbent upon all of us to strive for such a system so \nthat we may raise the overall standard of health care in this country.\n  The legislation we are considering today is an important step in the \nshort term toward making the medical justice system work better for \neveryone, not just a fortunate handful of personal injury lawyers.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to address one of the most \nimportant issues I think we are going to be talking about all year. I \nhope our colleagues will permit us to conclude our debate with a vote \nso we can actually adopt some legislation to deal with this crisis of \nlawsuit abuse in the United States. Some call it medical malpractice \nreform. Whatever you call it, we have to deal with it.\n  Unfortunately, what we have heard is that some of our colleagues are \ngoing to prevent us from having a vote on the bill that is before us, \nS. 11. It is a bill that addresses one of the most fundamental problems \nwe have, and that is access to available quality medical care by a lot \nof people in our society today. We need to reform this flawed medical \nmalpractice system which is prohibiting people from getting the quality \nmedical care they need and deserve.\n  We debated just before the Fourth of July recess Medicare reform to \nprovide prescription drug benefits to all of our senior citizens. We \ntook a lot of time talking about why our senior citizens needed access \nto care and how we were going to improve that access. But all of that \nwill go for naught, it will do no good, if there are no hospitals and \nthere are no pharmacists, if there are no physicians and other health \ncare providers--or an insufficient number of those providers--to help \nthose people in need, whether they be senior citizens or others, \nbecause of the high cost of malpractice premiums and therefore the \ninability of these providers to continue to serve the people in their \ncommunities.\n  Last year, the American Medical Association released a study on this \nlawsuit abuse problem. It concluded that 12 States were having a full-\nblown crisis and that 30 States were seeing serious problems in terms \nof the ability of physicians and hospitals to stay in practice to take \ncare of their patients.\n  Today, just a year later, that study has been updated and the AMA has \nnow concluded that 19 States are having a full-blown crisis in dealing \nwith the medical malpractice insurance rates just for physicians. Let \nme give some examples of how this is affecting different communities \naround the country so you can see it is truly a nationwide problem.\n  In my State of Arizona, health care providers have experienced \ndramatic increases in their insurance rates. Between 2001 and 2002, two \nhospitals in Phoenix saw a threefold increase in their malpractice \npremiums, paying more than $1.7 million. Meanwhile, in Winslow, AZ, the \nhospital premiums have more than doubled, to $1.8 million.\n  Some of you know the town of Winslow, AR, from a famous song by the \nEagles. It is a town with great history and rich in tradition in \nArizona but it is not very big. It doesn't have the patient base to \nsupport a hospital that has to pay almost $2 million a year in medical \nmalpractice premiums. It is not just in my State of Arizona. Methodist \nHospital in south Philadelphia recently closed its maternity ward and \nprenatal program because of its medical liability insurance rates. \nGreenwood Hospital in Mississippi was unable to keep its level II \ntrauma center rating because the neurosurgeons in the area had left \nciting the high cost of liability insurance.\n  I spoke with a woman whose husband had been very seriously injured in \nan automobile accident in Mississippi. She told the story of how--\nbecause of the lack of physicians and because of the high cost of \npremiums--her husband has suffered so terribly as a result of that \naccident and the inability to get quick medical attention.\n  Back to my home State of Arizona, the Copper Queen Community Hospital \nin Bisbee, AZ, was recently forced to close its maternity ward because \nthe family practitioners in that community were looking at a 500-\npercent premium increase. Expectant mothers now must travel more than \n60 miles to the closest hospital, which is either in Sierra Vista or in \nTucson. According to the recent news accounts, four women have since \nhad to deliver babies en route.\n  To cite the news accounts, Time magazine has a June 9 cover story \nabout the doctor being out and why so many patients are losing doctors \nto the rising cost of malpractice.\n  This is now truly a national event.\n  In the Time magazine piece dealing with this question of physicians \nhaving to leave the practice, there is a particularly interesting story \nabout a woman in Arizona whose name is Vanessa Valdez. The title of the \nstory is ``Taking the Highway to Have a Baby.'' The story points out \nthat Vanessa has to drive about 50 miles to see her OB/GYN and to have \na baby. She lives in the town of Douglas, which is on the Arizona-\nMexico border. But there is no obstetrician within an hour's drive to \ndeliver her child. There were six family practitioners in that \ncommunity but they couldn't afford the soaring malpractice premiums. As \na result, the hospital was forced to close its delivery room, and \nsuddenly rural Cochise County has but one delivery room for the 118,000 \nresidents. That is in Sierra Vista, 50 miles from Valdez's home of \nDouglas.\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\n  This is beautiful country. It is a great place to live. But it is no \nplace to live if you are going to get sick or you know you are going to \nhave a baby because you have an hour's drive to get to a doctor. That \nis not right. It is not as if this is out in the middle of nowhere and \nyou chose to live there with all of the attendant risks involved. No. \nThere are a lot of communities in this area but none of them had \nphysicians able to continue to practice because of the medical \nmalpractice premiums they had to pay.\n  One other example: Nevada was very much in the news last year because \nof the crisis in that State. Nevada's top level trauma center was \nrecently closed for 10 days after 58 orthopedic specialists in Las \nVegas temporarily quit because of the skyrocketing insurance costs. \nAlso, a lot of the physicians delivering babies and performing high-\nrisk surgeries have indicated that they won't be able to continue to \npractice without some kind of relief.\n\n  Ultimately, this destructive lawsuit abuse hurts the patients. Yes. \nThe doctors can't make it, so they leave. But ultimately it is the \npatients who are the ones who suffer.\n  Therefore, we are trying to deal with that through legislation that \nwill make it a little bit more difficult for this kind of lawsuit abuse \nto occur so that the insurance companies won't have to charge quite as \nhigh a rate, so the physicians and hospitals can stay in business, and \nso the people of the communities can continue to be served.\n  Also, the threat of lawsuit abuse often forces doctors to perform a \nlot more in the way of tests and surgeries and other kinds of \ntreatments than they otherwise would do simply to protect themselves \nfrom a claim that they weren't doing enough for the patients--sometimes \nexpensive tests, sometimes invasive procedures.\n  All of this is called defensive medicine--trying to do everything \nthey can to make sure some smart lawyer out there doesn't try to pick \nat what they did and find some kind of fault with it and find a client \nwho is willing and able to hire a lawyer to bring a lawsuit against the \ndoctor.\n  That is another effect of this lawsuit abuse. Another is the fact \nthat a lot of times doctors are no longer willing to perform risky \nprocedures that may be necessary to really help somebody or even save \nsomebody's life. Obviously, the more serious the condition, frequently \nthe more risky the procedure. You want to be served by a physician who \nis willing to go to the mat for you in that case. But if the physician \nis looking at a big medical liability suit, if the result doesn't \nhappen to work out right, then that physician is going to be less \nlikely to try to treat you.\n  All of this results in an inferior quality of medical care for \nAmerican citizens, which is wrong. It is not at all uncommon for these \nlawsuits to be brought and the lawyers to get over half the settlement. \nThat is wrong. That is one of the issues with which this legislation \ndeals.\n  The Congressional Budget Office determined that the House bill, which \npassed and which was pretty similar to S. 11, would reduce direct \nFederal spending for Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health \nprograms by almost $15 billion over the next 10 years. Since the \nFederal Government is a payer for many of the medical services, \nparticularly for our seniors who are indigent, it is a saving to the \nFederal Government as well for this lawsuit abuse to be addressed. \nBecause employers will pay less for health insurance for their \nemployees and more of the employees' compensation will be in the form \nof taxable wages and other fringe benefits, including, of course, money \nthat could be plowed back into greater health care for the employees, \nthe Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting this \nlegislation would increase Federal revenues by about $3 billion over \nthe next 10 years as employees receive higher wages.\n  Just a note about the legislation itself, there are a lot of \ndifferent ways you can do this. I had actually cosponsored a bill \nsomewhat different than this. But the basic idea is the same, even \nthough we might want to change specific provisions of this legislation. \nIt basically sets sensible limits on the noneconomic damages that can \nbe obtained in these lawsuits. The noneconomic damages are those \ndamages that go above and beyond the bills that have to be paid. When \nyou get sick and the physician allegedly committed malpractice, you had \nto go to another doctor to get the problem resolved. Those are economic \ndamages as you lost wages, and any other expenses that you have. And \nthose economic losses are fully compensated. But above and beyond that, \nyou are entitled and juries will award substantial damages for \nnoneconomic losses, mostly called pain and suffering because of what \nyou had to go through. Certainly people recover something for their \npain and suffering. The question is how much.\n\n  In order to avoid lawsuit abuse, some States--for example, the State \nof California has put a $250,000 limit on those noneconomic damages. \nThat is precisely what this legislation does as well. However, states \nwith higher caps can keep those under this legislation too. It also \nreserves punitive damages for cases that justify it. Part of lawsuit \nabuse is very large punitive damage awards which have nothing \nwhatsoever to do with either the economic or noneconomic losses but \nnevertheless help to enrich the lawyers.\n  There are some other features of the legislation as well. But the \npoint I wanted to make is whatever the specifics of the legislation, we \nneed to act.\n  I hope our colleagues will permit us to conclude the debate and have \na vote on this legislation so we can get together with the House of \nRepresentatives, which also passed a bill, have a conference committee \nwork out any differences, all have a chance to vote on that, and then \nhopefully have a bill we can send to the President.\n  If we are never able to have a vote on this, it is not just the \ndoctors, hospitals, and other providers that are going to suffer; it is \nthe American people because they will not have access to the quality of \nmedical care which they need and deserve. I hope we cannot only debate \nthis legislation but also permit it to come to a vote so we can address \nthis serious crisis in America today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wanted to use 12 minutes of the \nSenate's time to discuss my reaction to this bill and my general \nthinking about the subject of medical malpractice insurance premiums.\n  I think it is pretty clear that medicine is at a crossroads. I think \nit is pretty clear that something has to be done. My own State of \nCalifornia was at the crossroads 28 years ago. A bill was passed \nthrough the legislature called the Medical Injury Compensation Reform \nAct, known as MICRA. MICRA had a rough road initially. It had a number \nof court challenges. Finally, it was sustained by the California \nSupreme Court.\n  What we saw--I will go into this in more detail later on--was that \npremium costs began to settle down. In fact, I think it is fair to say \nthat the California medical profession is very pleased with the MICRA \nbill as it stands today.\n  The problem I have--and I am probably one of the few on my side of \nthe aisle who is not opposed to the issue of caps because I think in \nthis situation they are helpful, but my problem is with the bill that \nis before us today because that bill is nearly identical to the bill \npassed out of the House and, frankly speaking, it is not one that I can \nsupport.\n  This bill before us sets a $250,000 cap for noneconomic damages in \nmedical malpractice suits. Now, this can be applied not only to suits \nagainst doctors but to suits against HMOs, nursing homes, and medical \nproduct manufacturers. It is a very broad provision. This cap would \neven apply for extraordinary cases. I will give you one: A youngster, \nJessica Santillan, a 17-year-old who died after doctors mistakenly \ntransplanted the wrong kidneys into her body.\n  So under this bill, suits against drug and device manufacturers also, \nsuch as the makers of the weight loss drug Phen-Fen, the Dalkon shield \ncontraceptive device, faulty heart valves, and other products that have \ncaused innocent deaths, would be limited to $250,000 in noneconomic \ndamages. I find that unacceptable.\n  Secondly, this legislation would severely limit the availability of \npunitive damages not only for doctors but\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\nalso for manufacturers. In general, punitive damages are capped at the \ngreater of $250,000 or twice economic damages in this bill. But the \nbill also wipes out any punitive damages in several different types of \nlawsuits against medical product manufacturers. It would immunize the \nmanufacturer or seller of drugs from punitive damages for any packaging \nor labeling defect on their product. So, presumably, if a drug package \nlabel had mistakenly directed a patient to take 10 pills a day instead \nof 1 pill a day, a patient could not sue for punitive damages, \nregardless of the harm caused or the basis of the mistaken direction.\n  It would also limit the availability of punitive damages against any \nmanufacturer or distributor of medical products if the product complied \nwith FDA regulations. Let me give you an example: a product such as the \nBjork-Shiley artificial heart valve. It originally received FDA \napproval, but these valves broke in an estimated 619 patients and led \nto hundreds of deaths. Under this bill, they would be immune from any \npunitive damage case. I think that is wrong.\n  This FDA exemption, in a sense, sets a downward and unacceptable \ncourse. If a company has an FDA-approved product on the market and then \nlearns of a dangerous complication presented by that product or a \nfailure of that product, it should have the incentive to remove that \nproduct from the marketplace as soon as possible. I think to provide an \nexemption if the product has FDA approval creates a disincentive to the \nrapid removal of that product from the shelf.\n  So while I cannot support this proposal, there are, however, \nproposals which I could support because I do believe that rising \npremiums are creating a crisis all across this country in terms of \naccess to care. Others have placed before this body a number of \nsituations. Let me just repeat a few.\n  Obstetricians and gynecologists in Florida pay over $200,000 a year \nfor malpractice insurance as opposed to $57,000 a year in California. \nAnd there is no more high-cost State than California. So OB/GYN \npremiums in Florida, $200,000; in California, because of MICRA, \n$57,000; surgeons in Michigan pay $110,000 for malpractice insurance. \nTwenty percent of the OBs and GYNs in West Virginia and Georgia have \nbeen forced out of their practice due to rising premiums.\n  Nine hundred doctors in Pennsylvania have left the State since 2001 \nto avoid annual premiums as high as $200,000. The Methodist Hospital in \nPhiladelphia discontinued its prenatal program for low-income women \nbecause of high premium costs.\n  The neurosurgeons of Wheeling, WV, have left the area, and local \ntrauma patients requiring neurosurgery need to be airlifted out of the \nState.\n  Not only are insurance premiums skyrocketing in some States, but \ninsurers are leaving the market, and that is a very dangerous signal. \nThere were 14 companies underwriting liability in Mississippi; today, \nthere is but one willing to write new policies. Texas had 17 insurance \ncarriers; today it has 4.\n  In California, we have nonprofits handling the insurance for \nCalifornia's doctors, and that is one reason the system works.\n  I have spent a number of months taking a good look at the California \nlaw to see what could be transferred to the national level. And I want \nto say, here and now, this Senator would support reasonable caps on \nnoneconomic damages because I deeply believe they can lead to more \nstable premium rates.\n  At the time MICRA was enacted in 1975, the cost of health insurance \nin California was higher than any other market except New York City. In \nthe 6 years before 1975, the number of malpractice suits filed per 100 \nphysicians in California more than doubled.\n  MICRA has kept costs down. In 1975, California's doctors paid 20 \npercent of the gross costs of all malpractice insurance premiums in the \ncountry. Today, they pay 11 percent of the Nation's total malpractice \ninsurance premiums. Clearly, costs have dropped in comparison with \nother States.\n  All over the United States, premiums have grown 505 percent in the \npast 25 years. California's premiums have grown 167 percent. In other \nwords, premiums have grown three times slower in California than in \nother States. That alone shows that MICRA is working, regardless of \nwhat anyone might say.\n  Also, because of MICRA, patients get their money 23 percent faster \nthan in States without caps on noneconomic damages. Bottom line: \nCalifornia's malpractice premiums today are one-third to one-half \nlower, on average, than those in Florida or New York.\n  Because the California law has proven successful at keeping premiums \ndown--and I know there are those who do not want to believe it; they \nwill say it is some other reason; but I believe it has--I used the law \nas a departure point for crafting a proposal which I believe is both \njust and fair and which I believe should stabilize and, over time, \nreduce premium costs.\n  I very much appreciate the efforts of Senator Frist and Senator \nMcConnell in working with me to explore this option. I am not going to \noffer it on the floor today for one reason: Unfortunately, it would not \nhave the necessary votes.\n  Specifically, my proposal would do the following: It would create a \nschedule for attorney's fees. It would create a strict statute of \nlimitations, requiring that medical negligence claims be brought within \n1 year from the discovery of an injury or within 3 years of the \ninjury's occurrence. It would require a claimant to give a defendant 90 \ndays' notice of his or her intent to file a lawsuit before a claim \ncould actually be filed. It would allow defendants to pay damage awards \nin periodic installments. It would allow defendants to introduce \nevidence at trial to show that claimants have already been compensated \nfor their injuries through workers compensation benefits, disability \nbenefits, health insurance, or other payments--that is only fair--and \nit would permit the recovery of unlimited economic damages.\n\n  My proposal would differ from California's law in two key areas: One, \nnoneconomic damages and, two, punitive damages. The California MICRA \nlaw has a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages. In contrast, I would \npropose a $500,000 general cap on noneconomic damages. Today 15 States \nhave caps of $500,000 or less for noneconomic damages. Twelve States \nhave a cap of $500,000 or less on noneconomic damages, and that \nincludes Alaska, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, \nMississippi, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Hawaii, North Dakota, and South \nDakota. Three States have caps of $250,000-or-less and they include \nMontana, New Hampshire, and California. Thus, 15 States already have \ncaps of $500,000 or lower.\n  In catastrophic cases, where a victim of malpractice was subject to \nsevere disfigurement, severe disability, or death--in other words, a \ncatastrophic exemption--the cap would be the greater of $2 million or \n50,000 times the number of years of the life expectancy of the victim. \nThis really takes into consideration terrible morbidity done to a young \nchild whose life span might be 50 or 60 years more. Clearly, a cap of \n$250,000 or $500,000 is really not fair to that youngster. Therefore, \nthe catastrophic exemption we would propose would provide the greater \nof $2 million or 50,000 times the number of years of life expectancy of \nthe victim.\n  In addition, we would propose a less onerous punitive damages \nstandard than California law. California law is very strict today with \nrespect to a plaintiff's ability to prove punitives under the very high \nstandard of fraud, oppression, or malice. In other words, if you can't \nprove fraud, oppression, or malice, you can't prove punitive damages. \nIf a doctor is in the middle of surgery and walks out to go to his bank \nto make a deposit while the patient is under a general anesthetic, in \nmy view, that doctor should have punitive damages brought against him \nbecause that clearly is not accepted medical procedure.\n  California's law is much stricter. You have to prove fraud, \noppression, or malice. Under this law, I am not aware of a single case \nwhere a plaintiff has obtained punitive damages in California over the \npast 10 years. So at least in my view, for situations such as the one I \njust indicated, the California law is too strict in this regard.\n  Instead we would offer a four-part test where a plaintiff would have \nto show by clear and convincing evidence--and this was put together \nbased on measures that have passed this Senate in the not too distant \npast--that\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\nthe defendant, one, intended to injure the claimant unrelated to the \nprovision of health care; or two, understood that the claimant was \nsubstantially certain to suffer unnecessary injury and, in providing or \nfailing to provide health care services, the defendant deliberately \nfailed to avoid such injury; three, the defendant acted with a \nconscious flagrant disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of \nunnecessary injury which the defendant failed to avoid; or four, the \ndefendant acted with a conscious flagrant disregard of \nacceptable medical practice in such circumstances.\n\n  Clearly, the doctor who walked out of a surgery and left a patient \nunder a general anesthetic would fall under this fourth plank. It \ncertainly is a flagrant disregard of acceptable medical practice which \nwould be, you don't go to your bank in the middle of an operation to \nmake a deposit when the patient is under a general anesthetic.\n  I firmly believe a variant of this type could lead to a compromise in \nthe proposal in the Senate. Why didn't I go ahead with it? Much to my \nchagrin and, I think, surprise, both the American Medical Association \nand the California Medical Association rejected this proposal. The AMA \ncontends that despite the fact 15 States have caps of $500,000 or less, \nthey believe that a $500,000 cap is too high and it would not stabilize \npremiums.\n  The California Medical Association is opposed to it for a different \nreason. Although we leave State law in place, whether that State law is \nretroactively passed or prospectively passed, the CMA felt the State \nlegislature might--I say ``might''--change the $250,000 cap to \n$500,000. So both of these associations have rejected that proposal \nwhich meant I wouldn't have a chance to get the necessary votes on \neither my side of the aisle or pick up a few votes on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  They refused to move from a cap of $250,000 for noneconomic damages \nin even catastrophic cases. To me this is wrong because a $250,000 cap \nin 1975, when the California law set this cap, adjusted for inflation \nwas worth $839,000 in 2002. So last year a $250,000 cap, passed in \n1975, would be worth $839,000, if passed today. If a figure of $250,000 \nwas adequate in 1975, why couldn't a figure of $500,000, which is lower \nthan the 1975 cap adjusted for inflation, be acceptable this year?\n  Now if a victim receives $250,000 today, this is equal to $40,000 in \n1975. So when California led the Nation by passing the Medical Injury \nCompensation Reform Act and setting a cap for noneconomic damages of \n$250,000 in 1975, everybody should know that that is worth $40,000 \ntoday. In my book, that is unacceptable.\n  There are many specific instances of why it is unacceptable. Let me \nshare one case. That is Linda McDougal. She is 46. She is a Navy \nveteran. She is an accountant, a mother. She was diagnosed with an \naggressive form of cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. Two days \nlater she was told that a mistake was made. She didn't have cancer and \nthe amputation of both her breasts was not necessary.\n  A pathologist had mistakenly switched her test results with another \nwoman who had cancer. Is this Congress willing to say there should be a \ncap of $250,000 on noneconomic damages for this kind of mistake? I \nthink not.\n  A cap on noneconomic damages must take into account severe morbidity \nproduced by a physician's mistake, such as amputating the wrong limb or \ntransfusing a patient with the wrong type of blood.\n  Unfortunately, because of the opposition of both the American Medical \nAssociation and the California Medical Association, I am not proposing \nan amendment at this time. My purpose was to help physicians and \npatients, and I deeply believe that a $500,000 noneconomic damage cap, \ncoupled with the catastrophic exception I outlined, would accomplish \nthis, would accomplish it fairly, and would stabilize premiums over the \nlong term.\n  I also suggest that State laws, where they exist, should prevail. So \nthe California MICRA law, or any other State law, would prevail \nregardless of whether that State law was already enacted or \nretroactive.\n  So, bottom line, I could not get 60 votes for this proposal with the \nopposition of physicians. So the result may well be an alternative \nbecause I don't believe the House bill can pass in the Senate in its \npresent form.\n  Let me say this. I have given this bill a great deal of thought. I \nreally mean what I say--that I am prepared to support a reform bill. I \nam prepared to support a cap on noneconomic damages. But it has to be a \ncap that is realistic in view of today's time. It cannot be a cap that \nwas passed 28 years ago that has an actual value of $40,000 today. So I \nam hopeful there will be another time and another place when a bill \nsuch as the one I have tried to outline might be found to be \nacceptable. In the interim, I will vote against S. 11. But, again, I \nstand ready to participate in a solution along the lines I have \nmentioned.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the issue \nof medical liability reform, a matter that cries out for a remedy from \nthe Congress because of its sheer scope and size.\n  When it comes to health care, I believe the proper role of the \nGovernment is to protect the freedom of all people to act in their own \ninterests and in the interests of their health. I think it is \nappropriate that we make sure their decisions are not made by the \nGovernment but by themselves and their families. Patients and doctors, \nrather than lawyers and bureaucrats, should be trusted to decide what \ntreatment is best for themselves and their patients.\n  I strongly believe that when people have good choices in a health \ncare system built upon free market principles, it ultimately translates \ninto high-quality care. One of the obstacles, though, to achieving \naccess to that high-quality care is the current crisis involving \nmedical liability litigation.\n  Today, America is experiencing a medical liability litigation crisis \nthat is increasing the cost of health care, it is decreasing access to \nphysicians and hospitals for many patients, and it is generally \nlowering the quality of care. As a matter of fact, we could hardly call \nour medical liability system a ``system'' because it is such a mess. In \nrecent years, average jury awards have more than doubled, from more \nthan $460,000 in 1996 to more than $1 million in the year 2000.\n  In the past year, medical liability insurance premiums in many States \nhave increased by more than 20 percent, on average, and more than 75 \npercent for certain specialties. That is just in 1 year. Between 1991 \nand 2001, the number of medical malpractice payments of $1 million or \nmore that were reported to the National Practitioners' Database \nincreased from 298 to 806. The overall result is sky-high costs for \nliability insurance, increased costs for those who provide health \ntreatment, and costs that have really created a crisis of enormous \nproportions, one that is threatening the quality of care, diminishing \naccess to care, and exploding the cost of care.\n  According to studies at the Department of Health and Human Services, \ndoctors across the country are closing their practices, they are \nlimiting the types of patients they see, or they are leaving \ncommunities where they have long practiced because they cannot afford \nthe rapidly increasing costs of medical liability insurance or, worse \nyet, insurance coverage is unavailable altogether.\n  Fear of liability suits--even frivolous litigation--also results in \nthe practice of defensive medicine.\n  A recent survey, for example, conducted by an organization known as \nCommon Good, revealed some disturbing trends: 79 percent of physicians \nadmit that the fear of litigation has caused them to order more tests \nthan they thought medically necessary, and 74 percent refer more \npatients to specialists than their best medical judgment would \notherwise dictate. Half have recommended invasive procedures they do \nnot consider on a medical basis to be necessary, but they have done it \nin an effort to protect themselves against the second-guessing that \ngoes\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\nalong with the medical liability regime.\n  Defensive medicine increases risks for patients and it raises health \ncare costs by as much as $126 billion per year. This is a crisis not \njust for the Nation's physicians, it is a danger to America's \npatients--in other words, every single one of us.\n  For example, pregnant women in Nevada, Mississippi, West Virginia, \nand Florida must drive hours just to find an obstetrician who can care \nfor them, and many still cannot get the essential prenatal care they \ndesperately need. The only level 1 trauma center in Las Vegas had to \nclose temporarily last year because its surgeons could not afford \nmedical liability insurance. Some physicians' annual premiums had \nincreased from $40,000 to $200,000 in just a year.\n  In many States, physicians are retiring or moving their practices \nbecause they either cannot afford the liability insurance or simply \ncannot buy the liability insurance they need in order to protect what \nthey have worked a lifetime to achieve.\n  In Mississippi, physicians are actually moving across the river to \nLouisiana to serve the same patients they would serve in Mississippi \nbecause they can no longer afford to practice in that State, and most \ncities in the State of Mississippi with populations under 20,000 no \nlonger have any physician who will even deliver a baby.\n  There are many more examples from my State, the State of Texas. The \ncity of Austin, for example, is suffering from a shortage of \nneurosurgeons caused by retirements and relocation to avoid liability \ncoverage costs, a shortage so heavy that some patients have to travel \nmore than 65 miles away to find treatment.\n  In 100 of the 254 counties in the State of Texas, there is no \nobstetrician; in other words, there is no medically trained specialist \nwho will deliver a baby in 152 Texas counties. After 44 years, Spring \nBranch Medical Center near Houston has stopped delivering babies \naltogether due to the soaring malpractice insurance costs and the \nshrinking pool of physicians that will actually deliver babies.\n  According to the Texas Medical Association's physician survey last \nyear, more than half of all Texas physicians, including those in the \nprime of their professional career, are considering early retirement \nbecause of the State's medical liability insurance crisis, and earlier \nthis year the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported about one story that \nillustrates the way this problem affects patients who need care the \nmost. The story said:\n\n       Last summer, a pregnant woman showed up at Dr. Lloyd Van \n     Winkle's Castroville office in south Texas, less than 10 \n     minutes from delivery. Her family doctor in Uvalde had \n     recently stopped delivering babies, citing malpractice \n     concerns, and the woman was trying to drive 80 miles to her \n     San Antonio doctor and hospital. ``She made it as far as \n     Castroville and decided she wasn't going to make it any \n     further,'' Van Winkle said.\n\n  We all want to prevent disease and injury. When patients get sick, we \nall want to prevent medical errors, and when errors do happen, we can \nall agree that a patient should be compensated fairly. But if you can \nfind some goal hidden somewhere within the current dysfunctional \nmedical liability system, that goal would not be either the prevention \nof errors or the fair compensation for injury. Very clearly, the \ncurrent medical liability crisis operates for the benefit of a few at \nthe expense of the many.\n  Personal injury trial lawyers should not be able to drive good \ndoctors out of medicine or to reduce patients' access to health care. \nThis system undermines the ability of physicians to treat their \npatients without fear, and it destroys the trust and the important \nrelationship between patients and their physicians, and it truly \nabandons the American patient--that is, every one of us--when we need \nthe help the most.\n\n  I am proud to say that in my home State of Texas, the State \ngovernment has stepped up in the legislative session just ended and \npassed some needed reforms in this and other areas. This year, despite \noverwhelming pressures from special interest groups, the State passed \nhistoric liability reform which makes it possible for doctors to \npractice in Texas without fear of unwarranted and frivolous lawsuits. \nThe law puts caps on punitive damages while allowing for patients who \nare truly hurt to be fairly compensated. Judgments will be based on the \namount of involvement in the act caused in the suit without \nconsideration of who has the deepest pocket.\n  I must add, though, that even in my State of Texas, there will be a \nvote of the people on whether the Texas Constitution will be amended to \nprovide a means to achieve this historic reform and much needed reform, \nand that vote remains to be given and taken. Yet there is still little \nrecourse for patients in States without meaningful reform, and this is \ntruly a nationwide crisis and not one that should be addressed by \nindividual States, given the sheer magnitude of the crisis, its \ngeographic expanse and, frankly, the amount of Federal taxpayers' \ndollars to go in to paying for the current dysfunctional system.\n  Our health care system is still burdened with frivolous lawsuits and \noutrageous jury awards. According to a Health and Human Services study, \npremiums in States without meaningful liability reform went up 39 \npercent in the year 2001 and an additional 51 percent in 2002. An out-\nof-control system in one State can have an effect on malpractice \npremiums in other States, even those States that have made some \nincremental step toward reform.\n  This is a national problem, and it demands a national solution. This \nlegislation is comprehensive reform that will enact several critically \nneeded components. For example, it caps noneconomic damages awarded in \nmedical malpractice cases at $250,000. It will eliminate joint and \nseveral liability; in other words, the person at fault will pay for \ntheir percentage or their share of fault and no more. It will create a \nuniform statute of limitations; in other words, a period of time in \nwhich a lawsuit can be filed and pursued in court in a way that will \npreserve both the rights of the patient, as well as make sure that so \nmuch time does not pass that memories dim, records are destroyed, and \nthe facts are difficult to discern.\n  It will reform the collateral source rule, another arcane rule of our \nlegal system that says that even if someone has already been paid from \none source they can still keep that information from the jury and seek \nto be paid yet again for the same loss.\n  Finally, it will create reasonable limits and court approval of \nattorney contingency fee awards. In many places, the amount of money \nthat a lawyer will receive, and others will receive, in terms of costs \nof expert witnesses and the like routinely exceeds the amount of money \nthat an injured patient will receive, somewhere on the order of out of \nevery dollar that is awarded by a jury the injured patient only gets 40 \ncents. It is the lawyer and the bureaucracy in our litigation system \nthat absorb the rest.\n  If this were truly about what is best for the patients, we would see \nreform. We would see it in the Senate. Unfortunately, this is about the \n60 cents on the dollar that goes to people, other than the patient, who \nare obstructing true reform.\n  This legislation is a comprehensive reform and is modeled after the \nhighly successful MICRA law in California, one that has been very \nsuccessful both in making sure injured patients are fairly compensated \nwhile at the same time holding down the escalating costs of medical \nliability insurance in a way that allows most physicians to practice \ntheir chosen profession and which provides better access to good \nquality health care.\n  This act will help protect our critical care hospitals and provide \nneeded relief for nursing homes and medical specialists. The cost of \nhealth care will be reduced as the need for high premiums for liability \ninsurance will become a thing of the past.\n  We must remember that this crisis is not, in the end, about what is \nbest for doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, or personal injury \ntrial lawyers. What this bill is about is what is best for patients--in \nother words, what is best for the American people.\n  This crisis is threatening the quality of care, jeopardizing access \nto care, and escalating the costs of care. In my own State, one can \ntravel to the gulf coast and Corpus Christi where emergency room \nphysicians live in fear that they will be called to answer to a patient \nin a hospital emergency room, someone who they know they have never \nseen before and will never perhaps see again\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\nafter treating them in the emergency room, and for a patient visit that \nthey will likely not get paid or will get paid only pennies on a dollar \nfor their usual fee, but yet because of the medical liability crisis \nthey will put at risk everything they have worked a lifetime to build \nand achieve for themselves and for their family. That is even when they \ncan buy insurance.\n  The truth is, the costs of medical liability insurance have escalated \nso dramatically because of this crisis that many physicians cannot even \nbuy adequate amounts of coverage. If they can, it is at such a cost \nthat they figure why bother, why bother to practice, and so they simply \nleave.\n  I reiterate that in the end this is not about doctors, lawyers, \nhospitals, or insurance companies. This is about who gets access to \nquality health care, and in many parts of my State, and in many States \nacross the Nation, access to health care is simply not there because of \nthis crisis.\n  I believe we should end the liability lottery, where select patients \nand some trial lawyers receive astronomical awards, while others pay \nmore--all of us really--for health care and many suffer access problems \nbecause of it. We should pass meaningful medical liability reform that \nincludes real and lasting change and bring the lessons of Texas and \nother States that have done so to the Nation's Capital and the American \npeople.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  My most respected colleague from Texas said it is not about doctors \nand it is not about insurance companies. I would have to dissent from \nthat view from the standpoint of my experience over some 30 years \ndealing with this particular problem.\n  We started in the early 1970s with my good friend Victor Schwartz. \nProduct liability was the style of the day, the crisis. The Little \nLeaguers could not play anymore at the playgrounds. Football was going \nto have to be abolished because they could not buy safe helmets. They \nwere all being sued because of the helmets. We faced down the situation \nof so-called product liability and tort reform with the help of the \nNational Legislative Association, the National Governors Association, \nand some others.\n  We went to Y2K. We would go to terrorism insurance. I resisted, being \nan old States righter. I have an unusually good insurance commissioner \nin South Carolina. In fact, we have low rates as a result of his \nadministration. But from a studied view of this particular situation, \nthe problem is, yes, the doctors and, yes, the insurance companies.\n  Why do I say that? Well, according to the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Mr. Thompson, there are 100,000 deaths a year in \nAmerica as a result of medical malpractice. That is people killed. That \nis casualties. We had 58,000 people killed over 10 years, just about, \nin Vietnam.\n  Now, the doctors have to get ahold of themselves in the State of West \nVirginia, for example. There are some 40 doctors, I think it is, who \naccount for some 25 percent, one-fourth, of the 2,300 malpractice \nclaims.\n  Incidentally, they are moving down to South Carolina because I have \ntalked to some of my doctor friends. There is no better friend of \nmedicine than this Senator from South Carolina. I have worked with them \nclosely over the many years I have been in the National Government, and \nas their Governor. We have a very disciplined, one might call it, \nmedical practice in South Carolina. In fact, they have always told me, \nand again recently affirmed, that if we had the average licensed \ndoctors of some of the other States we would immediately add 1,000 \ndoctors. In other words, it is not easy to practice medicine in the \nState of South Carolina.\n  So we go immediately to the doctors disciplining themselves like the \nlawyers, and I can get example after example of us at the bar \nassociation disciplining the lawyers. Unfortunately, the doctors just \nrecently returned now to that particular practice and they are \nbeginning to see that they are having to pay for the whole thing. \nOtherwise, it is not tort reform; it is insurance reform.\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas mentioned California. I have \nheard, and it is true, that California has brought down the malpractice \ninsurance rates for the doctors there. That was done with caps in the \nbeginning, but it did not work--in 1975. And it wasn't until 1988 that \nthey had Proposition 103, to institute insurance reform--not tort \nreform but insurance reform, where they had an immediate rollback of \nthe rates of some 25 percent, regulation written by the insurance \ncommission, and anyone who wanted to question any rate increase had a \nright before the commission to petition and be heard.\n\n  So, yes, there is a way to do it. But you will see, as I speak here \nthis afternoon, it is not this tort reform. In fact, tort reform is \nbeing taken care of in the States. They are moving fast. They are \nalready moving in the State of Illinois, as the distinguished Senator \nDurbin has been pointing out, with respect to that, and other States \nhave not waited.\n  The only trouble with the cap is that it has not brought down the \nrates. The cap States--I mentioned Illinois that has no cap. The rates \nare up there. But four of the first five--Florida, Michigan, Texas, \nWest Virginia--these four of the five top States with the highest \npremiums have caps on damages.\n  So the proof of the pudding is in the eating. We have experienced \nthis with caps. I have other examples to show. Time and again, the \ninsurance executives say: Pass the caps, we are not going to lower the \nrates.\n  But the majority leader, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, is \none of the most eminent physicians. And I don't say that just speaking \non the floor in a right fashion. He saved the life of a good friend of \nmine with a lung transplant back in Tennessee. She has been getting \nalong extremely well as a result of the expertise, the touch, the \nsensitivity, the bedside manner of Dr. Frist. So there is no question \nin this body that we have a very valued doctor friend as a Senator from \nTennessee.\n  But Tennessee doesn't have that problem. Of course, there are no caps \nthere. They are below the median in premiums, and they do not have \ndamage caps. I am sure the distinguished doctor/Senator would long \nsince have asked that his State move in that direction if that were the \nproblem.\n  No, the problem is a political one. We have the doctors in town. It \nis almost like the computer crowd who came to town with Y2K, and the \nsky was going to fall--we had to immediately pass Y2K to make sure at \nthe first of the century the world wouldn't end.\n  We have a similar situation now where we look for the needs of the \ncampaign rather than the needs of the country. We call this bill, right \nin the middle of the energy bill, appropriations bill, and all the \nother important matters that we have, tort reform, medical malpractice, \nbecause the doctors are in town.\n  I guess instead of $2,000, those doctors could give $4,000 to \npolitical campaigns, so you might call this the $4,000 bill we will be \nvoting on tomorrow morning, as to whether or not we should have \ncloture. I hope we do have cloture because we ought to nail this \nbuzzard quickly and get rid of it.\n  You never hear anybody who has been represented as a result of \nmedical malpractice complain about the fee. It is always the loser who \ncomplains about a plaintiff's fee. I never have found a plaintiff yet \nwho complained about lawyers' fees.\n  That gets me right into lawyers because that is the pollster cancer \nwe have in Government in Washington today. You get the pollsters--and \nthey don't know. I never have found a pollster, incidentally, who ever \nserved in government or public office. So they do not know the \nquestions to ask, What about lawyers? Shouldn't we have tort reform? Of \ncourse, the Chamber of Commerce has us behaving like toadies for \ncorporate America, doing everything they want because we want their \nmoney in order to run for office. So we only pay attention to the money \nneeds and the campaign needs and not the needs of the country.\n\n  As far as tort reform is concerned, it is being taken care of at the \nState level. The big problem, of course, is the losses that have been, \nnot from medical malpractice, incidentally, but from their investments.\n  Let's say a word about those lawyers because, after all, we just had \nthe\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\nFourth of July. I saw a program about the forefathers. They were all \nmentioning the different ones who brought us this 227 years of freedom.\n\n       Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be bought at the \n     price of chains of liberty and freedom? I know not what \n     course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or \n     give me death.\n\n  A lawyer said that.\n  I can see that 34-year-old Jefferson, with the quill in hand:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal.\n\n  Equal justice under law, with the Declaration of Independence.\n  What is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on \nhuman nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If \nangels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on \ngovernment would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be \nadministered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You \nmust first enable the government to control the governed; and in the \nnext place oblige it to control itself.\n  We are out of control: We have a $428 billion budget deficit, after \ntalking about the surplus, surplus, and surpluses for 2 years. The \npublic debt to the penny is $428 billion, and we have not finished the \nfiscal year.\n  Madison, the lawyer, the Emancipation Proclamation--Abraham Lincoln, \nthe lawyer.\n\n       The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\n\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the lawyer.\n  You go right on down the line, giving meaning to equal justice under \nlaw.\n  Thurgood Marshall, the lawyer.\n  These were eminent lawyers and not jury fixers. We have 60,000 \nlawyers working on K Street. I am one of the 60,000 licensed to \npractice in the District of Columbia. There are 60,000, and 59,000 will \nnever see the courtroom of law. They are supposed to fix the 535 of us \nlawmakers here in Government. They are salesmen. I delight in seeing \nthem. They are a big help because we have to have the proceedings, and \nI listen to both sides and I make up my mind.\n  But they are, under the bill at hand that has been introduced, not \nlimited in their fees. They sit there claiming frivolity. If you are a \ntrial lawyer, you get the client who comes in. You have to perhaps get \nthe doctor for him, get the medicine. Then if you get the case, get out \non the highway, get some pictures and everything else like that, get \nthe experts, draw up the pleadings. After the pleadings are drawn, make \nall the motions, the interrogatories, and discoveries. Still you \nhaven't gotten a red cent. Time passes on, and what happens is you get \nto the trial and, after all the trial and the motions in the trial, you \nhave to win all 12 jurors. And after the 12, you have to make the \nmotions on appeal, you have to print up the briefs, you have to go and \nmake the arguments before the appellate court. Then, if you finally \nwin--if you finally win, yes, you get a good fee. But you probably \nspent a couple of years or more waiting around. And that is the \npractice of the trial bar.\n\n  I have been in it. I have also defended. And they are lazy. Man, they \nare lazy. I have seen them. They just absolutely sit there and let the \nrunners and investigators do all the work, call that doctor and do this \nand do that, and then if it is inconvenient, they say: We have a \nwitness who is sick, and we will move for a continuance--because, why? \nThe clock runs. The clock runs, and they get, what, $450 an hour?\n  I remember when I passed the first textile bill here, a Senator on \nthe other side of the aisle came and said: I know a lawyer downtown who \nhas been paid $1 million to get that bill passed, and he didn't do \nanything. Here you are, a freshman Senator, and you passed it.\n  I said: Yes, and I passed it for free because I believe in it.\n  But you have big fees down here. The clock runs with this corporate \ncrowd, just look at the bill. They say: Oh, no, no--they have no \ncontrol over their fees. Just control the trial lawyers--with tort \nreform. You have the biggest myth on the courts we have ever \nexperienced.\n  Let's go, since my time is limited, to the truth about malpractice \npremiums. According to the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners:\n\n       Total profits as a percentage of premiums for 1999 [that is \n     the most recent year for which data is available] are nearly \n     twice as high in the medical malpractice line than the \n     casualty and property insurance industry coverage. Recent \n     price increases are merely an attempt by the insurance \n     industry to maintain the extremely high level of \n     profitability for malpractice coverage.\n\n  If that is all the profits, where are the losses? This is Enron. This \nis Kenny Boy. The Justice Department spent 2\\1/2\\ years and they can't \nget him. They have gotten everybody in the world. They have gotten \nWorldCom all the way through the courts up to the SEC and reaffirmed \ntheir bankruptcy plan, but you haven't heard any more about Kenny Boy.\n  Listen to what this says:\n\n       When terrorists slammed airplanes into the World Trade \n     Center in 2001, the Donaldson Co. in Bloomington felt the \n     blow almost immediately. The manufacturer's property \n     insurance renewed just days later, with nasty surprises.\n       Our premium quadrupled from $500,000 to $2 million.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article from the Metro edition \nof the Star Tribune in Minneapolis printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Star Tribune, Mar. 9, 2003]\n\n Few Spared as Insurance Rates Soar; Corporate, Household Budgets Feel \n                               Same Pain\n\n                            (By Dee DePass)\n\n       When terrorists slammed airplanes into the World Trade \n     Center in 2001, the Donaldson Co. in Bloomington felt the \n     blow almost immediately. The manufacturer's property \n     insurance renewed just days later, with nasty surprises.\n       ``Our premium quadrupled from $500,000 to $2 million'' and \n     suddenly excluded $150 million worth of terrorism coverage, \n     said Marty Kohne, Donaldson's safety, environment and \n     insurance manager.\n       After Enron imploded, Donaldson's cost to insure its \n     directors and officers tripled to $300,000 a year.\n       ``You get very frustrated because all these events affect \n     you, but you have no control,'' Kohne said.\n       It's a common sentiment among insurance buyers of every \n     kind, both corporate and consumer. Pushed by events as \n     divergent as Enron's collapse, terrorism, natural disasters, \n     and health care inflation, insurance costs are spiraling \n     industrywide unlike anything seen in more than a decade. The \n     insurance inflation is part of what's stifling corporate \n     profits and eating into household budgets, and experts \n     believe it could be at least another two years before prices \n     stabilize.\n       Insurance executives contend they've had little choice but \n     to make major adjustments in premiums. Paul Bridges, senior \n     vice president of Marsh USA, the nation's largest insurance \n     broker, explained the increases this way:\n       ``We had an insurance industry that used to make all of its \n     money off of investment returns on Wall Street. But with the \n     death of the dot.bombs, those stopped,'' he said. ``Then, \n     with recent losses, margins reversed and [insurers] weren't \n     making money for stock holders.''\n       ``We started ratcheting up prices partly on the backs of \n     disasters'' last year, added Bridges, noting that premiums \n     are still on the rise. Commercial policies ``started off \n     rising 30, 40 and 50 percent and some even 100 percent.''\n\n\n                          There's no escaping\n\n       The burden is being felt at firms of all sizes.\n       Minneapolis CPA Barry Rogers runs his own firm with six \n     employees. There have been no major illnesses among his \n     workers, so he was shocked when his agent announced last year \n     that his premiums were ``only going up 12 percent.''\n       ``We had one person who had outpatient surgery done, and \n     that was the extent of it,'' Rogers said of the firm's \n     previous claims.\n       The firm's health care premiums jumped from $145 per worker \n     to $163, with the co-pay from $15 per office visit to $25.\n       Rogers and his agent eventually worked out a plan to reduce \n     the co-payment back to $ deductibles for hospitalization \n     climbed from $300 to $500.\n       Statewide, commercial health insurance premiums rose 12 \n     percent in 1999, 16 percent in 2001, according to the \n     Minnesota Department of Health. Estimates are that rates \n     will go up again around 12 percent this year.\n       Health care companies reported their costs rose 9, 13 and \n     10 percent in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.\n       In many cases, the rising health care costs are being \n     partly passed along by employers, effectively canceling out \n     workers' cost-of-living raises. Workers are then finding that \n     their personal insurance costs also take more money. Last \n     year, homeowner premiums rose 10 percent nationwide. This \n     year, homeowners' rates are expected to rise again.\n       ``There's no doubt about it, '02 had lots of premium \n     increases,'' said Kenneth Ciak, president of American Express \n     Property Casualty, which collected $260 million in premiums \n     last year.\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\n                           corporate coverage\n\n       ``Frankly, it's about time,'' Ciak said. ``On the personal \n     lines side, we have not had a 9/11 catastrophe, but there are \n     a fair number of storms that have occurred and the \n     homeowners' product has just been underpriced. We have not \n     made money for the last four or five years.''\n       While homeowners paid $37 million nationwide to protect \n     their homes against storms, fire and other disasters in 2001, \n     insurers reported losses and expenses equal to 114 percent of \n     all home premiums collected last year.\n       Even corporate coverage, which for years was predictably \n     and modestly priced, has exploded in cost, thanks to recent \n     events. The accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom and other \n     companies have erased an change for reasonable directors and \n     officers insurance or cheaply priced surety bonds.\n       The recent $1.4 billion settlement by investment banks with \n     regulators over allegations of misleading stock \n     recommendations also has increased the pricing pressures on \n     such policies, as insurers brace for investor lawsuits \n     alleging biased stock research. Directors and officers \n     insurance protects companies if their executives are sued by \n     shareholders or other plaintiffs.\n       A 2001 survey by Tillinghast-Towers Perrin found that \n     insurance claims against executives averaged $5.7 million for \n     each of its 2,037 corporate respondents that year, up 75 \n     percent from 2000. Shareholder lawsuits alone leaped 178 \n     percent to cost insurers $17 million on average in 2001.\n\n\n                        paying for enron's sins\n\n       Companies that haven't been sued aren't escaping the \n     fallout.\n       Apogee Enterprises of Minneapolis manufactures and installs \n     exterior building glass. The company has 5,500 workers, 12 \n     directors and no directors and officer claims in its history. \n     Nevertheless, it is paying or Enron's sins.\n       ``Last year we paid about $150,000 [in premiums]. Now we \n     can expect it to go way up, maybe triple . . . even though \n     [four underwriter groups] are very comfortable with Apogee \n     and our governance,'' said Michael Clauer, Apogee's chief \n     financial officer.\n       ``That's the reality of Enron. If you want the coverage, \n     you pay the price,'' Clauer added.\n       Marcy Korbel, a Marsh vice president of financial \n     professional services, recently shared similar bad news with \n     risk managers from General Mills Inc., 3M Co. and other \n     firms.\n       Industrywide, directors and officers ``premiums average 50 \n     to 300 percent increases and that's only if there are no \n     claims,'' she said. ``We are seeing increases of more than \n     300 percent if there is claims activity and even more for \n     companies with market caps over $1 billion.''\n       Policy prices have to reflect reality, said Bob Hartwig, \n     senior economist for the Insurance Information Institute.\n       ``The end of 2001 and all of 2002 were horrific years for \n     this country in terms of corporate governance. We have had \n     some of the worst scandals in the history of this country,'' \n     Hartwig said.\n\n\n                           premiums going up\n\n       Enron alone hit 11 insurance companies for $350 million in \n     director and officers claims. Enron's bankruptcy also cost \n     the St. Paul Companies $10 million in surety bond losses and \n     $12 million in unsecured debt the insurer held in the energy \n     company. AIG has announced a $1.8 billion charge in part to \n     deal with claims for both Enron and WorldCom.\n       All of this was on top of 9/11, which brought insurers $40 \n     billion in losses.\n       The St. Paul Companies, which lost $941 million in 9/11 \n     claims, hoisted commercial premiums 32 percent in 2001, and \n     27 percent last year to squeak back into the black after a \n     dismal 2001. The company lost nearly $1 billion in 2001. It \n     earned $290 million in 2002, about half the $567 million it \n     earned in 2000.\n       St. Paul CEO Jay Fishman has said premium increases will \n     continue this year.\n       At Apogee, the company's property premiums have risen 40 \n     percent, while its general liability premiums doubled. To \n     compensate, it has adopted higher property deductibles and is \n     self-insuring for workers compensation claims.\n       ``Not only did we assume more of claims but we also \n     incurred even more costs because premiums keep going up. It's \n     been a very challenging year for us,'' Clauer said.\n       On top of that, the company is still waiting for some \n     projects to get going because of the lack of terrorism \n     insurance, a product that is only beginning to be offered \n     again now and is likely to add another cost equal to about 10 \n     percent of the property's regular insurance costs.\n       ``We still have projects on hold because of the developers' \n     inability to get terrorism insurance,'' Clauer said.\n\n\n                            surging premiums\n\n       After going through a long period of subdued prices in the \n     `90s, premiums for business and homeowners insurance are \n     rising fast, pushed by a confluence of events including \n     terrorism, corporate crimes and natural disasters. \n     Percentages for 2002 are estimated, percentages for 2003 are \n     forecast.\n       Premium percent change from prior year--'90 4.5 percent; \n     '02 14.0 percent; and '03 12.2 percent.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Enron alone hit 11 insurance companies \nfor $350 million in director and officer claims. Enron's bankruptcy \nalso cost St. Paul $10 million in surety bond losses and $12 million in \nunsecured debt insurers held in the energy company. AIG has announced a \n$1.8 billion charge in part to deal with claims for both Enron and \nWorldCom.\n  All of this was on top of 9/11 which cost insurers $40 billion in \nlosses. Now, we find 9/11 and Enron. Kenny Boy is responsible for the \nlosses. It is not medical malpractice. In fact, in all of the cases, \nonly 1 out of 9, or 12 percent, of the cases actually go to court. Some \n26 percent of that small percentage actually are tried. The verdicts \nare up instead of down. But now we find out from where they come.\n  I have another article in the final edition of the Gannett \nCorporation on Friday, January 3, 2003. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, Jan. 3, 2003]\n\n           J.P. Morgan, Insurance Firms Settle Legal Dispute\n\n                           (By Edward Iwata)\n\n       Hoping to cut loose the Enron albatross, J.P. Morgan Chase \n     early Thursday settled a legal dispute with 11 insurance \n     firms that had accused the Wall Street bank of engaging in \n     sham financial deals with the collapsed energy-trading firm.\n       Later in the day, J.P. Morgan Chase said it will take $1.3 \n     billion in fourth-quarter charges to cover losses on its \n     dealings with Enron and to create a $900 million reserve for \n     related but unresolved legal claims.\n       J.P. Morgan Chase had sued the insurers last year, after \n     the companies refused to cover $1.1 billion in losses on \n     several failed energy trades in the late 1990s involving \n     Enron and Mahonia, an offshore company associated with J.P. \n     Morgan Chase.\n       The insurers--plus congressional investigators who have \n     looked into Enron's ties with Wall Street banks--alleged that \n     the deals between Enron and J.P. Morgan Chase were fake \n     accounting transactions designed to hide debt and boost \n     revenue.\n       Under the complex settlement submitted in court, the \n     insurance companies could pay from $520 million to $660 \n     million to J.P. Morgan Chase.\n       Neither side admitted wrongdoing, and both claimed a legal \n     victory.\n       John Callagy, an attorney at Kelley Drye & Warren in New \n     York who represents J.P. Morgan Chase, says the settlement \n     bolsters the bank's contention that the Enron deals were \n     legitimate. ``There was absolutely no evidence of fraud,'' he \n     says.\n       Alan Levine, a lawyer at Kronish Lieb Weiner & Hellman in \n     New York and the lead attorney for the insurers, says, \n     ``We're very satisfied with the economics of the \n     settlement.''\n       J.P. Morgan Chase's troubles relating to Enron haven't \n     ended, though. The bank still faces the giant Enron \n     bankruptcy case, a shareholders' class-action lawsuit against \n     Enron and several Wall Street banks and federal \n     investigations into the Enron scandal.\n       The insurers' settlement should have no legal impact on the \n     other legal fights, says one attorney close to the cases. \n     However, lawyers often use settlements as leverage in talks \n     in related cases.\n       In the insurers' case, the settlement came early Thursday \n     morning, near the end of a monthlong trial in New York before \n     U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff. The jury was ready to start \n     its deliberations Thursday.\n       As part of the settlement, Travelers Property Casualty \n     could pay up to $159 million; Chubb's Federal Insurance, $110 \n     million; Lumbermens Mutual Casualty, $94 million; Allianz's \n     Fireman's Fund, $93 million; St. Paul Fire & Marine \n     Insurance, $80 million; CNA Financial's Continental Casualty \n     and National Fire Insurance, $47 million; Safeco, $33 \n     million; Hartford Financial Services, $25 million; and \n     Liberty Mutual Insurance, $13 million.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it says:\n\n       Hoping to cut loose the Enron albatross, J.P.

Where do we go?\n  I quote from an article dated June 30 in U.S. News and World Report.\n\n       The case of Samuel Desiderio, while tragic, seems to give \n     perfect voice to the complaints of many doctors who see a \n     legal system gone wild. As a 4-year-old, he suffered brain \n     damage following surgery at a New York City\n\n[[Page S9020]]\n\n     hospital. A state court jury awarded him a hefty $80 million \n     for medical expenses and pain and suffering. In April, just \n     two months ago, an appeals court approved boosting the award \n     against his doctors and the hospital to an astonishing $140 \n     million.\n       But as Joan Butsko's modest award suggests, caps may not be \n     the answer. Insurance costs are up, but it's not clear that \n     juries or the courts are the culprits, or even that the \n     crisis is as dire as it's being portrayed. The statistics \n     don't line up as neatly as doctors and insurers would have \n     them, and left out of the argument is recognition that \n     ordinary market forces may be at work instead.\n       For starters, there's no explosion of cases that might \n     drive up legal costs. The number filed each year has remained \n     fairly steady during the past decade, according to the \n     National Center for State Courts. Further, most malpractice \n     plaintiffs never even see a jury--two thirds of their cases \n     are dropped or dismissed--and when they do, it often isn't a \n     sympathetic one. Only a tiny sliver of cases filed--just 0.9 \n     percent of some 5,500 cases surveyed for 2002--produce jury \n     verdicts for patients claiming injury. And even the size of \n     that small wedge is down by half since 2000, according to the \n     Physicians Insurers Association of America, the trade group \n     for malpractice insurers owned or operated by doctors, which \n     account for about 60 percent of the market.\n       Within that wedge, the number of payments that doctors' \n     insurers make following jury verdicts has held steady in \n     recent years, at around 400 annually, according to a U.S. \n     News review of hundreds of thousands of payments of all kinds \n     reported to the federal National Practitioner Data Bank. \n     These payments total about $143 million each year. \n     Malpractice insurers are required by law to report their \n     payouts to the system.\n       Doctors and insurers say that frequency of claims aside, \n     the prime issue is the size of awards. Indeed, the size of \n     insurer payments stemming from jury verdicts has been \n     increasing in recent years, U.S. News has found; in 2002 it \n     reached a median of $295,000. But, that's far below the \n     median jury award of $1 million the AMA and others often \n     cite. Even assuming two defendants per case--a number \n     insurers say is typical--plus other adjustments, the median \n     payment remains hundreds of thousands of dollars short of the \n     $1 million figure.\n       But it's not clear that verdicts are really the whip behind \n     settlements. Over time, the size of a typical settlement \n     payment has grown somewhat faster than a typical jury verdict \n     payment. And while the sum from jury awards has remained \n     stable over the past decade, the total of payouts from \n     settlements has soared, especially recently, when doctors say \n     the crisis has emerged.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what punitive damages do. They really set the \npace.\n  Dickie Scruggs and Ron Motley, the trial lawyers in the tobacco case, \ndid more to cure people of cancer or prevent people from getting cancer \nthan Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler.\n  I have been in the vanguard since Warren Magnuson had me have cancer \nhearings all the way back in 1967 and 1968. And over the years, we have \ntried everything in the world to stop people from smoking.\n  If my time is up, I ask unanimous consent for 10 additional minutes, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  People talk about those two lawyers and say, ``Look at all the fees \nthey got.'' I say look at all the good they did. Over the many years, \nwe have had the American Cancer Society, we have had fundraisers, we \nhave had cancer institutes, we have had all kinds of research and \neverything else like that, but how do you stop people from smoking? \nWhen they got that 360-some-billion-dollar settlement with the \nGovernment, the Attorney General, the medical community, and everybody \nconcerned, and the State attorneys general, that failed to pass the \nSenate, so it was taken up, and I think it was $232 billion that the \nStates settled for. That money is being paid out. In many States they \nhave programs to teach youngsters to avoid smoking. I go to the heart \nof the Pee Dee in South Carolina where they grow tobacco, and you will \nsee a big sign on the courthouse that says: ``No smoking.''\n  Now, that really got me. Those two lawyers really deserve every dime \nthey get out of the legal fees. They had been bringing cases upon cases \nupon cases, and I think their average victory was some 4 in 100 cases.\n  They just lost another case down in Charleston last year. Of course, \nthere have been ridiculous verdicts, like in Florida, where the \npunitive damages is somewhere around $27 million, but had been $145 \nbillion. Well, that was a six-man jury and a judge who did not know \nwhat they were doing. That was just a seven-man conspiracy. I agree, it \nwas wild and unjustified.\n  My point is, these trial lawyers are really doing a wonderful \nservice. I can go to the class actions, I can go to the asbestos cases. \nThe onslaught has got to be stopped here on this so-called tort reform \nbecause it is totally political. It is totally campaign funds. It is \ntotally the election next year and not the needs of the country.\n  Mr. President, that is what is going on, and colleagues have to wake \nup and realize we have a President who runs off to Africa, who has not \nsettled Afghanistan, who does not know where he is in Iraq. All he \nknows is the election is next year, in November. So there we are. We \nare being put upon with not the needs of the country but, frankly, with \nthe needs of the campaign.\n  I have an article here dated September 7 of last year from the New \nYork Times. I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 7, 2002]\n\n            Insurers Scale Back Corporate Liability Policies\n\n             (By Jonathan D. Glater and Joseph B. Treaster)\n\n       Shellshocked by corporate scandals and fearful of the hefty \n     payments they will have to make to settle shareholder \n     lawsuits, the big commercial insurance companies are cutting \n     back sharply on liability coverage for American corporations, \n     their directors and senior executives.\n       The cutbacks are taking the form of higher deductibles and \n     lower limits on overall coverage. But the insurance companies \n     are also demanding that corporations pay part of any court \n     settlements or jury awards out of their own pockets. As a \n     result, corporations in telecommunications, energy, financial \n     services and pharmaceuticals--where the risk of being sued is \n     thought to be highest--could face payments of up to half of \n     the cost of any settlement.\n       The three leaders in this line of coverage--the American \n     International Group, the Chubb Group and Hartford Financial \n     Services--have already begun requiring some customers to \n     share the expense of settlements.\n       The cutbacks effectively limit the size of policies \n     insurance companies will sell to any one company, said Andrew \n     Marcell, who is in charge of insurance for directors and \n     corporate officers at Guy Carpenter, a New York reinsurance \n     broker and a unit of the Marsh & McLennan Companies.\n       ``Companies that until recently were willing to provide $50 \n     million in coverage are now offering $25 million, and \n     companies that offered $25 million are now providing $10 \n     million to $15 million,'' Mr. Marcell said.\n       Enron had $350 million in this kind of coverage and some \n     corporations had been buying up to $1 billion worth. But now, \n     Mr. Marcell said, ``$250 million in coverage is pretty hard \n     to come by.''\n       The sharing of the burden of settlements may also leave \n     directors' and officers' personal assets exposed, lawyers \n     said.\n       ``This is very bad news for directors and officers,'' said \n     Michael Young, a partner at the law firm of Willkie Farr & \n     Gallagher in New York who often represents directors and \n     officers. ``The insurance industry is sending out the word \n     that for outside directors, insurance that provides 100 \n     percent protection is going to be increasingly difficult to \n     get and companies are going to have to pay through the nose \n     for it.''\n       John Keogh, a unit president of the American International \n     Group, said that some corporations could avoid sharing the \n     costs of lawsuits with insurance companies and get full \n     coverage up to limits of their policies by paying higher \n     premiums. But David H. McElroy, who is in charge of this kind \n     of insurance at Hartford Financial Services, said the \n     riskiest clients could not get full coverage at any price.\n       The insurers say they are merely acting in self-defense as \n     they watch corporate giant after corporate giant collapse as \n     they come under fire for deceptive accounting and management \n     abuses that have drained companies like WorldCom, Global \n     Crossing and Tyco of hundreds of millions in corporate money.\n       As share prices of these companies have plunged, \n     shareholders have turned to lawsuits in an attempt to recover \n     at least some of their losses.\n       Combining the expected costs from some of the latest \n     lawsuits, which are still in their early stages, and scores \n     of others that have been working their way through the courts \n     over the last few years, insurers estimate that they will \n     have to pay out $7.5 billion this year on liability \n     policies for directors and officers--but they collected \n     only $4.5 billion in premiums.\n       ``The expected claims paid out are going to be multiples of \n     the premiums that have been collected,'' said Mr. Keogh of \n     A.I.G. He would not comment on specific numbers. Some \n     insurers said that they expected the actual losses to be \n     lower, but that the industry would still lose money this \n     year. Quietly, several insurers have also begun trying to \n     cancel certain policies, arguing that corporate fraud makes \n     them void--a nightmare for executives.\n       The cutback in liability coverage and increases in premiums \n     are hitting corporations\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\n     hard. Bruce S. Zaccanti, an insurance consultant at Ernst & \n     Young, said a nationwide real estate management company he \n     had been advising paid $3 million for $100 million in \n     coverage last year. This year, the company's premium jumped \n     to $4.5 million for $70 million in coverage. On top of that, \n     he said, the deductible has jumped to $15 million from $5 \n     million.\n       By forcing the companies to share the cost of settlements, \n     the insurers also hope to prod them to fight harder to keep \n     those costs down. When all the costs have been covered, the \n     insurers said, the corporations are often eager to settle \n     quickly--rather than work for a smaller settlement.\n       ``There is no doubt in our minds that insureds' settlement \n     behavior has been less reluctant than maybe it once was when \n     there was an economic alignment,'' said Tony Galban, vice \n     president and manager of directors and officers liability \n     insurance underwriting at Chubb Specialty, a subsidiary of \n     Chubb & Son.\n       In recent years, the average size of settlements in \n     securities lawsuits has increased drastically, rising to $16 \n     million in 2001, according to the Securities Class Action \n     Clearinghouse, an organization at Stanford University that \n     tracks securities litigation. Before 1995, when a law was \n     passed making it tougher to bring securities fraud claims, \n     the average settlement was less than half that amount.\n       The possibility that individual directors and officers \n     could be forced to dip into their own wealth may make it \n     harder to recruit executives to serve on corporate boards, \n     said Brooks Chamberlain, head of the global insurance \n     practice at Korn/Ferry International, an executive search \n     firm. Fearful of personal liability, more and more recruits \n     are conducting their own due diligence on prospective \n     employers, he said.\n       Smaller companies, companies with financial problems, \n     companies in certain industries perceived to have a higher \n     incidence of fraud, and companies with fewer hard assets but \n     sizable market capitalizations will have more trouble, Mr. \n     Chamberlain said.\n       According to Mr. Young of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, \n     directors want some assurance that somebody else will be able \n     to pay any settlement or damage award.\n       ``What if the company goes into bankruptcy? Then who \n     covers?'' he asked rhetorically. ``Or what if the company's \n     just not wealthy enough?\n       The changes have already had the odd effect of leading to \n     the creation of a new type of policy that will protect only \n     independent directors. A.I.G. will sell the policies that \n     cannot be canceled even in the case of management fraud, Mr. \n     Keogh said.\n       But Gregory M. Schmidt, general counsel at the LIN TV \n     Corporation, an owner of television stations in several \n     states, wondered whether companies might choose not to take \n     on the additional cost of these policies and instead promise \n     to cover any settlement costs owed by the directors. ``The \n     question is whether that's going to be satisfactory'' to the \n     directors and officers, he said.\n       LIN's policies are not up for renewal until March, he said, \n     but executives at the company are monitoring changes the \n     insurers are announcing.\n       ``We're worried,'' he added.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We really are in trouble. I have in my own State the \nwidow of a physician who worked at a hospital in Columbia, where her \nhusband died after surgery. They had to sue as a result of his death.\n  How can we, the Congress, solve this problem? Let the doctors \ndiscipline the doctors. They are going to have to do it on the one \nhand. And let's have insurance reform. Yes, the Durbin-Graham approach \nis salutary in that it does away with the fixing of rates. That ought \nto be done away with. But the only way to really get at the problem \nitself is what they did in California with proposition 103 that passed \nin 1988 and that is to regulate the rates themselves.\n  You can get the information only then from the insurance companies, \nand I have tried my best as a member of the Commerce Committee, subject \nto insurance jurisdiction, to try to again and again, year in and year \nout. And the insurance companies won't tell you anything because they \nsay they are State regulated and we have no jurisdiction whatsoever \nover them. If there is one thing that is engaged in interstate \ncommerce, it is insurance.\n  Let's don't just go with terrorism insurance, and just tax credits to \npay the premiums, and patchwork little Band-Aids on this problem. Let's \nget to the real heart of the problem. The insurance companies lost \nmoney. They lost it on Kenny Boy. And now the officers and directors of \nthese corporations are being sued, and the rates have gone up with \nrespect to corporate bad practice. The only way to get at it is \ninsurance reform itself.\n  We are just acting like a dog chasing its tail when we go on about \ntort reform, and the lawyer's fees, and joint and severable liability, \nand product liability. If they are real problems, every State has a \nlegislature and they are subject to that jurisdiction. They can do it. \nBut as far as insurance goes, I have worked with them. I have seen \nthem, after 50 years of governmental service at every level. I had to \nclean up my own insurance department as Governor of South Carolina. I \nknow it intimately.\n  I can tell you that we have an insurance reform bill, and I want to \nwork with my colleagues on this, for this is how to take care of the \nmedical malpractice increase in premiums.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n11, the Patients First Act, of which I am an original cosponsor. \nThroughout my career in public service, health care has been one of my \ntop legislative priorities. We all want access to quality, affordable \nhealth care. And when the quality is not there, when people die or are \ntruly sick due to negligence or other medical error, they should be \ncompensated. But when healthy plaintiffs file meaningless lawsuits to \ncoerce settlements or to shake the money tree to get as much as they \ncan get, there's a snowball effect and all of us pay the price.\n  For the system to work, we must strike a delicate balance between the \nrights of aggrieved parties to bring lawsuits and the rights of society \nto be protected against frivolous lawsuits and outrageous judgments \nthat are disproportionate to compensating the injured and made at the \nexpense of society as a whole.\n  I have been concerned about this issue since my days as Governor of \nOhio. I wish we had the outpouring of support for medical liability \nreform 6 years ago that I see now. In 1996, I essentially had to pull \nteeth in the Ohio Legislature to pass my tort reform bill. I signed it \ninto law in October 1996. Three years later, the Ohio Supreme Court \nruled it unconstitutional, and if that law had withstood the Supreme \nCourt's scrutiny, Ohioans wouldn't be facing the medical access \nproblems they are facing today: doctors leaving their practice, \npatients unable to receive the care they need and costs of health \ninsurance going through the roof.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have continued my work to alleviate \nthe medical liability crisis. To this end, I worked with the American \nTort Reform Association to produce a study that captured the impact of \nthis crisis on Ohio's economy in order to share these findings with my \nconstituents and colleagues. Guess what we found? In Ohio, the \nlitigation crisis costs every Ohioan $636 per year, and every Ohio \nfamily of four $2,544 per year. These are alarming numbers! In these \neconomic times, families can not afford to pay $2,500 for the lawsuit \nabuse of a few individuals.\n  It is not just the individuals but the lawyers who bear some of the \nresponsibility. I recently received my yellow and white pages. Look \nwhat I found on the front and back covers, advertisements for personal \ninjuries. This is the yellow pages of the Cleveland phonebook and the \nwhite pages, advertisements on the front cover and on the back cover. \nOne of them says: Medical malpractice. It talks about wrongful death, \nquadriplegic/paraplegic. They have pictures, birth injuries, nursing \nhome negligence, Erb's palsy, cerebral palsy, heart attacks/late \ntreatment, cancer late diagnosis, emergency room negligence.\n  It goes on to say, ``Our firm will advance expenses for our clients \nin most cases,'' and ``Clients do not have to repay expenses unless \nthere is a successful outcome.'' This kind of stuff is in the yellow \npages and on television every night.\n  When I got out of law school, solicitation was a violation of the \ncanons of professional ethics of lawyers. That has all changed today. I \nthink unfortunately so.\n  Next to the economy and jobs--the most important issue facing our \ncountry today is health care. In fact, it is a major part of what is \nwrong with the economy. We have too many uninsured, employers face \nspiraling costs, and those who have insurance face soaring premiums \nevery year. The impact on\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\nbusinesses is great. It affects their ability to offer health insurance \nto employees. Too many times, they pass on the added costs to their \nemployees, whose family budgets are often already stretched razor thin. \nAnd then there are those who lose their jobs and can't afford COBRA, \nassuming their company is still in business and COBRA is available.\n  This issue is a personal one for me. My daughter-in-law, who is \nexpecting her fourth child, recently learned from her obstetrician that \nafter her delivery, she is no longer going to deliver any more babies. \nHer doctor is in a four-physician group, all of them obstetricians. \nThey have never had any lawsuits against them, yet their insurance \npremiums have skyrocketed from $81,000 three years ago to over $381,000 \ntoday. That's $75,000 per person over a period of 3 years. How can \nphysicians be expected to afford rate hikes like these? And how many \nbabies do they have to deliver in order to pay for medical insurance. \nThink of somebody getting out of medical school that is an OB/GYN and \nbeing told: Before you open the door, you will have to pay a premium of \n$75,000 to $80,000 to practice medicine.\n  This crisis is out of control, and when you listen to the statistics, \nyou will be astounded:\n  From 1994 to 2000, the median award for medical negligence in \nchildbirth cases, $2.05 million, was the highest for all types of \nmedical malpractice cases analyzed.\n  The median medical liability award jumped 43% in one year, from \n$700,000 in 1999 to $1 million in 2000; it has doubled since 1995.\n  Medical liability reform could produce $12.1 billion to $19.5 billion \nin annual savings for the Federal Government and increase the number of \nAmericans with health insurance by up to 3.9 million people.\n  There are some who say the Federal Government doesn't have a dog in \nthe fight. We certainly have, when medical liability reform could \nproduce $12.1 billion to $19.5 billion in annual savings and increase \nthe number of Americans covered by insurance.\n  Seventy-six percent of physicians in Ohio, surveyed by the Ohio State \nMedical Association, said rising professional liability premiums have \nimpacted their willingness to perform high-risk procedures.\n  Over half said they are considering early retirement as a result of \nrising costs.\n  There has also been an immense jump in million-dollar verdicts. In \n1995-97, a little over 36 percent of cases resulted in an award of $1 \nmillion or more. By 1998-99, the rate of million dollar awards reached \n43 percent. By 2000-01, it was at 54 percent, with one quarter of all \nawards exceeding $2.7 million. It is going up like a rocketship.\n  These numbers are shocking, and they continue to grow. We feel this \ncrisis very strongly in Ohio. Medical Liability Monitor ranked Ohio \namong the top five states for premium increases in 2002. OHIC Insurance \nCo., among the largest medical liability insurers in the State, reports \nthat average premiums for Ohio doctors have doubled over the last 3 \nyears. But don't listen only to the statistics. Let's talk about \ndoctors--human beings who have practices and patients:\n  Dr. Perm Jawa, a Cleveland urologist, says that soaring liability \npremiums leave him in perpetual fear of career-ending lawsuits. ``I shy \naway from major cases now. Sometimes you know what the best thing is \nbut you don't want to be doing it because there are potential \ncomplications with it,'' Jawa said. ``You're not as aggressive as you \nshould be.''\n  In Columbus, Dr. David Stockwell has seen coverage for his two-\nphysician OB-GYN practice climb to over $100,000 a year. And he \nexpected his premiums to rise 20 to 25 percent in May.\n  Dr. Robert Norman, a geriatrician in Cuyahoga Falls, saw his annual \nmedical liability premium jump $5,700 to $34,000 last year. He had been \nwarned that it could reach $100,000 this year if he continued treating \npatients in nursing homes. But in May he received an unexpected \nultimatum from his insurer and every other carrier he queried: agree to \nstop seeing nursing home patients or lose liability coverage \naltogether. As a result, 150 of Dr. Norman's patients had to find a new \ndoctor.\n  Dr. Stephen Cochran lost his hospital privileges at Akron General \nMedical Center when his insurer's financial stability rating was \ndowngraded recently. He is seeking another insurer, but meanwhile, he \nsays, ``We receive daily phone calls from the patients: `Why aren't you \nhere? Why aren't you seeing me? I want my doctor.' '' He says. ``It's \nbeen very stressful to a lot of the patients, particularly the \ngeriatric patients . . . This [the malpractice crisis] has probably \nchanged the nature of our practice more than anything that has happened \nin the last 10 to 20 years.''\n  After practicing for 15 years--their entire careers--in Cleveland, \nDr. Christopher Magiera and his wife, surgeon Patricia Galloway, \ndecided to leave Ohio to seek refuge from overwhelming liability \npremiums. Their insurance agent warned them that both would soon be \npaying $100,000 in annual premiums, up from $30,000 this year. Magiera \nand his wife decided to ``get out before the situation became \nhopeless,'' he said. They resettled in Wisconsin. Good for Wisconsin.\n  This is disgraceful. This crisis is forcing doctors to close their \ndoors and greatly affecting patient access to care.\n  I want to commend the physicians' grassroots efforts--they are really \nstarting to get attention for this issue. On May 3, 2003, I spoke in my \nhome State of Ohio at the annual conference of the Ohio State Medical \nAssociation. I also participated in a physicians rally last October in \nColumbus, OH which was sponsored by the Ohio State Medical Association. \nI was impressed with all of the speakers, in particular, Dr. Evangeline \nAndarsio, an OB-GYN from Dayton, who described the changes in the \nprofession and the effect of the litigation cloud:\n\n       The professional liability crisis is creating a barrier to \n     patients' access to good medical care, especially pregnant \n     women. . . . a paradigm shift needs to occur in our society. \n     Our laws must change to begin to reflect this paradigm shift.\n\n  After speaking at this rally, I received a letter from a young \ndoctor, telling me that he was leaving Ohio because he couldn't afford \nhis medical liability insurance premiums. Dr. Cly had received a notice \nfrom his insurance carrier that his premiums would be increased by \n$20,000-30,000. This, plus the $20,000 increase from last year, forced \nhim to make the difficult decision of uprooting his family and his \npractice to another State. Dr. Cly was unable to make the insurance \npremiums and still take care of his student loan obligations and his \nfamily. Even though he has never had a malpractice claim or judgment \nagainst him during his residency training or his private practice \nyears, his rates continued to skyrocket to the point where he could no \nlonger afford them. His move to Fort Wayne, IN, will save him $50,000 \nper year in liability insurance.\n  In his letter to me, which I would like to submit for the record, Dr. \nCly writes:\n\n       I represent young physicians in Ohio. Most young physicians \n     I speak with are all considering relocating to a place where \n     the ability to practice medicine is better and the liability \n     situation is more stable. I do not want to leave. I have \n     developed close relationships with many patients, families, \n     nurses, physicians, and staff here in Dayton, Ohio. I always \n     planned to retire here and raise my children here. It saddens \n     me greatly to have to make this decision. I feel as if I am \n     giving up and ``throwing in the towel'' by leaving, but I \n     believe my decision is the right one for my family.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 16, 2003.\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: Thank you for you listening to the \n     challenges Ohio physicians are facing regarding the medical \n     malpractice insurance premiums. As you may recall, I was the \n     young physician from Dayton, Ohio who spoke with you after \n     your speech to the Ohio State Medical Association May 3, \n     2003, while you were walking to another meeting. I work \n     alongside Dr. Evangeline Andarsio at Miami Valley Hospital.\n       I too, am an obstetrician/gynecologist here in Dayton, \n     Ohio. I have been in Dayton since 1988 when I attended the \n     University of Dayton. I later went to Wright State University \n     School of Medicine in 1992. After graduating from medical \n     school, I did my residency training at Miami Valley Hospital \n     from 1996\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\n     until 2000. I have been in private practice for the past 3 \n     years.\n       In order to attend college and medical school I had to take \n     out educational loans and work during those years. As a \n     result, I have accumulated $150,000 in student loans. With \n     the decreasing reimbursement and increasing medical liability \n     insurance premiums I am not able make much effort in paying \n     off my student loans. In addition, I am married with a set of \n     5 year old boy and girl twins. I haven't been able to afford \n     to save for their future college educations yet, nor have I \n     been able to put away much money in a retirement plan for me \n     and my wife.\n       Unfortunately, the liability insurance rates are being \n     unfairly and significantly increased once again this July by \n     our carrier, OHIC. I am expecting another $20,000-30,000 \n     increase from the $20,000 increase last year. Currently, \n     prior to the July increase, I am paying $55,000 for my \n     insurance premium. It is important to know that I have never \n     had a malpractice claim or judgment during my residency \n     training or private practice years.\n       I no longer afford to stay in Dayton or Ohio to practice \n     medicine. I am leaving the state, in July, 2003, and I will \n     be moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana to practice medicine. I will \n     save approximately $50,000 per year in liability insurance \n     alone. In addition, the managed care penetrations is much \n     less and the reimbursement is better. These factors will \n     allow me to begin eliminating my debt and saving for my \n     family's future.\n       I represent young physicians in Ohio. Most young physicians \n     I speak with are all considering relocating to a place where \n     the ability to practice medicine is better and the liability \n     situation is more stable. I do not want to leave. I have \n     developed close relationships with many patients, families, \n     nurses, physicians, and staff here in Dayton, Ohio. I always \n     planned to retire here and raise my children here. It saddens \n     me greatly to have to make this decision. I feel as if I am \n     giving up and ``throwing in the towel'' by leaving, but I \n     believe my decision is the right one for my family.\n       I am extremely thankful of your willingness to help \n     physicians with this crisis. I am genuinely concerned about \n     the future of medicine for our patients. If these issues \n     aren't corrected soon, many patients will suffer due to the \n     lack of access to care.\n       If I can be of any assistance please contact me. My home \n     phone is 937-376-0705. My cell phone is 937-657-5094. My 24 \n     hr pager is 937-636-3263. My office numbers, until June 27, \n     2003, are listed above. My email is geoffcly@msn.com.\n           Sincere Thanks,\n                                                 Geoffrey Cly, MD.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. For those of my colleagues who think medical liability \nreform is a State issue, I ask them to read this letter and see how the \nmedical liability crisis transcends State lines--particularly my \nfriends from the neighboring State of West Virginia. Our Ohio \nphysicians who practice along the border are feeling the effects of \ntheir proximity to West Virginia and its favorable plaintiff's \nverdicts. They are feeling these effects in their increasing insurance \npremiums.\n  This is a nationwide crisis. And it's not only doctors crossing State \nborders to find better insurance rates--it's patients as well. Citizens \nliving along the thousands of miles of State borders very often obtain \ntheir medical care across that line. Federal action is appropriate and \ncritically necessary. Even more so because this crisis affects Federal \nhealth care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and costs the \nFederal Government billions of dollars every year.\n  In fact, the cost of this crisis to the economy is quite staggering. \nWith over 41 million Americans without health insurance, including an \nestimated 1.25 million Ohioans at some time in 2001, we have to look at \na new system--because this crisis is not only bad for doctors and \npatients, it also affects our competitiveness in the global \nmarketplace. Many of our company's insurance costs have skyrocketed \nbecause of medical lawsuit abuse costs that their competitors just do \nnot have.\n  The Nation's medical schools and students feel the effects of the \nmedical liability crisis. According to the National Resident Matching \nProgram, a private, nonprofit corporation, the number of American \nmedical students applying to general surgery residency programs \ndeclined by 30 percent from 1992 to 2002. If this trend continues, less \nthan 5 percent of medical school graduates will choose a career in \nsurgery by 2005, and only 75 percent of general surgery residency \npositions will be filled by graduates of medical schools in the United \nStates.\n  Thank God we have foreign doctors who have come to the United States \nof America. In Ohio, one out of six doctors is an Asian Indian.\n  And, in its 2003 biennial survey of medical residents in their final \nyear of training, the firm of Merritt, Hawkins & Associates, MHA, \nnoticed a disturbing trend. When asked if they would study medicine or \nselect another field if they had their education to begin again, one \nquarter of all residents surveyed indicated they would select another \nfield--this compared with only 5 percent in 2001. It is sweeping across \nthe country and everybody is getting hit. It is going to have a \ndisastrous effect--it already is--and we have to do something about it. \nWhen asked to identify what factors caused them a significant level of \nconcern, sixty-two percent of residents indicated that malpractice is a \nsignificant area--compared to just 15 percent of residents surveyed 2 \nyears ago.\n  Specific medical specialties feel the crisis more than others. A \nSeptember 25, 2002 report by the American Association of Neurological \nSurgeons, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, and Council of State \nNeurological Societies, entitled ``Neurosurgery in a State of Crisis'' \nfound that professional liability costs among Ohio neurosurgeons have \nskyrocketed since 2000. For a $5 to $7 million coverage policy, in \n2000, a physician would have paid $75,000. By 2002, this number had \njumped to $168,000.\n\n  Not only in Ohio, but across the nation, between 2000 and 2002, the \naverage premium increase was 63 percent. As a result, of those \nneurosurgeons polled: 14 percent said they plan to, or are considering \nmoving; 25 percent said they either plan to, or are considering, \nretiring; 34 percent said they already do, or are considering, \nrestricting their practices.\n  In my hometown of Cleveland, OH, at one of our hospitals, the \nneurosurgeons just left. There was no one there to take care of \nemergency patients, although just recently because of something the \nCleveland Clinic did, they agreed to step in, but there were four \nneurosurgeons serving about 15 hospitals, and they just decided they \nwere getting out. Who is going to pick that up for them? What is going \nto happen to those patients?\n  Patients cannot get emergency medical treatment because fewer \nneurosurgeons are covering ERs, and trauma hospitals are shutting their \ndoors and diverting patients with serious head and spinal cord injuries \nto other locations.\n  Patients cannot find a neurosurgeon close to home because \nneurosurgeons are moving to States where insurance costs are relatively \nstable.\n  Further exacerbating this problem is the high retirement rate. \nAccording to the American Board of Neurological Surgery, in 2001 alone, \nover 300 neurosurgeons retired. This is 10 percent of our Nation's \nneurosurgical workforce. And for the first time in over a decade, there \nare now fewer than 3,000 board certified neurosurgeons practicing in \nthe U.S.\n  Earlier this year, I participated in a press conference with my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, and my \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada, Senator Ensign. During this \nconference, I met a doctor from Florida who had rushed his son to the \nhospital with his head hemorrhaging, only to find that there were no \npediatric neurosurgeons there. He asked if a regular neurosurgeon could \nhelp, but they could not because pediatric neurosurgeons require \nspecial liability insurance. Due to the exorbitant costs of insurance \nfor pediatric neurosurgeons, only seven were practicing in the State of \nFlorida and the nearest one was 150 miles away. Fortunately, the boy \nsurvived, but this type of scenario does not need to happen.\n  I was recently speaking with some doctors in Cleveland who told me \nthat the nephrologists practicing there will not even look at a baby \nfacing kidney problems, because adding pediatric work to their existing \npractices will cause their premiums to skyrocket.\n  The effects of the medical liability crisis can also be felt by the \nobstetrics-gynecologists community. In fact, obstetrics-gynecology is \namong the top three specialties in the cost of professional liability \ninsurance premiums. Nationally, insurance premiums for OB-GYNs have \nincreased dramatically: the median premium increased 167 percent \nbetween 1982 and 1998. The median rate rose 7 percent in 2000, 12.5 \npercent in 2001, and 15.3 percent in 2002 with increases as high as 69 \npercent, according to a survey by Medical Liability Monitor, a \nnewsletter covering the liability insurance industry.\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\n  According to Physicians Insurance Association of America, OB-GYNs \nwere first among 28 specialty groups in the number of claims filed \nagainst them in 2000. OB-GYNs were the highest of all specialty groups \nin the average cost of defending against a claim in 2000, at a cost of \n$34,308. In the 1990s, they were first--along with family physicians-\ngeneral practitioners--in the percentage of claims against them closed \nwith a payout of 36 percent. They were second, after neurologists, in \nthe average claim payment made during that period.\n  Although the number of claims filed against all physicians climbed in \nrecent decades, the phenomenon does not reflect an increased rate of \nmedical negligence.\n  That is something we should point out. It does not reflect an \nincreased rate in negligence.\n  In fact, OB-GYNS win most of the claims filed against them. A 1999 \nAmerican College of Obstetrics and Gynecology survey of its membership \nfound that over one-half of claims against OB-GYNS were dropped by \nplaintiffs' attorneys, dismissed or settled without a payment. Of cases \nthat did proceed, OB-GYNS won seven out of ten times. Enormous \nresources are spent to deal with these claims, only 10 percent of which \nare found to have merit. The costs to defend these claims can be \nstaggering and often mean that physicians invest less in new \ntechnologies that help patients. In 2000, the average cost to defend a \nclaim against an OB-GYN was the highest of all physician specialties: \n$35,000.\n  According to an ACOG survey of its members, the typical OB-GYN is 47 \nyears old, has been in practice for over 15 years, and can expect to be \nsued 2.53 times over his or her career. Over one-fourth of ACOG fellows \nhave even been sued for care provided during their residency. In 1999, \n76.5 percent of ACOG fellows reported they had been sued at least once \nso far in their career. The average claim takes over 4 years to \nresolve.\n  Practicing medicine and having lawsuits hanging over your head, and \nonly 10 percent are well taken, can you imagine, Mr. President, how it \nis to practice medicine under those conditions?\n  How does all of this affect patients' access to care?\n  As premiums increase, women's access to general health care--\nincluding regular screenings for reproductive cancers, high blood \npressure and cholesterol, diabetes, and other serious health risks--\nwill decrease. OB/GYNs are disappearing.\n  It leads to more uninsured women. Last year, 11.7 million women of \nchildbearing age were uninsured. Without medical liability reform, a \ngreater number of women ages 19 to 44 will move into the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  The legislation we are debating today gets us on our way to enacting \nmeaningful medical liability reform.\n  There are going to be a lot of excuses. We are going to hear from \nsome colleagues as to why this is not a good thing, and they are going \nto get into specific caps and so forth.\n  The fact is, this legislation provides a commonsense approach to our \nlitigation problems that will help keep consumers from bearing the cost \nof costly and unnecessary litigation, while making sure those with \nlegitimate grievances have recourse to the courts.\n  That is what we want to do. We want to make sure those who are \nlegitimately harmed have recourse to the courts and are compensated.\n  The bill sets sensible limits on noneconomic damages to help restrain \nmedical liability premium increases, while ensuring unlimited economic \ncompensation for patients injured by negligence.\n  In other words, there is no cap on economic compensation. All of \nthose issues that can be documented, you can be reimbursed for. It \nlimits attorney's fees so the money awarded in the court goes to the \ninjured parties, who are the people who really need it. It mandates \nthat relevant medical experts testify in malpractice trials, as opposed \nto highly paid ``expert witnesses'' who are often used to influence \njuries and foster abuses in the legal system. It also allows physicians \nto pay any large judgments against them over a period of time in order \nto avoid bankruptcy, and requires all parties to participate in \nalternative dispute resolution proceedings, such as mediation or \narbitration, before going to court.\n  It is a sensible way of handling a problem in our country and, at the \nsame time, looking at the societal costs that are being paid today by \nall Americans.\n  Providing this commonsense approach to our medical liability premiums \nis a win-win situation. Patients would not have to give away large \nportions of their judgments to their attorneys, truly injured parties \ncan recover 100 percent of their economic damages, punitive damages are \nreserved for those cases that are truly justified, doctors and \nhospitals will not be held liable for harms they did not cause, and \nphysicians can focus on doing what they do best: practicing medicine \nand providing health care.\n  I end with the words of Dr. Andarsio, whom I quoted earlier:\n\n       Help us to maintain an ability to have a practice that \n     offers patients excellent access to care--to continue one of \n     the most important relationships in our lives--the doctor-\n     patient relationship--thus maintaining individualized and \n     compassionate care.\n\n  In my own particular case--and it may be why I am probably more fired \nup about this than some people in the Senate--when I was about 2 years \nold, I contracted osteomyelitis.\n  It is a disease in the marrow of the bone. There was a lot of \ncontroversy among a couple of doctors on how I should be treated for \nthat osteomyelitis. There was one physician who had the courage to try \nsome new things. His name was Dr. Holloway. Dr. Holloway saved my life. \nI will not ever forget going to his funeral.\n  There are a lot of other people around this country like George \nVoinovich who are in need of access to orthopedic surgeons and other \ntypes of medical care. I want them to have the same opportunity I had, \nto have a life. That is what this is about.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I also understand we are under an \nagreement that we go back and forth. It could be that a Democratic \nspeaker might have been next. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to go ahead and speak since I am in the Chamber and prepared \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have heard colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle extol the virtues of the Weiss report to justify \nopposing limits on noneconomic damages. Some of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle seem to view this report as the end all and be \nall of reports on the effect of damage caps.\n  This Weiss report makes the rather bold and somewhat astonishing \nassertion that States with caps on damages actually have higher \npremiums than States without caps on damages. I never heard of such a \nconclusion. Indeed, it flies in the face of common sense, common \nexperience, and the expertise of actuaries and insurance commissioners.\n  As one can imagine, I was intrigued by this report and wanted to \nlearn more about it. Upon reviewing the report, it reminded me of the \nsaying by Mark Twain, or Will Rogers, who said: There are lies, there \nare damn lies, and then there are statistics.\n  I am wondering how Weiss calculated the median premiums found in his \nreport. No one can seem to figure that out because the report never \nreally explains how the median premium was established.\n  The Weiss report uses data over a decade-long period. We are talking \nabout the cost of something, in this case insurance coverage, over a \nsubstantial amount of time. Inflation is a pretty basic statistical \nvariable for which one should account. Does the Weiss report take \ninflation into account in reaching its conclusion regarding caps? It \nlooks as if the Weiss report knows that to do a proper analysis one \nshould take inflation into account. After all, it does so in analyzing \ninsurance company payoffs.\n\n[[Page S9025]]\n\n  For some inexplicable reason the Weiss report fails to do so in its \nanalysis of the increase in insurance company premiums. There is no \nindication Weiss took inflation into account, despite the fact it does \nso in making a similar calculation for insurance company payoffs in \nother parts of the report. If I didn't know better, I would say such a \nglaring and telling omission was part of an effort to arrive at a \npredetermined conclusion.\n  The publication from which the Weiss report obtained its data is \nsomething called the Medical Liability Monitor. It is one of the best \nsources for medical malpractice premium information. Many legitimate \nreports use the data found in this publication to help explain the \ncrisis. The most recent comprehensive rate survey in the Medical \nLiability Monitor, dated October 2002, had a headline that reads ``2002 \nrate survey finds malpractice premiums are soaring. Hard market wallops \nphysicians. Average rate increase more than double those in 2001.''\n  It seems to me the methods the Weiss report uses are not only wrong \nbut, in fact, misleading. The Weiss report is so seriously flawed, \naccording to the Medical Liability Monitor, the experts who collect the \ndata that Weiss manipulated, actually had to print the following \ndisclaimer in a June 2003 issue to ensure this report was not used to \nmislead the public.\n  Let me read the most salient parts.\n\n       The Weiss ratings analysis of medical malpractice caps \n     cites Medical Liability Monitor as the source of data Weiss \n     uses to calculate average and median premiums for physicians \n     during the last 12 years.\n       While we are an independent news publication and take no \n     position on tort reform or other proposals to improve the \n     medical liability climate, we feel it necessary to comment \n     on the use of our statistics because some readers have \n     expressed concern.\n       The medians and averages in the Weiss report are not the \n     numbers we report in our annual rates surveys. Weiss may have \n     taken our numbers--the amounts and increases of premiums paid \n     by doctors State by State--and used them to arrive at their \n     statistics, but it is impossible from their report to say \n     definitely how our numbers have been used.\n       It is our view that it is impossible to calculate a valid \n     ``average'' premium for physicians or for physicians in a \n     particular State or territory, and we state that clearly in \n     the executive summary of our rate survey.\n\n  But the editor of the Medical Liability Monitor goes further, \nadvising the leaders it is misleading to use median annual premiums \ncompiled from data from the Medical Liability Monitor to demonstrate \nthe effect of noneconomic damage limits on medical liability rates. \nThis is exactly what Weiss does. The report uses median annual premiums \ncompiled with data from the Medical Liability Monitor to try to \ndemonstrate the effect of noneconomic damage limits on liability rates. \nNot only is this wrong, it down right misleads the public.\n  I would be the first to confess I am not an expert on the subject but \naccording to many experts, including the PIAA, it is impossible to \ncalculate a valid and useful median premium using the numbers found in \nthe Medical Liability Monitor for many reasons. One of the obvious \nreasons is a median is not a weighted average. Thus, the Weiss \nmethodology, as far as we can tell, actually inflates the insurance \ncarrier's premium increase by not weighing premiums according to market \nshare. This is critically important because the highest rate probably \nhas the lowest market share.\n  In fact, the Medical Liability Monitor does not report how many \ndoctors have a particular premium, so a helpful weighted average is \nimpossible to calculate based upon that data as the authors of the \nWeiss report will tell you.\n  In short, according to the very experts upon whom the Weiss report \nrelies, the conclusion of the Weiss report on the effective economic \ndamages are wrong, misleading, and should be avoided.\n  I think it is better to look at some legitimate studies. While folks \nshould question the Weiss study, we can generally trust CBO. So let's \nlook at some highlights from CBO.\n  Reading from pertinent parts, States with limits of $250,000 or \n$350,000 on noneconomic damages have an average combined highest \npremium increase of 15 percent compared to 44 percent to States without \ncaps on noneconomic damages. In California, where the State has placed \na cap on noneconomic damages, punitive damages, or rewards for pain and \nsuffering at a quarter of a million, insurance rates have not shown the \nsharp increase experienced in other States.\n  Looking at my next chart which has been used by a number of \nproponents of the underlying legislation, it is very clear that major \ncities in States which have adopted some kind of caps on noneconomic \ndamages are experiencing lower malpractice insurance rates for \nphysicians. California and Colorado, where there are sensible \nrestraints on noneconomic damages, whether you look at a specialty of \ninternal medicine or general surgery or obstetrics, there is a dramatic \ndifference between the rates in California and in Colorado compared to \nStates such as New York, Nevada, Illinois, and Florida where there are \nno such caps.\n  The most dramatic example, I suppose, is in the area of obstetrics \nwhere in California the annual premium is $54,000; in Colorado, \n$30,000; compare these figures to a premium for obstetrics in Florida, \nwhich is $200,000 a year, Illinois is $100,000 a year, Nevada is \n$107,000 a year, and New York is just under $90,000 a year. These are \nactual 2002 premium survey data looking at selected specialties in \nStates where there are caps versus States where there are no caps.\n  I repeat, once again, this legislation does not deny the victim a \nfull recovery for all economic damages, plus on top of that, a quarter \nof a million dollars for pain and suffering, plus on top of that, \npunitive damages at twice the amount of economic damages or a quarter \nof a million, whichever is greater.\n  This is a bill that does provide for victims. In addition to that, it \nprovides some reasonable restraint on lawyer's fees, which of course \nalso benefit the victim because the dollars the lawyers don't get, the \nvictims do.\n  We can have many legitimate arguments. I know my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle seem to be terribly concerned about States' \nrights as it applies to this issue. I think that is certainly a \nreasonable argument to make. But it seems to me it borders on \nnonsensical to argue that caps on noneconomic damages have not had an \nimpact on premiums, because clearly they have. The facts speak for \nthemselves. All you have to do is look at the premiums for these \nspecialists in States where there are caps on noneconomic damages and \ncompare them to premiums in States where there are not. Clearly it \nmakes an enormous difference.\n  Taking a look at California again, their underlying legislation, \nwhich is commonly referred to as MICRA, is the model for the bill which \nwe hope to be able to proceed to. California has had very stable rates \nover the years going back to 1976 when MICRA was adopted, going right \nup to the present. If you look at the rest of the United States, \nCalifornia has had a 182 percent increase in medical malpractice \nliability insurance premiums over this quarter of a century period, but \nif you compare that to the rest of the country, there has been a 573 \npercent increase. Any way you look at it, the California law obviously \nhas had a positive impact on making it possible for physicians to \nafford their liability insurance and therefore continue to offer health \nservices for their people.\n  That takes us back to where I started yesterday. A year ago when the \nunderlying bill was offered as an amendment, or a portion of it was \noffered as an amendment, we had a number of States in crisis. Today we \nhave more States in crisis. Wyoming just yesterday changed from a state \nwith problem signs to a state in crisis. Also, in the year since we \nlast debated this issue, my own State of Kentucky, which was a State \nwith problems a year ago, is now a State in crisis. We have to add both \nstates to the red State list.\n  Connecticut. A year ago Connecticut was a State in trouble. Today, it \nis a State with a genuine crisis. So it will have to be added to the \ncrisis State list today.\n  North Carolina. A year ago North Carolina was a State with problem \nsigns. Today it is a State that is in crisis over this issue.\n  Arkansas. One year ago when we were considering legislation similar \nto this, Arkansas was a State with problems. Today, Arkansas is a State \nin crisis.\n  Missouri. A year ago, Missouri was in trouble. But today it is in \ncrisis.\n\n[[Page S9026]]\n\n  Finally, Illinois would have to be added today as a State in crisis.\n  So let's take a look at the map, where we stand today. As I can count \nthem, there are only six States in America that are currently OK \naccording to the AMA; that is, physicians are not avoiding choosing \ncertain specialties or retiring early or closing their shops over the \ncost of their medical malpractice premiums. We now have 19 red States. \nRed States are States in crisis. I think we had 11 this time a year \nago. Now we are up to 19. Then the rest of America is yellow. That is, \nStates with problem signs. At the rate we are going, many of these \nyellow States will become red States in the coming months if we do not \nact to deal with this truly national problem.\n  I think the argument of States' rights occasionally makes sense, but \nthis is a national issue, affecting health care for all Americans. This \nis really largely about the patients. Some people have described this \nas sort of a titanic struggle with doctors and insurance companies on \none side and lawyers on the other. Frankly, I am not particularly \ninterested in that struggle. I am sure it exists in a number of \ndifferent ways. The real issue is whether or not patients are going to \nbe cared for, whether or not there is going to be a medical \nprofessional within reasonable proximity of patients in order to \ndeliver a service all Americans are entitled to. That is no longer the \ncase in a significant part of our country.\n\n  In my State in eastern Kentucky we have had a number of horrendous \noccurrences as a direct result of medical professionals not being \navailable because they went out of business. They simply could not \nafford to pay their medical malpractice insurance premiums and still be \nin business. So this is a national crisis.\n  Let me just say in closing, we are debating a motion to proceed. \nReasonable people can differ about how to do something about this \ncrisis, but I don't think there are many Senators coming out here, \nsaying this is not a crisis. It is a crisis. Even those who are \nopposing the motion to proceed, I would expect most of them think we \nhave a major problem here. One of the advantages of voting for the \nmotion to proceed is to get us onto the bill so amendments can be \nconsidered. I would not even rule out the possibility that by the time \nwe came to final passage of this legislation, it might look quite \ndifferent. I might not like that, but I am not sure where the votes are \nunless we get onto the bill and have a chance to consider amendments \nand options to deal with this measure about the national health care \ncrisis.\n  Two weeks ago we added a prescription drugs benefit to a reformation \nof Medicare. The House has acted. A conference will unfold in the \ncoming weeks and we will on a bipartisan basis deal with one of the \nmajor health care issues confronting senior citizens, that is how to \nafford prescription drugs and whether or not they are going to have \nchoices under the Medicare program.\n  Now we need to turn our attention to another major health care \ncrisis, and that is the unavailability of health care in major portions \nof the country simply because physicians can no longer afford to pay \ntheir medical liability insurance premiums and still provide health \ncare for patients. That is why we call this the Patients First Act of \n2003.\n  I hope tomorrow, late morning, when we have the vote on cloture on \nthe motion to proceed, that cloture will be invoked, that we will move \non to this legislation, consider the various suggestions that have been \nmade by Senators on both sides of the aisle as to how we ought to deal \nwith this crisis. But let's act. Let's act. Let's make an effort to \ntackle one of America's great health care problems of the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto address the underlying bill for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will not object, but I would like to \namend that to be recognized after the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, rapid increases in the cost of medical \nliability insurance are forcing many physicians to stop performing \nhigh-risk procedures, limiting the kind of patients they will see, \nmoving to another State where the liability climate is more favorable, \nor, simply, they take the option of early retirement. When this occurs, \nwho wins? Who benefits? No one. Everyone loses.\n  Twenty-six States, including my State of Nebraska, have instituted \nsome sort of cap on noneconomic damages. However, some States have had \ntheir caps overturned by the courts and other States are barred by \ntheir State constitutions from enacting a cap. Medical liability and \naccess to quality health care are national problems. Medical liability \nreform is needed to help preserve the ability of health care providers \nto obtain affordable malpractice insurance so we can remain in practice \nand deal with the health care needs of America. At the same time, we \nmust ensure that victims of medical malpractice continue to have access \nto the courts and jury awards.\n\n  This is not an either/or issue. S. 11, the Patients first Act of \n2003, is a responsible solution. It is a balanced approach to \nmaintaining access to quality care while preserving the rights of both \npatients and providers.\n  S. 11 does not cap actual damages. S. 11 caps non-economic damages \nbut defers to current or future state caps. It limits punitive damages \nto two times actual damages, or $250,000, whichever is greater, but \ndoes not preempt existing state caps. It does not preempt State law \nwith respect to compensatory or punitive damages, regardless of the \nlimit.\n  S. 11 limits attorney contingency fees so that awards go to victims, \nnot to trial lawyers.\n  No provisions in the House-passed bill or in S. 11 would limit awards \nfor actual damages.\n  This legislation is important to ensuring access to quality health \ncare for our citizens, and retaining our healthcare workforce.\n  As an example of what providers face and the impact on patients, \nconsider the fact that annual medical liability insurance premiums for \nOB-GYNS range from a low of $12,000 a year in Nebraska, to a high of \n$208,000 in certain areas of Dade and Broward Counties in Florida. \nWomen in rural areas have historically been particularly hard hit by \nthe loss of obstetric providers.\n  Practicing obstetrics is already economically marginal in rural areas \ndue to sparse population, low insurance reimbursement for pregnancy \nservices and growing managed care constraints. An increase in liability \ninsurance rates will force rural physicians to stop delivering babies.\n  This is happening now. With fewer obstetric providers, women's access \nto early prenatal care will be reduced.\n  This is happening now.\n  Greater availability of prenatal care over the last several decades \nhas resulted in this country's lowest infant mortality rates ever.\n  Providers' ability to maintain this standard will be threatened \nbecause the cost of insurance places a major additional strain on our \nmaternal health care system.\n  Dr. Daniel Rosenquist, family practitioner in Columbus, NE who has \nbeen in practice 16 years, has delivered babies across Nebraska. \nHowever, if Nebraska's medical liability cap is overturned, he may have \nto give up that part of his practice. In the months before the cap was \nfinally upheld, Dr. Rosenquist had to tell his patients that he wasn't \nsure if he would be able to continue seeing them.\n  Dr. Rosenquist is not alone. The Harris Interactive for Common Good \nPoll of April 11, 2002 states that 432 percent of physicians said they \nhave considered leaving the medical profession because of changes \nbrought about by the threat of malpractice liability.\n  Because of a liability cap, Nebraska is able to recruit physicians \ninto rural areas by keeping medical malpractice insurance premiums at \nthe fifth lowest in the Nation. It is important to note that even with \na cap in place, medical liability premiums in Nebraska rose 36 percent \nin 2002.\n  Dr. Christopher Kent, one of four neurosurgeons in Lincoln, NE, who \nhas come to view Nebraska as a great place\n\n[[Page S9027]]\n\nto practice medicine, initially came to Nebraska to practice because of \nits reasonable medical liability structure.\n  If Nebraska's cap were to be overturned, he says he would have to \nleave the State, probably within a year. One of his partners would also \nleave Nebraska and another would retire. This is equivalent to losing \n75 percent of the neurosurgeons in Lincoln, and 15 percent of the \nneurosurgeons statewide. Dr. Kent and his colleagues have already begun \nrestricting their practice, and worry that they will have to restrict \ncare further if the cap is overturned.\n  According to a study by the Department of Health and Human Services' \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, States that have enacted \nlimits on non-economic damages in medical lawsuits have about 12 \npercent more physicians per capita than states without such caps.\n  Medical liability reform is about quality of care and access to care.\n  Caps on non-economic damages help keep premiums down, and keep \ndoctors in practice all over our State. S. 11 will provide security to \nStates like Nebraska facing the uncertainty of legal challenges to \nexisting caps, and will result in a faster, fairer, simpler medical \nliability system that protects both patients and doctors.\n  The economic benefits of medical lability reform are substantial.\n  CBO estimates that if legislation such as S. 11 is signed into law, \nMedicare, Medicaid and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Programs \nwould save $14.9 billion in Federal spending over the next 10 years.\n  State and local governments would save about $8.5 billion. State \nspending for Medicaid would decrease by $2.5 billion over that period--\nagain putting that money where we need it the most, where health care \nis most urgent.\n  The Joint Economic Committee in a May, 2003 report, estimates an \nadditional $16.7 billion will be saved over 10 years due to reductions \nin the practice of defensive medicine. According to a July 2002 Health \nand Human Services report, States with reasonable caps on noneconomic \ndamages saw premium increases of 12 to 15 percent in 2002 compared to \n44 percent in States without caps on noneconomic damages.\n  Dr. Daniel Kessler, a professor at the Stanford Business School, and \nDr. Mark McClellan, a former Stanford University economist who is \ncurrently FDA Commissioner, in a February 2000 study, looked at \nspending cuts after tort reform, beyond claim payouts and insurer \nexpenses.\n  They concluded that States adopting direct reforms exhibited \nreductions in hospital expenditures of 5 percent to 9 percent, but this \ndid not result in higher patient mortality rates or an increase in \nserious medical complications.\n  If these savings were generalized to all medical spending, a $50 \nbillion reduction in national health spending could be achieved through \nsuch reforms, in addition to that sense of confidence that would be \nincreased across America because these dollars would be focused in \nareas that need the health care the most--productive uses for $50 \nbillion.\n\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this responsible \nlegislation, S. 11, the Patients First Act of 2003. I urge my \ncolleagues to give it serious consideration and support S. 11.\n  Thank you and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle and on the other side of this issue for coming to the \nfloor because I hope the tone we have set in this debate indicates that \nregardless of which side of the aisle you are on, regardless of which \nside of the bill you are on, we understand that we are facing a \nnational challenge.\n  There is entirely too much medical malpractice in our country today. \nThe best doctors concede that. However, the insurance that is being \ncharged to even good doctors is too unreasonable in many areas, \ndepending on the specialty and where they choose to live. Frankly, \nthere are a lot of people who will suffer if we don't do something \nabout that. Obviously, the doctors themselves who have dedicated their \nlives to the medical profession want to see some solution to this. I do \nas well. But the patients who are served by them are also looking for \nus to do something constructive and positive to make certain that \nquality health care is available across America.\n  I don't personally believe S. 11 is up to that challenge. I am not \neven certain it is a step in the right direction. There has been \nlengthy debate about whether or not putting a limitation on the amount \nthat can be awarded to a person who has been a victim of medical \nmalpractice is going to bring down malpractice insurance premiums.\n  This bill, S. 11, suggests that rather than giving that decision to a \njury--whether it is in Rhode Island or Illinois or Nebraska--that \ndecision on how much an injured patient should receive will be made by \na jury of 100 U.S. Senators. We will pass a bill that says: Regardless \nof what has happened to you, what happens to your family as a result of \nmedical negligence and medical malpractice, you will be unable to \nrecover anything more than $250,000 for your pain and suffering. Oh, \nyes, they will pay the medical bills. And if you have lost wages, those \nwill be paid, too. But when it comes to pain and suffering, regardless \nof whether you are 6 years old, 60, or 96, there will be a limitation \nof $250,000 which can come your way.\n  Now, $250,000 in the abstract sounds like a large sum of money--until \nyou sit down and consider the cases, the actual people who have been \naffected by medical malpractice.\n  In a few moments, I am going to talk about a number of them, some of \nwhom I met for the first time today. When you hear their stories, I \nhope those who are following the debate will step back for a second and \nsay: Wait a minute--as I have--is this right for the Senate, for those \nof us elected from 50 States across the Nation, to decide in each and \nevery case what the maximum recovery will be for medical malpractice \ninjuries? I think the answer is clearly no. That is why I am \nencouraging my colleagues to vote against the cloture motion, which is \na motion which tries to bring this bill before the Senate.\n  What I believe--and others, I think, share this belief--is that we \nhave a national challenge and a problem when it comes to medical \nmalpractice. But it is a problem that will not be resolved until we \ndeal with it responsibly and completely, until we look at all the \nfacets of the problem.\n  This bill says it comes down to one thing: Injured victims of medical \nmalpractice are recovering too much money for their injuries. If we can \nlimit the amount of money they recover, then the system is going to be \nso much better.\n  I think that oversimplifies it. In fact, I think it really is an \nabuse of the situation rather than an effort to rectify it. That is why \nI am opposing it.\n  We had testimony a few weeks ago from the Bush administration, a \ndoctor from the Department of Health and Human Services, saying that \nmedical malpractice in America has reached epidemic proportions--\nepidemic proportions. There are those who estimate that as many as \n100,000 Americans lose their lives each year because of medical \nmalpractice--not because they are destined to die because of God's \nchoice but, rather, because someone has made a very serious and fatal \nmistake in their medical treatment--100,000 a year.\n  We also have studies that have come out from Harvard University that \nsuggest that only 1 out of every 50 cases of medical malpractice ends \nup in a lawyer's office with a claim against a doctor or hospital--1 \nout of 50. So I say to those who support this bill, if you do not look \nat the underlying incidence of medical malpractice in this country, \nsimply limiting the amount that an injured person can recover is no \nguarantee you will not face an avalanche of cases coming at you for \nmedical malpractice. We have to go to the underlying issues in how to \ndeal with it.\n  It is interesting to me, as well, how many elements are being \noverlooked during the course of this debate. All the debate on the \nfloor has been about doctors: States that do not have doctors, \ncommunities that do not have obstetricians to deliver babies, red maps \nbrought before us to show State after State where doctors are facing \nproblems.\n\n  But read this bill. This bill isn't just about doctors. This bill is \nabout protecting HMOs, managed care insurance companies, pharmaceutical \ncompanies, medical device companies, and nursing\n\n[[Page S9028]]\n\nhomes. So in all of this debate about the sad situations many doctors \ndo face in America, no one has come to the floor to justify why, within \nthis bill, there is protection for these special interests: HMOs, \nmanaged care insurance companies, which many times make decisions which \ncan be as lethal and fatal as any decision made by any doctor.\n  I think most Americans know of what I am speaking. When an HMO that \nyou are a part of or a managed care insurance company that your family \nis a part of makes a decision as to whether or not they will pay for a \ndiagnostic test, a laboratory procedure, your hospitalization, or a \nsurgery, when they decide how many days you can stay in the hospital, \nthey are, in fact, dictating medical care in the name of profitability. \nThey want to make more money. They would like to keep you out of the \nhospital as much as possible, reduce your costs as much as possible, \nand they make medical decisions.\n  It is interesting that today a report came out. It is a report that \nwas published by Health Affairs, and those who prepared it are people \nfrom the American Medical Association based in Chicago: Matthew Wynia, \nJonathan VanGeest, Deborah Cummins, and Ira Wilson. This report is \nentitled ``Do Physicians Not Offer Useful Services Because Of Coverage \nRestrictions?''\n  They surveyed doctors across America and asked them the question: How \noften have you decided not to offer a useful service to a patient \nbecause of health plan rules?\n  I have talked to doctors who have told me many times that is \nhappening more often than they would like to admit.\n  Let me show you a chart which tells you what they found in asking \ndoctors across America that question. They were asked this question: \nHow often have you, as a doctor, decided not to offer a useful service \nto a patient because of health plan rules, insurance rules? In this \ncase, ``very often,'' 2 percent; ``often,'' 6 percent; ``sometimes,'' \n23 percent; ``rarely,'' 27 percent. Even if you take the ``very \noften,'' ``often,'' and ``sometimes,'' you have 31 percent of the \ncases. Almost a third of the time doctors are saying they are making \ndecisions not to provide a useful service to a patient because the \nhealth insurance company tells them they will not pay for it and they \ncannot do it.\n  Now, that isn't part of this debate. No one has brought into this \nconversation the question as to whether or not HMOs, in the way they \nare treating doctors, are having some impact on medical malpractice and \ninjuries to patients. No. What we are doing for HMOs is not holding \nthem accountable but, rather, saying we are going to give them even \nmore privileges under law. We are going to insulate them from the \nliability of these bad decisions. So the insurance companies, \nparticularly the HMOs, are running rampant across the Senate when it \ncomes to malpractice instead of being held accountable, as they should \nbe, for their restrictions on good doctors making sound medical \ndecisions.\n  This is another question asked of these doctors in this Health \nAffairs study that came out today: If ``sometimes'' or ``more often'' \nyou decide not to offer a useful service because the insurance company \ntells you you can't, are you doing so more often, less often, or about \nas often as you were 5 years ago? Most of them say unchanged: 55 \npercent. But 35 percent say ``more often.''\n\n  So you have doctors who are increasingly finding insurance companies \nmaking decisions on what you, your mother and father, your wife or \nhusband or child is going to receive in terms of medical care. Is that \nthe answer to this issue, that we are going to say that HMOs will make \nthese decisions, and when they are wrong, and people are injured, and \nthese poor people then turn to a court and ask for some compensation \nfor their injury, they will be limited not only in what they can \nrecover from the doctor or the hospital but even the HMO insurance \ncompany? That is what this bill says. That is what this bill is \ndesigned to do: to insulate from liability even HMO insurance companies \nwhich are responsible for more and more doctors making medical \ndecisions which they believe, based on their training and experience, \nare not the right decisions for their patients. I do not think that is \nfair. I do not think it treats people as they should be treated.\n  Let me mention a couple other items. We have a nursing shortage in \nAmerica. It worries me. I am reaching an age when I am thinking about \nthe day when I want to punch a button at a hospital or some other place \nto call a nurse and hope that someone shows up. But the likelihood that \nis going to occur is diminishing because we have a nursing shortage, \nand it is a serious shortage.\n  As America's population ages, we need more nurses to take care of us \nin convalescent homes and nursing homes and hospitals and other places. \nSadly, those nurses are not as plentiful as they once were.\n  Let me tell you about a report from the Journal of the American \nMedical Association that relates to the issue of malpractice and the \nshortage of nurses. This is a report from October of 2002 from the \nJournal of the American Medical Association. They published the results \nof a study that, for the first time, showed that the number of patients \nwho die in the hospital increases when nurses are assigned to care for \ntoo many patients. An estimated 20,000 people die each year in \nhospitals from medical mistakes attributed to nurses caring for more \npatients than they can handle.\n  This accounts for 20 percent of the nearly 100,000 deaths annually \nfrom medical mistakes. While a link between nurse staffing and quality \nof care seems like common sense, many hospitals downplayed the link \nuntil the study was published.\n  This is a troubling report as well. I read from a book entitled ``The \nWall of Silence,'' written by Rosemary Gibson and Janardan Singh. This \nis a quote from the book:\n\n       Experienced nurses as well as newly-minted nurses are \n     leaving patient care at the bedside at a time when other job \n     opportunities exist. Their knowledge and skills are valued in \n     pharmaceutical companies, managed care organizations and \n     information technology firms. How many are leaving? It is \n     hard to say precisely. The Federal Government's Bureau of \n     Health Professions issued a report showing that about 50,000 \n     fewer nurses were using their licenses in 2000, as compared \n     with 1996.\n\n  As our population ages, as the demand for nurses increases, the \nnumber of nurses in America diminishes. We have seen that when there \nare fewer nurses in a hospital, there is more likelihood of medical \nmistakes, medical malpractice, and medical injuries. Has that even been \nmentioned in the course of this debate? Has anyone talked about the \nHMOs and their impact on medical practice? Has anyone talked about the \nshortage of nurses and the fact that it is leading to more medical \nmistakes, leading to more lawsuits filed against doctors and hospitals. \nInstead what we have had in this debate is a strict debate, limited to \nthe question of how much injured parties can recover once they face \nmedical malpractice, once the injuries have occurred.\n  I would like to introduce in the debate now some real-life stories \nabout people who have been victims of medical malpractice. As I \nmentioned earlier, some of them were kind enough to join Senator \nLindsey Graham and myself earlier this morning when we held a press \nconference and introduced our version of a bill which we think is a \nmore reasonable approach to dealing with the medical malpractice \nchallenge we face in America.\n  The first person is Colin Gourley. Colin is on your left as you view \nthis picture here in the striped shirt. This is his twin brother \nConnor. Nine-year-old Colin Gourley, from the State of Nebraska, \nsuffered a terrible complication at birth as a result of a doctor's \nnegligence. Colin has cerebral palsy. He cannot walk. He could not \nspeak until he was 5 years old. He has irregular brain waves and the \namount of time he has spent in a wheelchair has affected his bone \ngrowth. He has had five different surgeries, and he needs to sleep in a \ncast every night to prevent further orthopedic problems. His twin \nbrother Connor survived birth without any injury.\n  A jury ruled that Colin was a victim of medical negligence. They \ndecided that because of that medical negligence the Gourley family was \nentitled to receive $5.6 million. That was what was needed to \ncompensate him for his medical care and for the lifetime of suffering \nand problems which\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\nhe will face. Last month, the Nebraska Supreme Court upheld a Nebraska \nlaw that severely cut this jury verdict to about one-fourth of the \naward. As a result, Colin will have to rely on the State of Nebraska \nand the Federal Government for assistance for the rest of his life.\n  The jury understood what the case was worth. The jury got to meet \nColin, his brother, his two sisters, and mom and dad. The jury heard \nwhat happened that led to this terrible medical malpractice, and the \njury decided in fairness that he and his family were entitled to $5.6 \nmillion. Yet the law came in and said: I am sorry. We have to limit \nyou--a law similar to the one we are considering in the Senate this \nevening, a law which will say no jury in Nebraska nor Illinois nor \nNorth Carolina is going to make that decision. This decision will be \nmade by a jury of 100 United States Senators, and we will decide, in \nthe case of Colin, that no matter what his life may be, whether it is \n5, 10, 20, 50, or 80 years, the maximum amount we will pay for his pain \nand suffering is $250,000.\n\n  What may have sounded like a large amount of money at the beginning \nof this conversation, as we understand as we consider each and every \ncase, becomes an amount which is hardly adequate to take care of what \nColin is going to face, as well as his family.\n  Let me introduce you now to Kim Jones. This is a picture taken before \nKim's medical malpractice. As you can see, she is a lovely, proud \nmother from King County, WA. She was 30 years old and she remains \nseverely brain damaged and in a comatose state today after undergoing \nroutine tubal ligation surgery following childbirth at the Washington \nState Medical Center. After the operation, the hospital staff failed to \nnotice that Kim had stopped breathing since her vital monitors had been \nimproperly removed. Though successfully resuscitated, Kim suffered \nmultiple seizures and was given seizure control medication that \nactually worsened her condition. She was later taken by helicopter to \nanother medical facility.\n  Today Kim is unable to control her bodily functions. She has no \ndiscernable mental function and is being cared for at a convalescent \ncenter. Kim's father filed a lawsuit against the hospital and the \nanesthesiologist. The case is still pending.\n  Kim is standing there at a better time before the medical injury with \nher daughter. Now she is in a nursing home or convalescent home for the \nrest of her natural life. What is it worth? After the medical bills are \npaid, after her lost income is paid, what is it worth to her, to her \ndaughter, to her parents? According to this bill, we know exactly what \nit is worth. It is worth no more than $250,000 for the pain and \nsuffering she will endure for the rest of her life.\n  Now let me introduce you to a young lady who made quite an impact on \nus this morning. She told her terrible story. This is Sherry Keller \nfrom Conyers, GA. Sherry is shown in her wheelchair. That is where she \nwas today when she came to speak to us. She stood up and said: I am \nfrom Conyers, GA, and I am a registered Republican. I want to make that \nclear.\n  I said: We have Republicans and Democrats and Independents. Then she \ntold her story.\n  Sherry Keller received a complete hysterectomy. Her surgeon relied \nupon staples rather than sutures to hold her incision closed. Upon \nhaving the staples removed, Sherry's incision began to bleed. The \nsurgeon began cleansing the wound. Unfortunately, the incision opened. \nI won't go into the graphic details. But the doctor in that situation--\nthis happened at the doctor's office--apparently panicked and left her \nalone in the room for 35 minutes when the doctor went to call a wound \nspecialist. She left her lying on an examination table. The doctor \ncontinued to see other patients while the specialist was on the way and \nleft Sherry in that examining room for 35 minutes. Sherry went into \nshock from loss of blood, lost consciousness, and fell off the exam \ntable. There was no one with her. Her head hit the counter as she fell. \nShe came to but in the process damaged her spinal cord and rendered her \nan incomplete quadriplegic. She dragged herself out in that condition \ninto the hallway to get the attention of a nurse or doctor to come to \nher aid. The doctor called for an ambulance but gave directions that \nshe should be transported only. She, the doctor, left instructions that \na doctor would go to the emergency room to dress the wound later.\n\n  Sherry was then left in the emergency room for 2\\1/2\\ hours waiting \nfor a doctor to treat her wound. As a result of that fall in the \noffice, Sherry will never walk again. As she was not employed outside \nthe home, she has no lost income for her injury. Her damages were \nvirtually all medical bills and pain and suffering. Here she is, a \nwoman, some 35 years of age, who faces a lifetime in a wheelchair now \nbecause of malpractice.\n  This law we are considering would pay her medical bills but say that \nthe total amount of compensation for her for the pain and suffering she \nand her family will go through is limited to $250,000. Some Senators as \njurors have decided that in her case $250,000 is adequate, thank you.\n  I think a jury has a right to consider that case. A jury has a right \nto consider whether that doctor is guilty of malpractice and whether \nthis woman and her family are entitled to more than $250,000. The fact \nthat she was at home raising her children, because of this bill, will \nbe used against her. She has no job where she earns a paycheck, but she \nhas a real job as far as America is concerned; she was raising her \nfamily.\n  And now look at this situation. This bill will actually penalize her \nfor being a stay-at-home mother with her family. For a Senate that is \nsupposed to be dedicated to family values, it is hard to understand how \nSherry's case tells that story.\n  The next person I would like you to meet is Evelyn Babb of Tyler, TX. \nThis case is similar to many you may have read about. She is a bright, \nhappy-looking person in this picture. She needed arthroscopic surgery \non her right knee for a torn lateral meniscus. Her doctor marked her \nright knee to be operated on with an X. However, the hospital staff \nnegligently prepared her left knee for surgery. Without verifying \nwhether the staff had properly prepared the patient, the doctor \nproceeded to operate on the knee which the staff had prepared. He began \nperforming the partial lateral meniscectomy before he realized he was \noperating on the wrong knee. The staff then prepared the other knee, \nand the doctor performed the operation as previously planned.\n  Due to the unnecessary surgery on the one knee, Mrs. Babb's recovery \nwas considerably longer and more painful than it would have been. She \nhas severe pain and swelling in her left knee and a lingering \ninfection. She continues to suffer from pain, has difficulty walking, \nand has a markedly decreased range of motion in her knee.\n  As an elderly woman of 75, Mrs. Babb will suffer no loss of income, \nhowever, and there will be few, if any, additional medical expenses \nbecause there is nothing that could be done to improve her condition. \nVirtually all of the damages she could recover for this obvious \nmalpractice would relate to the pain and suffering she would endure. \nThis bill has decided how much her case is worth: no more than \n$250,000, period.\n  When you look at that situation, a person who is retired, with no \nactive income, and with limited medical bills, but a serious medical \noutcome, it is an indication of the unfairness of this underlying bill.\n  This case I will tell you about now involves Heather Lewinsky from \nPittsburgh, PA. Seventeen-year-old Heather Lewinsky's face remains \nscarred for life after a Pittsburgh plastic surgeon performed radical \nsurgery to correct a skin disorder near the left corner of her mouth \nwhen she was 8 years old.\n  The doctor claimed to have done this procedure on children many times \nbefore when, in fact, neither he nor any doctor in the United States \nhad ever done the surgery to treat a condition such as Heather's. \nFollowing the operation, Heather was left with horrific facial scarring \nand a terrible stroke-like tugging at the corner of her mouth.\n  The doctor attempted to fix the problem with two additional \nsurgeries, which made it even worse, forcing her to undergo 10 more \noperations with other doctors between the third and tenth grades.\n  The pain, swelling, and recuperation with each procedure were \nexcruciating. Heather and her family filed a lawsuit\n\n[[Page S9030]]\n\nagainst the doctor who only paid a small fraction of the jury verdict \nbecause he had insufficient insurance coverage.\n  This is an indication of a young lady who is scarred for the rest of \nher life. What is permanent disfigurement worth if it is the result of \nmedical malpractice? A point will be reached when no more surgeries \nwill be indicated; they won't add much to her improvement. She may not \nhave lost wages, but she is scarred for life. As far as this bill is \nconcerned, permanent disfigurement because of medical malpractice \nis worth $250,000, not one penny more.\n\n  The last case I want to talk to you about is a case that involves \nAlan Cronin of California. In the year 2000, Alan Cronin, then 42 years \nold, went into the hospital for a routine hernia surgery. Alan was \nmarried with three children at the time--two of them still at home. He \ngoes in for a routine hernia surgery. After the surgery, two doctors \nfailed to diagnose an acute infection following the routine hernia \nrepair. The doctors treated him as though he had the flu rather than \ninspecting the surgery site. He became septic and suffered toxic shock. \nOnce the doctors finally opened the surgery site, the pus and sepsis \nwere so overwhelming that they told Alan's family that he had a 98-\npercent chance of dying. Gangrene had set in and all of Alan's limbs \nwere amputated. When he awoke from his coma, he no longer had arms or \nlegs.\n  Alan was a customer service representative for a medical equipment \nmanufacturer. Workers' compensation paid for all of his medical bills, \nincluding future expenses. He also had a private disability policy that \nwas used as an offset against future economic damages.\n  In speaking with Alan about the cap on noneconomic damages, he says \nthat there are so many things that you don't think of as necessities, \nand $250,000 could not begin to cover those expenses. Alan, 42 years \nold, has had the amputation of his arms and legs from medical \nmalpractice. How much is the suffering and pain that he will endure in \nthe next 30, 40 years of his life worth? We know in the Senate. It is \nworth $250,000 and not one penny more.\n  Incidentally, there is another provision in the bill. Because Alan \nhad the foresight to work for a company that provided him with health \ninsurance that covered some of his medical bills after the medical \nmalpractice, and because he also had a private disability policy that \nwill help him with some of his expenses as he tries to struggle through \nrehabilitation and rebuilding his life, that information, according to \nthe bill, should be brought up in the trial. As a former trial lawyer, \nI can tell you it is being brought out so as to encourage the jury to \ndiminish any award they are going to give to Alan Cronin. Because he \nhad the foresight to pay for health insurance and a private disability \npolicy, he would be penalized in a court of law by the disclosure of \nthis insurance and this disability policy.\n  That isn't done today in any court in America, but it would be done \nunder this bill. S. 11 has decided that is a fair way to deal with \nmedical malpractice. I think most Americans would disagree. What they \nbelieve is, if you put a cap or limit on the recovery of a person who \nis a victim of medical malpractice, the malpractice insurance premiums \nmay come down. They hope if they come down, the threat to the lifestyle \nand future careers of doctors is going to be diminished. Yet when you \nlook at the studies--the Weiss study, for example--you find the \nopposite is true.\n  States with limitations on what can be recovered in court had a \nhigher percentage increase in malpractice premiums between 1991 to 2001 \nthan States without caps. So not only is this proposal in S. 11 \nfundamentally unfair, it is totally ineffective. What we are doing is \nseeing, frankly, this battle between the White House and the people who \nare gearing up for some Presidential campaign and the American trial \nlawyers. That is what this is about. It is not about malpractice \npremiums, bringing them down. It is not about the incidence of \nmalpractice and reducing it. Frankly, it is about a political battle \nwhich should be secondary to the more important issues before us.\n\n  S. 11, as it has been brought to us today, is a bill against which I \nhave led the fight. I am sorry I have to do it in one respect, but I am \nproud to do it in another. I am sorry because this should not be the \nbill we are considering. We ought to be coming before the American \npeople with a bill that addresses this problem in its entirety and in a \nfair way. We ought to bring into this conversation medical providers \nacross America. We should sit down and have an honest and open \nconversation about how to reduce medical injuries and medical errors. \nThat would be good for everyone. I am sure doctors could tell us ways \nto do that.\n  Let me give you an example of what we have tried to do in the past. \nWe decided at one point that we would create a national registry to try \nto find out how often we have these incidents of problems. With that \nnational data bank, we would say to hospitals that before you hire a \ndoctor on your staff, you can check to see whether he has had his \nlicense suspended or has been sued successfully for malpractice. In the \n1980s, we established that--my colleague, Ron Wyden from Oregon, was \nthen a Congressman who proposed the legislation. He thought if this \ndata bank were present, we could find the limited number of doctors who \nare most responsible for malpractice and make certain that they either \nchange their ways or get out of the practice of medicine. It was \ncertainly a good idea.\n  Sadly, there haven't been many people who have used it. Consider this \nfact:\n\n       The data bank is an effective information tool only if \n     hospitals and other health organizations actually report \n     adverse actions involving a health care professional. Federal \n     law requires this information to be reported. But hospitals \n     are not complying. Since the data bank was established, more \n     than 60 percent of hospitals have never reported any adverse \n     action [against a doctor that occurred on the premises.] It \n     was expected that hospitals would report more than 1,000 \n     disciplinary actions every month, yet fewer than 1,000 are \n     reported in a year.\n\n  Managed care organizations, which are protected by this bill from \nliability--the HMOs and managed care organizations which, again, \nreceive preferred treatment by the Senate under this bill--are not \ndoing much better.\n\n       From September 1, 1990, to September 30, 1999, [the managed \n     care organizations in America] reported only 715 adverse \n     events to the data bank. Eighty-four percent of them have \n     never reported any adverse action. The investigative arm of \n     the Federal Department of Health and Human Services, the \n     Office of the Inspector General, notes that ``with close to \n     100 million individuals enrolled in [managed care \n     organizations and HMOs] and hundreds of thousands of \n     physicians and dentists associated with them, fewer than a \n     thousand adverse action reports over nearly a decade of \n     service, for all practical purposes, are reported.\n\n  So the efforts we put in place to track medical malpractice, to try \nto weed out the bad actors, to try to take the doctors away who perform \nsome of these acts of malpractice have been in vain.\n  Hospitals, HMOs, managed care organizations, have refused to report \nthe bad actors. Yet our answer on how to deal with that situation is S. \n11. We are going to limit the amount of money victims can recover. Is \nthis totally upside down?\n  Should we not start with the premise that we want to limit the amount \nof malpractice itself and medical error in America and then follow \nthrough to the next and obvious question: When doctors are going to buy \ninsurance, how can we help them secure reasonably priced malpractice \ninsurance policies? That, of course, would mean bringing in the \nmalpractice insurance companies and reinsurance companies.\n  Incidentally, there is one thing I said yesterday that we are going \nto look into. It was my understanding from reports we received that \nthere were five reinsurance companies available to U.S. insurers. A \ncall today to the Illinois State Medical Society said they work with 9 \nor 10. I want to make sure the record is corrected and reflects the \nfact that at least we are trying to come to the right number of \nreinsurance companies. Regardless of whether it is 5 or 50, the \nreinsurance companies have to be part of this conversation as to how we \nare going to reduce the cost of malpractice insurance for doctors and \nhospitals across America.\n  The third point, and equally important, and I speak to this one as a\n\n[[Page S9031]]\n\nformer trial lawyer myself, is that the legal profession has to be part \nof this conversation. We have to say those lawyers who would consider \nfiling a frivolous lawsuit are going to face severe penalties. They \nwill have to pay compensation of cost and fees associated with those \ncases, and if, in fact, they are found to have done it repeatedly, we \ncan prohibit them from that field of practice completely.\n  I add, based on my personal experience, it would take an absolute \nfool as a lawyer to entertain a medical malpractice case that really \ndid not have a chance of success and that could be considered \nfrivolous. Those cases in my State of Illinois are extremely expensive. \nYou start with a certification by a doctor that you actually have a \njustifiable cause of action before you file your complaint. An \nimportant consideration in taking these cases up is whether or not you \ncan move them forward to recover for the plaintiff who is injured. If \nyou do not think you have a chance, you have to tell that sad news to \nthe client who sits in your office, and I have done that.\n  Frankly, you have to honestly tell many people who are seriously \ninjured: I do not think you have a case on which you can recover.\n  We have to bring together, if we are serious about medical \nmalpractice, the doctors who can speak for their profession, nurses who \ncan help us understand how we can bring more medical professionals to \nthe job to reduce the likelihood of medical injuries, HMO insurance \ncompanies that have to be told they can no longer dictate sound medical \npractice, where doctors are told what they have to do regardless of \nwhether they think it is right professionally. We have to bring in the \ninsurance companies to make certain the rates they charge are \nreasonable, and lawyers have to be brought in as well so they are \ninvolved in responsible conduct which is focused more than anything \nelse on recovery for the patient or claimant involved. That is what \nthis is about.\n  The idea that by limiting recovery for the victims we have talked \nabout here is going to solve the problem just will not work.\n  Let me use this chart as an illustration as well. Here are two States \nin the Midwest: One I am very familiar with, my State of Illinois, and \na neighboring State, Michigan. They are comparable States in makeup of \nthe population in rural areas and urban areas. They are big States by \nmost standards.\n  Michigan has caps and limitations on how much a person can recover in \ncourt. Illinois does not. Here we take a look at the professional \nliability insurance that is being paid in these two States as of \nOctober of last year. We will see in the State of Michigan, OB/GYNs on \naverage are paying more than in the State of Illinois that does not \nhave caps. With surgery, it is the same story. With internal medicine, \nit is the same story. Michigan, with caps, has higher medical \nmalpractice insurance rates than the State of Illinois without caps.\n  The belief that in passing this bill and establishing caps across \nAmerica we are going to bring down malpractice insurance premiums I do \nnot think is a reasonable conclusion, which is borne by the evidence \npresented here, and this comes from an analysis of the medical \nliability monitor data, the same monitor data used by both sides of the \ndebate.\n  I understand the Senator from Utah is here and would like to speak. I \nclose at this point by saying what I said at the outset, and I repeat \ntoday, I value very much the medical profession. They have meant so \nmuch to me and my family. I have entrusted the care of my greatest \ntreasures on Earth--my wife and children--to great doctors, and I thank \nGod they were there when we needed them.\n  I want them to continue in practice. I want them to feel good about \nwhat they do for a living. I do not want them looking over the \nshoulders at lawyers who are filing frivolous lawsuits. I do not want \nthem facing 35-percent increases in malpractice premiums they cannot \ncope with, that they cannot pass on to patients, that force them to \nmake decisions that, frankly, are not in the best interest of good \nmedicine.\n  Today, during the course of our press conference with these victims \nof medical malpractice, one of the staff in the back of the room \nfainted. When he fainted, we stopped everything and somebody said: Call \na doctor. How many times have we heard that said? We say it because we \nall know in those dire emergency situations and in everyday situations, \nwe need the medical profession.\n  I said at the outset of this debate, and I repeat, I stand ready to \nsit down with anyone in good faith who wants to deal with the medical \nmalpractice crisis facing America. Let us deal with this in its \nentirety and in an honest fashion. Let us ask everyone to make a \nsacrifice--the doctors, the lawyers, and the insurance companies--and \nthen I think we can come up with a bill that is worthy of the Senate.\n  For us to deliberately limit the amount of money available to these \nvictims with tragic stories, which I have brought to the Senate today, \nis fundamentally unfair. It is as unfair to those victims as those \nmalpractice premiums are unfair to many of the doctors who are paying \nthem today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to speak about the medical \nliability and medical crisis threatening our great Nation. Over the \nyears, I have pressed for legislation to protect our health care \ndelivery system from the ravages of an out-of-control medical liability \nsystem.\n  Many times we have come close to enacting legislation, and a giant \nopportunity stands before us today. I hope we do not let it slip \nthrough our fingers once more.\n  I remember as a young lawyer in the early days of my practice in \nPittsburgh, PA, the law basically was, if you met the standard of \npractice in the community, there was no case because everybody knew \nthat medical science is not an exact science. Once they adopted the \ndoctrine of informed consent in its various forms, it meant that every \ncase goes to the jury, regardless; every case that has a bad result, \neven though the doctor did everything in his or her power to effectuate \na decent result. And we have had this medical liability catastrophe \nupon our hands ever since.\n  I can remember as a defense lawyer, my advice to some doctors was \nthat they needed to do everything they possibly could to make sure \nthere was absolutely no way they overlooked anything with regard to any \nperson's complaint. If a person came in to them with a common cold, \nthey could no longer say: Take two aspirin every 6 hours, drink all the \nliquids you can, and in 7 days you will be better. Or: Don't do \nanything and in 7 days you will be better. No, they have to give \nvascular and respiratory examinations, blood tests, et cetera. As a \nresult, what used to be a $5 bill in those days, or at most $15 or $20, \nis far more today. Of course, I believe unnecessary defensive medicine \nsuch as that has driven our country to its knees from a medical \nliability standpoint.\n  Today, defensive medicine increases health care costs by $60 to $108 \nbillion per year according to the Department of Health and Human \nServices report of last year.\n  As I have noted previously, out-of-control medical liability \nlitigation is needlessly increasing the cost and decreasing the quality \nof health care for every American. It is preventing patients from \naccessing high-quality health care or, in some cases, any care at all \nbecause doctors are being driven out of practice.\n  I was pleased that President Bush announced his desire to address \nmedical liability legislation reform last summer when he spoke of the \nneed for reform in his State of the Union Address and when he called on \nus to pass meaningful medical liability reform legislation in this \nCongress. I am pleased that our majority leader, Dr. Frist, has brought \nthe Patients First Act forward to be debated today.\n  Our colleagues, Senator Ensign from Nevada, who introduced this bill, \nand Senator McConnell from Kentucky, deserve special recognition and \nthanks for their work on this bill as well.\n  Of course, this was not the first time we have addressed this issue. \nAs many of us will recall, we passed medical litigation relief language \nwith the Commonsense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act in 1995. \nUnfortunately, it was stripped from that bill in conference.\n\n[[Page S9032]]\n\n  I am sorely disappointed that in the ensuing 8 years we have not \naddressed this problem. As a result, the problem has continued to \nfester like an infection that will not heal. Worse yet, this infection \nis spreading to all parts of our country.\n  This map which has been utilized throughout this debate, and I think \nproperly so, with data supplied by the American Medical Association, \nshows the States that currently are experiencing a medical liability \ncrisis and those that are showing signs of a developing crisis. The 19 \nred States are crisis States. Nineteen of the 50 States are crisis \nStates. The 26 yellow States are showing problem signs. Only 5 States \nare currently OK. The red ones are in crisis. The yellow ones are about \nto be in crisis. The white States are currently OK generally because \nthey have passed medical liability litigation reform legislation like \nS. 11.\n  To contrast this for my colleagues, I must note that on a map with \nlast year's data, only 12 States were in crisis. In March, it was up to \n18. Now it is 19. The problem is growing and it reaches from coast to \ncoast.\n  There are very unfortunate consequences to this crisis--doctors \nforced to quit practicing, trauma centers closing, babies being born by \nthe roadside, and, yes, people dying. These are all due to out-of-\ncontrol litigation and soaring medical liability insurance premiums.\n  The crisis is particularly acute in the farming and ranching \ncommunities of rural America where obstetricians and family \npractitioners, some of whom have been delivering babies for 25 years, \nare quitting their obstetrical practice. As a result, there is an \nincreased shortage of obstetricians in the rural west, including in my \nhome State of Utah.\n  Studies by both the Utah Medical Association and the Utah chapter of \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists underscore the \nproblem. According to the Utah Medical Association:\n\n       50.5 percent of family practitioners in Utah have already \n     given up obstetrical services or never practiced obstetrics. \n     Of the remaining 49.5 percent who still deliver babies, 32.7 \n     percent say they plan to stop providing OB services within \n     the next decade. Most plan to stop within the next five \n     years.\n\n  The Utah study examined the causes of the crisis also:\n\n       Professional liability concerns were given as the chief \n     contributing factor in the decision to discontinue \n     obstetrical services. Such concerns include the cost of \n     liability insurance premiums, the hassles and costs involved \n     in defending against obstetrical lawsuits and a general fear \n     of being sued in today's litigious environment.\n\n  Although many blame out-of-control litigation, others believe that \nthe downturn in the economy caused the crisis. In an attempt to \nidentify the cause, in February Senator Gregg and I held a joint \nhearing of the HELP and Judiciary Committees. We heard from a lawyer \nwho believes the downturn in the economy and problems with State \ninsurance regulations are responsible. But, in addition, we heard from \nthe Texas State insurance commissioner and from the president of \nPhysician Insurance Association of America, representing provider-owned \nor operated insurance companies that provide insurance for the majority \nof American doctors.\n  One reason they do is not because the insurance companies are so \nawful. It is because the insurance companies will not handle this type \nof coverage any more. The reason they will not is because of the \nexposures they are facing. So they have turned now to provider-owner \nand operated insurance companies.\n  These gentlemen face this crisis and its consequences every day. \nTheir data and their studies, as well as those from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, show that increasingly frequent frivolous \nlawsuits and skyrocketing awards are responsible for rapidly rising \npremiums.\n  Have the recent downturns in the economy and the stock market \naffected medical liability premiums? Possibly. But this does not appear \nto be a major cause of the current crisis.\n  Look at this chart. This is a chart showing how insurance companies \nthat offer medical liability coverage allocate their assets. As this \nchart shows, between 1997 and the year 2001, insurance companies \ninvested conservatively, primarily in bonds--that is corporate in red, \nGovernment in green, which is the middle line, and municipal bonds in \npurple. A minority of funds, only about 10 percent, happens to be \ninvested in equities, which is shown in the yellow.\n  This conservative investment strategy minimizes the effect that \nchanges in the stock market have on insurance premiums. In fact, there \nis good evidence that increasing medical liability awards are \nresponsible for increasing premium costs.\n  This pie chart with data from the Physicians Insurance Association of \nAmerica shows the outcome of medical liability cases. The area in the \norange, almost 68 percent of the pie, represents medical liability \ncases that were dropped or dismissed. In other words, a vast majority \nof cases are frivolous to begin with. In those cases, the plaintiff \nreceived no award because no harm was found. Yet these frivolous \nlawsuits cost money, an average of at least $25,000 per case, and those \ncosts increase the costs of medical liability insurance.\n  This next chart shows the growth in median--that is the blue line and \nthe average in red--medical liability claim payments between 1989 and \nthe year 2001. Prior to 1995, median and average claim payments \nincreased readily, as we can see. But the rate of growth for both \nincreased dramatically after 1995.\n\n  Finally, this next chart shows the growth in million dollar ``mega \nverdicts'' claim payments equal to or greater than $1 million between \n1985 and 2001.\n  In 1985, less than 1 percent of all awards exceeded $1 million. In \n2001, over 8 percent of awards were $1 million or higher. The data is \nvery clear. A high percentage of medical liability claims are \nfrivolous. Average and median claim payments are increasing rapidly and \nthe percentage of mega awards, those greater than $1 million, increased \ndramatically as shown on this particular chart.\n  It seems clear to me that out-of-control medical liability litigation \nis driving the increase in premiums, not the economy and not a problem \nwith the insurance industry which some would try to make it. It is not \njust the doctors but all Americans who are paying the price. This is a \nnational problem and one that requires a national solution.\n  In my letter of March 12 to Budget Committee Chairman Nickles and \nRanking Democrat Conrad, I emphasized the important implications of \nmedical liability litigation on the Federal budget. In that letter, I \nwrote:\n\n       The Federal Government pays directly for health care for \n     members of the armed forces, veterans, and patients served in \n     the Indian Health Service. The Federal Government provides \n     reimbursement for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \n     According to the Department of Health and Human Services' \n     March 3, 2003, report . . . the Federal Government spends \n     $33.7 billion-$56.2 billion per year for malpractice coverage \n     and the costs of defensive medicine.\n\n  That is $33.7 billion to $56.2 billion a year just for malpractice \ncoverage in these areas of Federal Government medicine.\n  That report states:\n\n       reasonable limits on noneconomic damages would reduce the \n     amount of taxpayers' money the Federal Government spends by \n     $28.1 billion to $50.6 billion per year.\n\n  Now I continued to write:\n\n       In my view, Federal legislation that would decrease costly \n     frivolous medical liability lawsuits and limit awards for \n     noneconomic damages is necessary, not only to ensure patient \n     access to health care, but to curb increasing Federal health \n     care costs. Because of the substantial and important \n     budgetary implications, particularly to the Medicare and \n     Medicaid Programs, we request that the budget resolution \n     include language calling for medical liability legislation \n     reform.\n\n  I am pleased to report the budget resolution we passed in the Senate \nrecognized the tremendous impact of medical liability costs. The budget \nresolution included $11.3 billion in savings over 10 years as a result \nof medical liability reform based on CBO calculation. The Medicare \nProgram alone would save $7.9 billion while Medicaid would save $2.9 \nbillion. The remaining savings would occur in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program and the Department of Defense.\n  What if we had that money to help with the poor? It would certainly \ndo a lot of good, more good than is being done by spending it on \nmedical liability.\n\n[[Page S9033]]\n\n  But it is not only the Federal Government that is affected. Medical \nliability litigation directly and dramatically increases health care \ncosts for all Americans.\n  What is more, skyrocketing medical litigation costs increase health \ncare costs indirectly by changing the way doctors practice medicine. In \nan effort to avoid frivolous suits, doctors often feel compelled to \nperform diagnostic tests that are costly and unnecessary. This \ndefensive medicine is wasteful. Unfortunately, for doctors, it has \nbecome a necessity.\n  I hate to admit it, but I am partly responsible for that myself \nbecause, knowing that many doctors are going to be sued unnecessarily \nand improperly, I advised them to do what they can to protect \nthemselves. Consequently, this defensive medicine is leading to a lot \nof unnecessary defensive medicine. And they have to do it or they face \nunnecessary litigation.\n  According to a recent Harris poll, fear of being sued has led 79 \npercent of doctors to order more tests than are medically needed; 74 \npercent refer patients to specialists more often than necessary; 51 \npercent recommend invasive procedures that they thought were \nunnecessary; 41 percent prescribe more medications, including \nantibiotics, that they did not think were necessary.\n  Defensive medicine increases health care costs. But the real problem \ninherent in the current medical liability system and the resulting \nprocess of defensive medicine is that it also puts Americans at risk. \nEvery test and every treatment poses a risk to the patient. Every \nunnecessary test, procedure, potentially puts a patient in harm's way.\n  According to the Harris poll, 76 percent of the physicians are \nconcerned that malpractice litigation has hurt their ability to provide \nquality care for their patients.\n  That brings us to the main question. What can we do to address this \ncrisis today? The answer is, plenty. There are excellent examples of \nwhat works. The March 2003 Department of Health and Human Services \nreport describes how reasonable reforms in some States have reduced \nhealth care costs and improved access to, and the quality of, care. \nAccording to this report, over the last 2 years the States with limits \nof $250,000 or $300,000 on noneconomic damages premiums have increased \nan average of 18 percent compared to 45 percent in States without such \nlimits.\n  In 1975, California enacted the Medical Injury Compensation Reform \nAct, MICRA. Again, I will refer to this chart. This graph shows that \nMICRA slowed the rate of increase in medical liability premiums \ndramatically, and it did so without affecting negatively the quality of \nhealth care received by the State's residents.\n\n  The red on the chart is States that have gone up 573 percent from \n1976 to the year 2000. In California they have increased by only 182 \npercent. As a result of MICRA, California has saved billions of dollars \nin health care costs, and Federal taxpayers have saved billions of \ndollars in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.\n  The March 2003 report goes on to state:\n\n       A leading study estimates that reasonable limits on non-\n     economic damages such as California has had in effect for 25 \n     years, can reduce health care costs by 5-9% without \n     ``substantial effects on mortality or medical \n     complications.'' With national health care expenditures \n     currently estimated to be $1.4 trillion if this reform were \n     adopted nationally, it would save $70-$126 billion in health \n     care costs per year.\n\n  Now, in our joint HELP and Judiciary Committee hearings in February, \nwe heard from those who believe insurance reform is a cure for this \ncrisis. These individuals believe the Federal Government rather than \nthe States should regulate insurance. Those who advocate Federal \ninsurance regulation apparently believe the States and the State \ninsurance commissioners are not able to accomplish this alone. They \nsuggest that insurance companies are colluding to increase premiums. In \nall honesty, some of them are getting out of the business because of \nthe risks and exposure they face.\n  There has been little, if any, evidence during or after our hearing \nto support these allegations. In fact, we heard that the State \ninsurance commissioners monitor and regulate insurance business \npractices very closely. The State laws are based on the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners model rating laws that include \nthe following language:\n\n       No insurer or advisory organization shall attempt to \n     monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to \n     monopolize an insurance market or engage in a boycott . . . \n     of an insurance market.\n\n  And:\n\n       No insurer . . . shall make any arrangements with any other \n     insurer . . . which has the purpose or effect of unreasonably \n     restraining trade or lessening competition in the business of \n     insurance.\n\n  Moreover, insurance companies are precluded from increasing premiums \nto make up for past losses. It seems to me insurance reforms that some \nhave proposed not only miss the mark badly, they would do nothing to \naddress the cause of the crisis and would prevent State insurance \ncommissioners from performing their jobs.\n  I have to say I came away from the hearing convinced, and I remain \nconvinced, that out-of-control medical litigation is the major cause of \nthe crisis and we have to do something to stop it. The current medical \nlitigation system represents and resembles a lottery more than a \njustice system. This system harms patients in many ways. All Americans \ndeserve the access to care, the cost savings, and the legal protections \nthat States such as California provide their residents. This problem \nhas reached crisis proportions, and it is high time we end it.\n  The task before us is to design a system that protects both the \npatient and the provider. S. 11, the Patient First Act of 2003, which I \nam proud to cosponsor, includes provisions that have been shown to work \nthat are fair to all concerned. So S. 11 would encourage speedy \nresolution of claims by providing a reasonable statute of limitations. \nThe bill provides for unlimited awards for economic damages, and it \nlimits awards for noneconomic damages to $250,000.\n  Moreover, S. 11 does not preempt State limits on awards for damages, \nnoneconomic or otherwise, even if the State limits are higher than \nthose imposed by S. 11. The Patient First Act limits attorney's fees, \nthereby reducing the costs of medical liability litigation and \nchanneling award money to where it belongs, the injured patient.\n  Normally I am against that, limiting the attorney fees, but in this \nparticular case we have to do something. Women are going to be without \nobstetricians. Many people are going to be without surgeons and many \nwill be without specialists. Young people are not going to go into the \nprofession. Young outstanding geniuses who would make great doctors do \nnot want to go into the profession.\n  In addition, S. 11 provides for evidence of collateral source \npayments to be introduced in any health care lawsuit. Juries would be \nmade aware of existing health insurance or other sources that \ncompensate individuals for injuries. No longer would Americans \ncompensate an individual twice for the same injury.\n  While there is much to commend S. 11, one provision we should \nconsider adding is the carefully crafted catastrophic exception to the \nlimit on awards for noneconomic damages. A carefully worded \ncatastrophic exception can provide that individuals who have \nparticularly severe injuries as a result of extremely egregious acts of \nnegligence receive an award for noneconomic damages that would be \ngreater than the limit. Nine States have included such a provision in \ntheir statutes.\n  Having said that, I must say that S. 11 is a very good bill and I \nbelieve that it will accomplish our primary goal of ensuring that \nAmericans have access to health care.\n  What I like most about the ``Patients First Act'' is that it is true \nto its name.\n  The bill puts the patient first.\n  Not the doctor.\n  Certainly not the lawyer.\n  You see, it is the patient who is threatened the most by the medical \nliability litigation crisis.\n  It is the patient who eventually pays for the increased health care \ncosts and it is the patient that suffers most when he or she cannot \naccess needed care.\n  The medical liability litigation crisis threatens the economic health \nof our country and the personal health of every American. It is like a \nfestering\n\n[[Page S9034]]\n\nwound, spreading like an infection throughout the country. It is time \nthat we cured this infection by treating it with a proven remedy. S. \n11, the Patients First Act of 2003 is the proven remedy Americans need \nand deserve. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very \nimportant legislation.\n  Madam President, I began these remarks by stating that, as someone \nwho had experience in this field, I have witnessed an unfortunate \ntransition; a transition from the days when the standard of practice in \nthe community was the rule in most communities, which seemed to me to \nbe a fair rule, to a rule of the doctrine of informed consent, which \nmeans the doctor has to so inform the patient that the patient knows \nall of the risks involved. Well, the patient would have to go to \nmedical school to know all of the risks and it would take so much of \nthe doctor's time to advise a patient of those risks that none of us \ncould afford it.\n  There are always risks in surgery and there are always risks in a \nnumber of clinical procedures. Consequently, because no doctor can ever \nreally meet those standards, every one of those cases go to trial. In \nthis country, jurors don't realize by giving outrageous awards that are \nnot justified in these medical liability cases, they are basically \nspreading that cost to everybody in society.\n  If we do not act, babies will not be delivered with the utmost care \nin the future. Americans will not have access to trauma care. Americans \nwill not have access to the top surgeons.\n  And if we do not act, unnecessary and costly defensive medicine will \ncontinue. I have to say, I have witnessed the increased use of costly \nCAT scans and MRIs in cases where patients could very easily have been \ntreated at a very low cost in comparison. You can go right on down the \nline in almost everything else. It is getting so that young people in \nthis country cannot afford to have children because it costs so much, \nand it is all driven by this medical liability situation. I think that \nis pathetic. I think it is pathetic for anybody to stand on the floor \nand say this is not a problem of tremendous concern and, literally, say \nthat it is the insurer's fault.\n  That just is not the case. In all honesty, it doesn't take a rocket \nscientist to figure out what the problem is. I hate to say it, being a \nlawyer and having been a trial lawyer. The problem is caused by many in \nour profession who are bringing these frivolous suits. I have to tell \nyou that I have seen lawyers bring frivolous medical liability suits \nfor one reason and that is because it costs between $50,000 and \n$100,000 to defend those suits. Many of these insurance companies, \nrather than take the risk of a runaway jury or a forum shopping \nsituation, even within in a state, will pay the defense costs to get \nout of the case even though the case has no merit.\n  Settling 20 of these frivolous cases per year, makes a pretty good \nliving for an attorney, just forcing the insurance companies to pay \ndefense costs because the insurance company doesn't want to take the \nrisk of a runaway jury verdict in a runaway community.\n  I think what jurors need to know is that in many respects, by \nallowing outrageous verdicts in some of these cases where there has \nbeen no negligence, they are basically running this system right into \nthe ground. That is what has happened.\n  As I say, I would have a catastrophic provision in this bill if I \ncould, that basically would take care of particularly egregious, gross \nnegligence type cases. There are reasons for bringing litigation from \ntime to time. There are good reasons to weed out those doctors who \nshould not be in the operating room, those doctors who really are \nincompetent, those doctors who do not do what is right.\n  But those are the exceptions, not the rule. We are finding that far \ntoo many good doctors are leaving the profession because they cannot \nstand this intolerable situation anymore. The country cannot stand it, \neither.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this legislation, S. 11, is not a \nserious attempt to address a significant problem being faced by \nphysicians in some States. It is the product of a party caucus rather \nthan a bipartisan deliberation of a Senate committee. It was designed \nto score political points, not to achieve a bipartisan consensus which \nis needed to enact major legislation. For that reason, it does not \ndeserve to be taken seriously by the Senate.\n  We must reject the simplistic and ineffective responses proposed by \nthose who contend that the only way to help doctors is to further hurt \nseriously injured patients.\n  Unfortunately, as we saw in the Patients' Bill of Rights debate, the \nBush administration and congressional Republicans are again advocating \na policy which will benefit neither doctors nor patients, only \ninsurance companies. Caps on compensatory damages and other extreme \ntort reforms are not only unfair to the victims of malpractice, they do \nnot result in a reduction of malpractice insurance premiums. Not only \ndoes this legislation fail to do what it claims but it would do many \nthings that its authors are attempting to conceal.\n  In reality, this legislation is designed to shield the entire health \ncare industry from basic accountability for the care it provides. While \nthose across the aisle like to talk about doctors, the real \nbeneficiaries will be the insurance companies and large health care \ncorporations. This amendment would enrich them at the expense of the \nmost seriously injured patients, men and women and children whose \nentire lives have been devastated by medical neglect and corporate \nabuse.\n  This proposal would shield HMOs that refuse to provide needed care, \ndrug companies whose medicine has toxic side effects, and manufacturers \nof defective medical equipment.\n  In the last 2 years, the entire Nation has been focused on the need \nfor greater corporate accountability. This legislation does just the \nreverse. It would drastically limit the financial responsibility of the \nentire health care industry to compensate injured patients for the harm \nthat they have suffered. When will the Republican Party start worrying \nabout the injured patients and stop trying to shield big business from \nthe consequences of its wrongdoing? Less accountability will never lead \nto better health care.\n  According to professor Sara Rosenbaum, a nationally respected expert \non health care law at the George Washington University School of Public \nHealth:\n\n       This measure is so vast in scope that it reaches every \n     conceivable health care claim against every health care \n     corporation or manufacturer of health care products . . . In \n     this sense the measure extends far beyond its popular billing \n     as one related to the crisis facing physicians and other \n     medical professionals in individual practice.\n\n  In testimony on the companion bill to S. 11 before the House Commerce \nCommittee, she stated that the bill was written so broadly that it \nwould shield health care companies from claims as varied as billing \nfraud, providing tainted blood to patients, fixing the prices of drugs, \ndeliberately overcharging Medicare or Medicaid for health services, \nmaking defective implants and violating nursing home safety rules. This \nlegislation is attempting to use the sympathetic family doctor as a \nTrojan horse concealing an enormous array of special legal privileges \nfor every corporation which makes a health care product, provides a \nhealth care service, or insures the payment of a medical bill. Every \nprovision of this bill is carefully designed to take existing rights \naway from those who have been harmed by medical neglect and corporate \ngreed.\n  This legislation would deprive seriously injured patients of the \nright to recover fair compensation for their injuries by placing \narbitrary caps on compensation for noneconomic loss in all of these \ncases. These caps only serve to hurt those patients who have suffered \nthe most severe, life-altering injuries and who have proven their cases \nin court.\n  They are the paralyzed, the brain-injured, and the blinded. They are \nthe ones who have lost limbs, organs, reproductive capacity, and in \nsome cases even years of life. These are life-altering conditions which \ndeprive a person of the ability to engage in many of the normal \nactivities of day to day living. It would be terribly wrong to take \ntheir rights away. The Bush administration talks about deterring \nfrivolous cases, but caps by their nature apply only to the most \nserious cases which have been proven in court.\n\n[[Page S9035]]\n\n  A person with a severe injury is not made whole merely by receiving \nreimbursement for medical bills and lost wages. Noneconomic damages \ncompensate victims for the very real, though not easily quantifiable, \nloss in quality of life that results from a serious, permanent injury. \nIt is absurd to suggest that $250,000 is fair compensation for a person \nparalyzed for life.\n  Caps are totally arbitrary. They do not adjust the amount of the \ncompensation ceiling with either the seriousness of the injury, or with \nthe length of years that the victim must endure the resulting \ndisability. Someone with a less serious injury can be fully compensated \nwithout reaching the cap. However, a patient with severe, permanent \ninjuries is prevented by the cap from receiving full compensation for \ntheir more serious injuries. Is it fair to apply the same limit on \ncompensation to a person who is confined to a wheelchair for life that \nis applied to someone with a temporary leg injury?\n  Caps discriminate against younger victims. A young person with a \nsevere injury such as paralysis must endure it for many more years than \nan older person with the same injury. Yet that young person is \nprohibited from receiving greater compensation for the many more years \nhe will be disabled. Is that fair?\n  Caps on noneconomic damages discriminate against women, children, \nminorities, and low-income workers. These groups do not receive large \neconomic damages attributable to lost earning capacity. Women who are \nhomeowners and caregivers for their families sustain no lost wages when \nthey are injured, so they only receive minimal economic damages. \nNoneconomic damages are particularly important to these vulnerable \npopulations.\n  In addition to imposing caps, this legislation would place other \nmajor restrictions on seriously injured patients seeking to recover \nfair compensation. At every stage of the judicial process, it would \nchange long-established judicial rules to disadvantage patients and \nshield defendants from the consequences of their actions.\n  It would abolish joint and several liability noneconomic damages. \nThis means the most seriously injured people may never receive all of \nthe compensation that the court has awarded to them. Under the \namendment, health care providers whose misconduct contributed to the \npatient's injuries will be able to escape responsibility for paying \nfull compensation to that patient.\n  The bias in the legislation could not be clearer. It would preempt \nState laws that allow fair trdatment for injured patients, but would \nallow State laws to be enacted which contained greater restrictions on \npatients' rights than the proposed federal law. This one-way preemption \ncontained in Section 11(b) shows how result-oriented the legislation \nreally is. It is not about fairness or balance. It is about protecting \ndefendants.\n  The amendment preempts State statutes of limitation, cutting back the \ntime allowed by many States for a patient to file suit against the \nhealth care provider who injured him. Under the legislation, the \nstatute of limitations can expire before the injured patient even knows \nthat it was malpractice which caused his or her injury.\n  It places severe limitations on when an injured patient can receive \npunitive damages, and how much punitive damages the victim can recover. \nUnder the bill, punitive damages can only be awarded if the defendant \nacted ``with malicious intent to injure'' or ``deliberately failed to \navoid unnecessary injury.''\n  This is far more restrictive than current law. It prohibits punitive \ndamages for '`reckless'' and ``wanton'' misconduct, which the \noverwhelming majority of States allow. In the very small number of \ncases where punitive damages would still be allowed, it would cap them \nat twice the amount of economic damages, no matter how egregious the \ndefendant's conduct and no matter how large its assets.\n  It imposes unprecedented limits on the amount of the contingent fee \nwhich a client and his or her attorney can agree to. This will make it \nmore difficult for injured patients to retain the attorney of their \nchoice in cases that involve complex legal issues. It can have the \neffect of denying them their day in court. Again the provision is one-\nsided, because it places no limit on how much the health care provider \ncan spend defending the case.\n  If we were to arbitrarily restrict the rights of seriously inured \npatients as the sponsors of this legislation propose, what benefits \nwould result? Certainly less accountability for health care providers \nwill never improve the quality of health care. It will not even result \nin less costly care. The cost of medical malpractice premiums \nconstitutes less than two-thirds of 1 percent--66 percent--of the \nNation's health care expenditures each year. For example, in 2001, \nhealth care costs totaled $1.42 trillion, while the total cost of all \nmedical malpractice insurance premiums was $7.3 billion. Malpractice \npremiums are not the cause of the high rate of medical inflation.\n  This chart clearly reflects that we spend $1.42 trillion a year in \ntotal personal health care expenditures. It is a very large amount per \nindividual. If we are ever able to get the cost of health care per \nindividual down to a reasonable amount there would be real savings. But \nthat isn't what this is about. This is about $7.3 billion, and that \namounts to just one-half of 1 percent of all medical costs. Medical \nmalpractice premiums do not contribute to the overall rise. We ought to \naddress the cost of health care. That isn't what this bill is about.\n  Over the last 15 years, medical costs increased by 113 percent. The \ntotal amount spent on medical malpractice insurance rose just 52 \npercent over that period, less than half the rate of inflation for \nhealth care services. The increase is rising at virtually one-half of \nwhat other health care services are rising.\n  The White House and other supporters of caps have argued that \nrestricting an injured patient's right to recover fair compensation \nwill reduce malpractice premiums. But there is scant evidence to \nsupport their claim. In fact, there is substantial evidence to refute \nit.\n  In the past year, there have been dramatic increases in the cost of \nmedical malpractice insurance in States that already have damage caps \nand other restrictive tort reforms on the statute books, as well as in \nStates that do not. No substantial increase in the number or size of \nmalpractice judgments has suddenly occurred which would justify the \nenormous increase in premiums which many doctors are being forced to \npay.\n\n  Comprehensive national studies show that the medical malpractice \npremiums are not significantly lower on average in States that have \nenacted damage caps and other restrictions on patient rights than in \nStates without these restrictions. Insurance companies are merely \npocketing the dollars which patients no longer receive when ``tort \nreform'' is enacted.\n  Let's look at the facts. Approximately half of the States have a cap \non medical malpractice damages. Most have had those statutes for a \nsubstantial number of years. The other half of the States do not have a \ncap on malpractice damages. The best evidence of whether such caps \naffect the cost of malpractice insurance is to compare the rates in \nthose two groups of States.\n  Based on data from the Medical Liability Monitor on all 50 States, \nthe average liability premium in 2002 for doctors practicing in States \nwithout caps on malpractice damages was $31,926, virtually the same as \nthe average premium for doctors practicing in States with caps, which \nwas $30,521.\n  There are many reasons why insurance rates vary substantially from \nState to State. This data demonstrates that it is not a State's tort \nreform laws which determine the rates. Caps do not make a significant \ndifference in the malpractice premiums which doctors pay. This is borne \nout by a comparison of premium levels for a range of medical \nspecialties.\n  The average liability premium in 2002 for doctors practicing internal \nmedicine was less--2.8 percent--for doctors in States without caps on \nmalpractice damages--$9,552--than in States with caps on damages--\n$9,820. Internists actually pay more for malpractice insurance in the \nStates that have caps.\n  The average liability premium in 2002 for general surgeons was almost \nidentical for doctors in States without caps--$33,016--than States with \ncaps--$33,157. Surgeons are paying the same regardless of the State's \ntort laws.\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\n  The average liability premium for OB/GYN physicians in 2002 in States \nwithout caps--$53,163--exceeded the rate for doctors in States with \ncaps--$48,586--by less than 10 percent, a relatively small difference.\n  Shown on this chart are the figures for: internal medicine, general \nsurgery, OB/GYN, and the physicians in States without caps on damages \nand the physicians in States with caps on damages. A fair reading of \nthat would indicate there is virtually little that would reflect itself \nin lower malpractice insurance rates for those States with caps.\n  This evidence clearly demonstrates that capping malpractice damages \ndoes not benefit the doctors it purports to help. Their rates remain \nvirtually the same. It only helps the insurance companies earn even \nbigger profits. As Business Week Magazine concluded after reviewing the \ndata ``the statistical case for caps is flimsy.'' That is from their \nMarch 3, 2003 issue.\n  Since malpractice premiums are not significantly effected by the \nimposition of caps on recovery, it stands to reason that the \navailability of physicians does not differ between States that have \ncaps and States that do not. AMA data shows that there are 233 \nphysicians per 100,000 residents in States that do not have medical \nmalpractice caps and 223 physicians per 100,000 residents in States \nwith caps. Looking at the particularly high cost speciality of \nobstetrics and gynecology, States without caps have 29 OB/GYNs per \n100,000 women while States with caps have 27.4 OB/GYNs per 100,000 \nwomen. Clearly there is no correlation.\n  If a Federal cap on noneconomic compensatory damages were to pass, it \nwould sacrifice fair compensation for injured patients in a vain \nattempt to reduce medical malpractice premiums. Doctors will not get \nthe relief they are seeking. Only the insurance companies, which \ncreated the recent market instability, will benefit.\n  A National Association of Insurance Commissioners study shows that in \n2000, total insurance industry profits as a percentage of premiums for \nmedical malpractice insurance was nearly twice as high--13.6 percent--\nas overall casualty and property insurance profits--7.9 percent. Do we \nunderstand that now? This is the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners. Their study showed, in the year 2000, that the insurance \nindustry profits as a percentage of premiums for medical malpractice \ninsurance was twice as high as casualty and property insurance profits. \nThe profits from the premiums for medical malpractice insurance were \ntwice as high. This is the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners study.\n  In fact, malpractice was a very lucrative line of insurance for the \nindustry throughout the 1990s. Recent premium increases have been an \nattempt to maintain the high profit margins despite sharply declining \ninvestment earnings. That is what is at the root cause here.\n  Insurance industry practices are responsible for the sudden, dramatic \npremium increases which have occurred in some States in the past 2 \nyears. The explanation for these premium spikes can be found not in \nlegislative halls or in courtrooms, but in the boardrooms of the \ninsurance companies themselves.\n  There have been substantial increases in the last 2 years in a number \nof insurance lines, not just medical malpractice. Insurers make much of \ntheir money from investment income. Interest earned on premium dollars \nis particularly important in medical malpractice insurance because \nthere is a much longer period of time between receipt of the premium \nand payment of the claim than in most lines of casualty insurance.\n  The industry creates a ``malpractice crisis'' whenever its \ninvestments do poorly. The combination of a sharp decline in the equity \nmarkets and record low interest rates in the last 2 years is the reason \nfor the sharp increase in medical malpractice insurance premiums. What \nwe are witnessing is not new. The industry has engaged in this pattern \nof behavior repeatedly over the last 30 years. When ``tort reform \nlaws'' are enacted, the insurance companies pocket the resulting \nsavings to bolster their profits.\n  Last month, Weiss Ratings, Inc., a nationally recognized financial \nanalyst, conducted an in-depth examination of the impact of capping \ndamages in medical malpractice cases. This is a nationally recognized \nfinancial analyst. Their conclusions sharply contradict the assumptions \non which this legislation is based. Weiss found capping damages does \nreduce the amount of money that malpractice insurance companies pay out \nto injured patients. However, those savings are not--those savings are \nnot--passed on to doctors in lower premiums. That is the conclusion.\n  This is what the Weiss report, issued on June 3 of this year, states:\n\n       Since the insurers in the states with caps reaped the \n     benefit of lower medical malpractice payouts, one would \n     expect that they would reduce the premiums they charged \n     doctors.\n\n  At the very minimum, they should have been able to slow down the \npremium increases. Surprisingly, the data show they did precisely the \nopposite. Between 1991 and 2002, the Weiss analysis shows that premiums \nrose by substantially more in the States with damage caps than in the \nStates without caps. The 12-year increase in the median annual premium \nwas 48.2 percent in the States that had the caps, and only 35.9 percent \nin the States that had no caps. In the words of the report:\n\n       On average, doctors in states with caps actually suffered a \n     significantly larger increase than doctors in states without \n     caps. . . . In short, the results clearly invalidate the \n     expectations of caps proponents.\n\n  There it is. Those States with the caps, 48.2 percent median premium \nincrease; States without caps, 35.9 percent. That is from the study by \nWeiss Rating, Inc. It is not a study that is made up by those of us who \nare expressing opposition.\n  Doctors, especially those in high-risk specialties, whose malpractice \npremiums have increased dramatically over the past 2 years, do deserve \npremium relief. That relief will only come as a result of tougher \nregulation on the insurance industry.\n  When insurance companies lose money on their investments, they should \nnot be able to recover those losses from the doctors they insure. \nUnfortunately, that is what is happening.\n  Doctors and patients are both victims of the insurance industry. \nExcess profits from the boom years should be used to keep premiums \nstable when investment earnings drop. However, the insurance industry \nwill never do that voluntarily. Only by recognizing the real problem \ncan we begin to structure an effective solution that will bring an end \nto unreasonably high medical practice premiums.\n  I conclude with a quotation from the analysis of medical malpractice \npremiums by Weiss Ratings, Inc. Weiss Ratings, as I said, is not \nspeaking from the perspective of a trial lawyer or a patient advocate, \nbut as a hard-nosed financial analyst that has studied the facts of \nmalpractice insurance ratings. Here are their recommendations to us \nbased on those facts:\n\n       First, legislators must immediately put on hold all \n     proposals involving non-economic damage caps until convincing \n     evidence can be produced to demonstrate a true benefit to \n     doctors in the form of reduced med mal costs. Right now, \n     consumers are being asked to sacrifice not only large damage \n     claims, but also critical leverage to help regulate the \n     medical profession--all with the stated goal that it will end \n     the med mal crisis for doctors. However, the data indicate \n     that similar state legislation has merely produced the worst \n     of both worlds: The sacrifice by consumers plus a \n     continuing--and even worsening--crisis for doctors. \n     Neither party derived any benefit whatsoever from the \n     caps.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I also reference a really excellent article in U.S. News \nand World Report from June 30 that shows on a chart what has been \nhappening with premiums going from $2.9 billion to $4.9 billion and, on \nthe other hand, points out insurers' payments after the jury verdict \nwas $147 billion in 1993 and in the year 2001, $172 billion--so \nbasically a fairly flat line across almost a 10-year period, a dramatic \nincrease in the premiums and virtually flat in terms of the payments.\n  I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Massachusetts would yield for a \nquestion, I would ask him, since he has been our leader in the Senate \non the issue of a Patients' Bill of Rights to ensure that patients \nacross America have their rights against HMOs and managed care \ncompanies--I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, is he aware\n\n[[Page S9037]]\n\nthat despite the copious debate on the floor about the crisis facing \nphysicians across America, S. 11 provides a limitation on liability not \njust for doctors and hospitals but also for HMO insurance companies, \nmanaged care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and manufacturers \nof medical devices?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is exactly right. It is not only limited to \nthose groups the Senator has cited, but there is a strong belief that \nit would also apply protection for billing fraud, tainted blood to \npatients, fixing of prices of drugs, deliberately overcharging Medicare \nand Medicaid for health services, as well as making defective implants, \nand violating nursing home safety standards.\n  We don't hear much from those who are supporting this about why all \nof these various groups need this kind of protection. It is a catch \nall, not dealing with what was stated by many of those who were \nspeaking in favor. This is a catch all for anything to do in any way, \nunder any pretense, with the health care industry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator from Massachusetts another question \nthrough the Chair. There is a section in this bill I would like to call \nto his attention, section 13. I would like to read it to the Senator \nand ask him to respond, since he has been the sponsor of a Patients' \nBill of Rights, so that once and for all HMOs and managed care \ncompanies will be held responsible and accountable for medical \ndecisions they make that injure patients. I ask the Senator if he would \nrespond and tell the Senate on the record what it means to include in \nS. 11 a section 13, with the following language--sense of Congress:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that a health insurer should be \n     liable for damages for harm caused when it makes a decision \n     as to what care is medically necessary and appropriate.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, does this sense of Congress \nlanguage guarantee that those who are harmed by health insurers who \nmake bad decisions about diagnostic procedures, stays in the hospital, \nnecessary surgery--is this language some refuge and comfort for them \nthat finally now they will have their day in court and now, with this \nsense of Congress, they can hold these health insurance companies \naccountable?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It really insults the intelligence of the average \nfamily, and the average family is far too bright and smart not to \nunderstand what this says and what it does not. As implicated in the \nSenator's question, this is a sense of the Senate of something we \nshould be doing by legislation which we have attempted to do with the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n\n  This sense of the Senate is meaningless. It isn't even worth the \npaper it is written on, because of all the other provisions included in \nthe legislation which the Senator has spoken to so effectively during \nthe course of the debate.\n  This is sort of a catch all, a ``make them feel good,'' section, for \nsome to be able to say: Look, they have language in here that it is the \nsense we all feel this way. But, of course, it says this in a piece of \nlegislation which will effectively undermine the protections for \nworking families, for their parents, and for their children.\n  We have many things that can be done to provide help to some of those \nwho have the particular specialties which need attention, but the idea \nthat you have these two lines of a sense of the Senate to effectively \nsay: We have done all of these bad things, and we have put them in law, \nbut we want a sense of the Senate to make you feel good and show that \nwe are actually protecting the average family in this country--as the \nSenator well knows, it isn't worth the paper it is printed on.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may ask one last question of the Senator?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I may just add, as the Senator remembers--I hope the \nAmerican people do--we had weeks of debate on the floor on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. As the Senator remembers, what underlined \nthat whole debate was that we ought to put the well-being and the \nhealth care interests of the patients of this country ahead of the \nbottom line of the HMOs. This was a debate in which the American people \nreally participated. It was sidetracked because the administration \nrefused to allow States to make the ultimate decision about \ncompensation for individuals. That was in the final compromise which \nthis administration refused.\n  So for all those who want to talk about States rights issues on this \nand the States know best--all those who make that argument--they \nsomehow miss the importance of the real protections for people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My last question to the Senator: If this sense of the \nCongress is not worth the paper it is written on, as the Senator has \nsaid, is it fair to conclude that since the HMOs and managed care \ncompanies prevailed before when the Senator from Massachusetts offered \nhis Patients' Bill of Rights to protect individuals from insurance \ncompanies making medical decisions, is it fair to conclude that if S. \n11 were enacted as written, limiting the liability of these HMO and \ninsurance companies, these companies would win again, that we would \nreward them again for bad conduct, despite the sense of the Senate, \nsense of Congress, section 13 of this bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think what you could say is that this is the anti-Bill \nof Rights for the American consumer because it goes in just the \nopposite way. Rather than guaranteeing protections, it undermines \nwhatever protections are out there. This is a battle we have been \nfighting over and over again in recent years, making sure the most \nbasic protections for our consumers and families in the health care \narea are not undermined.\n  As the Senator has pointed out, this is going in the opposite \ndirection.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to respond to a few of the items \njust laid out in the Senate and try to point out what I think are \nglaring inaccuracies.\n  First of all, the Weiss report we have heard so much about from the \nlast two speakers uses numbers from the Medical Liability Monitor. The \nMedical Liability Monitor just provides the numbers. They are not a \ngroup that is pro tort reform or anti tort reform. This is what the \neditor, Barbara Dillard, says about the numbers that the other side of \nthe aisle is using to somehow skew what the premiums are doing in those \nStates that have enacted tort reform. Let me read some of the most \nsalient parts:\n       The Weiss ratings analysis of medical malpractice caps \n     cites the Medical Liability Monitor as the source of data \n     Weiss uses to calculate ``average'' and ``medium'' premiums \n     for physicians during the last 12 years. While we are an \n     independent news publication and take no position on tort \n     reform, or other proposals to improve the medical liability \n     climate, we feel it is necessary to comment on the use of our \n     statistics because some readers have expressed concern. The \n     median and averages in the Weiss report are not the numbers \n     we report in our annual rate surveys. Weiss may have taken \n     our numbers, the amounts and increases of premiums paid by \n     doctors State by State, and used them to arrive at their \n     statistics. But it is not possible from the report to say \n     definitely how our numbers have been used. It is our view \n     that it is impossible to calculate a valid ``average'' \n     premium for physicians, or for physicians in a particular \n     State or territory, and we state that clearly in the \n     executive summary of our rate survey.\n\n  But the editor of the Medical Liability Monitor goes further. She \nadvised the leader's office that:\n\n       It is misleading to use median premiums compiled with data \n     from the Medical Liability Monitor to demonstrate the effect \n     of noneconomic damage limits on liability rates.\n\n  This is exactly what Weiss does. That is the report they have been \nquoting here. The report uses median annual premiums compiled with data \nfrom the Medical Liability Monitor to try to demonstrate the effect of \nnoneconomic damage limits on liability rates. Not only is this wrong, \nit downright misleads the public.\n  Let me refer to some of the other issues they were talking about. \nHalf of the States have enacted medical liability reform. My State did \nthat a year ago. It has caps. If you look at my State, as far as the \nnumbers, it would look like it hasn't worked. It takes a minimum of \nprobably 8, 10, 12, or 15 years to go through the courts to find out \nwhether the caps are going to be upheld. If the insurance companies are \nunsure whether the caps are going to be upheld or not, there is no \npredictability there because they can reach way back--once it is held \nunconstitutional, they can go back and try those cases and get those \nawards.\n  That is why in California it took so long--from 1975 until the mid-\n1980s--to\n\n[[Page S9038]]\n\nfind out whether the law was going to work. Colorado and California \nhave now had their laws in place long enough to stabilize rates. Let's \nlook at those two States, in major cities, compared to other cities \naround the country.\n  Here are Los Angeles and Denver. We will start with the general \nsurgery. It is almost $37,000 in Los Angeles for the medical liability \npremiums for the year; that is for a general surgeon. In Denver, it is \naround $34,500. New York is about $51,000. Las Vegas was $70,000. It is \na lot higher this year in Las Vegas. In Chicago, it is $68,000. In \nMiami, it is $174,000. The cities in the gray on the chart are States \nwithout medical liability reform. The two in the white have had medical \nliability reform in place long enough for them to have predictability.\n  This whole debate isn't about hurting patients; it is about helping \nthem to have access to quality care. In my State, we had a level I \ntrauma center close for 10 days because of a crisis, where the \nspecialists who were treating patients there could not afford the \nmedical liability insurance anymore. So they had to say: We cannot come \nin there and practice because we cannot afford the insurance. The \nGovernor of our State, within a week, called a special session of the \nlegislature. They enacted, in a bipartisan way, caps. Unfortunately, \nlike a lot of the caps in the country--and they use a lot of these \nstatistics--they are similar to the caps in my State where they have \nloopholes that you can drive a truck through, which makes the \nlegislation pretty much, as far as a court of law is concerned, \nineffective. That is why there is a move in my State to close those \nhuge loopholes down to where just the most serious cases actually have \nunlimited pain and suffering type of awards.\n\n  In our State, the way they reopened the level I trauma center in that \nspecial session of the legislature--not only did they enact a $350,000 \ncap for the general population but for the level I trauma center they \nput it under the State. Guess what. Our State has $50,000 caps total--\neconomic, pain and suffering, medical, the whole thing. That is the \nonly way they could get the level I trauma center back open. Why did \nthey do it? They knew there was a crisis. People had died, and more \nwould die if they didn't reopen the trauma center.\n  Well, how bad does it have to get in the U.S. for us to say there is \na crisis? When will the other side realize how bad the situation is in \nAmerica? We are losing specialists. People are leaving the practice of \nmedicine--especially those specialties and subspecialties in which we \nalready have a shortage in many areas; and new people are not going \ninto these areas because they see the writing on the wall. They see it \nis going to be too expensive for them to go out and practice.\n  I have a good friend from Las Vegas, Dr. Spoon. We were talking a \ncouple months ago. One of his favorite things to do in his practice--he \nis an obstetrician--is to deliver babies, especially those high-risk \npregnancies. He got so much enjoyment from bringing them to the point \nwhere they were successful. His insurance company made him stop \nperforming high-risk deliveries, and they also cut him down from 250 or \n300 deliveries a year, and he can deliver no more than 125 babies a \nyear.\n  Southern Nevada is the fastest growing metropolitan area in the \ncountry. Yet we are losing OB/GYNs and new ones are not coming in. So \nwhat happens in that area is women are having serious trouble locating \nOB/GYNs to deliver their babies.\n  I want to try to talk a little bit about the bill and what it really \ndoes do and try to clear up some of these issues. First, to go back to \npremiums. It was said that in places such as California premiums and \ncaps on economic damages--caps on pain and suffering don't work. \nAccording to the CBO, they do work. H.R. 5, which is virtually \nidentical to the bill we have today, would significantly lower premiums \nfor medical malpractice insurance from what they would otherwise be \nunder current law. Premiums for medical malpractice insurance \nultimately would be an average of 25 to 30 percent below what they \nwould be under current law.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is nonpartisan, and everybody is \nsupposed to respect the numbers they put out around here. They \ncertainly don't have any pro or con as far as tort reform is concerned. \nThere are others such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices that say States with limits of $250,000 or $350,000 on \nnoneconomic damages have average combined highest premium increases of \n12 to 15 percent--that is average combined highest premium increases--\ncompared to 44 percent in States without caps on noneconomic damages.\n  The Joint Economic Committee of the Congress says that tort reform \nwill reduce overall spending on health care savings by between $67 \nbillion and $106 billion over the next 10 years.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about what kinds of economic damages. \nThat has been criticized. We don't cap economic damages. What can you \nget in economic damages under this bill? You can get all lost wages and \nbenefits. Lost earning capacity. They say it hurts children. You get a \nchild who gets hurt because of malpractice and you can calculate what \nthat child would have had over the next 60, 70 years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. They may not have the education to know what their total \npotential was but it is 60 or 70 years' worth of earnings they can get \nin economic damages. That can be significant. I will freely admit it is \nnot what Barry Bonds would get if he got hurt, or LaBron James, the new \nbasketball player. They would obviously get a lot more money because \nthey have the potential of making so much more money. But this child \nwould still get a significant amount.\n\n  Let me go through these points, and then I will yield for a question.\n  All medical expenses would be covered under this bill: long-term \ncare, assisted living devices, child care, household services, lost \ntime, special medical damages, value of care, counsel, advice, aid, \ncomfort, counsel for children, parents, and spouses. All of those are \npossible under economic damages in this bill.\n  The final point I wish to make is this: Does this capping hurt \npatients? We just have to look at Colorado and California and ask: Are \nthere people out there being hurt? I submit there are a lot more people \nbeing hurt and going to be hurt in States such as Nevada where the \ndoctors are leaving, where the doctor will not be in that emergency \nroom or will not be able to deliver a baby, especially in those high-\nrisk pregnancies.\n  This one case in Florida is a very good example. I actually met this \ngentleman. He is a physician himself. He was not performing duties as a \nphysician at this time, he was a parent of an injured child. His name \nis Dr. Frank Shwarin. His 4-year-old child in Naples, FL, fell and hit \nhis head on the side of the swimming pool. This was in July of 2002. \nThe father is named Frank and Craig is the son. He rushed him to the \nnearest hospital only to find that none of the neurosurgeons on call \nwould treat patients under 18 years of age. Why? Because they could not \nget medical liability coverage to treat, even in an emergency \nsituation, a pediatric neurosurgery case. They had to medevac his son a \ncouple hours away. Fortunately, because the father is a doctor, he was \nable to keep his son alive during that time.\n  A woman testified before the Senate that when the level I trauma \ncenter crisis happened in my State, her father died when that trauma \ncenter was closed because he had to be sent to another emergency room, \nand an emergency room is not a trauma center. They do not have the kind \nof expertise to treat severe trauma. As a result, her father died.\n  We cannot guarantee he would not have died in the trauma center, but \nwe can guarantee he would have had the best possible care and the best \nchance of living. That is what I believe this debate has come down to: \nThe system is out of balance now. It is not working. To correct this \nimbalance, we have to start reining in some of these frivolous, \noutrageous jury awards.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the sponsor of the legislation for \ncoming to the Chamber. I want to give him an opportunity to complete \nhis statement, and perhaps at the end of that statement, if he and I \ncan engage in dialog or debate, that would be fair. I do\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\nnot want to interrupt his train of thought during his presentation.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That would be fine. I have a couple other issues to go \nthrough. There are a few other cases I would like to bring to the \nattention of our colleagues.\n  First, because we need to put a real face on this issue--we need to \nput a face on the patients, and I think it is legitimate to put a face \non the other way. I think it is legitimate to put a face on somebody \nwho has had a claim of malpractice and actually had malpractice \ncommitted against them, and it is also fair to put faces on those \npeople who now are having trouble finding the kind of health care they \nneed.\n  This is a balancing act, there is no question about it. There is no \nperfect answer to this situation. I wish there were. The fact is, the \ncurrent system is driving health care providers out of the practice of \nmedicine, hospitals are closing down, and we need to correct the \nsituation so that when we seek health care in an emergency situation or \nin a nonemergency situation, we will have the kind of care we need.\n\n  A friend of mine in Las Vegas has Parkinson's disease and goes down \nto Loma Linda--I told this story earlier today--to see his \nsubspecialist in neurology to treat this disease. He had some fairly \nradical surgery where they actually separate parts of the brain. He has \nhad very good success with it. He had a specialist talked into moving \nhis practice to Las Vegas shortly before the medical malpractice crisis \nhit in Las Vegas. Once that hit the news, the guy said: Sorry, I live \nin California where we have caps. I cannot go to Las Vegas and pay \n$250,000 a year for my practice for medical liability coverage. I \ncannot afford to do it. Why would I do that when I have a good practice \nhere, we have caps, and it is working well in California?\n  He wanted to move to Las Vegas. He was ready to go with his family. \nHe liked the quality of life in Las Vegas. He did not go simply because \nhe cannot afford to take that kind of economic hit. So people in Las \nVegas have to drive down there.\n  Most of the time those are not emergency cases, but for those cases \nthat are an emergency, it is just a shame.\n  People say this is a State issue. I would counter that this is the \nUnited States of America, and we are supposed to be able to live where \nwe want to live, and now we are saying to people: No, you cannot go \nthere because of medical liability premiums, you cannot afford to open \nup your practice because of medical liability premiums. People should \nbe able to find the kind of health care they need wherever in the \nUnited States and live the quality of life and obtain the best health \ncare they can possibly get based on what is available in the area. I do \nnot think outrageous premiums should be the limiting factor.\n  Let me close with this point, Mr. President. Earlier there was debate \nabout punitive damages and that we are protecting big companies. Under \nthis bill, we do protect companies that make medical devices if they \nhave followed FDA regulations. In other words, the manufacturer would \nnot be liable for punitive damages if it satisfied FDA's rigorous \napproval process and if the harm to the patient did not result from the \ncompany's violation of an FDA regulation. If they played by the rules \nthat the Government set down, we protect them in this bill from \nnoneconomic--we do not protect them from economic or from medical \nexpenses. But if they violate the FDA rules, then they are not \nprotected. I think that is fairly reasonable. That is why we think this \nbill is a reasonable compromise, is a reasonable approach to solving \nwhat I believe is an out-of-control system.\n  I will be happy to yield for questions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the sponsor of the legislation. I \nwould like to ask him this question. Virtually every example the \nSenator has given, every compelling example he has given for this \nlegislation involves doctors paying malpractice premiums. Yet as he has \nwritten this legislation, it goes far beyond providing limitation of \nliability for doctors. It includes limitation of liability for HMOs, \nmanaged care, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, \nand nursing homes.\n  Can the Senator from Nevada explain to me why he has not come before \nus and argued on behalf of HMOs and why their exposure to liability for \nwrongdoing is a source of concern and leads to, he thinks, the need for \nlegislation?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we know we live in a litigious society. We \nare sue happy today. Everything is somebody else's fault, and we \nimmediately go to court. Because of the nature of our courts, it is \neasier to settle. When we settle, it drives up the cost for all of us. \nA lot of the cases never make it because it is too expensive to take \nthe case all the way to court.\n  A lot of companies especially are self-insured for certain amounts of \nmoney. It is easier for them to calculate the cost of going to court, \nand what happens in the long run is that all of us pay for that in \nhigher premiums. When we have higher premiums, it is pretty simple. We \nend up with a situation where employers cannot afford it. A lot of \nsmall employers especially are dropping their health insurance coverage \nand we are ending up with 41 million uninsured in this country and a \nbig part of that is the cost, not only of the premiums to doctors but \njust the whole cost of defensive medicine that we have to practice \ntoday because of the fear of being sued.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. So if the Senator from Nevada will yield for another \nquestion, through the Chair, is the Senator from Nevada going to bring \nfor us then more evidence, as he has when it comes to doctors, as to \nthe insurance crisis facing drug companies in America, which as I \nunderstand are the most profitable corporations in America with an \naverage annual return of 18 percent on capital, about 6 times the rate \nof return of the Fortune 500? Is he going to tell us about the \nliability exposure of HMOs that really necessitate this protection \nwhich he is building into his proposed law, S. 11? Is he going to tell \nus about the medical device corporations that have made faulty products \nwhich are causing problems across America and how their exposure and \nliability necessitate this need to limit their accountability and cap \nthe recovery of innocent people who are victims of their misconduct?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator would vote for us to go forward with the \nbill tomorrow when we have a cloture vote, we will have a lot of time \nto debate this. We can amend it and go forward with this debate. So I \nhope he will join us in voting for cloture because I do have a lot of \nevidence to justify the various provisions in the bill.\n  The bottom line is we all know that today it costs around $900 \nmillion to bring a single new drug to the market. I am not here to \ndefend the pharmaceutical companies or any other company.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is what the bill of the Senator does.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. No. What I am here to say is we have a problem with our \nhealth care system today and we need to fix it. If we can go forward \nwith this bill, if there are amendments the Senator thinks can improve \nthis bill, let's at least move to it so that we can amend it, put the \namendments forward, and have a healthy debate. We can take a week, or \nwhatever it takes, to do that so that we can go forward and try to fix \nsome of the glaring problems. If the Senator thinks there are some \nproblems with the bill, let's bring forth amendments and try to fix it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, I am \ncurious. What the Senator has just suggested is a good basis for \nestablishing what we might even call a Senate committee where we could \nhave Members of the Senate come together, consider evidence, and offer \namendments before the bill comes to the floor. If I am not mistaken, \nthe Senate bill already provides for committees. Why is it that this \nbill, of such consequence, should not go through a Senate committee \nsystem so that the very aspects that we have just discussed can be \nopenly debated and amended and come up with a work product that might \nbe of real value to this country?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I say to my friend and colleague that it is obvious why. \nWe could not get a bill to the floor. The Senator knows that and \neverybody here knows that. It is just like last year when the Senator \nwas in the majority, there were at least two bills that I remember, the \nEnergy bill, as, well as the prescription drug bill, that were brought \nto the floor that were not brought through committee. They were\n\n[[Page S9040]]\n\nbrought directly to the floor by the majority leader at the time. It is \nnot a common procedure, but it is a procedure that has to be done every \nonce in a while to bring up important legislation that cannot go \nthrough committee and my colleagues know cannot get through committee.\n\n  The way the Senate works is so different than the House, and the \nSenator knows that. We both served in the House of Representatives. The \nHouse of Representatives does almost all their work in the committee. \nWe can do a lot of our work on the floor and produce a pretty darn good \nproduct by bringing it to the floor, amending the bill on the floor, \nand that is what I think we should do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the Senator from Nevada, the sponsor of \nthis legislation, another question, he has spoken about his own home \nState of Nevada and the problems they have faced. In the last 2 days, \nthere has been a lot of discussion on the Senate floor about the \nmedical malpractice crisis in this country that involves an increasing \nincidence of medical malpractice. In fact, the Bush administration says \nit has reached epidemic proportions.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, what in his bill, S. 11, would deal \nwith the problem in his home State of Nevada, reported by Business Week \non March 3 of this year, in which they reported that in his home State \nof Nevada, which adopted a $350,000 cap on recovery last year, it was \ndiscovered that two doctors in his State were responsible for $14 \nmillion of the $22 million in claims awarded in Nevada in 1 year? What \nin this legislation would make certain that those doctors, guilty of \nmalpractice, would be held accountable for their wrongdoing and would \nbe removed from practice if, in fact, they are not meeting the \nstandards of professional conduct?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague that it is a great \npoint. I practiced veterinary medicine and I understand how \nprofessional boards work. I understand that with professional boards \nthere is a self-policing that is assumed. It is supposed to happen with \nlawyers. It is supposed to happen with accountants. It is supposed to \nhappen with veterinarians. It is supposed to happen with physicians. \nThe big problem today with professional boards is they are afraid to do \nsomething with somebody's license because if they do, they can be held \npersonally liable. That happens time and time again.\n  All of the professional boards go through this; that as badly as they \nwould love to jerk somebody's license, unless it is so clear and the \nevidence is so outrageous of what they have done to deserve their \nlicense being jerked, it just does not happen. Frankly, it should \nhappen more. There are incompetent doctors. There are incompetent \nlawyers. There are incompetent veterinarians. More of them should have \ntheir license jerked in that case, and I wish they were empowered a \nlittle more and maybe protected a little more to do that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to Dr. Ensign, we appreciate his leadership on \nthis matter and know that he is a professional himself, and he is \nfamiliar with these liability issues. The Senator talked about two \ndoctors in Nevada being responsible for $14 million of the $22 million \nin punitive damages. I guess what I want to ask the Senator is that in \nthis way we operate with punitive damages, is not the real truth that \nwhen two doctors get hit with big verdicts that the premiums from all \nthe innocent doctors in Nevada go up? It is not just the bad doctor who \npays--it is supposed to punish him--but the insurance company pays it, \ndoes it not, and then they pay for that by raising the premiums on \neverybody else?\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The Senator from Alabama brings up a very true point, but \nalso the Senator from Illinois is correct in that we do need to do a \nbetter job of policing the physicians. They need to do a much better \njob of that. That is why I brought up the point of the boards. The \npoint is, though, if we vote for cloture tomorrow, maybe we can work \nthis out. Maybe we can come up with something that could be addressed, \nor at least give suggestive language to the States to be able to work \nthis out. It is so clear that if we can invoke cloture--for the general \npublic, that means that we can proceed to the bill. The vote tomorrow \nis just whether we can proceed to the bill. All of this is just pre-\ndebate on whether we are going to proceed to a bill that is so critical \nto the future health care in this country.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is exactly correct. I certainly agree, as a \nFederal prosecutor--and I prosecuted some physicians and other \nprofessionals in the medical business for bad behavior, but the odd \nthing about the way our tort system works, people think the doctor who \ngets sued is being punished, but really the doctor has insurance which \nhe is required to have in order to practice in a hospital--virtually \neverybody has to have some, no matter how much it costs--and they do \nnot end up being punished. Every physician in the community is \npunished, are they not? Is that not an odd thing that we are dealing \nwith in current law?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I do not know if the Senator can see this chart--maybe we \ncan have that chart turned just slightly so the Senator from Alabama \ncan see it, but it brings up the exact point. The States that have \ncapped noneconomic damages in the white, California and Colorado, \nrepresented by Los Angeles and Denver, in those States let's go down to \nthe OB/GYNs, $54,000 in Los Angeles for the annual premiums for the \nmedical liability insurance, $30,000 in Denver. Go over to New York; it \nis almost $90,000; in Las Vegas, $108,000. I guarantee that number in \nLas Vegas is old because friends of mine who are OB/GYNs say they are \npaying anywhere from $130,000 to $150,000 a year. Chicago, $102,000 and \nMiami is over $200,000 a year. The cities in gray, representing the \nstates in gray, have no tort reform that has been on the books. Nevada \nhas it but it has not been on the books long enough. It will take 6, 8, \n10 years. Los Angeles and Denver have had their laws on the books long \nenough to work.\n\n  Because they have enacted what we want to do today, we see these \npremiums.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent.) The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will share my thoughts. I believe this bill is a good \nway to go about at the present time dealing with what is a health care \ncrisis in America--the surging costs of insurance and liability. I wish \nwe were not in the Senate having to deal with it. I have some great \nfriends in the tort business, good lawyers, and they have learned over \nthe years how to utilize the system to maximize verdicts and maximize \nrecoveries. They have been successful.\n  Things have gotten out of sync. They need to be brought into sync. We \ncan do it a number of different ways. We can do it State by State. The \ntruth is over half of the medical care in hospitals in America today, \nand a very large percentage of what doctors do every day, is paid for \nby the Federal Government in Medicaid. It is our tax money. We are \npaying it. Part of the need they have for higher pay and higher \nreimbursement rates is because of the malpractice insurance they must \npay.\n  Caps on damages have worked. Last week I was in the small town of \nRussellville in Alabama where I practiced law for a year or so. It is \npretty far off the beaten path. A bright young doctor gave me a couple \nof ideas about reforming medical care unrelated to this issue. He told \nme he had come from California. His premiums in Alabama were \nsubstantially higher, and growing each year, than his colleagues he \nleft in California. He did not expect that. We have little or no caps. \nWe have some caps in Alabama, but not the kind in California.\n  I talked to a physician friend of mine, a wonderful person I go to \nchurch with, Dr. Conrad Pierce, former president of the OB/GYN \nAssociation. And he talked about the $100,000 liability premiums that \nOBs pay. He said, Jeff, you can get by in a city if you are delivering \na couple hundred babies a year, but if you deliver 50 or 100 babies, \nthis is $1,000 per delivery. It represents your health care premium. \nThat is a big deal.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator will yield, is the Senator aware that, for \ninstance, in Las Vegas, they are limiting\n\n[[Page S9041]]\n\nthe number of babies they are allowed to deliver to 125. What your \nfriend was talking about is right, they used to deliver 250 to 300. Now \nthey limit how many they can deliver.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is the result we are dealing with. All kinds of \nfactors are occurring that are impacting adversely health care as a \nresult of the premiums.\n  As my friend pointed out, in some rural areas you only deliver 50 or \n60. It is not precisely how many babies delivered by a doctor that \ndetermines the premiums paid. You pay a basic premium if you deliver \nany at all. So the low numbers drive out physicians in rural areas who \ndo not deliver that many babies.\n  It is a big deal. We have seen medical malpractice insurance jump by \n81 percent over the past 2 years alone. It has driven people out of \nbusiness.\n  The Physicians Insurance Association of America shows a fourfold \nincrease from the period of 1991 to 2002 in the percentage of jury \nawards that exceed $1 million. We have a fourfold increase in the \npercentage of jury awards that exceed $1 million. Some say the reason \nthese premiums have gone up is because insurance reserves are not \nproducing the returns they used to produce. I don't think it is \ndisputed that we have a substantial increase in the large verdicts \naround the country. That does drive the market.\n\n  In West Virginia, Charleston Area Medical Center lost its Level I \nTrauma Center status, leaving West Virginia University Ruby Memorial \nHospital as the only Level I Trauma Center in the State. The inability \nof this facility to find neurosurgeons and orthopedists created a \nsituation in which critically injured patients had to be medevac'ed out \nof the State.\n  Open the newspaper and you will read of similar crises in \nPennsylvania, Nevada, Mississippi, and other areas. Rural areas are hit \nhardest by the increasing costs. This places additional burdens on \nthose who can least afford it.\n  In my home State, I was in the town of Atmore, not too far from where \nI grew up. The Atmore Community Hospital was forced to close its \nobstetrics unit because it could not afford the 282 percent increase in \nmalpractice insurance from $23,000 to $88,000. When you deliver a \nlimited number of children, $88,000 is a substantial cost against you. \nNow expectant mothers must travel either to the hospital in Brewton, 30 \nmiles away, or to Mobile or Pensacola, FL, an hour away, eliminating \navailability of health care.\n  Another rising crisis in my State has been brought to my attention \ninvolving the nursing home industry. It was a stunning statistic. At \nthe request of the American Health Care Association, Aon Risk \nConsultants conducted an actuarial analysis that found there was a \nsubstantial increase in premiums, an extraordinary increase from 1995 \nto 2002 for nursing homes, meaning that the cost for settling and \ndefending malpractice claims increased from $320 a bed in a nursing \nhome to $4,410 per bed, over a tenfold increase in the insurance \npremiums paid. This was first brought to my attention by an individual \nI know in my hometown of Mobile who shared those numbers with me. It is \nconsistent with his personal experience. I was shocked. We are looking \nat $4,000 per-bed cost annually for liability insurance per nursing \nhome bed. That is very significant.\n  I hope as we go forward we can move beyond obstruction and a \nfilibuster to be able to offer amendments, if people think they can \nmake it better, that we can do things that would be realistic and \neffective. I think we can do that. This bill has a good core right now. \nI intend to support it and I intend to vote for it and I intend to vote \nto move it up for debate.\n  The odd thing about malpractice in America today and the lawsuits \nthat get filed are, as I suggested to my able friend from Nevada, \nSenator Ensign, we think we are punishing doctors who make a mistake \nand we sue them for punitive damages. This historically was not a big \npart of litigation in America, but in the last 20 or 30 years punitive \ndamages have become a staple in litigation. If a doctor makes a \nmistake, they sue him for the mistake, they sue him for the \ncompensation, damages, pain and suffering of the patient, and they \ninvariably add it was done recklessly, wantonly, or without due regard \nof care and that he is, therefore, responsible for punitive damages. \nThose punitive damages are added on to it as a punishment to that \ndoctor. But already the doctor in the basic recovery is above the \ndeductible he had on his insurance policy. He has already paid that out \nof his pocket. So whether it is $1 million or $10 million or $500,000 \nin punitive damages, that is paid for by the insurance system that we \nset up. And who pays into that insurance system? All the doctors in the \ncommunity.\n\n  I absolutely agree with Senator Ensign that we need tighter controls \non physicians by the medical associations, just as I believe--and have \nbelieved for a long time--we need tighter controls by the legal \nprofessional community, of which I have been a part. We do not do \nenough there.\n  But, regardless of that, you are still going to have negligence. You \nare still going to have these kinds of recoveries. If not capped, they \ncontinue to shift the payment from the person who did wrong to the \ninnocent doctors and physicians out there who will all see their \npremiums increase substantially.\n  I have visited hospitals in my State on a regular basis. I visited \nprobably 30 hospitals in the last 3 or 4 years. I ask them about how \ntheir liability insurance premiums are doing. They tell me they tripled \nin the last several years, invariably--more than double consistently, \nthey tell me, over the last 3 or 4 years. Each one is somewhat \ndifferent but the premiums have gone up at an extraordinary rate.\n  I think this Congress, faced with a demand for improving health care \nand health care delivery to more people, and at the same time trying to \ndo so with contained cost, ought to look at one aspect of the medical \nsystem that produces little or no benefit and that is the amount of \nmoney paid out through this system.\n  Yes, I do believe that lawsuits make some physicians more careful. I \ndo think it has led to the altering of practices for better health \ncare. I do not believe all lawsuits are bad. I do not believe all \nrecoveries are bad. I think it is good sometimes if physicians get hit \nand popped and sent a message. I think the embarrassment of the lawsuit \nitself has a substantial impact on this physician and other physicians \nin the community. But whether the recovery is $500,000 in punitive \ndamages, $250,000 or $2 million is not the point. That physician is not \nreally going to be paying it. The other physicians in the community \nwill be paying it.\n  I think we will get the same impact in terms of improving health care \nif we allow lawsuits to go forward but we don't allow them to turn into \njackpot justice where one patient, one victim, one injured patient who \nsues gets $10 million and another one gets $500,000 or zero for \nvirtually the same circumstance. Too often that has happened. This is \nnot a systematic way we are dealing with malpractice in America. And \nwho is paying for it? John Q. Citizen, the Federal Government, in terms \nof Medicare and Medicaid moneys we send out.\n  I think we can do better. I think this bill is a step in the right \ndirection. My friend from Illinois is a skilled lawyer. There is no \ndoubt in my mind his remarks on this bill will represent the best \ncomments that can be made in opposition to it. But overall I think it \nis a net plus. It is the right step to take. We are going to need to do \nsomething about these costs. I do not believe the benefits in improved \nhealth care are anything like the costs that are being incurred by \nphysicians. They do not consider the amount of care being denied \nAmerican citizens as a result of physicians choosing another course.\n  Finally, I read in the newspaper about Dr. Sumpter Blackman from \nCamden, AL, a small town I grew up in of not much more than 1,000 \npeople with a small hospital with about 20-some-odd beds. Dr. Blackman \nis the main physician there.\n  It was reported that he may have to give up his practice; that he \ncould not get insurance. One of the companies had changed and he was \nnot able to get other insurance. The rates were extraordinarily high. \nHe was wondering whether or not he should stay in the business.\n  I could say to the Members of this Senate, with no doubt, if you took \na poll of the people in Camden, AL, and the environs and asked who was \nthe\n\n[[Page S9042]]\n\nmost important person in that community to them, Dr. Sumpter Blackman \nwould win that hands down.\n  He was my mother's physician. He takes care of people there. He knows \nthem. He is an excellent physician. He is talking about retiring early \nas a result of lawsuits. I think this has gone beyond just talk and \ndebate and big insurance companies and rich companies and poor victims \nand doctors. I think it is a health care issue. We cannot afford to \nlose people such as Dr. Sumpter Blackman from the medical profession. \nHe has saved the lives of thousands in his long career there in Camden, \nAL, and there are a lot more like him. They are thinking maybe this \nbusiness just isn't worth it; I put aside some money and maybe I will \njust go off somewhere and do something else and not have to worry about \nthis and worry about getting insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his \nkind words. He and I disagree on many issues but respect one another \nvery much. I am sure there will be an issue somewhere along the way on \nwhich we agree. We are both waiting, and after 6 or 7 years the day may \ncome. We will announce it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, I think we do agree we need \nto work to improve our legal system to make it the best we possibly \ncan. How do we do that? Sometimes we disagree but I respect the Senator \nfrom Illinois and his skill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I consider that a rhetorical question but I respect the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Let me say there was a statement made earlier by the sponsor of this \nlegislation that tells the whole story. When he came to illustrate the \nsavings in malpractice premiums from States with caps and States \nwithout caps, he said to us, I think the Congressional Record will \nreflect what I am about to say is accurate, that the reason he only \nchose Los Angeles and Denver to illustrate that States with caps lower \nmalpractice premiums was because it takes a long period of time for the \ncaps to be reflected in the premiums charged to doctors. In his words, \nhe said 8 to 12 to 15 years before premiums come down.\n  I think perhaps he may be right. Perhaps he may not be right. Over a \nperiod of 8 to 15 years it is hard to measure what is going to have an \nimpact on malpractice premiums. It could be the investment success of \nthe insurance company as much as a cap or any other thing. But it tells \nan important part of the story. If we are facing a medical \nmalpractice insurance crisis today in America, what is being proposed, \nlimiting the recovery of medical malpractice victims, putting a cap on \nthe amount of money they can take home from a lawsuit, is, in fact, not \ngoing to provide relief to doctors or hospitals facing these high \npremiums today. In fact, it may be 8, 10, 12, or 15 years, according to \nSenator Ensign, the sponsor of this legislation. I think that should \ngive pause to every Senator who believes they can vote for this \nlegislation, see it enacted, go home to doctors in their community and \nsay we have met our obligation. I do not think that is a fact.\n\n  There is another side of the story here that is worth at least \npointing to. When I asked the Senator from Nevada why he included more \nthan just doctors in this bill, more than just hospitals in this bill, \nwhy did he go on to include health care organizations such as insurance \ncompanies, HMOs, managed care organizations, why did he include \npharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, nursing homes, \nwhy are all of them being brought into the debate if our concern is \nwhether or not there will be enough doctors around to deliver babies, \nhe basically said we are trying to reduce the cost to the health care \nsystem. I assume if you limited recovery to zero dollars, you could \nreduce it even more. This bill limits it to $250,000 in noneconomic \nlosses. He gave an illustration of the fact that economic losses \ninclude lost wages. Then he went on to say that if a child were injured \nand would be unable to be employed, for example for the rest of his \nlife, they would have to try to make some calculation as to the lost \nwages.\n  I might remind my friend from Nevada that his bill requires objective \nverifiable losses. How do you calculate that for a 6-year-old boy, such \nas the one I talked about yesterday, who will literally have no work \nlife, no work experience the rest of his life on Earth? How do you \ncalculate that in objective verifiable ways, as to his future lost \nwages?\n  The importance of that, of course, is that is only one of two things \nhe can be compensated for--medical losses as well as loss of income. So \nthe calculation is very difficult under the exact language of the bill \nwritten by the Senator from Nevada.\n  I take exception to a comment made during the course of this debate \nby my friend from Alabama. He has made this comment before. He referred \nto what he called ``jackpot justice.'' He referred to verdicts that \nreally are of little or no benefit, as he said, to society.\n  I suggest to him that we have statistics. Virtually both sides \ninundated the record with statistics. But these come from the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners. Here is what they tell us.\n  The number of new medical malpractice claims declined by 4 percent \nbetween 1995 and 2000. During that 5-year period of time, new medical \nmalpractice claims declined by 4 percent.\n  If we were talking about a proliferation of claims or lawsuits, the \nrecord suggests it is not the number. But, of course, some will argue \nhow much is being awarded to those that are being filed. I would \nconcede that the general awards have gone up. It reflects a number of \nthings. It reflects inflation in medical care, and the cost of medical \ncare. Everybody knows that is a fact. The cost of prescription drugs, \nthe cost of doctors' care, and the costs of hospitals have all gone up. \nThat is reflected when a verdict or an award is given to someone who \nhas been injured. You would expect under normal circumstances for a \nperson who is aggrieved or injured by medical malpractice on a year-to-\nyear basis to see that award going up, understandably so. But how about \nthe big awards, ones over $1 million?\n  According to Business Week, and their March 3, 2003, issue, which I \nquoted earlier--Business Week is hardly a liberal publication--in 2001 \nthere were only 895 out of 16,676 payouts exceeding $1 million, about 1 \npercent. That is up from 506 in 1996.\n  In a 5-year period of time, the number of awards over $1 million went \nfrom 506 to 895.\n  From the debate on the floor you would conclude that the number was \nmuch larger.\n  I take exception especially to a reference to these awards and \nsettlements in larger numbers as ``jackpot justice.''\n  I will not bring out the photographs. But earlier I mentioned some of \nthe people who have been victims of medical malpractice.\n  Heather Lewinsky of Pittsburgh, PA, a 17-year-old who has gone \nthrough a series of plastic surgeries and will be deformed and scarred \nfor the rest of her life by medical malpractice--would a verdict in her \ncase be a jackpot? I don't think so.\n  Evelyn Babb, a 75-year-old woman from Tyler, TX, went in for a simple \nknee surgery and the surgeon operated on the wrong knee. As a result, \nthis 75-year-old lady lost her mobility and will be suffering with pain \nfor the rest of her natural life. Would a verdict in her case be \n``jackpot justice''?\n  Sherry Keller from Conyers, GA, a graphic case which I talked about \nearlier, a lady who went into her doctor's office after a hysterectomy \nand had a terrible situation where her womb was reopened because of \nbleeding and she went into shock--the doctor left her alone in the \nroom, she fell off the examination table striking her head as she fell \nto the floor, eventually leading to a situation of being a \nquadriplegic. If she received an award, this mother and homemaker, of \n$500,000, has she hit the jackpot?\n  I don't think so.\n  Colin Gouley from Nebraska came with his family to see us today. This \nlittle 9-year-old boy, whose life has been compromised dramatically, \nwill have a difficult time doing things we pray that every child can \ndo, such as read, write, engage in conversation, walk, and run. He will \nnever have that chance. A jury in Nebraska thought that his damages \nfrom malpractice committed against him was worth\n\n[[Page S9043]]\n\nmore than $5 million. So did Colin Gouley hit the jackpot with a $5 \nmillion verdict if he has a lifetime of being in a wheelchair because \nof medical malpractice? Is this ``jackpot justice''?\n\n  Kim Jones, 30 years old, went in for a simple tubal ligation and \nended up in a comatose state in a nursing home for the rest of her \nlife. Is an award in her case a jackpot? Did she hit it big if they \ngave her enough money for someone to care for her the rest of her life? \nFrankly, she will never be able to care for her daughter again.\n  Or Alan Cronin, 42 years of age, who went into a hospital in \nCalifornia for a routine hernia surgery and ended up with an infection \nso serious that it lead to gangrene in all of his limbs and amputation \nof both arms and legs--Alan Cronin, would he be the winner of a jackpot \nif those who were responsible for his losing his arms and his legs had \nto pay and compensate him not only for his medical bills and lost wages \nbut also for his pain and suffering?\n  That is the part of the calculation which those who bring the bill to \nthe floor have not spoken of. They talked about the challenges facing \ndoctors. We conceded that. In some areas of the country, malpractice \ninsurance is too high. Don't overlook what this bill does. It closes \nthe door and removes the jury from the decision about fair compensation \nfor people who have been injured through no fault of their own.\n  That is why I think those who are pushing this bill will probably be \nunsuccessful tomorrow. People on this side of the aisle, and \nRepublicans as well, believe this bill, S. 11, goes too far. This is \nexcessive. This is not setting out to simply solve the problem. This is \nsetting out to make a political point--that we are going to go after \nthose who would be so bold as to file a lawsuit.\n  In the pages of this bill, you will see a limitation on what \nattorneys can be paid if they represent one of these clients or one of \nthese patients I have mentioned--people who have lost their limbs, \npeople who are no longer able to function as normal human beings. If \nthey go to hire a lawyer to represent them in a case of malpractice, \nthis law will restrict how much their lawyer can be paid.\n  If you believe in justice, wouldn't you also argue that those who \ndefend the doctors and defend the hospitals should have their \nattorney's fees limited as well? Wouldn't that be fair? Isn't that \njustice with a blindfold? No. The blindfold is raised on one side. It \nis a wink and a nod to the defense industry representing the doctors \nand the hospitals. But when it comes to these poor people with limited \neconomic resources fighting for compensation for injuries that are no \nfault of their own, this bill limits the amount of money that can be \npaid to those lawyers.\n  I will tell you that without the contingency fee system, most of \nthese poor people I have described today will never ever have their day \nin court. No attorney will be able to represent them.\n  Do you recall not too many months ago that sad story in North \nCarolina, I believe at a major university, where there was supposed to \nbe a heart-lung transplant and they mistakenly brought the wrong blood \nand tissue type organs to be transplanted and a mistake was made? It \nwas clearly not the mistake of the family or the little girl who was \ninvolved. Discovering this error, they tried to implant an additional \nset of organs--heart and lung--to save her after this serious mistake \nwas made.\n\n  I can tell you that this little girl, who sadly died because of that \nmalpractice, would have recovered little or nothing for that wrongful \ndeath under this legislation.\n  Where do you point to in terms of lost wages for a little girl who \ndied during the course of the surgery? Where is the pain and suffering \nin a wrongful death lawsuit? Yet that is what it comes down to.\n  Those sponsors of this bill are prepared to close the courthouse door \nand say that for her family, they do not have the opportunity to get a \nlawyer because the contingency fee is limited, and once they have that \nlawyer there is little or nothing they can recover despite clear \nevidence of medical malpractice.\n  That isn't fair. It isn't American. It isn't just. We are talking \nabout rewarding people who have been seriously and egregiously injured.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me tomorrow in voting against the \nmotion for cloture. We should not proceed to this bill. This bill \nshould proceed to a committee. It should go to a committee for a long \nperiod of study of compromise, of amendment, of a good-faith effort on \nboth sides involving the medical profession, and the insurance industry \nwhich gets a windfall from this bill, as they do virtually every bill \nthat comes through here, as well as the legal profession; and a bill \nthat will end up in a resolution of the problems facing our doctors and \nmedical providers whom we value very much, but I don't believe they \nwould stand behind such a product that is so fundamentally unfair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 50 years ago today a young and \ndynamic woman was elected as a member of the Los Angeles City Council. \nShe was just 22 years old, making her the youngest council member in \nthe city's history.\n  The fact that such a record has been held for so long is in itself \nremarkable. But then again, we are talking about a truly remarkable \nwoman, Rosalind Wyman.\n  For many years now, Roz has worked tirelessly, for her family and \nfriends, for the city she loves, for the State of California, for the \nDemocratic Party, and for women everywhere.\n  There is a wonderful photo of Roz when she was only 2 years old, \nsmiling up at a portrait of Franklin Roosevelt. Her mother, Sarah, was \na precinct captain for FDR's first Presidential campaign, running the \noperation out of the family's drugstore on 9th Street and Western \nAvenue in Los Angeles.\n  Roz's father, Oscar, worried that such a partisan stance would cost \nthem customers, but Sarah believed that electing Roosevelt was much \nmore important.\n  Small wonder, then, that Roz developed a deep and abiding passion for \npolitical activism and the Democratic Party. Her first campaign was \nworking on behalf of Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, in her ill-\nfated 1950 Senate race against Richard Nixon, when he unfairly \nportrayed her as ``the Pink Lady.''\n  Then, 2 years later, Roz made history by becoming the youngest person \never elected to the L.A. City Council, and only its second woman \nmember. She went on to serve in that body for the next 12 years, on the \nfinance and budget committees, and eventually becoming president pro-\ntempore.\n  As another woman who entered California politics in the 1950s, I can \nassure you that it was quite a different world back then. It was still \nvery much a male club. In both Los Angeles and San Francisco, one was \nhard-pressed to find a women's bathroom anywhere near the chambers.\n  Something else Roz inherited from her mother was a love for baseball. \nIn fact, there is nowhere that Roz Wyman would rather be than at Dodger \nStadium, at the home plate corner of the Dodger dugout, where she has \nhad her seats for over 40 years now.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that the Dodgers would not have come to \nLos Angeles without the vision, fortitude, and sheer determination of \nRoz Wyman. Just ask Tommy Lasorda, who said: ``What this lady did for \nbaseball in this city, they should erect a monument to her.''\n  Today, it is hard to believe how polarizing the effort was to bring \nthe Dodgers from Brooklyn in the late 1950s. Yet Roz, believing that a \nprofessional sports team was just what L.A.\n\n[[Page S9044]]\n\nneeded to cement its image as a major American city, braved death \nthreats and earned many political enemies in order to see this come \nabout.\n  One year after coming to L.A., however, the Dodgers went on to win \nthe World Series, as they did again in 1963, 1965, 1981, and 1988, \nalong with three National League Championships in the 1970s. No one \ntoday could imagine the city without one of baseball's greatest \nfranchises.\n  One of the other defining moments in the modern history of Los \nAngeles, which placed the city firmly on the map as one of America's \npremier cities, was when it hosted the Democratic Convention in 1960.\n  And here, too, Roz Wyman played a vital, even pivotal role. She was \nan ardent Kennedy supporter, having supported him in 1956, in his \nunsuccessful bid for the Vice Presidential nomination.\n  She understood the natural connection between Hollywood and \nWashington, and before many others recognized Kennedy's enormous \ncharisma and appeal, along with the growing importance of television to \nelectoral politics.\n  And with her late husband, Eugene, who served as chairman of the \nCalifornia Democratic Party, they proved to be extraordinarily \neffective fundraisers and campaigners. They were responsible for \nenlisting the likes of Frank Sinatra to sing by the swimming pool, as \nKennedy worked his political magic with the delegates.\n  It is easy to forget that back then, party conventions were not the \nlargely scripted events that they are today. There was real drama--\nnothing was inevitable--and delegates could change their vote at the \nlast minute.\n  Such was Roz's influence with the Kennedy campaign, that she was able \nto convince Robert Kennedy to change the venue for JFK's fabled ``New \nFrontier'' speech from the Sports Arena to the grander Memorial \nColiseum next door.\n  She went on, 8 years later, to work closely on Robert Kennedy's bid \nfor the White House, which ended so tragically in Los Angeles.\n  During the 1970s, both with her husband Gene and after his unexpected \npassing, Roz was a highly effective advocate for the Democratic Party, \nraising awareness on a wide array of issues.\n  I first met Roz when I was mayor of San Francisco and she served as \nconvention chair and chief executive officer of the 1984 Democratic \nNational Convention, the first woman--Democrat or Republican--ever \nselected to run a Presidential Convention. In that position she oversaw \nthe entire planning and management of the convention and its $13 \nmillion budget.\n  We soon became close friends, forming a bond that has grown ever \nstronger over the years. She was already a living legend, already a \nstar of our party, and she did an absolutely stellar job, not just for \nthe Democratic Party but for the city of San Francisco.\n  President Clinton recognized Roz's contribution, back in 2000, when \nhe said: ``She reminds me of my ties to my roots. Her loyalty to our \nparty and our candidates is something I hope I can emulate for the rest \nof my life.''\n  I share President Clinton's sentiments--and I, too, hope that I can \nemulate Roz Wyman. A pioneering force in American politics, she is my \nField Marshall, my trusted adviser, and most importantly to me, my very \ndear friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9044-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced \nthe Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Tulsa, OK. \nOn September 11, 2001, a 29-year-old Pakistani was hospitalized after \nhe was badly beaten and kicked by three men. The racially motivated \nattack happened outside of a service station as the victim was visiting \na friend who worked there. The victim suffered a broken jaw and lost \nseveral teeth during the attack. He was hospitalized for several days \nin a Tulsa hospital.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9044-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9044-S9045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING STUDENT RECIPIENTS OF GATES MILLENNIUM SCHOLARSHIP\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today it is my great \nhonor to recognize three outstanding Nebraska students who recently \nwere named Gates Millennium Scholars by the Bill and Melinda Gates \nScholarship Foundation.\n  David Sanchez-Aparicio, from Oaxaca, Mexico, is the son of Benito and \nJuana Sanchez. Since he was a child, David's scholastic interest has \nbeen in computer technology. While a student at Lincoln High School in \nLincoln, NE, David took part in the Information Technology Focus \nProgram, specializing in computer programming, networking, and \nmultimedia production. David played tennis and ran track, focusing on \nthe 800-meter race. David also spent his time working at BryanLGH \nMedical Center in the cafeteria. In addition to rigorous coursework and \nextracurricular activities, David, whose mother passed away 2 years \nago, has spent much of his high school career helping his father care \nfor his younger siblings. David's teachers note that he is a quiet, yet \ndiligent student who is dedicated to his studies and his family. David \nwill attend the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the fall where he \nplans to major in computer engineering.\n  Codah Gatewood, 18, is the youngest of three children and a member of \nthe Navaho, Omaha, and Santee Sioux tribes. His parents are Edison \nGatewood and Belva Gatewood. Since he was a young boy, Codah's primary \nacademic interest has been architecture. As a child, he would create \nintricate buildings with Legos; at Lincoln High School, he learned to \nuse computer-aided-design, CAD, in technical design and architecture \nclasses before tackling advanced architecture and engineering. Codah \nwon an academic letter during his senior year of study for his mastery \nin pre-calculus, differentiated physics, advanced architecture, and \napplied economics. In his free time, Codah volunteers at the Indian \nCenter of Lincoln, assisting in powwows and dinners. He also likes to \nexperiment with mobile electronics on his car, frequently updating his \nown website with his success in modifications. Codah's teachers \ndescribe him as a self-reliant and high-ranking scholar. For his \ncommitment to academic excellence, Codah has also earned a University \nof Nebraska Davis Scholarship, awarded to the most academically \ntalented racial minority students. He will attend the university this \nfall.\n  Huong Le, 18, came to Lincoln from Long An, Vietnam, 11 years ago \nwith her parents, Vinh Le and Luong Nguyen, and sisters and brother. \nLong An is a small province in the Mekong Delta of South Vietnam. Huong \nspoke very little English when she arrived in Lincoln, but began to \nmaster the language while a student at Everett Elementary School. Huong \nwas nominated for the Gates scholarship by her Lincoln High School \nchemistry teacher, who taught her a rigorous advanced chemistry course \nand saw promise in her passion for science. The following summer, Huong \nparticipated in a sophisticated research project, coordinated by the \nUniversity of Nebraska, involving organic and biochemical processes of \ninsects. While at Lincoln High School, she also played tennis for 4 \nyears and was a member of the Asian Caucus, Upward Bound, and Youth \nLeadership Lincoln. Huong has also volunteered at the Lincoln Buddhist \nTemple, Lincoln Action Program and United Way. Huong plans to take \nEnglish composition and calculus classes as part of the Summer of \nPromising Scholars Program. Huong will pursue a degree in pharmacy from \nthe University of Nebraska.\n  The Gates Millennium Scholarships aim to reduce the financial \nbarriers for African-American, Hispanic, Native and Asian-Pacific \nstudents with high academic and leadership promise. They also increase \nrepresentation of minority students in the targeted disciplines.\n\n[[Page S9045]]\n\nThe Gates Foundation will pay for the students to attend any college \nwith any undergraduate major, and for a graduate education in \nmathematics, science, engineering, education, or library science.\n  I am proud to represent these promising young students who are \ndedicated to excellence in the classroom and in the community. I am \nconfident that these talented leaders will excel at the University of \nNebraska and beyond. The city of Lincoln and the State of Nebraska are \nfortunate to have these three students as part of their \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9045-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD CHRISTIAN CHURCH\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise \ntoday to honor the Light of the World Christian Church of Indianapolis. \nThis congregation, under the leadership of Bishop T. Garrott Benjamin \nJr., is opening a new worship facility this weekend. The 3,000-member \ncongregation has come together to raise the funds necessary for a truly \nimpressive church. The new facility will feature a congregation hall \ncapable of seating 1,200, a chapel for weddings and funerals, and amply \nspace for classrooms and offices. But what I would most like to \nrecognize is the persistence and dedication demonstrated in achieving \nthis goal by Bishop Benjamin and the benefit he has provided our \ncommunity as a result.\n  In addition to providing spiritual guidance, the church provides \nnumerous family services including the well-known Respect Academy that \nemphasizes teaching children self-respect as well as respect for \nothers. The church's programs and services affect nearly 2,000 young \npeople each year. The influence the church has on the lives of the \nchildren at such an important time in their lives is invaluable.\n  Bishop Benjamin, now in his 34th year as pastor, has made his \nstruggles in life the mission and driving force behind many of the \nyouth programs offered at the Light of the World Christian Church. At \nthe age of 5 Bishop Benjamin was abandoned by his parents and was \nraised entirely by his grandmother. He says it was his own experience \nthat made him so distinctly aware of the value of a nurturing spirit in \na young child's life and that has made him so proud of the youth \nprograms sponsored by his church.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Light of the \nWorld Christian Church for nearly 140 years of service to the \nIndianapolis community. I know that my colleagues will join with me in \ncongratulating the congregation, and especially Bishop Benjamin, for \ntheir accomplishments and in wishing them continued success as they \nenter a new and promising future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9045-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE LIFE OF E.W. KELLEY\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise \ntoday to honor the life of my friend, E.W. Kelley, who passed away on \nJuly 4, 2003, after a long-fought battle with prostate cancer. Mr. \nKelley was known around the world for his philanthropy and generosity, \nyet remained a modest man who never sought the fame that came with his \ngreat gifts.\n  Among his many projects, Mr. Kelley helped found the Jerusalem YMCA \nto help foster peaceful coexistence and even friendship among the \ncity's residents. He was also a past-president of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica Council and was involved with the United Way. In 1997, he \ndonated more than $23 million to Indiana University's School of \nBusiness, where he had graduated nearly 60 years before.\n  Born in 1917, Estel Wood Kelley grew up near Sharpsville, IN, before \nattending Indiana University's School of Business. Mr. Kelley made a \nname for himself in business marketing, creatively introducing America \nto countless products that have become integral parts of domestic life \ntoday. In 1961, he became the youngest vice president ever at General \nFoods, and in 1967 was named ``Marketer of the Year'' by Advertising \nAge magazine. However, it is his philanthropic work and the numerous \nlives he touched through it, for which he will be remembered best.\n  E.W. Kelley served as a shining example for business executives \neverywhere, humbly giving back to hometown institutions and \ninternational organizations alike in order to improve the lives of \nthose around him and those he would never meet. His legacy of giving \nwill continue through his many scholarship awards, including the Kelley \nScholarship Program at Indiana University, which provides full tuition \nto 15 business undergraduate students each year. Mr. Kelley eschewed \nany special attention connected with his gifts, saying that the reason \nhe donated to causes like Indiana University was simply ``to give back \nto society what society helped me get.''\n  The sense of loss to all those who knew E.W. Kelley and were affected \nby his generosity in Indiana, the Nation, and throughout the world is \ntremendous. He is survived by his wife, Wilma Lippert Kelley, and their \nchildren, E.W. Kelley II, Wayne L. Kelley and K. Kelley Germaine.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of my friend Estel Wood Kelley \ninto the Congressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9045-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO CAROL COTTRILL, TINA SLUSHER, AND ROBERT SALLEY\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthree of Kentucky's finest physicians. Drs. Carol Cottrill, Tina \nSlusher, and Robert Salley are exemplars in the field of medicine \nbecause they spend several months of each year providing medical care \nto children in developing and underprivileged countries.\n  Drs. Cottrill, Slusher, and Salley performed an implantation of a new \nmechanical heart valve for a young girl from the village of Eku, \nNigeria. Dr. Slusher first examined Sussana Olesenekwu in a 168-bed \nBaptist hospital near her village in Nigeria. Upon realizing the \ngravity of Olesenekwu's heart condition, Dr. Slusher worked with \nurgency to find a U.S. hospital and surgeon willing to do the surgery \nquickly and for free. Dr. Cottrill, a children's heart specialist, and \nDr. Salley, a heart surgeon, joined Dr. Slusher in donating their time \nand skill to perform a surgery largely unavailable in Nigeria. Dr. \nCottrill is even allowing Olesenekwu to recover in her home. Aided by \nMedtronic, which contributed the mechanical heart valve, and St. \nJoseph's Hospital, which incurred the remaining costs, these \nexceptional doctors saved Olesenekwu's life.\n  Open-heart surgery is almost nonexistent in Nigeria. Though the \ncountry has a population of approximately 130 million, it has just one \nfacility that performs only a few surgeries each year. In Nigeria the \nsurgery would cost $3,000 to $4,000, and most families earn less than \n$10.00 a week. Drs. Cottrill, Slusher, and Salley's altruistic and \nselfless donations of time and skill are unparalleled.\n  Drs. Cottrill and Salley both live and practice in Lexington, KY, and \nDr. Slusher is a native of Bell County, KY. Their commitment to \nimproving the lives of those less fortunate are an inspiration to many. \nTheir contributions have truly made the world a better place. Drs. \nCottrill, Slusher, and Salley are tributes to Kentucky. They are \nKentucky at its finest. I thank the Senate for allowing me to recognize \nDr. Carol Cottrill, Dr. Tina Slusher, and Dr. Robert Salley and voice \ntheir praises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9045-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9045-S9046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CELEBRATION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GEORGETOWN FIRE COMPANY\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of the Georgetown Fire Company. Founded in 1903, the \nGeorgetown Fire Company is only one of fifteen Delaware fire companies \nto achieve a century or more of service a testament of the hard work \nand dedication of those who have been part of this venerable \norganization.\n  Several fire companies in Delaware, particularly around rural \ncommunities, were formed in the wake of disasters. That was the case \nfor nearby Milton, which founded its fire company in 1901. But \nresidents and town leaders in Georgetown formed their own fire company \nbefore a major fire broke out.\n  On April 11, 1903, the commissioners of the Town of Georgetown \nadvised the\n\n[[Page S9046]]\n\ntown's people by posting in the local newspaper, The Sussex Journal, \nthat there would be a meeting that evening for the purpose of creating \na fire company. In this posting, they stated that the formation of a \nfire company would decrease the cost of fire insurance within the town. \nThere were fourteen charter members of the Georgetown Fire Company. \nUntil that day, the community had relied solely on so-called bucket \nbrigades and a hand-drawn ladder wagon.\n  Today, the fire company owns the most modern of technology and \nfirefighting equipment, and what started off as a small squad of locals \nwith minimal training has evolved into a company that today has almost \n100 members, 50 of whom are active. The remaining members are life \nmembers, limited service members or honorary members, all of whom \ncontinue to help protect Georgetown. Originally located in the old fire \nhall building on The Circle in 1930, they moved to their new building \non South Bedford Street in 1966. There, the doors are opened one \nevening each February for an annual fundraiser for the fire company, \nthe legendary ``Oyster Eat,'' which attracts people from throughout the \nDelmarva peninsula and beyond.\n  I rise today to recognize all the members of the Georgetown Fire \nCompany, past and present, and their contributions to their beloved \ncommunity. This is a historic event, especially for a non-profit \norganization based solely on volunteerism. I congratulate you all and \nthank you for your service to the people of Georgetown and to all of \nSouthern Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9046-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO MAJOR ROBERTA KEARNEY CHANG\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great \nAmerican and a true military heroine who has honorably served our \ncountry for over 20 years in the Army Medical Service Corps: MAJ \nRoberta Kearney Chang. As a resident of Bellevue, WA, MAJ Chang began \nher career at Fort Benning, GA, home of the Army's infantry, as a \nmedical platoon leader. There, she earned the coveted Parachutist Wings \nand Expert Field Medical Badge. Following in her father's footsteps, \nthe late First Lieutenant Robert M. Kearney, United States Army, \nRetired, she quickly rose through the ranks and served at Army bases \nthroughout the world.\n  MAJ Chang had two overseas tours, one in Honduras, Central America, \nand one in the Republic of Korea. In Honduras, she participated in \nhumanitarian missions to provide aid and medical care to the people of \nthis country. In Korea, she successfully completed two consecutive \ncompany commands for the 121st Evacuation Hospital and Headquarters, \n18th Medical Command. MAJ Chang was handpicked to become an instructor \nat the U.S. Army Academy of Health Sciences, Fort Sam Houston, TX. In \nthis capacity she taught health care administration subjects to over \n5,000 officers annually. MAJ Chang also served as the senior patient \nadministrator for the Command Surgeon, United States Army Reserve \nPersonnel Command. She counseled and assisted hundreds of reservists \nthat were injured as a result of service in Operation Desert Storm. Her \nknowledge of the intricacies of the physical disability system for both \nthe active duty and reserve component soldiers is unsurpassed, and she \nis considered an expert trainer in these areas. She served as a health \ncare operations officer and the head of communications and customer \nservice at the TRICARE Mid-Atlantic, Lead Agent Office Norfolk, VA for \nfinal assignment TRICARE Mid-Atlantic serves over 1 million military \nbeneficiaries.\n  In each assignment, MAJ Chang excelled and met every challenge, and \nwas rewarded with greater responsibilities and opportunities. Her \ntalent for teaching and mentoring personnel, as well as her creativity \nand skill in management, were instrumental in providing army medicine \nthe fine cadre of hospital administrators serving today. Above all, she \nis a stellar officer and leader who always put the welfare of her staff \nand patients first. MAJ Chang is a committed health care professional, \nand is an active member of the American College of Healthcare \nExecutives and the American Health Information Management Association. \nMAJ Chang always went the extra mile to serve her country and her \nfellow man. Her performance reflects greatly on herself, the United \nStates Army, the Department of Defense, and the United States of \nAmerica. I extend my deepest appreciation to MAJ Roberta Kearney Chang \non behalf a grateful Nation for her over 20 years of dedicated military \nservice. Congratulations, MAJ Chang, and let me be the one of the first \nto welcome you home to Washington State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9046-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DICK KNIPFING's 40TH ANNIVERSARY IN NEW MEXICO BROADCASTING\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a friend \nand public servant of New Mexico, Dick Knipfing of Albuquerque.\n  A few years ago, a New Mexico research company conducted a statewide \npoll on the popularity of certain well-known people. My name was one of \nthe most recognized, but I wasn't No. 1. The person best known and best \nliked by New Mexicans was Dick Knipfing.\n  He is not a politician. He has never been Governor, Senator, mayor, \nor on any city council. Dick is something more special to everyday \ncitizens--he has been a nightly guest in their living rooms for 40 \nyears.\n  In July 1963, Dick started as a reporter for the CBS affiliate in \nAlbuquerque. He did it all. He shot and edited his own film, wrote his \nown scripts, and got to know some of the most influential people in New \nMexico. Eventually, Dick became an anchor. Over the course of his \ncareer, he moved to the ABC affiliate, then to the NBC station, and \nback to ABC. This month, he celebrates his 40th anniversary in \nbroadcast journalism at channel 13, the CBS station where it all \nstarted.\n  Since Dick returned to Channel 13, a station whose news had been in \nthe ratings cellar, the station rapidly shot into head-to-head \ncompetition with other New Mexico news channels. There is one big \nreason--Dick Knipfing.\n  New Mexicans trust Dick as a veteran newsman. He is respected by his \ncolleagues. He has been inducted into the Silver Circle Society by the \nNational Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, one of the \norganization's highest honors for a television journalist.\n  Dick Knipfing is revered by viewers because they easily discern that \nhe is devoted to bringing them a comprehensive and accurate look at the \nday's major news events. Viewers have welcomed him into their homes, \neither as a reporter or anchor, because he has shown them that he cares \nvery deeply for New Mexico and its people. Dick, and his wonderful \nwife, Charlene, have made Albuquerque and New Mexico their home, and \nintegrated themselves into activities to make it a better place to \nlive.\n  Like tens of thousands of New Mexicans, my wife Nancy and I have \ngrown accustomed to Dick's face and his voice. As he marks his 40th \nanniversary in broadcast journalism, we hope there will be 40 more \nyears of Dick Knipfing to represent the best in broadcasting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9046-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9046-S9047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      GREATER MIDWEST AFFILIATE OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the \ncreation of the Greater Midwest Affiliate of the American Heart \nAssociation. This new affiliate which was founded on July 1, 2003, \ncovers seven States, including my State of Michigan.\n  Heart disease is still the No. 1 killer in America. The American \nHeart Association is the second largest funding source for research and \nprevention of heart disease behind only the Federal Government. Its \nmission is to reduce disability and death from cardiovascular diseases \nand stroke. To this end, they work within local communities to educate \npeople on prevention and identification of heart disease.\n  The merger which creates the Greater Midwest Affiliate strengthens \nthe potential for positively influencing the health and welfare of \nAmericans by advancing groundbreaking medical research and spreading \nlifesaving education on heart disease to people of all ages. I am sure \nmy colleagues join me in applauding the Greater Midwest Affiliate of \nthe American Heart Association as they renew a commitment to\n\n[[Page S9047]]\n\ncreate healthier communities and make stronger, longer lives possible \nfor more Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9047-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN RECOGNITION OF THE 21ST ANNUAL METRO DETROIT YOUTH DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize an \nimportant event that will soon be held in my home State of Michigan. On \nJuly 9, 2003, community residents, business owners, and area youth will \ngather at Belle Isle to celebrate the 21st Annual Metro Detroit Youth \nDay.\n  Metro Detroit Youth Day was founded to improve relations between \nyouth and other community members in the metropolitan Detroit area. \nBefore its creation 20 years ago, a series of altercations had occurred \nbetween Detroit area youth and several grocery store owners. Since that \ntime, Youth Day has provided an opportunity for all community members \nto work and play together and has drastically reduced the level of \nviolence in the area. Youth Day includes games, meetings with \ncelebrities, motivational speakers, sports events, and a wide variety \nof other activities designed to promote unity within the Detroit \ncommunity.\n  I am pleased to recognize Metro Detroit Youth Day as an example of a \nproactive community effort that has promoted positive change. I am sure \nthat my Senate colleagues will join me in saluting this event and in \nwishing Metro Detroit Youth Day continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9047-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF MARQUETTE COUNTY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize an \noutstanding county in my home State of Michigan for receiving a \nprestigious community recognition award. Marquette County, which is \nlocated in the beautiful upper peninsula of Michigan, was recently \nnamed an All-America City by the National Civic League.\n  The National Civic League has presented the All-America City Award \nannually for the last 54 years. The award recognizes outstanding \ncommunities such as Marquette for their excellence in combining \ngrassroots efforts with local government and businesses' community \nprograms to address critical local issues. This year Marquette County \nwas selected in recognition of its efforts to increase access to health \ncare, create a countywide nonmotorized trail system, and build support \nfor at-risk youth in the community.\n  Marquette County was one of only 10 communities nationwide to be \nawarded the distinction of All-America City. The selection was made out \nof a pool of more than 700 applicants and 30 finalists. A 10-person \njury comprised of nationally recognized public and civic affairs \nexperts evaluated Marquette County based on a 10 category model \ndeveloped by the National Civic League. Criteria include significant \nevidence of results which have improved the community within the last 3 \nyears, extent of public participation, evidence of collaboration \nbetween multiple jurisdictions, and creative usage of available \nresources.\n  In addition to being an active and caring community, Marquette County \nincludes some of the nation's most beautiful beaches, waterfalls, and \nwildlife. Thousands of tourists each year are attracted by the \nbreathtaking scenery and numerous outdoor leisure activities such as \ngolf, skiing, canoeing, hiking, and fishing.\n  I take great pride in congratulating Marquette County for the award \nof All-America City. This award is well deserved and is a source of \npride for everyone in my home State of Michigan. I know my Senate \ncolleagues will join me in saluting Marquette County and wishing its \ncitizens continued success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9047-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NEBRASKA'S TOM ALLAN\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, Tom Allan wasn't born \nin Nebraska, but that didn't stop him from falling in love with my \nState or from making the entire State feel like part of his family. Tom \ntraveled the highways and byways for over 40 years, seeing the beauty \nof Nebraska, making friends, and sharing his experiences through his \noften humorous and always insightful news articles. When he passed away \nrecently there were Nebraskans in every city, town, and village that \nmourned him and fondly remembered their favorite Tom Allan stories.\n  Tom Allan was born in Scotland and moved to Nebraska when he was only \n9 years old. After graduating from high school and Ottawa College he \nserved his Nation honorably in World War II with tours in the \nPhilippines and Alaska. He retired as a major in the Nebraska National \nGuard.\n  He began working for the Omaha World Herald in 1947 and became the \npaper's roving reporter in 1959. He traveled more than a million miles \nand wore out 20 cars while filing stories from every community in the \nState. He covered the occasional big news story, but Tom Allan \nspecialized in simple stories that touched the heart. For readers in \nOmaha, Tom brought to life the unique people and small towns that can't \nbe found on a map.\n  Tom Allan outran tornados, trekked through the Amazon jungle, and \neven stood in for a U.S. Ambassador in Finland. He covered the State \nfair with such regularity that he was honored with ``Tom Allan Day'' at \nthe Nebraska State Fair in 1997. His humor and humility were clear when \nhe wrote, ``I'd rather they'd just given me a fat-hog blue ribbon and \nlet it go at that.''\n  In that same column Tom described his job as the privilege of \ndiscovering what is over the next hill and who is around the next bend \nin the road along the byways of Nebraska. On behalf of all Nebraskans, \nI would like to thank Tom Allan for the privilege of his company and \nfor the wonderful stories he shared with all Nebraskans for over 50 \nyears. We will always remember his love for the State of Nebraska, and \nwe are grateful that through his stories he taught us about Nebraska \nand helped us understand ourselves.\n  Tom Allan passed away on June 27, 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9047-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9047-S9048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNITION OF THE MAGDALENA RIDGE OBSERVATORY\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Office \nof Naval Research for the successful design review to begin development \nof the next great astronomical telescope. The Navy is the preeminent \nauthority in the areas of Precise Time and Astrometry, and distributes \nEarth Orientation parameters and other Astronomical Data required for \naccurate navigation and fundamental astronomy. Now they are managing an \ninternational team to build the Magdalena Ridge Observatory, MRO, on a \n10,000 foot mountain in central New Mexico. The Navy, along with the \nAir Force, Army, and a consortium of universities from the United \nStates and the United Kingdom, will break ground on October 20 this \nyear.\n  This month, the prestigious scientific journal, Physics Today, \npublished a superbly written article that explains the MRO. The project \nwill create a unique array of mirrors that can take pictures of bright \ncelestial objects with a resolution equivalent to a huge telescope \nmeasuring 400 meters in diameter.\n  I ask that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n   New Mexico Plans Optical Interferometer and Fast-Slewing Telescope\n\n       How does a minor university land a major observatory? In \n     New Mexico Tech's case, it helped that the university has \n     access to a high, dark site, that the Magdalena Ridge \n     Observatory (MRO) will have national security applications, \n     and that the project has allies in Congress.\n       ``We had a coalition of universities looking for an \n     observatory,'' says Van Romero, vice president for research \n     at New Mexico Tech (officially the New Mexico Institute of \n     Mining and Technology), which has around 1800 students and \n     110 faculty members. New Mexico Tech and its partners--New \n     Mexico State University, New Mexico Highlands University, and \n     the University of Puerto Rico--learned that the US Army's \n     neighboring White Sands Missile Range wanted better missile \n     tracking capability and the Air Force Research Laboratory in \n     Albuquerque was interested in developing adaptive optics. \n     ``We seemed to have a critical mass--universities, along with \n     more than one military user,'' says Romero. Representative \n     Joe Skeen and Senator Pete Domenici, both New Mexico \n     Republicans, supported creating the MRO because the potential \n     for education outreach, adaptive optics research, and world-\n     class astronomy ``all came together in a happy confluence of \n     ideas,'' says Stephen Traver, a legislative fellow in \n     Domenici's office who used to work for the now retired\n\n[[Page S9048]]\n\n     Skeen. Domenici led the way in winning a congressional markup \n     for the $48 million observatory.\n       The observatory's future home is on a ridge in the \n     Magdalena mountains near Socorro, about 130 kilometers south \n     of Albuquerque. Besides the clear skies and roughly 3200-\n     meter-high perch, the site's advantages include that it is \n     near both White Sands and New Mexico Tech, it has room for \n     the observatory to expand, and it has a road and other \n     infrastructure already serving ecological and atmospheric \n     studies and the university's lightning lab (see box).\n       The MRO will consist of an optical-infrared interferometer \n     with eight to ten 1.4-meter telescopes in a reconfigurable Y-\n     shaped array up to 400 meters long plus a single 2.4-meter \n     telescope. Groundbreaking is scheduled for 20 October.\n\n\n                            stars and scuds\n\n       The MRO array will have a large number of bigger elements \n     distributed over a wider range of baselines than any other \n     optical interferometer in the works, says Chris Haniff, whose \n     University of Cambridge group is involved in the project. \n     MRO's angular resolution, he adds, ``will be a factor of a \n     hundred higher than the Hubble Space Telescope. That means \n     that for any class of astronomical object, you can see more \n     detail.''\n       ``One of the exciting things we think we will be able to do \n     is to look at the central engines of active galactic \n     nuclei,'' says David Westpfahl, project scientist for the MRO \n     interferometer. ``All the models have a massive object at the \n     center, such as a black hole, and an accretion disk and polar \n     outflow, but the detailed shape and arrangement of these \n     things are still being worked on. We hope to be able to \n     resolve several of these objects and decide among the \n     models.'' The MRO interferometer will also be used to deduce \n     the relative rotational axes of stars in clusters, which \n     could shed light on the importance of turbulence in star \n     formation, and to study other aspects of star birth, as well \n     as star aging and planet formation.\n       Fast slewing is the special feature of MRO's single \n     telescope. It will be able to zip to a particular part of the \n     sky at 10 deg. per second. The slewing was initially \n     incorporated to accommodate the US Army. The MRO offers a \n     good look at target missiles fired from Fort Wingate in \n     western New Mexico, says Tomas C. Chavez, chief of test \n     technology at White Sands. ``We could collect phenomenology \n     data during the target's boost and coast phases to help home \n     in on the target with an interceptor.'' Adds Romero, ``This \n     is a match made in heaven. The army wants to use [the \n     telescope] during the day and early morning, we want to use \n     it at night.'' The 2.4-meter mirror was donated by the air \n     force. Originally intended for classified space-based \n     research, it has hardware added to keep it from sagging in \n     Earth's gravitational field.\n       Astronomers will take advantage of the fast slewing, too. \n     ``One big use of the telescope will be `alert response to \n     transient astrophysical phenomema,' '' says project scientist \n     Eileen Ryan. ``An example would be to find the optical \n     counterpart of gamma-ray bursts.'' For that, the telescope \n     would automatically interrupt other observations when it \n     receives signals from Swift, a satellite NASA is supposed to \n     launch in December. The MRO telescope, Ryan adds, will be \n     bigger and will slew faster than other ground-based \n     telescopes currently hunting for GRBs (see Physics Today, \n     July 2002, pages 24 and 25). Mostly, though, the 2.4-meter \n     telescope will be devoted to studying ``small Solar system \n     bodies--asteriods, comets, and Kuiper Belt objects,'' says \n     Ryan. ``We want to use the telescope to ask how fast \n     asteroids are spinning. How big are they? What are their \n     shapes?\n\n\n                           possible with pork\n\n       What with the MRO being funded directly by Congress, the \n     project often gets labeled as pork. Says Romero, ``Without \n     this type of funding, we would not be able to build it. But \n     we think this is a facility that funding agencies like NASA \n     and NSF will take the opportunity to fund research at.'' And, \n     unusual for a federally funded project, New Mexico Tech and \n     its partners will foot the running costs, estimated at $2 \n     million a year. If all goes as planned, the single telescope \n     would see first light in 2005, and the interferometer could \n     be up and running a couple years laters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9048-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9048-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/08/senate-section/article/S9048-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9048-S9049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-3008.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to specify the purposes for which funds provided under subpart \n1 of part A of title I may be used; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with \nSenator Ensign to ensure that Title I funds are directed towards \ninstructional services to teach low-income students.\n  Title I provides assistance to virtually every school district in the \ncountry to serve children attending schools with high concentrations of \nlow-income students, from preschool through high school.\n  It has been the ``anchor'' of Federal assistance to schools, since \nits origin in 1965. And while it has always been Congresses intent for \nTitle I funds to be used for instruction and instructional services, \nthe Federal Government has never provided a clear definition of what \ninstructional services should entail.\n  This lack of Federal guidance has become especially clear now, as \nStates scramble to comply with the new and expanded Title I \naccountability standards established in ``No Child Left Behind.''\n  While State Administrators of Title I are directed by law to meet \nthese specific requirements, they have been given little guidance as to \nhow to ensure that they are in compliance with the law.\n  I believe that the Federal Government is responsible for making this \nprocess as clear to States, as possible. In my own view, as it relates \nto Title I, we haven't lived up to our end of the bargain.\n  During consideration of ``No Child Left Behind,'' I worked hard to \nget my bill defining appropriate Title I uses included in the Senate \nversion of the bill.\n  Unfortunately, during conference consideration, my bill was stripped \nout and in its place language directing the General Accounting Office, \nGAO, to report on how States use their Title I funds was inserted.\n  In April, GAO released the report that Congress directed them to \nsubmit on Title I Administrative Expenditures.\n  What GAO found is that while districts spent a relatively small \namount--no more than 13 percent--of Title I funds on administration \nthat ``because there is no common definition on what constitutes \nadministrative, or indirect, expenditures'' the accounting office \ncouldn't precisely measure how much of their Title I funds were used \nfor administration.\n  Because Title I funds are not defined consistently throughout the \nStates, the accounting office created their own definition by compiling \naspects of State priorities to complete the report.\n  You see, the very reason I worked to define how Title I funds should \nbe used--to create consistency and distribution priority nationwide--\nbecame the definitive aspect preventing GAO from effectively drawing \nconclusions in their report.\n  My bill takes some strong steps by balancing the needs for States to \nretain Title I flexibility and providing them with the guidance needed \nto administer the program uniformly throughout the country.\n  My bill does two things: It defines Title I direct and indirect \ninstructional services and sets a standard for the amount of Title I \nfunds that can be used to achieve the academic and administrative \nobjectives of this program.\n  It ensures that the majority of Title I funds are used to improve \nacademic achievement by stipulating that ``a local educational agency \nmay not use more than 10 percent of [Title I] funds received. . . . for \nindirect instructional services .''\n  By limiting the amount of funds that schools can spend on \nadministrative or indirect services, school districts are restricted \nfrom shuffling the majority of Title I to pay for non-academic \nservices, but it also gives the districts flexibility to use the \nremaining funds for the indirect costs of administering Title I \ndistribution.\n\n[[Page S9051]]\n\n  The second component of my bill defines direct and indirect services \nso that all States apply the same standards for Title I use nationwide.\n  Examples of permissible Direct Services are: Employing teachers and \nother instructional personnel (including employee benefits); \nintervening and taking corrective actions to improve student \nachievement; extending academic instruction beyond the normal school \nday and year, including summer school; providing instructional services \nto pre-kindergarten children for the transition to kindergarten; \npurchasing instructional resources such as books, materials, computers, \nand other instructional equipment and wiring to support instructional \nequipment; professional development; developing and administering \ncurriculum, educational materials and assessments; transporting \nstudents to assist them in improving academic achievement.\n  Examples of indirect services limited to no more than 10 percent of \nTitle I expenditures are: business services relating to administering \nthe program; purchasing or providing facilities maintenance, \njanitorial, gardening, or landscaping services or the payment of \nutility costs; and paying for travel to and attendance at conferences \nor meetings, except for travel and attendance necessary for \nprofessional development.\n\n  Current law on Title I is much too vague.\n  It says, ``A State or local educational agency shall use funds \nreceived under this part only to supplement the amount of funds that \nwould, in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available from \nnon-Federal sources for the education of pupils participating in \nprograms assisted under this part, and not to supplant such funds.''\n  Basically, it says that Title I funds are to be used for the \n``education of pupils.'' That is just too nebulous.\n  The U.S. Department of Education has given States a guidance document \nthat explains how Title I funds can be used.\n  Under this guidance document, only two uses are specifically \nprohibited: 1. Construction or acquisition of real property; and 2. \npayment to parents to attend a meeting or training session or to \nreimburse a parent for salary lost due to attendance at ``parental \ninvolvement'' meeting.\n  I believe we should give the Department, States and districts clearer \nguidance in law.\n  My reasons for introducing this bill are two-fold: First, I believe \nthat States must use their limited Federal dollars for the fundamental \npurpose of providing academic instruction to help students learn.\n  Secondly, I believe that it is nearly impossible to do so without \nproviding a clear definition of what is considered an instructional \nservice.\n  I am not suggesting that it is the fault of the school districts for \nnot focusing their Title I funds on academic instruction. They are \nsimply exercising the flexibility that Congress has given them.\n  What I am saying is that if Congress also intended for those funds to \neducate our neediest children, Federal guidance must be given to ensure \nthat it happens.\n  It is my view that Title I cannot do everything. Federal funding \naccounts for a small percentage of total funding for elementary and \nsecondary education and Title I is even a smaller percentage of total \nsupport for public schools.\n  That is why I am trying to better focus Title I funds on academic \ninstruction, teaching the fundamentals and helping disadvantaged \nchildren achieve success.\n  Schools must focus their general education budget to pay for expenses \nthat fall outside of the realm of direct educational services and \nretain the majority of Federal funds to improve academic achievement \nfor poor children.\n  It is time to better direct Title I funds to the true goal of \neducation: to help students learn. This is one step toward that goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1372\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the reauthorization of programs \nadministered by the Small Business Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Small \nBusiness Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003,'' \na bill to reauthorize the U.S. Small Business Administration, SBA, and \nits programs for the next three years. While reauthorization \nlegislation is a significant event, this year it is particularly \nauspicious since we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the \nagency--a full half century of helping to create, assist, and guide \nsmall businesses.\n  As the Chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \nI began developing this legislation just after assuming the leadership \nof the Committee in January. The bill I introduce today is the product \nof considerable effort and vetting, and I am very pleased to be joined \nby the Committee's Ranking Member, Senator Kerry, in this process. \nThrough his contributions and those of other Members of my Committee, \nthis is truly bipartisan bill.\n  Over the past several months, we have held a series of hearings and \nroundtables to examine virtually every aspect of the SBA and the wide \narray of programs and services it provides to the country's small \nenterprises. As we started that process, we looked back on the SBA's \nhistory to learn from its past in order to set a path for its future.\n  More than 50 years ago, congressional efforts began to focus on the \nspecific needs of small businesses--to create a ``level playing \nfield''--and to develop Federal small business assistance programs. One \nof the objectives was to\n\n[[Page S9052]]\n\nensure that small businesses could develop management and marketing \nskills to compete with big business for their share of government \ncontracts.\n  In May of 1953, the Small Business Act was introduced, and it became \nlaw on July 30 of that year with President Eisenhower's signature. \nSince 1953, Congress and the various administrations have responded to \nthe needs of small businesses by creating a fair but competitive \nenvironment for those who choose entrepreneurship. The SBA has evolved \nfrom a direct lender and provider of management assistance to a \nnationwide delivery system of resources offering a complete menu of \nsmall business tools, professional counseling assistance, business \neducation and training programs, Federal procurement opportunities, and \nloan guaranty programs.\n  Today, the agency faces enormous challenges. Each year, there are 3 \nto 4 million new businesses start-ups--one in 25 adult Americans is \ntaking steps to start a business. One quarter of existing small \nbusiness owners intend to form another business. And, small businesses \naccount for approximately two-thirds of the net new jobs in our \ncountry. So while the SBA has had a tremendous impact on the success of \nsmall businesses over the past 50 years, it is critical that we ensure \nthe agency is well positioned to produce even better results in the \nnext 50 years.\n  My goal in developing this bill has been to ascertain what works \namong SBA programs, why it works, and apply that approach to other \nprograms so there is more consistent success within the SBA portfolio \nof products and services. In the end, I hope this bill will lead to a \nrenewed SBA, rededicated to improving the environment or leveling the \nplaying field for small business ownership in America.\n  While the particulars of this bill are extensive, I want to highlight \nthree of its most critical, key areas--\n  In terms of financing programs for small businesses, during this \nreauthorization process, I have focused extensively on improving the \ncredit and venture capital resources that the SBA provides for small \nenterprises. These programs--including the 7(a), 504, and Microloan \nprograms as well as the SBIC, New Markets Venture Capital, and Surety \nBond programs provide vital capital for America's small businesses. In \naddition, looking just at the lending programs, they alone are \nresponsible for helping small businesses create and retain more than \n1.3 million jobs in just the past 3 years!\n  That is why I held two Committee roundtables on these financing \nprograms so I could hear firsthand from small business, lenders, and \nthe SBA about ways these programs can increase access to capital for \nsmall businesses. To start, we are proposing to continue the growth of \nthe financing programs through reasonable increases in their \nauthorization levels. The bill also increases the amount that small \nbusinesses can borrow subject to the SBA's guarantee, so that the SBA's \nloan sizes will keep pace with what it actually costs to start and \noperate a small business in today's economy. And we make improvements \nto the SBA's loan programs that will benefit fast-growing contributors \nand vital elements of our economy including women-owned and veteran-\nowned businesses and small business exporters.\n  Moreover, the bill addresses access to capital by helping SBA's \nlending partners. A new initiative that holds great promise will allow \nfor the pooling of small business loans not guaranteed by the SBA. This \npilot program was recommended by participants at our roundtable on \nApril 30, 2003, and has been under consideration by the SBA. By pooling \nthese non-guaranteed loans together and offering them as securities on \nthe secondary market with a partial SBA guarantee on the pool, banks \nwill be able to free-up capital for additional small business lending. \nAs a result, they will be able to provide even greater resources for \nsmall businesses struggling to secure the necessary capital to start \nup, operate, and grow.\n  Similarly, the new National Preferred Lenders Pilot Program will \nallow qualified SBA lenders to be licensed on a nationwide basis. \nCurrently, Preferred Lenders must qualify in every region where they do \nbusiness, which is both cumbersome and costly. This initiative will \nstreamline that process for the premier lenders who qualify for a \nnationwide license and enable them to provide capital more efficiently \nand effectively to small businesses across the nation.\n  In addition, the bill includes a proposal by Senator Kerry to permit \nnon-profit child-care centers to qualify for 504 loans. I believe the \ngrowing need for child care in this country warrants testing this idea \nas a pilot program, even as I continue to have reservations about this \ninitiative's effect on the availability of loans under the 504 program \nfor other for-profit borrowers and the expansion of this loan program \nto non-profit entities. Accordingly, we have limited the loan volume \nunder the pilot to 7 percent of the overall 504 loans to ensure that \nthis initiative does not bar qualifying for-profit businesses from \nobtaining necessary financing.\n\n  Finally in the area of financing programs, we have also focused on \nimproving the SBA's procedures for overseeing lenders participating in \nthe credit programs. By improving this oversight, we can protect \nagainst improper lending practices, produce a more consistent system \nfor lenders, and provide taxpayers with better protection of their tax \ndollars.\n  In the area of entrepreneurial development, we set out to ensure that \nthe SBA's programs continue to provide the products and services \nessential to small businesses, which in turn create a return on our \ninvestment in these programs through successful business ownership and \njob creation. Recognizing the tremendous accomplishments by women \nentrepreneurs, I introduced the Women's Small Business Improvement Act \nof 2003 (S. 1154) earlier this year to improve the SBA's Office of \nWomen's Business Ownership, the Women's Business Centers Program, the \nNational Women's Business Council, and the Interagency Committee on \nWomen's Business Enterprise. I have incorporated those provisions into \nthe bill before us in order to provide a universal approach to all of \nSBA's sponsored programs and services for women.\n  A cornerstone of this effort involves making the Women's Business \nCenter Program a permanent program that will offer opportunities for \nnew centers and renewal grants for existing centers on a competitive \nbasis. By replacing the pilot Sustainability Program, which expires at \nthe end of the current fiscal year, with a fair and balanced grant \nprogram, the bill will correct the funding constraints that have \nplagued the program in 2003. The bill will also provide for the \ncreation of new centers and the continuation of current operating \ncenters through renewal grants. This structure will reward successful \ncenters with continuation funding and weed out failing centers to make \nroom for new ones with greater potential for serving the needs of \nwomen-owned businesses.\n  The National Women's Business Council will also be given greater \ncontrol of its mission, and I am proposing the full funding of $1 \nmillion for each Fiscal Year for this program. The Interagency \nCommittee on Women's Business Enterprise will be reenergized by \nproviding interim leadership and a shared focus with the National \nWomen's Business Council, the Women's Business Centers, and the Office \nof Women's Business Ownership. These programs hold great potential for \nwomen-owned businesses, but they must be coordinated so that their \nlimited resources are dedicated to a focused goal.\n  In addition, the SBA's entrepreneurial development partners--the \nSmall Business Development Centers and the Service Corps of Retired \nExecutives--continue to provide quality training and free counseling \nthrough almost 2,000 locations and are limited only by funding and \ntheir geographic locations. Therefore, in addition to minor technical \nchanges in these programs, I propose that we increase the authorization \nlevel for these programs to support the increased demand for their \nservices.\n  And we have included the Native American Small Business Development \nProgram in the bill. This initiative will provide entrepreneurial \nassistance to Tribal Governments and Colleges, Small Business \nDevelopment Centers in Native American communities, and small \nbusinesses located on or near Tribal Lands. Complementing the SBA's \nOffice of Native American Affairs, this initiative will strengthen the\n\n[[Page S9053]]\n\nSBA's efforts to help Native Americans start, operate and grow small \nbusinesses.\n  Finally, one of the most serious problems facing small business is \ntheir inability to participate fully in Federal contracts, on either a \nprime or subcontract basis. In the last 10 years, contract bundling has \nforced more than 50 percent of small businesses out of the Federal \nmarketplace. Steps clearly must be taken to ensure that small \nbusinesses have the opportunity to compete for the business of the \nnation's largest consumer--the Federal government.\n  President Bush recognizes the inequity that contract bundling \nrepresents. He also understands the damage it does to both small \nbusinesses and the Federal procurement process by denying the \ngovernment the benefits of more robust competition, small business \nefficiencies, and small business innovations. He has spoken out against \nthis practice, and I applaud his commitment to addressing this problem.\n  To achieve that objective, the SBA reauthorization bill addresses the \npractice of Federal contract bundling by limiting its use and giving \nsmall businesses access to Federal contracts and a fair opportunity to \ncompete for them. By requiring studies to be done for all \nconsolidations worth more than $5 million for the Department of Defense \nand $2 million for all other agencies, the bill also holds agencies to \na higher level of accountability than exists under current law.\n  Those who support the practice of bundling allege that denying small \nbusinesses access to prime contracts can be offset by ensuring that \nsuch firms receive more subcontracts from the large firms that are \nawarded prime contracts. However, small businesses continue to \nexperience difficulties at the subcontract level as well. This bill \ncontains strong language that strengthens oversight and enforcement of \nsmall business subcontracting plans to ensure small business \nsubcontractors are not neglected.\n  Furthermore, we have included provisions to encourage contracting \nopportunities for women-owned businesses--one of the fastest growing \nsegments of the small business sector of our economy. Despite their \nsuccess, women-owned small businesses have testified before the Small \nBusiness Committee about how difficult it is to do business with the \nFederal Government. Three years ago Congress created a Procurement \nProgram for Women-Owned Small Business Concerns. That legislation \nrequired the promulgation of regulations to help implement new small \nbusiness procurement set-asides for women-owned businesses.\n  The legislation, however, conditioned the regulations by first \nrequiring a study to be conducted to justify the disparate treatment of \nwomen in various procurement instances. At the Small Business \nCommittee's roundtable on April 9, 2003, women-owned small businesses \nexpressed their frustration that it has taken so long to conduct the \nstudy and implement the program. This bill directs the GAO to complete \nthat study by December 31, 2003 to ensure that the women's procurement \nprogram is finally implemented.\n  Finally, the bill contains improvements to the HUBZone program, which \nare intended, in part, to address the serious consequences that \nmilitary base closings pose for our local communities. Closing a \nmilitary base adversely affects the towns and communities surrounding \nthe installation due to loss of tax revenue, defense income, base \ntransition costs and clean-up costs.\n  Successful recovery from a base closing has been tied to public and \nprivate reinvestment in these communities. While Congress has taken \naction in the past to ease the transition for individuals and spur \nreinvestment, this bill supports faster redevelopment by expanding the \nHUBZone Program to include communities affected by base closures. It \nprovides an incentive, through Federal government contracts, for small \nbusinesses to operate in these communities and to provide employment to \nthese military and civilian personnel.\n  This year's SBA reauthorization bill paves the way to a stronger SBA \nable to meet the needs and concerns of the country's entrepreneurs. The \nfuture of our country is inextricably tied to the future of small \nbusiness--and by enhancing the conditions that support small business, \nwe will ensure a more prosperous future for all. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation on behalf of the \nnation's small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, as Ranking Democrat on the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I join the \nCommittee's Chair, Senator Olympia Snowe in introducing a three-year \nreauthorization bill for the Small Business Administration's programs. \nThese programs help small businesses, often called the engine of the \nAmerican economy, with access to capital, business advice and training \nand Federal procurement opportunities. But before I speak more \nspecifically about the provisions of the bill, I would like to thank \nChair Snowe for working hand-in-hand with me on this, my third, \nreauthorization of the Small Business Administration. Having worked \nclosely on two previous reauthorizations, and as a member of the Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee for over 18 years, I can tell \nyou that the SBA reauthorization process takes diligence and a strong \nattention to detail. I want to commend Senator Snowe for taking the \ninitiative to draft legislation that makes such important and necessary \nchanges to the SBA during this reauthorization process and for showing \ngreat leadership in her first seven months as Chair of the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Our bill will strengthen the SBA and dramatically improve the \nagency's ability to deliver services to small businesses in every \nstate. It is based on a sound Committee record. In addition to holding \ntwo hearings and three roundtables to specifically address SBA's \nprograms and related reauthorization issues, our Committee met and \nspoke with numerous constituents, program directors and small business \nadvocates. It is through this correspondence, research and input that \nour Committee has been able to prepare a comprehensive piece of \nlegislation that will likely serve the Small Business Administration \nand the entire small-business community well past even the next \nreauthorization period.\n  Over the past three years, as Chairman and Ranking Member of this \nCommittee, I have seen this administration reduce government funding \nand transfer that money to the wealthy with tax cut after tax cut, \nresulting in a significant loss of revenue for essential programs aimed \nat fostering small businesses and the economic activity they bring \nabout. While many of us like to note that small businesses are the \nengine of economic growth and should be bolstered by our government, \nthis administration has given small businesses more words than action.\n  The need for small business programs--for access to capital, for \ntraining and counseling, for assistance in gaining access to the \nFederal marketplace--runs counter cyclical to the economy. When the \neconomy is slumping, as it now is, small businesses and entrepreneurs \nneed the SBA even more. Our Committee has heard from the small-business \ncommunity that demand for training and assistance and access to capital \nis up, yet this administration has proposed freezing funding for \nvirtually all SBA programs for six years. Their proposal includes no \nadjustment for inflation or demand, despite SBA's own numbers that show \ndemand is up for its programs.\n  It is carrying out our legislative and oversight responsibilities \nthat Chair Snowe and I raised a number of concerns regarding the SBA's \nreauthorization proposal and the overall management and direction of \nmany of the agency's programs through hearings, and roundtables and in \nletters and phone calls to the administration. And after hearing from \nthe community and working with small business experts in the field, \nSenator Snowe and I came to the conclusion that many of the proposals \nput forth by the Small Business Administration would not help the \nagency's programs but ultimately hinder them.\n\n  This administration and small businesses across this Nation will \nfind, however, that our prescription for small businesses in a flailing \neconomy\n\n[[Page S9054]]\n\nis quite different. Our reauthorization legislation embraces the \nprograms that have worked for years, redirects those that have \nstruggled and sets the SBA and up for continued success.\n  Although banks have plenty of cash to lend, small businesses are \nstill having a problem getting access to credit. For the past few years \nas the economy has fizzled, the Federal Reserve has reported that banks \nhave cut back on lending to small businesses, making it harder and more \nexpensive to get loans. And who has been there to pick up the slack? \nThe Small Business Administration and its lending partners.\n  Lending is up in SBA's largest lending program for working capital. \nLending is up in SBA's microloan program, which serves those with the \nleast access to capital through the private sector. And SBA's venture \ncapital programs account for a significant role--more than 50 percent--\nin this country's investment in our fastest-growing small businesses. \nLast year these loans pumped about $20 billion into the economy, \nleveraged millions more from the private sector, fed the local tax base \nas the Federal government cut back, and created at least 400,000 jobs.\n  As the Committee reviewed SBA's programs for reauthorization, these \nfacts figured largely into establishing the program levels. I thank our \nChair, Senator Snowe, for working with me to set the levels for SBA's \nlending and venture capital programs at increasing levels for the next \nthree years. I am particularly pleased with the increased funding \nlevels for the microloan programs.\n  I disagree with the administration's proposals over the past few \nyears to cut back its investment in microloans and training assistance \nto micro-entrepreneurs. And I disagree with the Adminstration's \ncontention that these borrowers are being served through the 7(a) loan \nprogram. The small borrower in the microloan program is different than \nthe small borrower being served through the 7(a) loan program. Both are \nimportant, but they are different, and one is not a substitute for the \nother.\n  And who are these borrowers being served through the microloan \nprogram? Thirty percent are African American. Eleven percent are \nHispanic. Thirty-seven percent are women. And anywhere from 30 to 40 \npercent go to small businesses in rural areas. Banks turn these \nborrowers away, and yet the administration proposed cutting the \nmicroloan program by 36 percent in its most recent budget. SBA needs to \nfully fund these programs and put more resources into the office that \nmanages the program. Four people is not enough to manage 1,400 loans \nand 180 grants.\n  Aside from setting the levels for each small business financial \nassistance program, we made important program changes and started new \ninitiatives. In the 7(a) loan program, SBA's largest loan program, \nwhich provides working capital to small businesses with long terms of \nup to 25 years, we made permanent the reduction in the fees borrowers \nand lenders pay. We are testing a proposal that allows the most \nproficient 7(a) lenders in good standing to lend in every state. \nLenders have complained that applying for lending autonomy in each of \nthe 70 district office and branches is administratively burdensome, \nboth for them and for the Agency staff, and that some district offices \nhave taken advantage of the power to approve or disapprove lenders when \nthey apply for this special lending status.\n\n  I want to make clear while I want to avoid unnecessary paperwork and \neliminate reported abuses, I do not want the lenders to take this as \nauthority to quit working with the district directors. It is important \nto have a local connection and for the SBA and the lenders to work \ntogether to maximize service to the small businesses. For this purpose \nI have included a provision which directs the SBA to consider the \nrecommendations and comments of any district directors and regional \nadministrators when reviewing a lender for national lending authority.\n  To increase the value of 7(a) loans sold in the secondary market, the \nCommittee has included a provision to allow SBA to pool and sell the \nguaranteed portion of loans with varied rates. Currently SBA has the \nauthority to only sell those loans with identical rates. This should \ncreate efficiencies in market and bring down borrowing costs for the \nsmall business borrower. At Senator Snowe's request, in order to reach \nmore under-served small businesses, we have enhanced the Low-Doc \nprogram, allowing lenders to use the simplified application form for \nloans up to $250,000 from $100,000, making it the same as the SBA \nExpress program. We have also expanded the incentives for lenders to \nprovide financing to export small businesses, and proposed letting 7(a) \nborrowers use a simplified size standard when determining if an \napplicant is a small business.\n  To improve the 504 loan program, which makes long-term loans of up to \n20 years to small, growing businesses to buy equipment and buildings, \nwe have also raised the debenture size to keep pace with the rising \ncost of commercial real estate and equipment. We have brought the job \nrequirement standard up from $35,000 to $50,000 after ten or twelve \nyears. We have directed SBA to simplify the application and \ndocumentation process of applying for and closing 504 loans, long a \ngoal of this Committee and made a priority based on the testimony of \none of our witnesses during the reauthorization process. We have \ncreated two alternatives for 504 lenders to use when establishing a \nloan loss reserve to cover potential losses.\n  I am particularly pleased that we have included S. 822, the Child \nCare Lending Pilot Act in the reauthorization bill. It allows small, \nnon-profit childcare businesses access to 504 loans. I thank Senator \nSnowe and my colleagues for agreeing to try this for three years, \nsimilar to what we have done with the microloan program. And I thank \nthe trade association of 504 lenders, the National Association of \nCertified Development Companies, and other 504 lenders for their \nendorsement of an input on the pilot.\n  The more research I've done, the more I've come to realize how \nvitally important it is that we give non-profit day care providers the \nsame opportunities as for-profits to expand their businesses. Non-\nprofit day care centers are often the only child care suppliers \navailable in needy areas, from the most urban to the most rural. Giving \nthese businesses access to 504 loans for three years will allow us to \ngauge whether this valuable loan program is the best way to aid these \nvaluable providers of care to our Nation's children. I have taken note \nof states like Oregon, where 79 percent of day care providers are non-\nprofit, Michigan, where that number jumps to 86 percent, Iowa with 77 \npercent, my own State of Massachusetts with 90 percent, Ohio with 62 \npercent, and the list goes on and on. I've learned that in State after \nState families are waiting for affordable day care; from more than one \nthousand families on the waiting list in Nevada and Maine to more than \nthirty thousand on the list in Texas. These parents are waiting for \nquality day care they can afford, and making available affordable loans \nto all licensed child care providers may increase access to care and \ncut down those waiting lists.\n\n  I understand the concerns of those who are concerned about the \nprecedent of SBA lending to non-profits. And I agree it should not be \nexpanded to all industries. However, this is a very unique industry \nthat in many States is delivered mostly through non-profits, and the \nonly way to penetrate the market is to reach both for-profit and non-\nprofit. Further, non-profits are usually the providers that care for \nthe neediest kids. I have added provisions to ensure the underwriting \nstandards are just as tough, if not more so, as those applied to for-\nprofit centers. The loans must be personally guaranteed, the collateral \nmust be owned outright by the child care provider, and it must be able \nto make its loan payments and cover normal operating expenses from the \nrevenue generated from its clients. With these protections, the loans \nto non-profits should perform just as well as those made to for-\nprofits, and if there is a problem, the loans should be collateralized \nsufficiently to cover the losses.\n  The bill defines a small, non-profit child care business to mean an \nentity organized as a 501(c)(3), but not just any organization. It must \nbe a licensed child care provider; it must meet the size standard for a \nsmall business; and it must provide care to infants, toddlers and pre-\nkindergarten and older children after school. At Senator Snowe's \nrequest, the pilot is limited to\n\n[[Page S9055]]\n\n7 percent allowed for pilots under SBA's 7(a) guaranteed business loan \nprogram. I feel that the agreed upon cap should allow for sufficient \nlending under the pilot to adequately test whether lending to non-\nprofit childcare providers is effective in increasing access to \naffordable childcare, and whether it protects the general 504 program, \nwhich is vital to the financing of small businesses in this country.\n  The bill also includes a comprehensive study by the GAO to track and \nmonitor the impact of this program both on the industry and the \nprogram. Last, I want to remind my colleagues that the 504 program is \nfunded entirely through fees and does not require appropriations.\n  Also included in this bill is S. 318, the Small Business Drought \nRelief Act. This simply reinforces in legislation something which SBA \nshould already be doing. You see, the SBA doesn't treat all drought \nvictims the same. The Agency only helps those small businesses whose \nincome is tied to farming and agriculture. However, farmers and \nranchers are not the only small business owners whose livelihoods are \nat risk when drought hits their communities. The impact can be just as \ndevastating to the owners of rafting businesses, marinas, and bait and \ntackle shops. Sadly, at present these small businesses cannot get help \nthrough the SBA's disaster loan program because of something taxpayers \nhate about government--bureaucracy.\n  The SBA denies these businesses access to disaster loans because its \nlawyers say drought is not a sudden event and therefore it is not a \ndisaster by definition. However, contrary to the Agency's position that \ndrought is not a disaster, as of July 16, 2002, the day this \nlegislation was introduced last year, the SBA had in effect drought \ndisaster declarations in 36 states. That number had grown to 48 the \nbeginning of this year, demonstrating that problem had gotten worse and \neven more small businesses were in need.\n  As I have said time and again, the SBA has the authority to help all \nsmall businesses hurt by drought in declared disaster areas, but the \nAgency won't do it. For years the Agency has been applying the law \nunfairly, helping some and not others, and it is out of compliance with \nthe law. The Small Business Drought Relief Act of 2003 would force SBA \nto comply with existing law, restoring fairness to an unfair system, \nand get help to small business drought victims that need it. I thank \nSenator Bond for working with me on this when he was the Ranking Member \nof the Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, and I thank \nSenator Snowe and her staff for all their help and support. While we \nmight have had a lot of rain recently in the Northeast, there are areas \nlike Lake Mead in Arizona where it is so dry that the water level is \ndown and small businesses are losing business and making expensive \nchanges to extend docks to reach the water.\n\n  In this bill are also provisions to shore up SBA's venture capital \nprograms--the Small Business Investment Company Debenture and \nParticipating Securities programs, and the New Markets Venture Capital \nProgram. We have balanced investment incentives with soundness issues \nand allowed small businesses to receive more SBIC financing than \ncurrently permissible if they also have a 504 or 7(a) loan. We have \nimproved the arrangement for distributing payments from successful \nSBICs so that SBA and the investors are treated more fairly and the \ntaxpayers has more protection for realizing repayment on the \ninvestments. We have put in place conforming amendments to make the New \nMarkets Venture Capital program work with the New Markets Tax Credit, \nas Congress intended. We have clarified that new markets venture \ncapital companies have two years to raise their matching capital, as \nCongress intended. The Committee has been troubled by the Agency's \ninterpretation of the NMVC statute which they viewed as permitting SBA \nto choose how much time it can give conditionally approved NMVCs to \nraise the private-sector matching money. The chosen time frames were \nunreasonable and not what Congress intended.\n  We have also included many measures to strengthen SBA's oversight of \nlenders, responding to findings by the General Accounting Office and \nthe Office of Inspector General. And we have reauthorized and clarified \nthe law for surety bond guarantees to help small businesses get \ngovernment contracts.\n  While no one would deny the importance access to capital plays in the \nsuccess of small businesses, as SBA Administration Hector Barreto and \npast SBA Administrators have acknowledged time and again, debt is not \nalways the answer. In the SBA's FY 2004 budget request, there is \nreference to information from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and \nDun & Bradstreet that indicates ``80 percent of new businesses \ndiscontinue operation within five years because of lack of `knowledge' \nof key business skills.'' Despite the recognized importance of such \nassistance, the SBA's funding request for FY 2004 and its legislative \nproposal to implement that request would freeze funding levels for \nvirtually all Agency programs, without even accounting for inflation, \nfor a six-year period. If enacted, that would severely hamstring this \nnation's small businesses and their ability to effectively compete and \nprosper in the national economy.\n  Cuts to or inadequate funding of the SBA's entrepreneurial \ndevelopment programs are often attributed to vague and unfounded claims \nof duplication. Such claims mistake a common mission of training and \ncounseling for duplication, ignoring the reality that small businesses \nvary greatly, are often at very different stages of development, and \nhave many different needs. Just as it would be ineffective to only have \none type of loan or venture capital financing structure for the 25 \nmillion small businesses in this country, it would be futile to water \ndown specialized management and training programs to impose a one-size-\nfits-all approach.\n  I want to commend Chair Snowe for giving women entrepreneurs such a \nprominent place in the reauthoziation process. Rarely do women \nentrepreneurs get the recognition and attention they deserve for their \ncontributions to our economy: 18 million Americans would be without \njobs today if it weren't for these entrepreneurs who had the courage \nand the vision to strike out of their own. During my tenure as a \nmember, Chair, and lead Democrat of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I have worked to increase and improve \nthe opportunities for enterprising entrepreneurial women in a variety \nof ways, leading to greater earning power, financial independence and \nasset accumulation--and I am glad that Senator Snowe is joining me in \nthis endeavor.\n\n  As Chair Snowe expressed when she introduced the Women's Small \nBusiness Programs Improvement Act--and when Senator Snowe and I passed \nthe Women's Business Center's Preservation Act--protecting the \nextremely effective and well-established Women's Business Center \nnetwork was a high priority in this reauthorization. For that reason, \nwe make permanent the Women's Business Center Sustainability Pilot \nProgram by creating three-year ``renewal'' grants for those centers \nwith sustainability grants and four-year ``initial'' grants for new \ncenters; increase the program's authorization levels; and direct the \nOffice of Women's Business Ownership, OWBO, to make all Women's \nBusiness Center grants at $150K and to consult with the associations of \nWomen's Business Centers when making improvements to the program. Other \nchanges to the Women's Business Center Program include streamlining the \ndata collection and the grant application and selection criteria, \nprotecting the privacy of Women's Business Council, WBC, clients, and \nproviding for a smooth transition from sustainability to the newly \nestablished WBC program. Our legislation will not only secure the \nfuture of the Women's Business Center Program, but it will connect all \nSBA-related women's initiatives with a unified mission, similar \nguidance and training. These changes were coupled with minor, yet \nsignificant, changes to the National Women's Business Council, NWBC, \nand the Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise. Senator \nSnowe and I included provisions to give the NWBC cosponsorship \nauthority, to allow more flexibility in the way the Council uses funds, \nand to direct the Council to serve as a clearinghouse for historical \ndata. Each of these things will enable the Council to become a better \nresource for the Administration, Congress and the entire small-business\n\n[[Page S9056]]\n\ncommunity. To bolster the representation of women business owners in \nthe federal government, our bill re-establishes the Interagency \nCommittee on Women's Business Enterprise, directs the Deputy \nAdministrator of the SBA to serve as acting chairperson of the \nInteragency Committee until a chairperson is appointed, establishes a \nPolicy Advisory Group to assist the Committee's chairperson in \ndeveloping policies and programs under this Act and creates three \nsubcommittees similar to those created under the National Women \nBusiness Council.\n  This bill also supports and protects the Small Business Development \nCenter network, which has served 9 million small-business owners since \nits inception more than 20 years ago. It should also be noted that in \n2001, SBDCs helped small businesses create or retain over 80,000 jobs, \ngenerate $3.9 billion in sales and obtain $2.7 billion in financing. \nFor every dollar spent on an SBDC, $2.09 in tax revenue was returned to \nthe Federal Government. Numbers aside, the nationwide network of SBDCs \nprovide important counseling services to small-business owners that are \nunable to afford private consulting, many of whom are women and \nminority clients. The SBDC program has grown to serve 1.25 million \nsmall-business owners and entrepreneurs each year, and there are nearly \n1,000 centers serving every State in Nation.\n  While this bill rejects the potentially detrimental changes proposed \nby the SBA to the SBDC network, it does address concerns expressed by \nthe centers and small businesses. Included in our bill are increased \nauthorization levels to keep up with increased demand and a provision \nto protect the privacy of the program's clients and a provision to help \nSBDCs that have been adversely affected by poor economic conditions or \ngovernment downsizing.\n  Also, included in the entrepreneurial development section of our bill \nis a provision to increase to $7 million annually the authorization \nlevel for the Service Corps of Retired Executives, SCORE, which has \nnearly 11,000 volunteers, and a technical change to allow SCORE to keep \nits modest staff of fourteen employees.\n  I want to thank Senator Snowe for working with me to include, as \nintroduced, the Native American Small Business Development Act, which I \nreintroduced earlier this year together with Senator Johnson and \nSenator Smith to address the SBA's growing lack of commitment to the \nNative American community. According to a report released by the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, the ``three year average poverty rate for American \nIndians and Alaska Natives [from 1998-2000] was 25.9 percent; higher \nthan for any other race groups.'' With an unemployment rate well above \nthe national average and household income at just three-quarters of the \nnational average, Native American communities need a commitment from \nthe Federal government that we will help them, particularly during \nthese difficult economic times. To reaffirm this commitment, the \nJohnson-Kerry-Smith bill provides Native Americans the resources they \nneed to take advantage of the opportunities of entrepreneurship.\n  The Native American Small Business Development Act, as included in \nour reauthorization bill, will ensure that the SBA's programs to assist \nNative American communities cannot be dissolved by making the SBA's \nOffice of Native American Affairs, ONAA, and its Assistant \nAdministrator permanent. Our legislation would also create a statutory \ngrant program, known as the Native American Development grant program, \nto assist Native Americans. It would also establish two pilot programs \nto try new means of assisting Native American communities and require \nNative American communities to be consulted regarding the future of SBA \nprograms designed to assist them. In short, this legislation will \nensure that our Native American communities receive the adequate \nassistance they need to help start and grow small businesses.\n  To address the growing business development needs of veterans, \nSenator Snowe and I reauthorized the Advisory Committee on Veterans \nAffairs, expanded veterans outreach grants from just service-disable \nveterans, to veterans, reservists and service-disable veterans. \nFurther, we increase the funding for the Office of Veterans Business \nDevelopment to enable that office to better deal with the demand by \nveterans for outreach and development services.\n  We continue to receive reports of the detrimental effects of the \nAdministration's policy of reduced staffing and resources for essential \nprograms aimed at allowing small businesses to thrive. Week after week, \nthe Federal Times reports on the decline in contracts being allocated \nto small businesses, small businesses losing ground in the federal \nmarketplace, and most recently, on the awarding of more big contracts \nwith less oversight from Federal agencies. With agencies awarding \nlarger, more complex and more costly contracts with less staff \nperforming oversight, this nation's small businesses and its tax payers \nare the ones shouldering the burden when small business goals continue \nto be unmet. In addition to helping small businesses obtain access to \nprocurement opportunities, these goals are meant to help the government \nbenefit from the cost-savings and innovations small business \ncontractors can often provide.\n  Significant improvements to the on-going problem of contract \nbundling, also called contract consolidation, are included in this \nbill. The first provision creates a two-tiered approach to preventing \nunnecessary contract consolidation. Civilian agencies will be required \nto meet specific standards if they attempt to consolidate contracts \nabove $2 million and additional requirements for those contracts above \n$5 million. The Department of Defense is required to meet two types of \nsimilar requirements for contracts above $5 million and $7 million. The \nbill also eliminates the use of the term ``contract bundling'' and \nexpands the definition of ``contract consolidation,'' closing a \nloophole that has been widely used and has detrimentally affected small \nbusinesses.\n\n  The second provision increases in the number of Procurement Center \nRepresentatives (PCRs) stationed throughout the country. These \nrepresentatives advocate on behalf of small businesses in cases \ndirectly affecting contracting, such as the bundling or consolidation \nof contracts. In the bill, we have increased the number of PCRs to \nensure that every state and every major procurement center is allocated \nat least one PCR. Meanwhile, we have also ensured that these PCRs are \nnot burdened with responsibilities that were previously the duties of \nBreakout PCRs and Commercial Marketing Representatives. These two \nimprovements will dramatically increase the efficacy and efficiency of \nall three positions and allow proper review of the approximately 40 \npercent of Federal contracts, nearly $90 billion, that are currently \nnot being reviewed by PCRs. This should increase small business's \naccess to Federal contract opportunities.\n  The bill would also create a reporting requirement for the \nBusinessLINC program, which has been showing promise in creating real \nteaming opportunities for small businesses in the private sector. \nAlthough the Administration recommended elimination of the program, the \nreports this Committee received regarding the overwhelming success of \nthe existing nine programs made it clear that the SBA did not have \nsufficient information about BusinessLINC to make an informed decision \non its effectiveness. The Committee's bill would ensure that the SBA \noffers the proper level of oversight and would foster the continued \nsuccess of the program. I would like to thank Senator Snowe for working \nwith me to find a compromise to preserve this successful program.\n  At each of this Committee's three Roundtables on Reauthorization and \nthe hearing on contract bundling, the small business community \nreiterated the need for accountability for small business contracting \nat the agency level. I applaud Senator Snowe on her efforts to ensure \nthat Federal agencies be held accountable for fully utilizing small \nbusinesses and to allow a greater amount of Congressional oversight of \nthe implementation of agency procurement strategies. Provisions within \nthis bill will ensure that the heads of Federal agencies identify a \nspecific portion of their budget request that will be awarded to small \nbusinesses in their strategic plan and their annual budget\n\n[[Page S9057]]\n\nsubmission to Congress; will hold senior executives and senior program \nmanagers accountable in their annual performance evaluations for small \nbusiness utilization in Federal contract awards.\n  In addition to increasing opportunities for prime contracts, this \nbill addresses another serious problem: small businesses have been \nseverely hamstrung by dishonest practices by some businesses that have \nprime contracts with the Federal Government and receive preference over \nother prime contractors due to their superior subcontracting plans. \nSenator Snowe and I have worked closely to address the concerns of \nsmall businesses regarding delays in payment, false reporting and the \nuse of ``bait and switch'' tactics by prime contractors.\n  This bill holds prime contractors responsible for the validity of \nsubcontracting data, requiring the CEO to certify to the accuracy of \nthe subcontracting report under penalty of law. It also expands the \npenalties for falsifying data included in subcontracting reports to \nmatch the $500,000 penalty for businesses that falsify their status as \na small and disadvantaged business. If one intentionally falsifies data \nas a part of a subcontracting report to a Federal agency, he is \ndefrauding the United States government and will be punished to the \nfull extent of the law. I commend Senator Snowe for her diligence in \ncreating these strict penalties and her efforts to create a bipartisan \nresponse to protect small businesses.\n  I want to thank Chairwoman Snowe and her able staff for all of their \nhard work over the past several months. I also want to express my \ngratitude to all members of the Committee and urge them and my other \nSenate colleagues to support the Small Business Administration 50th \nAnniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 1376. A bill to include the Department of Energy and the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission as employers for the purposes of whistleblower \nprotection; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nproviding greater protection for workers dealing with nuclear materials \nand nuclear power. I am pleased to introduce this legislation today \nwith my colleague from Nevada, Senator Ensign.\n  Several weeks ago, I chaired a hearing of the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Subcommittee on problems facing the Yucca Mountain project. \nI was extremely disappointed that two of the witnesses--both current \nemployees of the Department of Energy and one of its contractors--\nfailed to testify at the hearing.\n  It was clear to me that these people failed to appear before the \ncommittee because they were concerned that their appearance could have \nnegative repercussions on their jobs. That is completely unacceptable.\n  So today, Senator Ensign and I are introducing legislation to expand \nthe whistleblower protections. The bill we are introducing does two \nthings.\n  First, the bill would expand whistleblower protection to all \nDepartment of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission employees and \ntheir contractors' and subcontractors' employees.\n  Second, the bill would provide a process for whistleblowers to \nutilize Federal courts if their cases are not addressed quickly by the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  Our Democracy depends on the ability of citizens and their elected \nrepresentatives to make informed decisions. That means we need to know \nthe truth about the issues.\n  These changes are simple fixes that help ensure that Federal \nemployees and other people working for the Federal Government never \nhave to fear they will lose their jobs for simply telling the truth.\n  I hope the Senate will act quickly on this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 1378. A bill to transfer to the Secretary of the Interior \nauthority to revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, thirteen years ago the Corps of Engineers \nwas given 6 months to revise the Missouri River Master Manual. The \nMaster Manual provides a framework for managing the flows on the \nMissouri River.\n  But here we are, thirteen years later, and nothing has happened. So \ntoday I am introducing legislation to take management away from the \nCorps of Engineers and give it to the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  In my judgment, the Corps has failed miserably in its efforts to \nrevise the Master Manual. In the interim, the Corps has managed the \nRiver in a way that benefits the downstream States at the expense of \nthe upstream States, despite the fact that the upstream States generate \nten times more economic activity from recreational use than the \ndownstream states generate from barge traffic.\n  And this mismanagement has cost North Dakota a lot. Enough is enough. \nIt's time to take this responsibility away from the Corps and give it \nto the Bureau of Reclamation. The Bureau manages other rivers, like the \nColorado River, so let's give them a chance to manage the Missouri and \nto revise the Master Manual. Perhaps this will give the upstream States \na chance to be treated fairly for a change.\n  I have written a letter to the head of the Corps of Engineers, \nGeneral Robert Flowers, expressing my concern about this issue and I \nask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 1, 2003.\n     LTG Robert B. Flowers,\n     Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear General Flowers: More than a decade ago, the Corps of \n     Engineers was tasked with revising the Missouri River Master \n     Manual, which governs the management of the Missouri River. \n     As you well know, I have been very frustrated with the long \n     history of missed deadlines and continual delays. It \n     certainly appears that the Corps has no intention of moving \n     forward with a new Master Manual any time in the near future. \n     In addition, as I have learned more about the unfairness of \n     the current management plan, I am concerned that the Corps is \n     either unwilling or unable to implement equitable management \n     of the River.\n       Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota has suffered lake level \n     decreases of over 16 feet. This has had a devastating effect \n     on the recreational uses of the lake. It is unacceptable for \n     the Corps to continue to shortchange the upstream states by \n     sending water downstream for a barge industry that generates \n     less than a tenth of the economic activity as the upstream \n     recreational interests. Fort Peck in Montana has seen lake \n     level declines of 21.2 feet and Lake Oahe in South Dakota has \n     suffered lake level reductions of more than 22 feet.\n       And the downstream lakes? These lakes have seen virtually \n     no change in their lake levels. Harry S. Truman Lake in \n     Missouri has lost less than half a foot of elevation. Lake \n     Rathbun in Iowa is down just 2.4 feet.\n       This is truly a case of double jeopardy for the upstream \n     states. The water from their lakes gets drained off for a \n     nearly non-existent barge industry at a time when the \n     downstream states are not asked to make any contributions \n     from their own lakes. The table below shows the inequity of \n     this situation.\n\n                            DOWNSTREAM LAKES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Change in\n                            Lake                               elevation\n                                                                (feet)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHarry S Truman Lake (MO)....................................        -0.4\nStockton Lake (MO)..........................................        -4.8\nPomme De Terre (MO).........................................        -1.9\nLake Rathbun (IA)...........................................        -2.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                             UPSTREAM LAKES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Change in\n                            Lake                               elevation\n                                                                (feet)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFort Peck (MT)..............................................       -21.2\nLake Sakakawea (ND).........................................       -16.2\nLake Oahe (SD)..............................................       -22.1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The Corps has developed a deplorable track record of \n     managing the Missouri River to the detriment of the upstream \n     states and the millions of people who live in that region. \n     This is just the latest in the Corps' string of poor \n     decisions.\n       It is clear the Corps is simply incapable to managing the \n     Missouri River in a fair and equitable fashion.\n       For this reason, I plan to introduce legislation when the \n     Congress returns from its July work period, that would \n     transfer authority for the revision of the Master Manual and \n     the responsibility for the management of the dams along the \n     Missouri River, to the Bureau of Reclamation. The Corps has \n     failed in its mission to manage the River in an effective way \n     and has neglected to revise the Master Manual despite 13 \n     years of work on the project.

MISSOURI RIVER MASTER WATER CONTROL MANUAL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the original study for the revision of the operating \n     plan under the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual was \n     begun in November 1989 and was scheduled to be completed 6 \n     months later;\n       (2) the Corps of Engineers has missed that deadline by more \n     than 13 years and has consistently missed every other \n     deadline set in the interim;\n       (3) the Corps of Engineers is unable or unwilling to move \n     the process forward to revise the Manual, despite legal \n     requirements, direction from Congress, scientific evidence, \n     and various lawsuits from affected parties;\n       (4) in report number RCED-92-4 in January 1992, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States concluded that there \n     is no statutory or regulatory basis for any contention by the \n     Corps of Engineers that the Corps is bound to give higher \n     priority to navigation interests than to recreation interests \n     affected by the operation of dams on the Missouri River;\n       (5) the Missouri River yields more than 10 times the \n     economic benefit for recreation and tourism in upstream \n     States than it does for shipping interests in the downstream \n     States; and\n       (6) it appears that the Corps of Engineers is unable to \n     provide the leadership necessary to finalize revisions to the \n     Manual.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Secretary of the army.--The term ``Secretary of the \n     Army'' means the Secretary of the Army, acting through the \n     Chief of Engineers.\n       (2) Secretary of the interior.--The term ``Secretary of the \n     Interior'' means the Secretary of the Interior, acting \n     through the Commissioner of Reclamation.\n       (3) Manual.--The term ``Manual'' means the Missouri River \n     Master Water Control Manual.\n       (c) Transfer of Authority.--There is transferred from the \n     Secretary of the Army to the Secretary of the Interior all \n     authority of the Secretary of the Army to--\n       (1) revise the Manual; and\n       (2) operate the dams the operation of which is governed by \n     the Manual.\n       (d) Completion of Current Revision.--The Secretary of the \n     Interior shall, to the maximum extent practicable, complete \n     the revision of the Manual begun by the Secretary of the Army \n     before the date of enactment of this Act not later than the \n     date set for completion by the Secretary of the Army.\n       (e) Management of Water Resource Projects.--After the \n     Secretary of the Interior revises the Manual, the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall manage water resource projects formerly \n     operated by the Corps of Engineers in accordance with the \n     revised Manual.\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1135.
