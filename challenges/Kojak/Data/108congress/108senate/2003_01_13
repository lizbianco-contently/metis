Keep us focused on the liberating truth that \nwe are here to serve You by serving our Nation. Our sole purpose is to \naccept Your absolute lordship over our lives and give ourselves totally \nto the work of this day. Give us the enthusiasm that comes from knowing \nthe high calling of serving in government. Grant us the holy esteem of \nknowing that You seek to accomplish Your plans for America through the \nlegislation of this Senate. Free us from secondary, self-serving goals. \nHelp us to humble ourselves and ask how we may serve today. We know \nthat happiness comes not from having things or getting recognition, but \nfrom serving in the great cause of implementing Your righteousness, \njustice, and mercy for every person and in every circumstance in this \nNation. We take delight in the ultimate paradox of life: the more we \ngive ourselves away, the more we can receive of Your love. In our \nLord's name.

Mr. President, I wish to comment on an issue that I think \nis so important. In reading the Hill publication Roll Call, I think it \nspeaks volumes to look at page 13. I see the distinguished Democratic \nleader coming in, and I am sure he would agree with that.\n  On this page, it indicates why, from the time he and I came to the \nSenate, things have changed for the better. This is a picture of all \nthe women in the Senate. There are 3 Republicans and I think 9 or 10 \nDemocrats. It is really a tremendously important picture.\n  I recall last year when the military construction appropriations bill \ncame to the floor. That committee was chaired by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, and the ranking member was the Senator from \nTexas, Kay Bailey Hutchison. That says it all.\n  I think this is a better place and we are a better country for having \nthese women in the Senate.\n  Then I show to my distinguished friend, the Democratic leader, on \nthis same page there is a picture of the Democratic leader in the House \nof Representatives, Nancy Pelosi. I think that is really tremendous, \nand we should think every day about what a better place this is because \nof the women who have been elected to the House and Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/13/senate-section/article/S210-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S210-S212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              A CHANGE OF HEART OR ONLY A CHANGE OF FACE?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I concur with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada, the assistant Democratic leader. We have made a great deal \nof progress, as is evidenced by the number of women who now serve in \nthe Senate as well as the House. In addition, of course, as we look to \nthe election of the first woman as a leader of either caucus, I think \nthat, too, speaks volumes for the transition that this country and the \nCongress itself have experienced over the course of the last couple of \ndecades. We have made progress on women's rights, and many of us would \nlike to think we have made progress as well on civil rights.\n  Over the course of the last several weeks, this country has been \nfocused on the issue of civil rights. I think virtually every Member of \nthe body spoke strongly about the need for healing and reconciliation \nas we consider the issue of civil rights and the rights of minorities \nin this country. We recognize we have a long way to go.\n  We have a new leader in the Republican caucus who has pledged to \npursue these goals, and I applaud him for his willingness to do so. \nUnfortunately, yesterday the Republican leader may have caused \nconfusion about his intent in that regard. His comments indicated to me \nthat among the Republican leadership there may have been a change of \nface, but there has not been a change of heart.\n  When the administration chose to renominate Charles Pickering to the \nsecond highest court in the land, it now appears that in many respects, \nthey did not even have a change of face. The question is whether or not \nall of us, Republicans and Democrats, can express in our actions what \nso many have expressed in words. If indeed it is a change of heart, we \nneed to see actions that bear out such a change.\n  On the question of affirmative action, Senator Frist said he supports \nit if affirmative action is defined as it was in the 1960 Civil Rights \nAct. Well, that was not affirmative action; that was civil rights. That \nwas equal rights.\n\n  The real question of affirmative educational opportunity is now being \nasked in the United States Supreme Court. The administration has chosen \nto remain silent. Yesterday the Republican leader in the Senate did not \nask them to break that silence or indicate a desire to break his.\n  When it comes to protecting equal rights, we still have a lot of work \nto do in changing hearts, in changing minds, and in changing laws. \nUnfortunately, that lesson still seems to be lost on a number of our \nRepublican colleagues, in spite of their expressions of intent over the \ncourse of the last several weeks.\n  There will be much more to say and do on the issue of racial \nreconciliation in the coming weeks. I hope to see more than just words \nfrom our Republican colleagues, because yesterday it appeared that what \nwe had hoped was a change of heart was little more than a change of \nface.\n  Last week the administration announced we would be able to see the \ndetails of the economic stimulus package they intend to offer.\n  Last week we also learned that during the month of December we lost \n100,000 jobs; 100,000 jobs in December. That brings the total job loss \nsince George Bush took office to 2.3 million jobs. When the President \nputs forth his stimulus plan, my concern is it will be a stimulus plan \nfor the rich and a sedative for the rest. The reason I say that, in \npart, is because there is very little job creation in the first year \nunder what we know of the President's plan. The President has \nacknowledged that in his first year he will be creating approximately \n190,000 jobs. When that 190,000 jobs is compared to the 100,000 jobs \nlost in December alone, or the 2.3 million jobs lost in the first 2 \nyears, 190,000 jobs is hardly a drop in the bucket. It is hardly worth \nwriting home about. It is not the stimulus that all economists and the \nrest of the country expect the Congress to consider. That is the \nconcern many have: 90 percent of the so-called stimulus plan the \nPresident is proposing takes place in the outyears--not when we are \nlosing the jobs by the hundreds of thousands each month. It takes place \nin years beyond 2003.\n  If anything, the economists have said over and over if you are going \nto create a stimulus package, make sure it is immediate. Make sure it \ntakes effect now, not at some point in the outyears. We made that \nmistake before. We are feeling the consequences of it. So, the fact it \ndoes not stimulate the economy is the first concern we have.\n  My second concern is the question of fairness. Mr. President, 200,000 \nmillionaires get tax relief that exceeds the salary of 92 million \nAmericans who make $50,000 or less. Again, 200,000 millionaires will \nget $89,000 annually as a tax cut while those who are making $50,000 a \nyear or less will get somewhere in the vicinity of $70 or $80 a year in \ntax reduction. This proposal flunks the test of fairness.\n  I am troubled on two other accounts. In the last few weeks young men \nand women at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota have been sent \noff to the Persian Gulf to prepare for war. We hope that war will not \ncome. But if war does come, they will be asked to put their lives on \nthe line. They will be asked to put their lives on the line at the very \ntime these millionaires are going to get an $89,000 tax break. For the \nlife of me, I don't see where the fairness is in that.\n  Over the last 333 days, we have also suggested there has to be some \nform of drought relief, some form of assistance given to farmers and \nranchers and people in rural areas who are suffering as a consequence \nof the drought. So far we have been unsuccessful. We have been \nunsuccessful because the administration has said we cannot afford $6 \nbillion in drought assistance. What I don't understand is how in the \nname of fiscal fairness we can support $764 billion in tax cuts largely \ndirected to those at the very top while we tell our farmers and \nranchers they are not eligible for any assistance and while we send our \nyoung men and women off to war. On the issue of fairness, this plan \nalso fails.\n\n  Perhaps my biggest concern, however, goes to how reckless this plan \nis. People have to be reminded we are borrowing every single dollar of \nthese funds to pay for the tax cut. We are borrowing that out of Social \nSecurity. We have no other recourse. Whatever money is going to go to \nthe tax cut this year will be borrowed from the Social Security trust \nfund. So the fact we are borrowing at a time when we may go to war, \nwhere we may actually have to draw down more resources to be able to \nfight that war, seems senseless to me. To borrow at the magnitude the \nPresident is proposing, $764 billion in face value and perhaps $1 \ntrillion when interest costs are factored in, $1 trillion when we have \nto fight a war, seems like the most reckless course for fiscal \nresponsibility I can think of.\n  The Governors are not sounding a false alarm when they tell us this \nplan will cost them $4 billion. That is over and above the $50 billion \nshortfall they are currently experiencing all over this\n\n[[Page S211]]\n\ncountry. In my own State of South Dakota, we are experiencing about a \n$50 million shortfall, one of the largest on record. But it is $50 \nbillion nationwide. This tax plan will exacerbate that $50 billion by \nanother $4 billion.\n  Mr. President, from the point of view of its stimulative value, from \nthe point of view of fairness, from the point of view of our \nresponsibilities and the potential for recklessness, this plan leaves a \ngreat deal to be desired. In fact, it causes very great concern to \nmany.\n  I am also troubled that as we contemplate the need for action on this \nstimulus package, as we contemplate the need to address the omnibus \nappropriations bill, as we recognize we still have to work out our \norganizing resolution, that the Congress may take vacation next week. I \nhope we would refrain from taking a vacation next week. I hope we come \nto the floor, resolve these matters, work on them intently, bring this \neconomic stimulus plan, have a good debate, make sure we are acting in \ngood faith to try to deal with these tragic unemployment numbers that \nroll out month after month. That is my hope, that we stay here next \nweek, that we address these concerns in a realistic, in a bipartisan, \nand in an immediate way, sending a clear message we are a lot more \ninterested in getting this work done than we are in taking a few days \noff so soon into the new session. I stand ready to work with our \nRepublican leadership and certainly with those in the committees as we \nbegin to do our work.\n  Senator Frist and I have had some conversations with regard to the \norganizing resolution. We are not yet able to say with any confidence \nwhen we may finish those discussions. It is fair to say, as everyone \nknows, we had exactly the mirror circumstances in the 107th Congress \nthat we have today. In the 107th Congress, there were 51 Members in the \nmajority and 49 Members in the minority. In the 108th Congress, there \nare 51 Members in the majority and 49 Members in the minority. It would \nseem to me given the fact that we have simply seen a reverse, the \nmirror image of the makeup of the 107th Congress, we ought to have \nexactly the same organizing resolution; the same funding, the same \nmembership, the same space, the same circumstances. That really is as \nsimply as I can describe what the Democratic position is. If it was \ngood enough for Republicans and Democrats in the 107th Congress, you \nwould think it would be good enough for Democrats and Republicans in \nthe 108th Congress.\n\n  We are willing to settle for 49 percent of the resources, 49 percent \nof the space, and a one-vote Republican majority on committees in the \n108th Congress. That is our position. It is the same position we held \nlast time. Unfortunately, there are some who have argued that ratio is \nnot satisfactory any longer. Since they are in the majority, they want \nmore--more resources, more space. I hope, in the interests filling the \ncommittee positions and moving through the legislative agenda we have \nbefore us, that we can move as quickly as possible to a resolution of \nthis matter.\n  Let's do in this Congress what we did in the last one. We all signed \noff on it. We all said it was the right thing to do. We all agreed, and \nthe time has come for us to agree again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator allow me to ask a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. The leader has made it very clear, but I want to make sure \nagain that everyone hears the fact the Democrats simply want to have \nthe same exact program for committees that was here last year. The only \nthing is the Democrats are now in the minority and Republicans are now \nin the majority, but the funding and the staffing and the space would \nbe exactly the same, is that right?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that is exactly what I am proposing and \nwhat I assume would be the circumstance in the 108th Congress.\n  As I say, I did not have one chairman last year express a concern \nabout the inadequacy of resources while we were in the majority. I \ncan't imagine, with the cost-of-living adjustment, that anyone would \nhave difficulty accepting those resources--as I say, with a cost-of-\nliving adjustment--in this Congress.\n  Mr. REID. If there is a problem here and the organizational efforts \nare not going forward, it would not be anything the Democratic leader \nhas done? You want exactly the same situation as last year, is that \nright?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely correct. What we are simply \nsaying is what we had agreed to with a 51-49 breakdown in the 107th \nCongress is what we ought to agree to with a 51-49 breakdown in the \n108th Congress.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask the Democratic leader one other series of \nquestions based upon what I think was his very clear speech, the Wall \nStreet Journal, which I understand has a circulation of about 2.5 \nmillion people, came out today with something you usually don't see in \nthe Wall Street Journal, something supporting what we think is going \nwrong in the country. The headline in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       U.S. Job-Market Slump Is Longest in Decades--Near-Term \n     Prospects for Workers Remain Grim . . .\n\n  The leader is aware that even the Wall Street Journal is painting a \nvery bleak picture about this economy, is that true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is certainly true. I read that article \nthis morning. I commend the distinguished Senator from Nevada for \nraising its content.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 13, 2003]\n\n U.S. Job-Market Slump Is Longest in Decades--Near Term Prospects for \n             Workers Remain Grim Despite Hopeful Forecasts\n\n                         (By Jon E. Hilsenrath)\n\n       The later market in the U.S. appears to be in the most \n     protracted slump in decades, and the near-term prospect for \n     workers isn't encouraging.\n       The Labor Department said payroll employment contracted by \n     101,000 in December, led by more hemorrhaging in the \n     manufacturing sector, which eliminated jobs for the 29th \n     straight month, and by struggling retailers that hired less \n     than normally during the Christmas selling season. The \n     unemployment rate was steady in December at 6%, mainly \n     because workers are leaving the labor force, which contracted \n     by 191,000 last month.\n       For more than a year, economists have said that the current \n     economic recovery was too limp to spur hiring because \n     corporate profits have been so weak. In recent weeks, \n     however, economists have speculated that the jobs market \n     would start to pick up later this year, in part because they \n     expect business confidence to improve. Some recent reports \n     support that argument. The Institute for Supply Management, \n     for instance, said earlier this month that orders to \n     manufacturers picked up in December.\n       But Friday's report suggested that, despite signs that the \n     corporate sector is healing, cost cutting remains the order \n     of the day for many companies. That could mean more setbacks \n     for labor.\n       The surprising labor market weakness heightened attention \n     on Wall Street and in Washington on the need for fiscal \n     stimulus. President George W. Bush last week proposed $674 \n     billion in tax cuts and spending increases to lift economic \n     growth. Analysts said the weak job market probably softens \n     opposition to some kind of action out of Congress in the \n     months ahead, although the shape of that action remains to be \n     hashed out by Washington partisans.\n       Bush administration officials seized on the report to make \n     their case. ``The president views the latest report on \n     unemployment as another reason why it's so important for \n     Congress to pass the president's job-creating economic \n     plan,'' said presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer. Democrats \n     argue that the Bush plan doesn't provide enough short-term \n     stimulus and costs too much in the long-term.\n       Even before Friday's report, economists were likening the \n     U.S. economy's performance to the jobless recovery of the \n     early 1990s. The latest data suggest it might be that and \n     more. Few job-market downturns have been this protracted. The \n     29 straight declines in manufacturing employment is the \n     longest stretch of manufacturing retrenchment in post World \n     War II history. Overall in the 22 months since the recession \n     began in March 2001, employers have eliminated 1.75 million \n     jobs. By contrast, 22 months after the 1990 recession began, \n     employment had already started to pick up, and fewer jobs--\n     1.57 million--had been eliminated.\n       Executive caution about hiring has made it increasingly \n     hard for unemployed workers to get back in the work force \n     once they have lost jobs. The Labor Department said 22% of \n     all unemployed workers have been out of work for more than \n     half a year, the highest ratio of long-term unemployed \n     workers since 1992. Also in December, 30% of workers said \n     jobs were hard to get, the highest level since 1994, an \n     earlier report by the Conference Board indicated.\n       Some economists said the weak job market puts the economy \n     on more insecure footing\n\n[[Page S212]]\n\n     at the beginning of 2003. Business spending has been held \n     back for months by uncertainties surrounding the possibility \n     of war with Iraq. Economists are becoming concerned that the \n     weak job market could pinch consumer spending.\n       But the job market news wasn't all bad last week. Several \n     economists said they expect the employment statistics to look \n     a bit better in January because of seasonal adjustment \n     factors. And the U.S. government's measure of retail \n     employment fell for December after seasonal adjustments, \n     because retailers hired fewer workers than they normally do \n     in the month. In January, they are conversely likely to lay \n     off fewer seasonal workers, which should boost the retail \n     employment statistics.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, simply to summarize the article, it says \nnot only are we suffering month-to-month joblessness at levels we have \nnot seen in 8 years, but if you look at the joblessness in the context \nof the economy over the last several decades, this is one of the most \nsevere slumps we have seen in decades.\n  So we have both an immediate context and a long-term context. In both \nof those contexts, as the Wall Street Journal article points out, this \nmatter is of great consequence. Mr. President, 2.3 million jobs, now, \nin the last 24 months have been lost. What the article simply states is \nthat, while it is a serious immediate concern, we have to be very \nconcerned about the long-term repercussions of this joblessness. I \nthought it was one of the better articles I had seen in recent times \nwith regard to the economic dilemma we face as we deal with the \nstimulus package later this month.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask one more question? The leader mentioned we \nwere borrowing money. It is true, is it not, that when this \nadministration took over there was a 10-year surplus, in the trillions \nof dollars? Whether it was $5 trillion or $6 trillion, it was trillions \nof dollars. In the last 2 years every penny of that is gone, and the \nleader is certainly aware of that, is that true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would say to the Senator from Nevada, that is one of \nmy greatest concerns. Obviously, the debt we were able to eliminate \nover the final years of the 1990s, thinking that somehow--I can recall \nhaving conversations that we may be spending down the debt too fast. \nPeople expressed the concern we might be eliminating the debt too fast.\n  I just now shake my head in disbelief we even had conversations like \nthat. But, nonetheless, that was one of the concerns expressed by some \nduring that period of time.\n  I can recall so vividly this question about what it is we were going \nto do with a $5.5 trillion projected surplus. We no longer have that \nsurplus projection. We no longer have those year-to-year balanced \nbudgets we were proud to report to the American people. We now have a \ndeficit of $200 billion to $300 billion, depending on whether or not \nyou consider the Social Security trust fund. We are expected now to see \na deficit of $350 billion in the next fiscal year. So we will see debts \nof a magnitude we have not seen, deficits of a magnitude we have not \nexperienced as a result of what has happened over the course of the \nlast 24 months.\n  In spite of it, we are going to be actually borrowing to exacerbate \nthat debt even more, borrowing to provide a tax cut to those at the \nvery top of the income scale.\n  I have always been concerned about the relationship between the \ncircumstances we face now in the war on terror and the circumstances we \nfaced in World War II. President Roosevelt stood up and said: I want \nall Americans to sacrifice. In fact, he raised revenue, he did \neverything possible to ensure there was an adequate degree of sacrifice \nacross the board. Now we are asking young men and women to sacrifice \nperhaps their lives at the very time we turn around and give a \nmillionaire an $89,000 tax break. It turns logic on its head, but that \nis the concern I have.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from Nevada raising the question.\n  Mr. REID. I know how busy the Democratic leader is, but I would ask \none more question. The Democratic leader is going into his 9th year \nbeing leader of this caucus. Prior to that time Senator Mitchell of \nMaine was leader. I can remember the Democratic leader today and myself \ngoing into a meeting with Senator Mitchell. The problem there is the \nRepublicans were having a mad rush to have a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget, but they were going to use Social Security \nsurpluses to offset that deficit. The Senator remembers that, does he \nnot?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I sure do.\n  Mr. REID. You remember at that time I agreed to sponsor an amendment \nto have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget but not using \nSocial Security surpluses? That worked out well enough that we were \nable to stop that very mischievous amendment from passing. It would \nhave wiped out Social Security. Social Security would be gone by now.\n  But I say to my friend, the Democratic leader, the money that is \nbeing borrowed now is coming from Social Security. Not only that, the \ndeficit would even be more if they didn't use Social Security surpluses \nto hide it, isn't that also true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That's the concern we have about a $200 billion Social \nSecurity cushion that is all being drawn down; not only this year, but \nfor every year in the foreseeable future, every year in the coming \ndecade. Every dollar of Social Security revenue coming in will be used \nto offset the costs involved in running the Government and providing \nthe resources for the tax cuts the President has either advocated or \nactually enacted.\n  There is no doubt that the fiscal irresponsibility and the \nrecklessness that comes with the extraordinary reliance on Social \nSecurity trust funds at the very time the baby boomers are coming into \nretirement age is very troubling. I think it ought to be the subject of \na lot more debate and scrutiny in the days and weeks ahead.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the leader is leaving the floor, I wish \nto recognize my friend from North Dakota who after I offered that \namendment was on the forefront of the next Congress making sure that we \ncontinued our efforts to beat down that mischievous constitutional \namendment to balance the budget which would have used the Social \nSecurity surplus to balance the budget. I applaud my friend from North \nDakota for taking that tough stand which allowed us to move forward and \nhelp us defeat one of the most dangerous efforts in the guise of \nbalancing the budget and destroying Social Security.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I rise today to make observations on two \nimportant points that have already been alluded to by my colleagues \nfrom South Dakota and Nevada during this session. One has to do with \nthe need to resolve the issue of funding for committee staffing.\n  One ordinarily would think this would be an administrative decision \nthat would not be of enormous consequence, but the fact is, until that \nis resolved, this Senate is not able to go forward with legislation of \nany kind, much less to resolving the fiscal year 2003 appropriations \nissue involving 11 of the 13 appropriations bills remaining incomplete \nand needing work. These are bills that should have been concluded prior \nto October 1 of last year, and yet here we are now well into January \nwith that work incomplete.\n  I have some concerns about the size of the budget cuts--roughly $9 \nbillion--that will be required, apparently, to come out of these 11 \nappropriations bills in order to accommodate President Bush and the \nRepublican leadership budget baseline to which they have agreed. I look \nforward to offering amendments to moderate that for purposes of \nagriculture, veterans health care, and other areas. But we cannot go \nforward, in any way, until a resolution is reached.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader, at this point, appears to have \ntaken the position of the far right of his caucus in demanding that his \nparty have\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\ntwo-thirds of the funding versus one-third for the Democratic side. It \ndoes not take a rocket scientist to conclude that with a 51-to-49 \ndivision in the Senate--consistent with what we did in the most recent \nCongress--a funding division of two-thirds to one-third is not fair.\n  I appreciate that there is precedent going back a number of years for \nthat kind of divide, but most recently, with the then-majority leader, \nSenator Daschle, in place, we accommodated our Republican colleagues \nwith a much narrower divide of committee budgeting. That is the right \nway to proceed. It is the only way that will allow us to go forward \nwith our work. It certainly is my hope that the majority leader will \nsee the error of his ways and return to a more moderate, more \nresponsible approach to the funding of these committees and concur with \nthe recommendations of Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader, so we \nmay get on with the work of the people.\n  Secondly, I have to share with my colleagues some thoughts on the \nbudget tax proposal submitted by President Bush. I stand here as 1 of \n12 Democrats who joined in an effort of moderating President Bush's \ninitial $1.35 trillion tax cut. Our thought was that by participating \nin that effort, we could moderate its cost, make it more fiscally \nresponsible, as well as redirect some of its benefits to middle-class \nand working families, to people who really make our economy go, and \ncertainly in a way that is consistent with the interests of my home \nState of South Dakota.\n  We did that, but we did that at a time when the projections were that \nwe were going to run up a $5.6 trillion budget surplus over the coming \n10 years. We had just come from 4 consecutive years--the final 4 years \nof the Clinton administration--of budgets in the black, and we were \npaying down the national debt. There was concern about whether we would \npay down the national debt too quickly. That, believe it or not, was \nthe concern at the time. We had budget surpluses as far as the eye \ncould see, and there was no war on the horizon. So the environment was \nconsiderably different.\n\n  Now we find ourselves, with the passage of that tax bill, with \nchanges in the economy and with a war possibly imminent. We hope not, \nbut we certainly are very cognizant of the fact that we may wind up in \nIraq and expending literally hundreds of billions of dollars in that \neffort to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the \nresources they need if, in fact, we wind up in that kind of conflict.\n  So the environment is radically different. Now we find ourselves with \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. Now we find ourselves utilizing \nSocial Security trust fund dollars, according to the administration's \nOffice of Management and Budget, for the remainder of this decade. Now \nwe find ourselves not paying down the accumulated national debt at all, \nmuch less paying it down too quickly, as President Bush and his \nadministration coached us to fear a short time ago.\n  So now we find ourselves with this radically different environment. \nYet the President comes to us with a plan which would cost $675 billion \nover the coming 10 years. If you take into consideration the interest \npayments that would have to be made--because every dime of that will \nhave to be borrowed; we will have to borrow that money out of the \nSocial Security trust fund to pay for these tax cuts--if you take into \nconsideration the interest costs, it comes to cost roughly $933 billion \nover the coming 10 years. We would be deep in the red as far as the eye \ncould see. And this is before you take into consideration the added \ncosts of war, before you take into consideration what else could happen \nto the economy.\n  This would involve about a $108 billion tax cut in the coming year, \nprimarily for Wall Street and for the superwealthy, although there are \na few grains of benefit for middle-class families. But, by and large, \nthat is a very modest part of the overall plan we would borrow money to \npay for.\n  Yet at the same time that we are considering this ill-considered, \nirresponsible plan, we are being told by the administration that we \nhave to cut about $9 billion out of next year's budget. That comes out \nof veterans health care. That comes out of education; it comes out of \neconomic development; it comes out of infrastructure; it comes out of \nhighways and airports; it comes out of law enforcement; it comes out of \nso many areas that are fundamental and vital to America's national \ninterests. That will have to come out this year alone. But that is just \nthe beginning compared to where we would be in future years.\n  My constituents--Republicans and Democrats alike--in my home State, \nwhich is a very agricultural State, are asking me: Why has the \nPresident threatened to veto a $6 billion drought relief bill, for \ndroughts in 2001 and 2002, that has the support of 32 agricultural \norganizations, from the Farm Bureau to the Farmers Union, liberal to \nconservative, because of the natural disasters they faced? Why is the \nPresident threatening to veto $6 billion of relief but talking \nsimultaneously about $108 billion of economic stimulus this year that \nwould go primarily to Wall Street?\n  What would be more stimulative of the economy than to provide that \ndrought relief across the dozens of States that suffer badly this year? \nBecause of the circumstances the States face, schools in my State are \nliterally on the verge of closing their doors. My hospitals and my \nnursing homes--because we did not pass the Medicare reimbursement \nchanges last year and seemed to be in no rush to get it done this \nyear--are at risk of closing their doors as well.\n  Our veterans are standing in lines, 10 and 12 and 14 months long, in \nmy home State, waiting to gain access to the health care benefits that \nthey fought and struggled for in defending our Nation but for which we \ndo not now have the money to provide.\n  The priorities laid on the table are astonishing, that the President \nwould recommend $108 billion of tax cuts this year, to borrow the money \nto pay for that when we can't come up with the drought relief and the \nVA health care and can't keep our schools and nursing homes open. What \nsense does that make?\n  I am willing to consider some additional tax relief for middle-class \nfamilies, but the environment has changed radically from what it was a \ncouple years ago. Now we find ourselves in a situation where the most \nfundamental needs of our people are in jeopardy. We need to take that \ninto consideration.\n  It is my hope that there will be strong bipartisan opposition to the \nplan as presented by the President, that we can in fact go forward, \ncome to an equitable division of resources available for committees, \npromptly take up the 2003 budget, take up the 2004 budget, deal with \nthe shortfalls that we have in rural America for our veterans, \neducation, health care, seniors. And when we have done that, we will \nsee what we can do relative to tax relief for our middle-class working \nfamilies who struggle so hard every day to meet health care payments \nand house payments and to keep their kids in school. We will work with \nthem as well, but we can't give away the store. We cannot, regardless \nof the libertarian political drive behind it, support a budget tax \nproposal as wildly out of keeping with where most South Dakotans and \nmost Americans of either political persuasion want to go.\n  I express my frustration that this Nation needs to meet its \ncommitments, it needs fiscal responsibility, and it can only do that by \nrejecting the President's enormous $933 billion, over 10-year proposal, \nand returning to taking care of the needs of our people, returning our \nbudgets to the black and setting the stage for additional prosperity \nand making sure that we have the resources to deal with whatever \nmilitary eventuality we may have to face very soon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Since that terrible day on September 11, virtually none \nof us have been untouched by those acts of cowardice and the effort to \nbreak the American spirit. Fortunately, they did not succeed. We were \nshaken but probably strengthened from that.

Mr. President, I wish to talk a little about the \ncongressional session we are in now for our second week. We have lots \nof things to do. Certainly, the American people are anxious that we \nmove on to do those things. Yet we find ourselves in sort of a stall on \nthe floor, which is disappointing. We know we have actions to take. We \nknow we have to be organized. Yet we are held up in being organized. \nThat is discouraging to many of us.\n  The fact is that 2 years ago, when the Senate was 50-50, we had an \nagreement as to how to work and how to fund the committees. Now we \nfind, particularly on the other side, that we can't come to agreement.\n  As I understand it, we had then a 50-50 arrangement with 10 percent \ngoing to the majority committee because there are lots of common costs. \nSo it broke it down really into a 60-40 arrangement. That was \nsatisfactory.\n  Now it seems that we can't find a satisfactory agreement. I urge the \nleadership to move forward so we can get on to do the things we are \nhere to do. We have a lot of things to do, many of which are held over \nfrom the last session.\n  One of the most pressing is ready to be acted upon whenever we are \nready to act on it, and that is 11 of the 13 appropriations which we \ndid not even get to last year. The other is to begin on a budget of \nwhich we had none last year. A lot of people say it doesn't make much \ndifference whether you have a budget anyway; You always break it. The \nfact is, it is important because it has a restriction in it. When a \nbudget is set and the spending goes beyond that budget, you can raise a \npoint of order, and it takes 60 votes instead of 50. That is a \nprotection from overspending. We hear a lot about spending. I am one \nwho wants to control spending.\n  So here we are with things to do in the new year. We are here with \nitems left over from last year, and we are not able to get going with \nit.\n  Everyone, of course, has their own priorities, but there are some \nfairly commonly agreed upon. Certainly education is one. There is \nnothing more important. When I talk to people about Government programs \nand things they want to do more about, education is always among the \ntop. It is true that the Federal contribution to the financing of \neducation is only about 7 percent of the total. But nevertheless, it is \nan important part, particularly when Federal rules and regulations \nprovide some unfunded mandates to the States to do the things they must \ndo.\n  I am in favor of having some common methods of having an assessment \nof how schools are doing partly because now we move so freely in this \nNation; if you are educated in Wyoming, you may end up working in New \nYork. You need to know that your education is comparable so you will do \nas well there as you could anywhere else.\n  We are talking about funding. We are talking about IDEA, funding for \nspecial education, which is very important. I hear a great deal about \nthat. My wife happens to be a special education teacher, and it is \nterribly important that we give everyone an opportunity. To do that, \nyou have to have special education.\n  The Perkins Act, which funds vocational education, whether it be \nagriculture, business, whatever, is apparently in somewhat of a \ncontroversy at the moment. It is very important that we be able to \nprovide vocational education and opportunities for young people to \nbecome trained in what they want to do.\n  Testing, of course, is very controversial, but I believe it is a test \nas to whether or not schools are keeping up with others. Some argue, \nwell, you just teach to the test. I suppose there is some danger of \nthat. If the tests are adequate, perhaps that is not a bad idea, but \nthere has to be accountability. So that is where we are with education.\n  On energy policy, we spent a great deal of time with that last \nyear, more probably than we should have had to spend because it was \npulled out of committee and the committee did not make the decisions. \nWe brought it to the floor. I believe we were here 7 weeks on energy \npolicy. Then it went into committee to facilitate the differences \nbetween the House and Senate and, frankly, we never did come to a \nsuccessful conclusion.\n\n  Energy policy is very important at any time because nothing touches \nmore of us than does energy--whether it is light, heat, automobiles, \nwhatever. Even more important now, as we deal with economic \ndifficulties, is that we find the price of energy going up, partly \nbecause of the unrest in the Middle East. So energy policy, it seems to \nme, is very important, and we ought to get back on that.\n  We can have an energy policy. We have not had one for years. We need \nto have one that has to do with domestic production, so that we are not \n60-percent dependent upon exports as we are now. We need a policy that \nprovides for more research into new sources of energy, so that we have \nrenewables, so that we have various other kinds of opportunities. We \nhave to have research to make sure that what we use now--coal, for \ninstance--is as clean as it can be for air quality. That is the kind of \nbalanced policy we need. But here we are with that need to move forward \nand we are not able to do that.\n  Certainly, health care is one. In my State of Wyoming, health care \nhas become particularly important over the last couple years, largely \nbecause of cost and accessibility. Often, when we talk about health \ncare, we talk about Medicare, and certainly we should. Medicare is very \nimportant to a large number of people who have higher costs generally. \nNevertheless, Medicare is there and we need to make some changes with \nit, particularly as we look forward to what we are going to do over the \nnext few years--a program that gives some choices and hopefully brings \nin more private operations and a more private distribution of resources \nthat will fund a program that is needed over a period of time. The one \nwe have now isn't going to do that.\n  We have to make some changes. I suspect we will be looking at more \nshort-term changes originally, as we first go about it. We need to look \nat the long term, what we want to have over time and what it takes to \nprovide a health care distribution system that is useful. It is not all \nMedicare. For example, in our State the prices have gone up \nsubstantially. There are a number of reasons, of course. Part of it is \nliability insurance for physicians. Many have given up certain kinds of \npractices because the cost of liability insurance is out of sight. We \ncan do something about that, and we can do something about it here as \nwell as in our States.\n  We have a problem with the number of uninsured in this country. Of \ncourse, the notion of insurance, the concept of insurance is that you \nhave a broad participation of people, some of whom are less likely to \nneed services than others, so that it levels out the costs. But when \nyou have a large segment of the most healthy people who do not carry \ninsurance, then that concept is weakened. So those are broader issues \nthat we need to have. We have a shortage of nurses. We need to do \nsomething about that. It has very little to do with Medicare.\n  The other one that is important, of course, and I suspect will be \ndealt with\n\n[[Page S215]]\n\nmore quickly, is pharmaceuticals. Some say we have an overutilization \nof pharmaceuticals. For many people, particularly the elderly, the cost \nis extremely high for pharmaceuticals and is unable to be handled by \nmany people. We need to find a better way of distribution, find a \nbetter way of using generics, find a better way of examining the \npharmaceutical requirements.\n\n  We had some meetings. In one case, we had a retired pharmacist take a \nlook at the pharmaceutical needs of the people employed by his former \ncompany. He was able to reduce it substantially and still provide the \nsame kind of health care. So there are a lot of things that we can do.\n  As to jobs and the economy, obviously, nobody is unaware of the fact \nthat we need to do something there. We need to have a program. All we \nhave heard in the last 2 weeks is criticism of the President's economic \nprogram. I believe the President has a very well-balanced effort at \ndoing something about the economy. He does something initially with \npayments, such as child care, reduction of income tax withholding, \nwhich would put more dollars in right away. I suppose we can talk about \nthe size of the package because of dividends on some of the payments \nthat are made. But the fact is, it is a balanced program that has \ninitial impact; it has long-term kinds of tax reductions that create \njobs.\n  Now, it is one thing to just sling money out there, which some folks \nlike to do. The real answer is to develop jobs so people have them long \nterm, and that is what it is all about.\n  On judicial nominations, we are behind from last year. We still \nhaven't organized a committee to do that.\n  We are faced with lots of opportunities to do some things that need \nto be done. Yet here we are waiting to begin to move. I think the \npressure needs to be on the leadership to resolve this issue and get us \ninto a position to move forward so we can deal--as we are here to do--\nwith the issues before us and resolve many of the questions that are \npending.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, hopefully we will be able to move forward on \nthe most important matter facing the country today, in my opinion, and \nthat is getting something done to be able to fund Government.\n  As the Democratic leader said earlier today, we all recognize the \ncountry is in a deep economic decline. Last month alone we lost over \n101,000 jobs as reported by the Department of Labor. As we talked \nearlier this morning, we need only look at the article in the Wall \nStreet Journal today which is entitled, ``Slump in Job Market Is \nLongest in Decades. Near-term Prospects For Workers Remain Grim.''\n  This is Monday. Thursday is fast approaching, and that is when people \nare always saying they have to catch a plane. If we cannot complete our \nbusiness this week and deal with the 11 appropriations bills, we should \nwork next week. The majority leader should tell everybody right now \nthat they should put on hold their business for next week, that this is \nan important time for the country. With the economy being in the \nrecession and no prospects in the near future of getting out of it, and \nthe only proposal we have coming from the White House is to give more \ntax cuts to the rich--and from the reports in the press today part of \nthe tax dividends would go to both the President and Vice President in \nthe sums of hundreds of thousands of dollars if this crazy dividend \nscheme goes through--hopefully we would work through next week, if \nnecessary, to deal with the problems the country faces.\n  There is no plan for creating jobs. It seems the only answer that \ncomes from the administration to every problem is more tax cuts for the \nwealthy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/13/senate-section/article/S215-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S215-S220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE NATION'S ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last Thursday I spoke at some length about \nthe Nation's economy and pointed out what I thought at that time were \nsome of the deficiencies in the President's plan for economic recovery.\n  In my remarks on Thursday, in reading them over in the Record, I \nthought maybe I might have been a little harsh; maybe my remarks were a \nlittle too pointed in that they referred to the President's economic \nplan as one that would unduly benefit the wealthiest in our country and \nthat would not do much to really help working Americans.\n  After reading the newspapers over the weekend, I have come to the \nconclusion that what I said on Thursday was not nearly as harsh a \njudgment on the President's economic policy as that of some of our \nforemost economic thinkers and writers in America today.\n  So after reading these newspapers this weekend, I thought I would \ncall the attention of my colleagues and others to several articles that \nappeared on this topic over the weekend, which I think are graphic in \ntheir detail and analysis of how awful the President's economic program \nis, and will be for this country if we enact his latest version.\n  The first thing I saw was, on Saturday morning, a front-page article \nthat said the economy lost 100,000 jobs in December. The unemployment \nrate remains at an 8-year high. This was on the front page of the \nWashington Post on January 11:\n\n       U.S. companies shed more than 100,000 jobs last month, \n     reducing payrolls to their lowest level since the recession \n     began in early 2001, while the unemployment rate remained at \n     6 percent, its eight-year high, the Labor Department reported \n     yesterday.\n\n  Again, unemployment is high and continues to get worse. So clearly we \nhave to do something in this country to stem the rising tide of people \nwho are not working.\n  Looking back a couple of years ago to when the first economic \ndownturn started, when the President put his recovery program into \nplace, in 2001, it is clear it is not working. We are 18 months later \nand it is not working. It is going in the wrong direction. So do we \nkeep going down that road or do we start to make some changes? That is \nwhat we have to do. We have to recognize we are going down the wrong \nroad and we have to make some changes.\n  The President has now proclaimed his new economic program to build on \nthe misguided one of 2001. This is a David Broder column from Sunday's \nWashington Post entitled: ``It Reeks of Politics.'' I wondered what he \nwas talking about. I thought maybe he was talking about judicial \nappointments or something like that--``It Reeks of Politics.'' No. What \nMr. Broder was talking about was the economic program. I will quote \nsome parts of it.\n\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\n\n       Before the O'Neill talk--\n\n  He is talking about a phone call from Paul O'Neill--\n\n       I asked one of my favorite Republican economics guides what \n     he thought of the new Bush tax plan. He did not mince words. \n     This man--a veteran of the Nixon and Ford administrations and \n     a friend and adviser to many officials in the Reagan and two \n     Bush administrations--said, ``It may be the least defensible \n     policy ever.'' I would amend that slightly. It is probably \n     the most ill-considered since Treasury Secretary John \n     Connally persuaded President Nixon to freeze wages and prices \n     in 1971. Like that move--designed to help Nixon's reelection \n     in 1972, whatever the damaging long-term consequences, this \n     latest pack of proposals reeks of politics. The proposal to \n     eliminate taxes on dividends--the centerpiece of the plan and \n     the source of more than half of its staggering costs--looks \n     like ``the wrong reform at the wrong time,'' my mentor said.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Mr. Broder's column printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 12, 2003]\n\n                          It Reeks of Politics\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       When Commerce Secretary Don Evans phoned me to praise the \n     tax plan announced by President Bush last week--he must have \n     drawn the short straw to have my name on his call list--he \n     assured me that the ``bold package'' would boost ``the \n     general well-being of the people.''\n       ``Nobody wins unless we all win,'' the president's longtime \n     friend said--a sentiment with which I assured him I \n     concurred.\n       In his next breath, Evans derided the rival Democratic \n     stimulus plan--which would cost one-fifth as much as the $674 \n     billion, 10-year Bush package--because it relies mainly on a \n     one-time rebate of $300 to every taxpayer. ``One-shot \n     remedies don't work,'' Evans said. ``You have to create a \n     feeling of certainty for at least the next 10 years, so \n     businesses and families can plan.''\n       It was not that long ago that the White House was telling \n     us that the 2001 tax rebate--$300 for individuals and $600 \n     for families--had been instrumental in making the recession \n     ``the shortest and shallowest in history.'' But now, as the \n     president's re-election approaches and unemployment lingers \n     at uncomfortably high levels, the ``certainty'' of 2001's 10-\n     year Bush tax plan is being scrapped by the administration in \n     hopes of pumping the economy before the voters get to the \n     polls.\n       Is it needed? In his first public appearance since he was \n     fired last month as Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill told a \n     Sulgrave Club audience the other night that, with the economy \n     growing at a 3 percent annual rate in the first three \n     quarters of 2002, ``it is hard to see a need for Keynesian \n     remedies,'' i.e., further tax cuts and more stimulus.\n       Before the O'Neill talk, I asked one of my favorite \n     Republican economics guides what he thought of the new Bush \n     tax plan. He did not mince words. This man--a veteran of the \n     Nixon and Ford administrations and a friend and adviser to \n     many officials in the Reagan and two Bush administrations--\n     said, ``it may be the least defensible policy ever.'' I would \n     amend that slightly: It is probably the most ill-considered \n     since Treasury Secretary John Connally persuaded President \n     Nixon to freeze wages and prices in 1971.\n       Like that move--designed to help Nixon's reelection in \n     1972, whatever the damaging long-term consequences--this \n     latest pack of proposals reeks of politics. The proposal to \n     eliminate taxes on dividends--the centerpiece of the plan and \n     the source of more than half its staggering cost--looks like \n     ``the wrong reform at the wrong time,'' my mentor said.\n       Eliminating the double taxation of dividends--once on the \n     profits of the corporation and again on the payout to the \n     stockholder--has been discussed in every Republican \n     administration, he said, and considered by some Democratic \n     presidents. It has a sound foundation, because double \n     taxation tilts corporate finance toward borrowing, rather \n     than going into the equity markets. But, he said, business \n     groups and almost all economists agree that the right way to \n     remedy the situation is to make dividend payments deductible \n     for the corporations, as interest payments already are.\n       Instead of that straightforward policy, the administration \n     chose to lift the tax on dividend recipients--eliminating any \n     direct benefit to the companies--so that Bush could claim, as \n     he did, that this change ``is for the good of our senior \n     citizens'' who count on dividends to supplement their Social \n     Security.\n       That argument has gaping holes. As was quickly noted by the \n     accounting industry, the Bush proposal entails complicated \n     calculations for both business and individual taxpayers, \n     adding further complexity to the tax code.\n       Moreover, it would not affect the mass of dividends that go \n     into the 401(k) plans on which most working Americans depend \n     for additional retirement income. Those dividends are not \n     immediately taxed now, and the taxes due when the money is \n     withdrawn would remain unchanged under the Bush proposal.\n       According to an analysis by the Urban Institute and the \n     Brookings Institution, 64 percent of the $364 billion in \n     benefits from dividend tax elimination would go to the top 5 \n     percent of taxpayers, the same people who are the main \n     beneficiaries of the Bush tax cuts of 2001.\n       Over time, eliminating this tax would likely deepen the \n     growing budget deficits. The first round of Bush tax cuts \n     will cost more than $1.3 trillion in revenue over 10 years. \n     This package pushes the costs to the $2 trillion level--even \n     as the demands of homeland defense, the war on terrorism and \n     a possible attack on Iraq add to spending pressures.\n       But none of this is likely to deter Bush. His arguments are \n     flexible, but the policy is constant: Keep cutting taxes from \n     the top down.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Rove and the political advisers to the President may \nthink it is good politics, but it is terribly damaging to our economy. \nAgain, I refer to some Republicans in this Congress and in this \nadministration who support this plan, and I said they should properly \nbe called ``red ink Republicans'' because they seem to have absolutely \nno concern about pushing plans that will skyrocket the deficit and the \nnational debt.\n  Mr. Broder goes on in the last couple of paragraphs to point out:\n\n       Over time, eliminating this tax--\n\n  The dividend tax--\n\n     would likely deepen the growing budget deficits. The first \n     round of Bush tax cuts will cost more than $1.3 trillion in \n     revenue over 10 years. This package--\n\n  This new package--\n\n     pushes the costs to the $2 trillion level--even as the \n     demands of homeland defense, the war on terrorism and a \n     possible attack on Iraq add to spending pressures. But none \n     of this is likely to deter Bush. His arguments are flexible, \n     but the policy is constant: Keep cutting taxes from the top \n     down.\n\n  Now we are talking about more than $2 trillion in deficits. I guess \nthe times have changed. Former Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois once \nsaid: A billion here and a billion there, and pretty soon you are \ntalking about real money. We have to revise that. Now it is a trillion \nhere and a trillion there and pretty soon you are talking about real \nmoney. And, that is before we add huge additional sums in interest to \nbe paid on the debt.\n  We have considerable needs that we have to meet domestically: \nHomeland defense, a possible war with Iraq--I hope not--a huge unfunded \nmandate on local schools called Leave No Child Behind, which is \nunderfunded; special education, totally underfunded. These last two \nitems, the cost of special education, the cost of all the testing and \neverything to leave no child behind, they mean higher property taxes at \nthe local level, which is harder on the middle class than the tax on \ncorporate dividends.\n  If we do not meet our obligations at the Federal level on special \neducation and meet other education needs like the unfunded mandate of \nLeave No Child Behind, that means the States and local communities will \nhave to do it. They will raise property taxes. That hits the middle \nclass a lot harder than the tax on dividends.\n  Of course, towards the end of the decade we will have the retirement \nof the baby boomers coming. Then where will the money be to fix Social \nSecurity and Medicare? We will be so far in the hole at that time maybe \nthen that dream will come true of those who want to privatize Social \nSecurity. Maybe that is what it is all about at the end of this decade.\n  So the reading this weekend was not too good, not promotive of the \nPresident's policies. There were a lot of warning shots heard. There \nwas another article in the Sunday Washington Post, ``A Tax Plan That \nWill Pay Few Dividends.'' The article was written by Reuven S. Avi-\nYonah, the Irwin I. Cohn Professor of Law at the University of \nMichigan, and David S. Miller who is a tax lawyer in Manhattan. I don't \nknow either one of these individuals. Reading their article is a clear \nwarning to those in Congress that if the President will not cease and \ndesist from this ill-considered tax scheme of his to cut taxes on \ndividends, then we in the Senate must hold up the stop sign and say no. \nThis article, ``A Tax Plan That Will Pay Few Dividends,'' is alarming \nin how it paints the future of what happens if we go down that path:\n\n       So the portrayal of the double tax on dividends as evil is \n     more fiction than fact. Dividend exclusion is unlikely to \n     have the desired effect of lifting the stock market, and the \n     administration's proposal won't really cure the woes of our \n     corporate tax system.\n       Instead, it raises serious issues. First, if the measure \n     does encourage individuals to\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\n     shift investments from taxable bonds into more risky tax-free \n     dividend-paying stocks, the investing public will be less \n     diversified and less cushioned for the next stock market \n     downturn. And if the proposal succeeds in increasing dividend \n     rates, corporations might borrow more to pay higher yields, \n     making balance sheets all the more shaky.\n       And fourth, the exclusion will benefit the wealthy. The \n     Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates that the \n     wealthiest 1 percent of all taxpayers could capture as much \n     as 42 percent of the benefits of a dividend exclusion. This \n     ``tax cut'' won't put any more money in the hands of working \n     Americans.\n       But we are certain of one thing: Excluding dividends from \n     taxation will create opportunities for new tax shelters. \n     There will be tax shelters that permit corporations to \n     artificially manufacture dividends for shareholders and \n     shelters that permit shareholders to receive tax-exempt \n     dividends without economically ``owning'' any of the \n     underlying stock. Each of these shelters is easy to develop \n     under current law.\n       If history is any guide, Congress will respond by enacting \n     new rules to stop taxpayers from abusing the exclusion. Given \n     the IRS's recent track record, these anti-abuse rules will \n     run to hundreds of pages, few cheats will ever be caught, \n     those cases will take years to litigate and ultimately the \n     anti-abuse rules will prove ineffective.\n\n  Then this morning, I listened to NPR and I obtained a transcription. \nThis was ``Morning Edition'' on National Public Radio. Bob Edwards was \nhost in the first of a series of commentaries about the Bush economic \nplan. Commentator Kevin Phillips says:\n       The White House proposal to eliminate taxes on dividends \n     will increase debate over class warfare in the U.S. economic \n     policy.\n\n  Then Kevin Phillips came on, and he said:\n\n       Over the last two decades, the Republicans in Washington \n     have been quick to charge class warfare when the Democrats \n     complain that this or that tax or economic proposal gives too \n     much to the American rich. By this the Democrats usually mean \n     the top 1 percent income group. It's been a good GOP \n     strategy, and sometimes it has worked when Democratic \n     debaters have backed off. But this time, with the \n     administration's proposal to allocate more than half of a \n     $674 billion economic stimulus program to tax relief for \n     stock dividends, the whole class warfare issue was riding a \n     giant boomerang.\n       The Democrats say, and they're quite right, that what the \n     administration is doing is in itself class warfare; high-\n     income policy makeovers are short-changing the other income \n     groups. The top 1 percent of Americans alone hold some 40 \n     percent of the individually owned stock in the United States, \n     and they also get about that same 40 percent ratio of \n     dividends paid out. Given all the concern in the White House \n     and elsewhere about pumping support into a weak economy, this \n     proposal is really mind-blowing, not just for its contents, \n     but for its lack of stimulus. Republican Senator John McCain \n     had called for payroll tax relief.\n\n  Well, so have I. Last Thursday I said what we ought to be calling for \nis a payroll tax holiday with the trust funds fully reimbursed through \nthe general fund for perhaps four months and put the money where it \nreally needs to go.\n\n       But not George Bush. The congressional leadership in the \n     White House are so wedded to an economic policy keyed to \n     helping those at the top that they lined up behind what is \n     really a program to make stock dividends into a 10-year, $300 \n     billion individual income tax shelter. This isn't just \n     trickle-down economics. The benefits to the rest of the \n     economy, even to the stock market, are so conjectural that \n     trickle-down looks to become misting down.\n\n  That is Kevin Phillips; with long Republican credentials.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada, after the trickle-down economics of \nthe 1980s, one of my constituents came up to me in Iowa and said: I \nheard all about the trickle-down, I have not even had any drops on me. \nI would just settle for a heavy dew. That is what Kevin Philips said we \nmight get out of this: Maybe a heavy dew.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I heard the Senator speaking and wanted to congratulate the \nSenator. I listened also to Kevin Phillips' presentation. By the way, \nKevin Phillips is a Republican, not a Democrat. But he was fair in his \nanalysis. Quite clearly, all economists that I know, unless they work \nat 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, say this tax plan is bizarre. Crazy.\n  The Senator is aware, is he not, that not only do we have this tax \nplan that is floating around, that is going to be very harmful short \nterm and disastrous long term, the Senator is aware that the Wall \nStreet Journal, which is also not a piece put out by the Democratic \nParty, said today, on page 2: ``Slump in Job Market is Longest in \nDecades.'' And near-term prospects for workers remain grim?\n  Is the Senator aware that is in the Wall Street Journal today?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was so depressed after reading the newspapers this \nweekend, I didn't pick up the Wall Street Journal this morning. I guess \nI could get depressed further reading that.\n  Mr. REID. This article points out, among other things, last month \nthis economy lost over 101,000 jobs. I know this because I was on a \ntelevision program with Tim Russert. He had a chart demonstrating all \nthe Presidents of the United States going back to Truman. Every \nPresident created jobs--Nixon, Truman, Eisenhower, all of them except \nGeorge W. Bush. That chart shows the only President that has not \ncreated jobs, George W. Bush, and, in fact, he has lost 2.5 million \njobs.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was not. I was aware of the fact we lost 100,000 jobs \nin December. It was Christmas. Imagine, at Christmas, to have 100,000 \njobs lost. I also know we are at the highest unemployment level in over \n8 years.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is right. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Also, this article in the Wall Street Journal has a number of graphs \nand charts, but one of the things that just jumped out at me is the \nlevels of unemployment of certain segments of our economy, certain \ndemographic segments. It just jumps out.\n  Teenagers, of course, a lot of them are unemployed, and they want to \nwork. But for African-American teenagers the unemployment rate is over \n33 percent. It has gone up. From last year to this year, it has gone up \n3 percent. These are kids who want to work.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. There are no jobs for them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then we wonder why kids in the cities are hanging around \nthe streets and get into drug, joining gangs and things like that. They \nneed jobs. They need to be put to work.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, I \nwas on a talk radio program this morning in Las Vegas--conservative. \nOne of the things I have advocated is that the Federal Government \nshould spend money creating jobs, infrastructure. I know in Iowa there \nare water systems that need to be worked on, sewer systems that need to \nbe repaired and enlarged, highways, bridges, dams that need to be \nworked on.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Schools.\n  Mr. REID. And school repairs. This is a conservative program. They \nbrought it up.\n  They said: I understand you want to have jobs and spend taxpayers' \nmoney on creating jobs.\n  I said: Yes, I do.\n  They said: Wouldn't the private sector be better off creating those \njobs?\n  I said: Wait just a second. You understand the private sector is the \none that is going to be conducting the work.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. It is no Government giveaway. These are projects that need \nto be done, roads that need to be built, dams that need to be repaired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. I think we had a good discussion on this conservative radio \nprogram. I hope I educated them and their listeners because I said, \namong other things, that for every $1 billion we spend, we create \n42,000 or 44,000 jobs. Think about that. These are good jobs, people \nwho are paying taxes, they are buying refrigerators and cars.\n  We have this backwards. We are trying to help the wrong people, to \ncreate this windfall to the very wealthy in this scheme. There is no \nbetter place to start than the President and the Vice President. Is the \nSenator aware that the President of the United States and the Vice \nPresident of the United States would benefit significantly from this \ndividend scheme? In fact, between the two of them, the benefits would \nbe over $400,000 a year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. A huge benefit.\n  Mr. REID. Don't we have this backwards? Wouldn't it be better if we \nwere creating jobs rather than cutting taxes for the wealthy?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Nevada, the assistant minority \nleader: You are thinking too rationally. You are just thinking too \nrationally. Evidently what is happening down there at the White House \nis they want to think irrationally. But we have to stand up and we have \nto think along the lines\n\n[[Page S218]]\n\nthe Senator is talking about here right now.\n  The Senator put his finger on it. I have been somewhat successful in \nthe last few years, getting some money in my State for rebuilding and \nmodernizing schools all over the State of Iowa. I visited--not all of \nthem, I visited a number of them: new classrooms, getting new \ntechnology in.\n  I visited one school that just started up this fall, and one of the \nworkers there, one of the brick masons, saw me outside. He said: I \nunderstand you helped get some Federal money to get this going, get \nthis school improved.\n  I said yes.\n  He said: I want to thank you. It put food on my family's table for \nmonths, working on that school.\n  To answer this sort of statement the Senator made earlier about: \nWell, these are government jobs; wouldn't the private sector be \nbetter?--all the jobs done on that school were done in the private \nsector: private contractors, private electricians. They buy all the \nstuff from the private sector. So the ripple effect in the economy was \ntremendous.\n  That is why the Senator has put his finger on it. There are so many \nunmet needs in this country. I focus on schools a lot. I think the \nrecent estimate is somewhere in the neighborhood of $189 billion, I \nbelieve--I could be off some--just to bring all our public schools up \nto modern-day standards; in other words, to give them the heating and \nthe air-conditioning, the lighting, fire standards, the Internet \nhookups--just making them modern. What an unmet need out there.\n  What if we were to do that? Think of the jobs we would create. One \nthing I might also say to my friend from Nevada: Just think, not only \ndo you get the jobs' ripple effect in the economy, but when it is over \nwith, you have something that lasts a long time. You have new schools.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, I \ntraveled to one of Nevada's schools fairly recently, Boulder City High \nSchool. It is an old school now. It is an old high school. It is hard \nfor me to comprehend Boulder City having an old high school, but they \ndo. The average school in America is 45 years old. The average school--\nthink of that--is 45 years old. Schools need to be refurbished and \nrebuilt. Boulder City is kind of unusual in Clark County, in Nevada, \nbecause most of our schools there are new. We hold the record. We \ndedicated 18 new schools in 1 year in the Clark County School District.\n  So certainly the Senator is right. But I wanted to say this about the \nthing the Senator mentioned, and Kevin Phillips was mentioned, and he \ntalked about class warfare. They believe the best defense is a good \noffense. So they have been whacking away at us since they introduced \nthis ridiculous tax plan. They have been whacking away at us saying: \nThey, the Democrats, are trying to create class warfare. We are not \ndoing it. They have been doing it with their ridiculous tax plan.\n  I have nothing against rich people. I wish them well if they can make \na lot of money and be rich. But they have created that, that the very \nwealthy are going to get tax benefits from this plan and the middle \nclass and the poor get nothing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. Almost literally nothing. We are only bringing out facts \nand talking about the reality of this tax plan. We are not trying to \ncreate class warfare.\n  That is why the Wall Street Journal writes about this:\n\n       Slump in Job Market Is Longest in Decades.\n\n  We are not doing that. That is a fact of life.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Nevada, I got depressed reading \nthe weekend newspapers. Here is one in the Business section of the \nSunday Washington Post, apropos of what you are just talking about \nhere, about whom this is benefitting. The headline:\n\n       Some CEOs Would See a Windfall.\n\n  They have a nice little 1040 Tax Code wrapped up as a nice package \nhere.\n  It says here:\n\n       . . . some of the biggest potential winners under the Bush \n     plan would be top executives at dividend-paying companies who \n     own big blocks of their firm's shares.\n       Walt Disney Co.'s Michael D. Eisner, for instance, owns \n     about 14 million company shares, a spokesman said. Disney \n     announced an annual dividend of 21 cents this month, which \n     adds up to about $2.9 million for Eisner. Under the current \n     tax code, assuming Eisner is in the highest personal income \n     tax bracket, the Disney chairman and CEO would pay about $1.3 \n     million in state and federal taxes on that amount, according \n     to a tax expert at a major accounting firm. Under the Bush \n     plan, he might pay nothing on that portion of his income.\n\n  It went on. There were some other ones here that they mentioned. \nSanford Weil, who owns 22.8 million shares, would save as much as $6.9 \nmillion in taxes.\n  Mr. REID. This is per year. This is not over a lifetime; this is per \nyear.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is for 1 year. I am sorry. I thank the Senator for \npointing that out. It is not a lifetime sum. It might be repeated year \nafter year.\n  Douglas Daft owns 2.5 million shares in Coca-Cola. He is chief \nexecutive. Coke paid 80 cents a share in dividends. Under the Bush \nplan, he would save about $875,000 in taxes.\n  These are all, I am sure, fine individuals. They have done a lot. \nThey have invested in America, helped build big corporations. They are \nCEOs. I have nothing against them, as the Senator said. I have nothing \nagainst them. They are likely to be fine people. But does that mean \nwhat we are going to do now is take the Tax Code and give them even \nmore wealth, as the Senator said, when we have 100,000 people in \nDecember out of work and we have so many unmet needs in this \ncountry? This is a cockamamie scheme.\n\n  My friend from South Carolina, who sits across the aisle from me, \nSenator Hollings, once said this came about after Charles Schwab went \ndown to the Texas ranch--I guess in December or sometime like that--and \nhad a little bite to eat and a little refreshment with the President. \nAnd Schwab evidently said: This is a good idea. And the President said: \nIt sounds good to me. Let's do it.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Last week I called someone the Senator from Iowa knows. He \nis a very strong businessman. I don't want to embarrass him. It was a \nprivate telephone call.\n  I said: Tell me what you think about this tax thing. He said: It is \ncrazy. He would benefit from it. He said: It is crazy. There are too \nmany things that need to be done.\n  I said: Would you come down and join with us and say something \npublicly about this? He said: I have a lot of government contracts, and \nI am afraid I would be punished if I did something like that.\n  He is not kidding. He has a lot of government contracts. The people \nfrom 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue and all people in the Cabinet have \nsome influence over who gets contracts and how they keep them.\n  I would also say this is in support of and in commendation for rich \npeople in America. I have, as does the Senator from Iowa, some rich \nfriends. I have not had a single person from Nevada call me about this \ngoofy scheme. I haven't had a single Nevadan call me. They know me \nwell. If they liked this program, they would call me.\n  There have been other tax proposals from the White House--in the \nClinton administration and in this administration--that I got calls on \nsaying either do it or not do it. I haven't received a single call from \nmy wealthy Nevada friends, or from wealthy Nevadans who may not be my \nfriends, I haven't had anybody call me and say: Reid, I want you to \nsupport this. This is important to me.\n  I don't think they could do it with a straight face.\n  Could Michael Eisner support what is happening? Knowing all of the \ncharitable things the Disney corporation is involved in, he couldn't \npossibly want more money for himself personally and another $2 million \na year when he makes these multimillions. He knows this should go \ntoward some of the public service things that need to be done and some \nof the health things that need to be done--the terrible battle we are \nfighting in the United States with AIDS and the like. I have to \nacknowledge and applaud wealthy Americans because they are not out \nclamoring for this to be done.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with my friend. I have had not a single call \neither. I have often said there is nothing wrong with being rich in \nAmerica. There is\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\nnothing wrong with having a nicer home and a nicer car, or a nicer \nlifestyle, as long as you have done it honestly and forthrightly. And \nmost wealthy people have done it that way. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. But I think the obligation that we have in government is to make \nsure we leave the ladder down for others to climb.\n  What the Bush administration seems to be saying is: You have a lot of \nmoney, you have made all this money, and you can pull the ladder up \nbehind you. And guess what. We are going to help you pull the ladder up \nbehind you.\n  That is not my idea of what America is about. America is about \nfairness and equity and giving the kids from Searchlight, NV, or \nCumming, IA, that same opportunity to get a great education, to be \nhealthy, to have a piece of that American dream, and to have that \nopportunity. But the more we concentrate wealth in the hands of a few \npeople and then use the Government to ensure that they not only keep it \nto get wealthy, the more we are taking that American dream from those \nkids in Searchlight, NV, and Cumming, IA.\n\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I want to say a word, if I may, \nbefore the Senator from Rhode Island, who is the Presiding Officer, \nleaves the Chamber.\n  The junior Senator from Rhode Island I think set a mark for people on \nthe other side of the aisle when he was the first to come out against \nthis proposal. That is the way I heard it. I read in the paper that the \nSenator from Rhode Island opposes this, and as a result of his doing \nthis, there have been several other Republican Senators who followed. \nBefore he leaves the floor, I want to express my appreciation for the \ncourage of the Senator from Rhode Island in coming out against this \nprogram.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would add my commendations also to my good friend, the \nSenator from Rhode Island, for his forthrightness in coming out as he \ndid. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. REID. I have taken so much of the Senator's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize for using so much of the \nSenator's time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is a good exchange. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. REID. I will say this last thing. I hope that we, the Democrats, \nand those courageous Republicans who oppose this don't fall for some \ncompromise. I hope they don't come back and say: Well, we will not do \naway with all of that, but we will do such and such.\n  We have to recognize this for what it is. It is a bad program. We are \nbroke as a country, and in the 2 years of this Bush administration they \nhave ruined the economy. During the last 3 years of the Clinton \nadministration we were taking in more money than we were spending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There was a surplus.\n  Mr. REID. It is remarkable. We were paying down the surplus. They \nhave wasted the largest surplus that we were able to acquire. It is a \nterrible shame. I hope we don't have some cockamamie compromise where \npeople walk out here and say: Well, it is not as bad as it could have \nbeen. We should recognize this for what it is and not compromise. We \ndon't want it.\n  That is how I think we should move forward.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Here is the chart that illustrates it. Here we are, \nstarting in, in 1981, with the first Reagan tax program. Look at what \nhappened to the deficit. It went down and down until finally we had the \n1993 plan when we started to reinvest in America and get our economy \nback on track. Look at what happened. Look at this. It is a steady \nclimb up for 8 straight years to one of the largest surpluses we have \never had in America.\n  Then, in 2001, the administration couldn't stand that we were getting \nout of debt. There were actually too much surplus for them. We were \npaying down national debt for future generations. This is the 2001 tax \nbill. Look at what happened--right back down where we started. Now we \nare back down in the hole again in the deficit. If that isn't enough, \nthey want to add even more--taking more money out with this \nnew cockamamie scheme of theirs to take it away with a tax dividend.\n\n  Mr. REID. I only point out one thing. In the Senator's last \nstatement, he said it was one of the largest surpluses in the history \nof this country. It was the largest surplus in the history of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is the largest surplus on record. Exactly.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator for allowing me to interrupt. I \nappreciate the Senator very much for allowing me to have a few words on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend for his keen insight into the economics \nof this country and this tax bill and how bad it really is.\n  I close by saying again that we have to kind of look at the past and \ntake some instruction from what happened. If you look at unemployment \nrates, when the 1981 tax bill was passed, the unemployment rate was 7.4 \npercent. Eighteen months later, it went from 7.4 to 10.3 percent. When \nthe 2001 tax bill was passed, unemployment was 4.5 percent. Now it is 6 \npercent. Now we have this coming in. Now in 1993, the blue line shows \nwhat we did. The unemployment rate went down. When it passed in 1993, \nthe unemployment rate was 6.8 percent, 18 months later it was down to \n5.4 percent and eventually it dropped to 4 percent. All of the red ink \nRepublicans said how it would be so terrible for the economy. But, \nafter the 1993 tax bill where the wealthy did see some real tax \nincreases, the economy boomed. The deficits turned into surpluses. And \nwe created a huge number of jobs. Again, we ought to be instructed by \nthat and know the fact that the President's tax cut will not only \nplunge us further into deficit spending but it will not help increase \nemployment. It will provide for one of the unfairest distributions of \nincome in our country.\n  For example, the 100-percent reduction in dividend rates provides, \nfor those making more than $1 million a year, an $88,000 tax cut--an \n$88,000 tax cut. And the average Iowan, making between $20,000 and \n$30,000, would get $204 in 2003.\n  But that is just the beginning. When you look at the outyears, it \ngets worse. By 2010, for the average Iowan, making $20,000 to $30,000, \nthey might get maybe $25. For those making $40,000 to $50,000, they \nwould get about $84. But if you made over $1 million a year, you would \nget $27,000 in tax benefits in the year 2010.\n  I believe it was former OMB Director David Stockman back in 1981, who \ncalled the Reagan tax cut--the trickle-down tax cut--he called it a \n``riverboat gamble.'' And that is exactly what it was: a riverboat \ngamble. And we lost in terms of deficits and unemployment. We got it \nback on track in the 1990s, but here we are back again.\n  Well, Mr. President, a ``riverboat gamble,'' ``trickle-down \neconomics''--whatever you call it--I call it ``go-go economics'': Don't \nthink about the future. Live for today. And, by all means, whatever may \nhelp you politically, whatever will help ensure your reelection, do \nthat, and forget about what comes after.\n  That is what this program is. Because it is designed, basically, to \nhelp those who will give the most out of their pockets to reelect this \nRepublican President: the richest people in this country. And, of \ncourse, we just had campaign finance reform, so to speak. And what did \nit do? It doubled the amount of money that a person can give to a \nFederal candidate--doubled it.\n  So I believe President Bush, when he was a candidate, if I am not \nmistaken, raised over $100 million--with those $1,000 contributions. \nWell, now that doubles and with a primary and general combined, it adds \nup to $4,000. So it just goes back to the same people. Plus they give \nmore money in other ways. So I guess what this is: rewarding your \nfriends. I understand that politically he rewards your friends. But in \nthis case it is hurting our whole economy by him rewarding his few rich \nfriends at the top.\n  As my friend from Nevada said--and I share this with him--I have not \nspoken with one wealthy person in Iowa or anywhere who called me saying \nthis is the best thing to do. Not one. In fact, I think most of them \nare even embarrassed by President Bush's proposal.\n  So the best thing, I think, is for the President to recognize this \nwas a bad\n\n[[Page S220]]\n\npiece of advice he got. I think one of the marks of leadership is to \nrecognize when you are wrong and to rectify it. If you want to give the \neconomy a shot in the arm right now, and give our bond markets a shot \nin the arm, I think the best thing the President can do is say he is \nscrapping this whole deal.\n  Then what we need is a payroll tax holiday, paid through the general \nfund to put money in the hands of working people, many of whom do not \neven pay income taxes. But they are working, and they are raising \nfamilies, and they are paying every last penny of payroll taxes. Many \nof these people did not get anything out of the 2001 tax plan. These \nare people who need some help. I will be talking more next week and in \nthe days to come about my concept of a payroll tax holiday that would \nextend for a few months, and which could be adjusted after that \ndepending upon what the economy is doing at that time.\n  It would be a lot cheaper than what the President is proposing, No. \n1. No. 2, it would give an immediate stimulus to the economy. Third, it \nis fair because it puts the money down at the bottom where it is \nneeded. As we know in Iowa, and as I am sure they know in Minnesota, \nyou don't fertilize a tree from the top down. You have to put it in at \nthe roots and let it grow. That is what a payroll tax holiday would do. \nThat would give us our short-term stimulus.\n\n  Then--exactly what Senator Reid was talking about--let's invest in \nrebuilding and modernizing schools. Drive the interstates someday and \nhave your car beaten to death. That interstate highway system is now \nalmost 50 years--a half a century--old. It needs to be rebuilt. These \nare things that need to be done in investment in the future of this \ncountry that puts people to work. That is the kind of job growth we \nneed in this country. And all those jobs are not done by the \nGovernment. They will all be done by the private contractors.\n  So I hope the President will recognize the bad advice he got, will \nsay he is scrapping this plan, and then come down and work with all of \nus. There are bipartisan things we can do here--I am convinced of it--\nbipartisan things we can do that will be both a short-term stimulus, \nthat will not inure huge deficits in the outyears, and there are long-\nterm things we can do to put people back to work that will benefit this \ncountry.\n  I call upon all my friends on the other side of the aisle who are not \n``red ink'' Republicans to join in this effort and to recognize the \nfuture of this country is not more red ink and more red ink and more \nred ink, but it is getting this country out of the hole, paying off the \ndeficits, and getting back to a surplus once again.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working in a bipartisan fashion \ntowards this end. But the lead has to come from the President. As long \nas he pushes that dividend tax scheme of his, well, then we are going \nto be kind of blocked from doing anything here. So I hope the President \nwill scrap it, call us together, and let's work out a bipartisan plan \nto get this country moving again.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his indulgence. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/13/senate-section/article/S220-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S220-S222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REORGANIZATION OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am very pleased to see the person \npresiding in the chair and welcome him to the Senate.\n  I am looking at an empty Chamber except for Senator Harkin, who is \njust leaving. It is incredible to understand that the Senate was sworn \nin on January 7, and yet today we sit in the Chamber having transacted \nno business except for the extension of unemployment benefits which was \ndone by unanimous consent because it didn't have to go through a \ncommittee.\n  Why, one may ask, would something only be able to pass that didn't \nhave to go through committee? Well, the answer is, because we don't \nhave any committees. The Senate has not been able to reorganize since \nJanuary 7 because we cannot get an agreement. We have not been able to \norganize our committees because the Democrats have been unwilling to \ncome to an agreement that would be a fair allocation of resources and \nthat would allow us to go forward.\n  A lot of people in the country don't realize that the Senate is in an \nabsolute stalemate because we do not have Republican chairmen, even \nthough the Republicans control the Senate. There are eight new Members \nof the Senate, and none of them have been appointed to a committee--not \none--because we don't have an organization resolution.\n  I do not think that is what the people of America said last November \nwhen they went to the polls. They voted on Senators, and they voted to \ngive Republicans a 51-to-49 vote count in the Senate.\n  Any person who follows this would imagine that everyone would \nunderstand that there has been a change of control, and they would have \nexpected us to be up and open for business, with committees meeting and \ndoing the business of the people. That is what was said by the people \nwho went to the polls in November and made their decisions on who would \nrepresent them in the Senate.\n  I am very pleased that our new Members have been sworn in. It is \nlittle enough to ask, I would say. But to think that they have not been \nable to even go to a committee meeting yet is unconscionable. A lot of \npeople have not realized that this is going on because we have tried to \nnegotiate in good faith, and Senator Frist is doing that as we speak. \nHopefully Senator Daschle is doing the same.\n  I don't think we can wait another week before we start confirming \nsome of these judges who have been sitting unconfirmed since May of \n2001 or even unable to have their nominations acted on.\n  We were ready to hit the ground running. The Judiciary Committee \nchairman wanted to start the process so the President would have his \nconstitutional right to appoint and have confirmed or turned down his \nnominees to the Federal bench. He has had neither. We were ready to go. \nWhat has happened? The Judiciary Committee cannot meet because Senator \nHatch has not been installed as chairman because we don't have an \norganization resolution.\n  We had hoped to pass the appropriations bills that had been lingering \nsince last Congress. We had only passed the Defense and military \nconstruction appropriations so all of the other Departments of \nGovernment have not yet been funded except in a continuing resolution, \nan omnibus bill that just says we will go on with 2002 levels of \nspending, but we don't have any allocations because the Appropriations \nCommittee has not been able to meet. The appointments have not even \nbeen formalized yet.\n\n  I do not think that is what the people of America expected when they \nvoted last November to put a Republican majority in the Senate. They \nexpected us to start appropriations bills. They expected us to confirm \nthe judges that had been sitting in the pipeline since 2001.\n  The President of the United States has a constitutional \nresponsibility to appoint judges, and he has the constitutional right \nto have those judges acted on by the Senate. Yet we have people whose \nlives have been disrupted because they have been appointed to the \nFederal bench, sitting there for 1 year, 2 years with their lives \ninterrupted. They are unable to have Senate confirmation or turndown.\n  The Senate has the absolute right to make the decision, but it has \nthe responsibility to go forward and let these people know if the \nPresident is going to get his appointment through or if these people \ncan go on with their lives.\n  I hope the President gets all of his appointments. He has been very \ncareful in making his appointments. But all of them have a right to \naction, and the President, most of all, has a right for the Senate to \ntake the very serious responsibility of confirming nominees.\n  We have appropriations bills. We have Departments of Government that \nhave no specific authorizations because we have only acted in a general \nway, saying whatever you had in 2002, you may keep until we can \nexercise our responsibility to pass the appropriations bills, which we \nhave not done since the end of the fiscal year October 1, 2002. These \nagencies deserve to know what Congress intends for them to do this year \nand how much money they have to spend.\n  This is not the way to run the Government. It is not responsible for \nus to\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\nbe talking to an empty Chamber since January 7 when the people have \nspoken and we are here to do business.\n  I do hope we will come to an agreement. It should be very simple. The \nelections were held. The majority has been elected. It is time to let \nthe majority take control of the Senate, organize the Senate, have the \ncommittees appointed, and start to do business. I hope we will go \nforward and do that.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I was in my office and I listened to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, the senior Senator from Texas. I agree with the \nSenator. I agree with what she said.\n  From our perspective, we realize we have lost the majority. It has \ngone from 51 Democrats to 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. Last year at \nthis time there were 49 Republicans.\n  But our suggestion is that the exact same organizational status that \nwas in existence for the 51-49 Democratic majority should be in effect \nfor the 51-49 Republican majority. That is what this is all about. We \nbelieve we should be working under the same organizational standards \nset when the majority was held by the Democrats. You would have the \nsame staffing that we had as Democrats, the same funding that we had as \nDemocrats, with the exception that both sides would have cost-of living \nincreases given to them automatically.\n  I hope common sense and fairness will prevail and, in short, that we \nwill have the same organizational standards as existed last time, \nexcept you would have what we had and we would have what you had.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the distinguished \ndeputy leader of the Democrats coming down because there are a lot of \ndifferent precedents in the Senate for all the years that the Senate \nhas been in session. Last session was quite unusual in that we had a \n50-50 Senate when we first came into office.\n  We made an agreement at that time that was based on 50-50, and the \nagreement was that it would stay in place regardless of what happened \nduring that time.\n  We can argue about what the funding ratio is of committees, but I \ndon't think that should hold us up from doing the business of the \npeople.\n  The committee allocations have been determined by agreement. The \nnumbers that serve on the committee have been set. So the committee \nappointments could be made, and we could open for business. What we are \nlosing this week is the nomination hearing for the Secretary of \nHomeland Defense, because the Democratic chairman would not yield to \nthe Republican chairman to chair such a hearing.\n  Now, Mr. President, there should not be a Democratic chairman in this \nSenate. The Republicans have control of the Senate. That is a fact. So \nI ask the distinguished deputy leader if we can open for business, hold \nhearings, appoint the committee so the Democrats and Republicans would \nhave their committee assignments and be able to begin the work and let \nthe negotiations go on for what the money allocation is for the \ncommittees. Let us do the business of Government and worry about \nwhether we have 60 percent of the money for the majority or 50 percent \nof the money for the majority, or 55, or 57, or whatever it is. We \ndon't have to decide that to do the business of Government.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield to the deputy leader on the \nRepublican side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I wonder if my friend from Texas knew what our friends \nand colleagues on the other side of the aisle had in mind had they \nstill been in the majority this year. I will read this to the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would not know that, so I am happy for the Senator \nto do that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There was an article on October 31 of 2002, and I will \nquote a couple of them:\n\n       Neither side particularly liked the resolutions that were \n     struck, after two intense negotiations, over how to organize \n     the Senate and its committees in the 107th Congress, \n     establishing new rules and giving equal space and funding to \n     the minority and majority parties.\n\n  Skipping over:\n\n       A senior Democratic aide said that was an ``extraordinary \n     circumstance''--\n\n  We will agree that the Senate ending up 50/50 was unusual. It hasn't \nhappened since the 1880s.\n\n     --that forced them to continue under an even funding deal for \n     committees.\n       ``If we pick up a seat or two, I think it's without a doubt \n     we'd go back to the two-thirds/one-third,'' the aide said, \n     using the in-house phrase to describe normal funding levels \n     that gave the majority up to 67 percent of committee money.\n\n  My question to the Senator from Texas is this: I wonder what has \nchanged between then and now. It appears that what our good friends and \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle had in mind, had they \ncontinued to be up 51-49, was to go back to the traditional split of \ntwo-thirds/one-third. There must have been some intervening thinking, I \nask my friend from Texas, some new development here.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I wonder if the Senator from Kentucky might have been \nreferring to the election held in November just after that statement \nyou have just read was made.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is pretty clear, as the Senator from Texas pointed \nout, the American people are not in doubt as to who took control of the \nSenate. What is also not in doubt was that the previous Congress was an \nextraordinary circumstance, very unusual circumstance, in which we \nfound ourselves in a 50/50 tie at the beginning of that Congress--and \nwe are now at the beginning of a new Congress--and we produced a \nresolution that dealt not just with appointing of the committees but \nalso funding and space. That was unusual. It had not been done before \nin a floor resolution, as the Senator from Texas pointed out. We \nswitched in the middle because one Senator decided to go to the other \nside. It was not because the voters had voted out a Republican Senate, \nbut a Senator decided to go over. In order to minimize the disruptions \nto staff who could have been laid off in the middle of a Congress after \nmaking plans and having families rely on employment at least for a 2-\nyear period of time, to minimize the disruption, since we were in the \nmiddle of a Congress, we decided to leave it that way. I say my friend \nfrom Texas is absolutely on the mark.\n\n  There is no precedent for what is being suggested would be \nappropriate by the other side. It is clearly inconsistent with what \nthey had in mind had they been up by a seat or two.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator allow me to answer the question she asked?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, in response to my friend from Kentucky, that Roll Call is not \nSenate precedent. Roll Call is a fine newspaper that we have here on \nCapitol Hill, but you always have to question when someone is quoting a \n``senior Democratic aide.'' Even if, in fact, that person were speaking \nwith some authority--which that person, of course, was not--if you \nlisten to what the person said, it said if we Democrats pick up a seat \nor two--in fact, if that happened, it would not have been 49-51, it \nwould have been 47-53. With that, I think there might have been an \nopportunity to look at how the distribution should take place. But the \nfact is the American people understand that common sense still is part \nof what we need to deal with here in Washington, and that is that last \nyear the Republicans were in the minority with 49 Senators. We are now \nin the minority with 49 Senators. Why don't we keep the same deal we \nhad last year? That is what Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader, is \npushing. That is what we Democrats want because it is fair.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator yielding and being as courteous as \nshe always is.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will end by saying I really hope we \ncan put aside the 57 percent, or the 60 percent, even though I think \nthere is certainly the argument for precedent whenever there has been a \nclear majority at the beginning of a term to have a two-thirds/one-\nthird split. In fact, I was told that in the really old days, the \nmajority got 100 percent of the allocation of committee funds, and it \nwas only to give the minority some ability to hire staff that it went \nfrom 100 percent to two-thirds/one-third. That has been the precedent \never since when there has been a clear majority at the beginning of a \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\n  I think it is also a fact when the change was made, it was then said \nthere would be a hold-harmless from the change in staff allocations so \nthat we actually added budget to allow all the staff to stay on from \nboth parties. So I think now that we are at the beginning of a \nCongress, you can argue we have to have certain levels of funding on \nthe majority side for the administrative functions of a committee. You \nhave to put out the notices, you have to pay for certain witnesses to \ncome to your committee, you have to do the printing of the bills and \nthe printing of the statements. There are administrative costs.\n  So I think the majority has to have some lead to be able to function \nas a committee. I think that also is the precedent for the Senate. I do \nthink we will be talking about this to determine what is fair. But even \nif you said there is a disagreement between two-thirds/one-third and \n50/50, and maybe you go to 60/40, or maybe you don't, nevertheless, \nthere is nothing that would not allow us in the next 30 minutes to have \na unanimous consent resolution that would say the committees will be \nformed, the appointments will be made, they will be able to function, \nand we will fund them at a certain level until we have a final \nagreement.\n  The key is the people of America deserve the business of our country \nto go forward. We can offer them the excuse that we cannot decide \nbetween two-thirds/one-third and 50-50 and, therefore, we are holding \neverything up, but I do not think that excuse holds water.\n\n  I believe we ought to move forward. Let our committees convene. Let's \nwork this out. This is a body of 100 intelligent people. We can work it \nout if we agree that we are going to all sit down and negotiate in good \nfaith, but I do not think we ought to hold up the business of the \npeople of this country for another week or a week after that. We were \nsworn in on January 7. We have been unable to have a committee hearing \nto confirm the Secretary of Homeland Defense so he can start the \nplanning for his agency to protect this country.\n  We had to cancel a hearing for the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard to speak to the Budget Committee because we cannot form our \ncommittees. That is not what the people of our country expect, it is \nnot what they deserve, and I do hope we can, in a very short order--\ntonight or early in the morning--have the cooperation of the Democrats \nto go forward and do the business of the country.\n  Let our committees be appointed. Let our work begin. Let's have a \nhearing this week for the Secretary of Homeland Defense. Let's have the \nFederal Reserve Board Chairman come to the Senate and talk about the \nstate of our economy. We need to hear from him. The least we can do is \nform our committees and allow the business to go forward. We can talk \nabout 60-40 or 67-33 or 50-50 for the next month and not hold up the \nbusiness of the people of our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with us to do that. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I simply say in response to my friend from \nTexas that the hearing could have gone forward. There is no reason for \nthe hearing not to go forward. Senator Lieberman, or someone else, \nwould have conducted the hearing. No one I know opposes the proposed \nnominee for this new Cabinet office. It would have been a very quick \nhearing. It is not as if a hearing could not have gone forward. The \nmajority chose not to go forward with the hearing. That is a choice \nthey made, not a choice we made.\n  I further say to the Senator from Texas, or those within the sound of \nmy voice, once you turn over the chairmanship of these committees and \nhave the committee people assigned to the committees, we simply lose \nany authority we had. Fairness dictates that if the Senate was divided \nlast time 51-49 with the Democrats in the majority and it is divided \n51-49 with the Republicans in the majority, the committee structure \nshould be the same. That is what we are saying it should be, and we are \ngoing to hang tight until it is that way. That is the way we think it \nshould be.\n  Other Congresses have joined together and worked out their \ndifferences. We have to do that. The only way we will do that is if we \nagree on 51-49 having the same value it did a few months ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, \nexcept for the extraordinary circumstance in which the Senate found \nitself--50-50--for the first time since the 1880s, the issue of \ncommittee funding was not dealt with by the full Senate. The only issue \nthat was dealt with by the full Senate was the appointment of the \ncommittees. For 1 week now, the Senate has been in the majority of the \nRepublicans, and yet there is not a single Republican committee \nchairman. New Members of the Senate, such as the occupant of the Chair, \ndo not yet have committee assignments. He has been a Senator, I say to \nthe Senator from Minnesota, for almost a week now, and he is not yet on \na committee.\n  What the Senator from Texas has been saying--wholly aside from this \ndebate over what the committee funding should be, which is typically \nnot dealt with by the full Senate anyway--there is no rational basis, \nno equitable basis for not ratifying the results of the election last \nNovember by letting the new Members of the Senate and, for that matter, \nthe old Members of the Senate who are going to new committees, have \nthose committees ratified and the chairmen and ranking members \nselected. That is what I believe the Senator from Texas was saying.\n  I do not have the exact facts in front of me, but I understand this \nis the latest, certainly in recent Congresses, after the beginning of a \nCongress that we have, in effect, ratified the results of the election.\n  Last Tuesday, the Senator from Minnesota was sworn in. It has been \nalmost a week; he is not on a committee yet. We do not have any \ncommittee chairmen. It is not enough to suggest that the minority ought \nto hold the hearings about which the Senator from Texas was talking. \nThe minority does not hold hearings; the majority does. That is the \ntradition of the Senate. That tradition should be honored, and we \nshould not delay passing the committee resolution pending the outcome \nof this ongoing discussion about what the committee funding ratio \nshould be.\n  I think the Senator from Texas makes a compelling and irrefutable \npoint about the need to start doing the people's business. We did not \npass 11 of the 13 appropriations bills last year. They have not been \ndone yet. We cannot have a meeting of the Appropriations Committee to \nget started on trying to pass those 11 bills because we do not have a \nchairman. The committees have not been organized. Let's at least get \nthat job done, as the Senator from Texas points out, and we can \ncontinue--I assume at the rate we are going indefinitely--to discuss \nwhat the appropriate funding ratios should be.\n  We are holding up the people's business. We are not honoring the \nresults of the election Tuesday, November 5. We need to get on with it, \nand tonight or tomorrow would be a good time. I yield the floor, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/13/senate-section/article/S222-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S222-S225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE REORGANIZATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the majority leader is on the floor \nand I will be very brief.\n  A couple of times this afternoon people have talked about the 11 \nappropriations bills that did not pass last year, but the Record should \nbe spread with the fact that the Senate completed its work on the \nappropriations bills. We reported every bill out of committee, but even \nbefore the summer hit the House closed down and would not send us any \nbills. So that is why the appropriations bills were not passed.\n  We did everything we could to try to get those bills passed and the \nRepublicans in the House simply would send us no bills. We asked the \nWhite House, we asked the Republican leadership and they simply would \nnot help us, so we were not to blame for the bills not passing. That \nwas something that was\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\ndone by the Republicans in the House and in the White House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will take a moment and update Members of \nthe status of the committee resolution. I know we have had a discussion \nand some debate of this on the floor, both in the last hour and earlier \ntoday.\n  I will reassure my colleagues that we have been working in good faith \nto try to resolve the outstanding issues which would allow us to go \nforward and do something that is very fundamental to the operation of \nthis body, in fact necessary for us to go forward with the nature of \nthe business. It is what the Senate is all about.\n  We do have 11 new Senators who simply are not on committees, who do \nnot have the opportunity to fully participate in that process as we \nlook at the issues surrounding us, whether it is war, homeland \nsecurity, or the funding of the appropriations bills that were just \nmentioned.\n  I remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that normally this \nso-called committee resolution is adopted in the first day or two of \nthe session with very little fanfare. Again, we are talking about after \nan election, when there is a clear-cut majority based on that election, \nthat we appoint the committees and their chairmen, which is really what \nwe are talking about. That allows us to proceed with the important \nbusiness before the Senate.\n  It was mentioned earlier in the day that the precedent has been set \nto go beyond what we would like to do and that is address committee \nmembership so that we can begin with the hearings and the discussion. \nIt was mentioned that the precedent has been set that we include a \nrange of other issues, such as committee funding and space. I remind my \ncolleagues--and I have had an opportunity to do that with a number of \nthem today but not everybody--that the precedent in Congress after \nCongress, when we begin with a clear-cut majority based on elections, \nis the traditional practice of limiting these resolutions, usually \ncarried out in the first couple of days, of naming committee members.\n\n  Some Members have mentioned the agreements of the 107th Congress as \nthe precedent or the basis where we have to consider all of these other \nissues. Let's not forget that the 107th Congress was a unique Congress, \nunlike the Congresses before, in that in that Congress we had 50-50, \nsomething that neither side had fully addressed or thought about \nbecause it had not occurred in a generation or so of this body.\n  That being the case, and very appropriately, this committee \nresolution did address other issues such as space and the other issues \nthat were mentioned today. But it is not 50-50 beginning this Congress. \nThis is not the 107th Congress; it is the 108th Congress. The American \npeople spoke very clearly in the most recent elections and provided for \na majority--yes, in this case a Republican majority.\n  Again, I hope we can proceed. I think we have made real progress in \nall of our discussions, but now is the time we need to come together \nand get on with the Nation's business. Therefore, I hope we can proceed \nin the traditional manner that when we begin a Congress and there is a \nclear-cut majority based on the elections that we pass the committee \nresolution, establish the committee membership and their chairmanships \nand move towards working on the issues that are important to the \nAmerican people: security of the homeland; we have important \nnominations that have to do with homeland security. Until we get the \ncommittees actually set up and established, Members, such as the Member \noccupying the Chair, do not sit on any committees and cannot fully \nparticipate. They cannot vote because they are not on that committee \nyet. That applies to the appropriations bills as well.\n  We are trying to finish the business from the last Congress, which \nbecause of the indecision and a whole range of issues we were not fully \nable to address in the 107th Congress. Now we are working very hard, in \na bipartisan way, on these so-called appropriations bills or spending \nbills. The American people at this juncture really expect no less of \nus. If it is not confusing now, it is going to get very confusing as to \nwhy we cannot even name the committees and their chairmen.\n  The American people do not want a continuation of an inability of \nthis body to function, to carefully consider the appropriations bills \nand the nominations through the committee structure.\n  I have been keeping an open mind and in truth have really encouraged \nMembers on our side of the aisle to not come out and say we should move \nforward because we are in the majority. I have encouraged them to sit \nback and let the negotiations continue. Over the last 7 days, we have \naddressed this whole range of issues and have felt obligated to extend, \nat least in our discussions, beyond just naming the committee members \nand chairmanships and to talk about space. We talked at length about \nother committees and the way particular committees should be organized \nand the space both within the Capitol and among the committees.\n  We have worked in good faith and we have worked productively on a \nwhole range of issues.\n  Having said that, we need to proceed with the business of the Senate, \nand what I have observed today is that we are unable to adequately \naddress appropriations, the nominations for the Treasury which the \nPresident has addressed and the 31 nominations of the judiciary, with \nvacancies around the country, which we really cannot address until we \ndo something very simple, and that is appoint who is on the committees, \nwhich we have already decided, by the way. The American people should \nknow we have already decided who is going to be on these committees and \nwho the chairmen are.\n  Having said this, I need to put everyone on notice that if an \nagreement is not reached shortly--and we will be working through this \nevening as we have throughout the course of today--if we do not reach \nan agreement shortly--and by that I mean very soon, very soon--I will \nbe moving forward with the committee resolution. The resolution is \nsimple: That is, who is on the committees, which has already been \ndecided, who those chairmen are.\n  This may or may not delay the consideration of the appropriations \npackage of fiscal year 2003. My goal had been that we do what is \nnormally done in the Congress in the first several days: Appoint \ncommittee chairmen and systematically address the appropriations bills \nleft over from last year. Now we are 1 day into this week and we have \nnot made progress sufficiently in negotiations to be able to appoint \nthose committees. I am beginning to think we are not going to be able \nto complete those appropriations bills this week--again, business left \nover from the last Congress.\n  In any event, the Senate will not adjourn for a recess next week \nunless and until the Senate completes these two items. The very basic \none, appointing who is on committees, that has already been decided. \nAgain, we need to come to that very quickly. The other item is the \nappropriations. Great progress has been made. But until we have the \ncommittee structure in place, we have a chairman at that juncture and \nwe have 11 Senators, who have been duly elected, able to participate in \nthat process, as I have said previously, we will remain in session to \nget our work done. What we will do if we do not make adequate progress \nis return next week, on Tuesday, after the holiday and remain in \nsession each day and evening until we can complete both of these must-\ndo items.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished Republican \nleader, the majority leader's explanation to the Senate as to the \ncurrent circumstances involving the organizing resolution. I have been \nthrough a number of these resolutions over the time that I have had the \ngood fortune to be leader. I share his view that oftentimes these \nmatters do not require a great deal of attention. I wish this would not \nrequire the time that it has. I am very hopeful we can resolve these \nmatters. He and I have talked. Our staffs have talked. He has consulted \nwith his chairs. I have consulted with 9 Democrat ranking members, \ncurrently the chairs, because they are the chairs until a new \nresolution has been incorporated. I have said on several occasions, to \nhim personally as well as to my colleagues, that I will do all I can\n\n[[Page S224]]\n\nto see if we can find a way to resolve the matter.\n  Let me respond to a couple of things on which the distinguished \nmajority leader commented. First of all, while there have been \noccasions when a two-thirds/one-third funding breakdown has been the \norder of the organizing resolution, in the last Congress, in the 107th \nCongress, there were 51 Democrats and 49 Republicans. As he noted, it \nstarted at a point where there were 50 and 50. As we negotiated the \nresolution under a 50-50 Senate, we attempted to address what happens \nwhen you have membership in committees that is equal. We came to the \nconclusion that there is a significant budgetary, a significant \npractical space consideration to be given when you have membership on \ncommittees that close. There are times when, obviously, the disparity \nbetween the two parties and membership would reflect a need that also \nis commensurate budgetarily and in space, but with a 51-49 or a 50-50 \nSenate, clearly the budgetary, the staffing, the space questions become \nmore relevant. That was really what our discussions were when we moved \nfrom 50-50 to 51-49 last spring. In fact, I would say as I negotiated \nwith, I believe, five senior members of the Republican caucus, the \nissue of funding and the issue of space were not even at question. At \nthat point, it was more a question of a blue slip and a number of other \nwhat I call extraneous matters that we attempted to resolve: How do we \ndeal with judgeships? How do we deal with the question of a blue slip; \nthat is, a Senator's prerogative to sign off on a nominee before it \ncomes before the committee. That was the subject of discussion--not the \nfunding, not the space.\n  So it was after several weeks of negotiation--and I emphasize weeks, \nnot days--that we had to move back the time that officially we became \nthe majority on committees by about 6 weeks. During that time, \nobviously, I would have preferred to have moved much more quickly, but \nwe were unable to do that--again, not because of space and not because \nof budget but because of the question of blue slips.\n  When we did pass the resolution with a 51-49 breakdown in the Senate, \nwe passed it with a recognition that those budgets and that space and \nthose questions pertaining to membership on committees were as relevant \nwith 51 Senators as they were when we had 50 Senators.\n  So the Senate established a precedent that was practical, that was in \nkeeping with the functional responsibilities of the two parties and \neach committee. Again, I would emphasize, it passed unanimously, 51 to \n49, virtually equal budgets, with an administrative bonus for the \nchairman to be allocated as that particular chair and ranking member \nsaw fit. We lived under that resolution. It worked.\n\n  Now we have the reverse, the mirror image of that, 51-49, the same \nbreakdown we had just a month ago. Yet some of our Republican \ncolleagues are saying they want a budget that is dramatically \ndifferent, a huge disparity, once again, between the Republican funding \nand the Democratic funding. If it was good for both parties in the last \nCongress with 51-49, we are simply saying it is good for this Congress. \nWe are prepared to go to work tomorrow. We are prepared to move this \nlegislation, and I want very much to work with my Republican colleagues \nand the majority leader to take up these priority matters. In fact, I \nsaid last week to the President, we do not need a new organizing \nresolution to do the work of the Senate. Sure, it would accommodate the \nnew Senators, and we would like very much to get that done. But the \nSenators heard what I heard from the President just last week at our \nmeeting. The President said it is urgent we move these nominations. It \nis urgent we take up some of these priorities. I indicated at that time \nwe would be more than happy to move these nominations.\n  The Snow papers just arrived today, so it is not the fault of the \nCongress that we have not been able to hold hearings or confirm the \nSnow nomination. But with regard to all nominations, the Ridge \nnomination was supposed to be the subject of hearings tomorrow. I \nunderstand that was canceled. I am disappointed, in spite of the \nurgency expressed by the administration; their unwillingness to move \nahead with the hearings sends a conflicting message with regard to just \nhow urgent it is. We are prepared with whatever circumstances to deal \nwith the nomination and to deal with these issues.\n  It is hard for me to understand the logic or the rationale for \nreversing what was done unanimously not once but twice in the 107th \nCongress, which was done in a way that reflected the balance in \ncommittees, reflected the functional and practical needs of the \ncommittees. That is all we are asking now. If it was good enough for a \n51-49 Senate a month ago, it ought to be good enough for a 51-49 Senate \ntoday.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my good friend, the \nDemocratic leader, I was one of those five Republican Members who were \nappointed by Senator Lott to discuss with you how we would go forward \nin the wake of Senator Jeffords' decision to leave us and to come over \nto your side. Your recollection is entirely correct. The reason for the \ndelay was a discussion of how to handle the judges and the whole blue \nslip policy.\n  But on the issue of staffing, my recollection is the reason we had \nalmost no discussion of that is that we didn't want to, in the middle \nof a Congress, disrupt the lives of a number of staff members on both \nsides who had signed on for 2 years. I think we all believed this was \nsuch an extraordinary circumstance, we didn't want to be sending out \npink slips a mere 5 or 6 months into a new Congress since a lot of \npeople had been hired for the Congress and were depending on this for a \nlivelihood.\n  So my recollection of the reason we spent little or no time talking \nabout changing the staffing was the compassionate decision, bipartisan \ncompassionate decision, not to disrupt the lives of a great many \nmembers. I had no recollection that we discussed this to be sort of a \npermanent notion about how we would handle a 51-49 Senate at the \nbeginning of a Congress. I have no recollection of that.\n  I just thought I would add my own thoughts to the Democratic \nleader's, having been a part of that discussion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just respond quickly, and I \ndon't want to belabor this, but I would say actually that was my \nbelief, too--that we wanted to hold our Republican colleagues harmless, \nif you will, if that is the right phrase; in other words, to \naccommodate their staff.\n  But I think that the logic, again, ought to be extended. If that was \nthe case, that we wanted to show some compassion for staff, we wanted \nto send a clear message about our intent to work in a meaningful and a \nbipartisan way, it would seem to me under a 51-49 Senate last time we \nmade the decisions that the Senator from Kentucky has noted; we did so \nwith an understanding about the disruption it would cause.\n  That isn't my first concern in this case, but it is a concern. I \nwould think those staff would have every bit as much of an expectation \nnow that they had a year ago--I guess it would be 2 years ago, in May--\nthat certainly some continuity, some degree of certainty under these \ncircumstances could be expected, given what we did before.\n  So I appreciate very much the Senator commenting. We will have more \nto say about it as time goes on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am ready to close. Let me yield 3 minutes \nto my colleague from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would just like to ask a question. \nWe are sitting here talking about percentages and funding of \ncommittees. Why can't we just agree to set up the committees, appoint \nthe chairmen, let them function, and decide on the percentages later? \nThe people of America deserve for us to do their business. We have been \norganized for a week, but we don't have committees functioning and we \ndon't have chairmen. The idea that we would sit here and hold the \nentire Senate, all the employees here, when we cannot have committee \nmeetings and begin to do the work, just doesn't pass the smell test. I \nmean it is just ridiculous.\n  So I would ask the distinguished leaders on the Democratic side if \nthey would allow us to draw up a resolution tonight--we could do it in \n30 minutes--\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\norganize the committees, let us appoint the chairmen, and we can talk \nabout the funding later. We can agree that we will go forward. Since \nthe appropriations bills have not been passed and the legislative \nbranch is operating on the 2002 budget, let's go forward and organize, \nand we can deal with the money later. That is what I ask.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I just want to close and say that we have \nworked together, both sides of the aisle, aggressively over the last \nweek. I do believe it is time for us to, as much as possible, bring \nthis to a close, at least in terms of getting our committees set up and \nrunning.\n  I am ready to close unless my colleague has anything to add.\n  Mr. REID. I would just briefly say to the leader--I appreciate his \ncourtesy in allowing me to speak--we waited 6 weeks last time. I was \npart of the wait. I understand how long it took. It may have been over \nblue slips or something else, but still the organizational resolution \nwas held up for 6 weeks. I hope that isn't the case this time. I hope \nwe can work it out more quickly. There has been a lot of debate on both \nsides. It has clearly been spread on the record of the Senate what the \nrespective positions of both sides are.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in closing, we have a lot of work to do. We \ngot off to a good start last week with the unemployment insurance. We \nare making progress in terms of negotiations. But--and I mentioned this \na few moments ago--the two issues that we have to address, as we look \nforward to this potential recess 8 or 9 days from now, are: The basic \norganization of the Senate, simply getting the committee assignments \nmade; second, appropriations: And if we do not complete them, we will \nbe back during the week, after the holiday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/13/senate-section/article/S225-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 25, \n2001 in Dumfries, VA. Two Afghan-American teenagers were beaten by a \ngroup of attackers. Police said that April Scruggs, 42, and her son, \nJarvis Berkley Wilhoit, 19, had been taunting the victims for more than \na month prior to the beating.

Mr. President, on January 7, I reintroduced the ``Contract \nwith Investors,'' which proposes a number of changes to the tax code to \nspur investment and encourage economic growth and job creation.\n  Investment, especially by individuals, is the lifeblood of the U.S. \neconomic system. They key to fostering robust economic growth, rather \nthan the anemic growth we are seeing right now, is to eliminate the \ndisincentives, the high tax rates, that discourage individuals from \ninvesting. Once individual investors return to the stock markets, or \nare encouraged to start up, or invest in existing, small businesses, we \nwill get the growth that creates new, good jobs.\n  The first element of my proposal repeals from the 2001 tax-relief law \nthe sunset provision that was required by arcane Senate budget rules. \nThe prospect of taxes reverting back to their 2001 levels in 2011 sends \na signal to businesses and investors that tax increases are in their \nfuture, and this dampens investment. Furthermore, a dramatic tax \nincrease in 2011 will devastate our economy.\n  Next, I propose to accelerate the remaining marginal rate reductions \nfrom the 2001 law, moving the 2004 rate reductions to this year and the \n2006 reductions to 2004. Lowering these rates benefits all taxpayers, \nand is the key to encouraging individuals to invest and take the \neconomic risks that will create jobs. In our progressive income tax \nsystem, the marginal rate is the rate at which a person's last dollar \nof income is taxed. This means that a person who works harder and \nlonger and earns more has those additional earnings taxed at the \nhighest rate for which he or she qualifies. Reducing marginal rates \nencourages taxpayers to work harder and longer because they will not be \ntaxed as much on that extra income. On the same principle, it makes \nsense to accelerate the planned tax-rate reductions. Phased-in \nreductions give taxpayers an incentive to put off income-producing \nactivity into the future, when rates are scheduled to be lower. \nAccelerating the reductions gives taxpayers the incentive to engage in \nthat income-producing activity immediately.\n  This also gives quicker relief to small businesses, which are \ntypically taxed not at corporate, but at individual rates. Small \nbusinesses account for most new jobs and half of the output of our \neconomy. Currently, the maximum income tax rate for C corporations is \n35 percent; once the individual rate cuts are fully implemented, the \ntop tax rate for individuals will also be 35 percent, instead of the \ncurrent 38.6 percent. This will eliminate a penalty unfairly imposed on \nsmall businesses and enable them to expand and employ more workers.\n  The next element of my plan accelerates to 2005 repeal of the death \ntax, the estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes. The death tax \nis unfair and counterproductive and it must be permanently eliminated. \nA 1998 study by the Joint Economic Committee concluded that the \nexistence of the death tax during the last century has reduced the \namount of investors' capital in the economy by nearly half a trillion \ndollars. The same study estimates that, by repealing the death tax and \nputting those resources to better use, as many as 240,000 jobs could \nhave been created over seven years and Americans would have had an \nadditional $24.4 billion in disposable personal income.\n\n  In 2001 testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Dr. Wilbur \nSteger, the president of Consad Research Corporation and a professor at \nCarnegie Mellon University, testified that immediate repeal of the \ndeath tax would provide a $40 billion automatic stimulus to the \neconomy, based on estimates of the amount of net unrealized capital \ngains that would be ``unlocked.'' Many Americans choose to hold on to \ntheir assets until death in order to obtain for their heirs a ``step-\nup'' in basis. Getting rid of the death tax will encourage Americans to \nsell assets before death, hence my term ``unlocking.'' Repeal also \nremoves the strongest disincentive to business investment and expansion \nthat faces older business owners. After all, why would people in their \ngolden years expand their businesses, when the federal government is \npoised to confiscate a large share upon their death?\n  Under current law, the death tax will go down to zero in 2010 but \nreappear thereafter, at exorbitant 2001 levels, thus adding significant \ncomplexity to future death tax planning, increasing costs that are a \ndrag on economic activity, and retreating from a principled rejection \nof this unfair tax. This is unacceptable. Until the death tax is gone, \nfamily business, farms and ranches must still pay for expensive life \ninsurance policies, death tax planners, and tax attorneys. These \nexpenses, wasted resources that could be put to much more productive \nuse, total more than $12 billion a year, according to Consad Research \nCorporation. My bill would, as I said, permanently repeal the death tax \nin 2005, thus allowing all Americans two years to plan for a future in \nwhich the federal government no longer taxes the death of its citizens.\n  The Contract with Investors also addresses capital gains. It provides \nfor maximum taxation of individual capital gains at a rate of 10 \npercent, which is half the current rate. Ideally, this\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\ntax should go the way of the death tax. The capital gains tax is a form \nof double taxation that penalizes risk-taking and entrepreneurship. \nShort of eliminating this tax, a solution endorsed by many economists, \nincluding Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Congress must enact \na substantial and permanent reduction in the capital gains tax rate to \nstimulate new investment and more productive use of resources for both \nthe short-term health of our economy.\n  According to a recent study by the American Council for Capital \nFormation, American taxpayers face capital gains tax rates that are 35 \npercent higher than those paid by average investors in other countries. \nFurthermore, the United States is one of a small number of countries \nthat requires a holding period for an investment to qualify for \npreferential capital gains treatment. Reducing the capital gains rate \nwill promote the type of productive business investment that fosters \ngrowth and creates high-paying jobs. Lowering rates will aid \nentrepreneurs in their effort to make advances in products, \ntechnologies, and services that people want and need.\n  The fifth component of the Contract with Investors modernizes the \ncapital loss limitation of the tax code by increasing the amount of \ncapital loss an individual may deduct against ordinary income from the \ncurrent $3,000 to $10,000, and by indexing this amount for inflation. \nThe capital loss limitation was set arbitrarily more than 25 years ago, \nand would have grown to $10,000 if it had been indexed for inflation \nwhen enacted. Modernizing this provision will allow investors to move \nout of unproductive assets or unfavorable investments, and use the \nprofits to reinvest, save, or spend, as they choose.\n  My bill also encourages savings. It accelerates the increase in \namounts that may be contributed to certain tax-qualified retirement \nsavings plans, and raises the age at which mandatory distributions must \nbegin. Increasing the annual, maximum individual retirement account, \nIRA, contribution to $5,000 and the annual, maximum 401(k) plan \ncontribution to $15,000 will enable American workers to save more for \nthe future by investing in businesses. Increasing from 70.5 to 75 the \nage at which seniors must begin making annual withdrawals from this \ntax-deferred retirement accounts will allow seniors who are approaching \nthis arbitrary age to choose whether to maintain their investments, \nrather than being forced to divest.\n  Finally, the Contract with Investors eliminates the double taxation \nof dividends by excluding from gross income 100 percent of dividends \nreceived by individuals. Currently, corporations pay income taxes on \ntheir profits. Their investors are forced to pay income tax at the \nhighest marginal rate applicable on amounts that corporations \ndistribute to them in the form of dividends. The National Center for \nPolicy Analysis has calculated that the combined tax rate on corporate \nprofits is approximately 60 percent.\n  My bill will eliminate the tax imposed on individuals receiving \ndividends from domestic C corporations, which will produce higher \nreturns on dividend-yielding equity investments. It will also remove \nthe disincentive for corporations to pay dividends and put equity \nfinancing on the same tax-footing as debt financing. Eliminating the \ntax bias against equity will improve corporate governance at a time \nwhen the public is demanding better practices at American firms. It \nwill reassure investors who may be concerned about companies taking on \ntoo much debt or making unwise or unnecessary investments with excess \ncash. Eliminating the double taxation of dividends will, like the other \nelements of my plan, encourage investment and foster economic \nexpansion.\n  Finally, I have included five provisions under ``Sense of the \nSenate'' language. I believe that the Senate must act on these issues \nand I stand ready and willing to assist my colleagues in solving these \nproblems.\n  First, Congress should pass legislation to safeguard American \nworkers' pension and retirement accounts. Last Congress, the Finance \nCommittee unanimously passed out of committee such a bill. The Senate \nand the House of Representatives should act quickly to pass similar \nlegislation as soon as possible.\n  Second, Congress should modernize this country's international tax \nprovisions to permit U.S. companies to better compete internationally. \nOur tax code places U.S. companies and the investors who own them at a \ndistinct competitive disadvantage. Congress must modernize these \nprovisions and move towards ending the current practice of taxing \nprofits earned outside the boundaries of the United States.\n  Third, Congress must take the trouble to purge redundant, outdated, \nand unscientific regulatory burdens on investors and U.S. companies. \nCongress is quick to pass onerous new laws but slow to repeal them. \nThis is an abdication of our responsibility as legislators. Before \nplacing new burdens on investors and businesses, Congress should be \nrequired to perform a cost-benefit analysis and institute performance \ncriteria to evaluate these new burdens on U.S. businesses and \ninvestors.\n  Fourth, Congress should enact meaningful tort reform as soon as \npossible.\n  Finally, Congress should enact meaning tax reform that simplifies the \nInternal Revenue Code and reduces the depreciation recovery periods \nthat businesses are forced to use to recover the cost of capital \ninvestments.\n  Now is the time for bold action. A ``Contract with Investors'' is \nlong overdue. I have laid out my principles. I look forward to future \nhearings and discussions with my colleagues. It's time to get working.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/13/senate-section/article/S226-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        RETIREMENT OF GUY COATES\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, \nSenator Breaux, and the entire State of Louisiana to pay tribute to a \nreal Louisiana legend, Guy Coates.\n  For the better part of 40 years, Guy Coates has reported on all \naspects of Louisiana politics and State news. Guy Coates started his \njournalistic career as a reporter for KNOE-TV in Monroe and KSLA-TV in \nShreveport. He joined the AP in 1968 in the New Orleans Bureau and \nmoved to Baton Rouge in 1973. Guy became the bureau chief in Baton \nRouge in 1991. He is currently the dean of Baton Rouge Press Corps.\n  Mr. Coates has a long and distinguished career as one of Louisiana's \nfinest reporters. Guy covered his first governor, Jimmie Davis, in 1962 \nat a ground-breaking for Toledo Bend Lake. He covered his first \nlegislative session in 1965 when John McKeithen was governor. For the \nAP, Coates has been involved in coverage of the New Orleans sniper; the \n1973 constitutional convention; the Luling ferry disaster; various \nracial demonstrations; the big '73 flood; every statewide political \ncampaign and election since 1968; GOP and Democratic National \nConventions; Apollo 14; the Louisiana visit of Poe John Paul II; \nexecutions at Angola; the Oakdale prison riots; and he was the only \nreporter invited to the marriage of Edwin Edwards and Candy Picou. Guy \nserved as a witness to history for all of us when he was the only AP \nreporter on the Gulf Coast during the landfall of Hurricane Camille in \n1969.\n  Guy was perhaps best known for his alter ego, Jethro. As one reporter \nand colleague of Guy put it, Guy ``was unique among AP writers for his \npolitical column, which included the homespun, irreverent observation \nof his fictional friend, Jethro.'' In Guy's final column, today, he \nwrites, ``So, it's time to join my old column soul mate, Jethro \nRotheschild, who retired to our make believe world in the garage a few \nyears ago.'' The entire State of Louisiana is going to miss the \npoignant insights into the political arena that made his opinion \ninvaluable in any Louisiana political discourse.\n  I know that my colleague, Senator Breaux joins me in wishing Guy and \nhis wife Jonica McDaniel many happy years together in whatever \nendeavors they choose to pursue. Louisiana is losing one of our finest \nreporters, and we are better off having had him report on our State, \nNation and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/13/senate-section/article/S226-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S226-S227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING DON COOK\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am saddened to report the \npassing of one of South Dakota's most exceptional public leaders, Don \nCook.\n  Don Cook was a widely respected representative, political strategist, \nand long time leader in the South Dakota\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nDemocratic Party. He was greatly admired by his peers for his \ndedication to his community and local concerns. A principle figure in \nthe State party, Don served as State Central Committeeman and Vice \nChairman, as well as a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions \nin 1992 and 2000. His tremendous contributions to the community and \npublic leadership set him apart from other outstanding South Dakotans.\n  Born in 1920, Don joined the U.S. Army in 1942 and served with \nGeneral George Patton's Army in Europe where he was awarded the Bronze \nStar and five Battle Stars. A native of Missouri, Don moved to South \nDakota 40 years ago, where he and his wife Maxie ran a very successful \nfeed and seed business in Huron. They had two children, a daughter \nConnie and son Sid, who recently preceeded his father in death. An \nactive member of the community, Don was a participating member of the \nFirst Presbyterian Church, the Huron Country Club, Yel Daz Shrine, \nAmerican Legion, VFW, and the Huron Chamber of Commerce.\n  Like fellow Missouri native, President Harry Truman, Don was \ndescribed as a regular guy who did not mince words. He was a staunch \nand determined political fighter, who unselfishly lent his support to \nmany local politicians. A man of action and passion, Don made things \nhappen and those around him proud to know him. His influence on South \nDakota's political development is extraordinary, and extends here to \nour Nation's capital. He was a friend and supporter of both Senator \nDaschle and myself, both as State legislators and as representatives in \nWashington, D.C.\n  Through his outstanding community involvement and political activism \nthe lives of countless South Dakotans were enormously enhanced. His \nwork continues to inspire all those who knew him. I am proud to have \nbeen a friend of Don Cook. Our Nation and South Dakota are far better \nplaces because of his life, and while we miss him very much, the best \nway to honor his life is to emulate his commitment to public service \nand to his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/13/senate-section/article/S227-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF EDWARD PIOTROWSKI\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, over the weekend one of my \nconstituents, Edward J. Piotrowski, passed away. This eulogy was \nwritten by his son, Steve, a long time and greatly valued member of my \nState staff. Steve's words speak for themselves, but I would just add \nthat Steve and his father are not at all average, but extraordinary \ncitizens and contributors to the State of Wisconsin and the Nation.\n  The eulogy follows:\n\n\n                          An Average American\n\n       An average American died today. His death did not make the \n     evening news. Only his friends and family noticed his death. \n     His death was unremarkable as was his life. Yet, his passing \n     lessens us all a little bit.\n       He was the son of Polish immigrants. He grew up on a farm \n     in Central Wisconsin. He attended a school that was taught in \n     Polish, and he only had an eight-grade education. Yet, he was \n     a smart man, and he was a kind and gentle man. He cared about \n     other people and knew that part of his obligation in life was \n     to help make his community a better place. He cared deeply \n     about his family, his community, his church and his country. \n     He never aspired to greatness, he only wanted to work hard \n     and make life better for his family and community.\n       His was a simple life. He worked hard from the time he was \n     young as one of thirteen children helping his family on the \n     farm. He came of age during WWII, and in spite of the fact \n     that he had and could have maintained a farm deferment, he \n     volunteered to serve his country during the War. He was \n     initially trained as an infantryman, but was then transferred \n     to the Army Air Corps where he became a nose gunner on a B-\n     24. He was scheduled to ship to the European theater of \n     operations when one of his crewmembers was killed in a \n     training accident. The Army broke up the crew and reassigned \n     and retrained them. He was on his way to the Pacific when the \n     war ended. I believe that he always regretted that he never \n     got the opportunity to test his courage in combat but was \n     also grateful that he along with his brothers made it home \n     alive and well.\n       Shortly after the war, he met my mother and they married \n     and began the process of raising their family. Eventually \n     they had six children, and suffered through the loss of their \n     first daughter at the age of two. He drove a semi-truck for \n     nearly 20 years after the war. It was a good way to earn a \n     living, but caused him to have to spend a great deal of time \n     away from his home and family. He eventually decided to run \n     his own business, a small service station in his small \n     hometown. He loved to build and fix things, and this \n     business, while trying at times, allowed him many \n     opportunities to do that. After a while the changes in the \n     service station business convinced him to look for work that \n     better suited his skills and abilities.\n       He found a job as a carpenter; his life-long hobby was now \n     also his occupation. He had a talent and dedication for wood \n     working that was amazing. His ability to turn raw lumber into \n     beautiful furniture and useful items was inspiring. He loved \n     to spend his time in his workshop building furniture for his \n     family and friends. He usually made his furniture only for \n     friends and family, and he never charged anywhere near what \n     his skills and labor could have demanded. He just wanted to \n     create useful and beautiful things for others to enjoy. He \n     donated his creations to his church and the community for \n     their use and as items in various fundraisers.\n       He was not a man that showed his emotions easily. Like most \n     men of his generation, he was taught to be stoic and composed \n     in all situations. Yet, he showed his love for his family in \n     so many ways every day. When his boys were young, go-carts \n     were all the craze. He found an old Nash Rambler and using \n     parts from the body and frame of the car, his own ingenuity, \n     and his skills with wood working and welding, he built the \n     boys a go-cart with a hood and seat and working lights. It \n     was a rather funny looking little vehicle, but it gave the \n     boys hours and hours of pleasure racing around the farm \n     fields and yards.\n       When we moved off the farm and into town, there wasn't a \n     place for us to play baseball. The only ballpark in town was \n     set up for softball, and the river ran right behind the short \n     left field fence causing us to loose many baseballs. He, \n     along with a number of other fathers, talked to a man who \n     owned an unused farm field on the edge of town and got \n     permission for us to build a ball field. Using only their \n     garden roto-tillers and hand tools, he led the fathers and \n     boys in building, seeding and leveling a very useable \n     ballpark for us kids. It was maintained and used for years by \n     the kids in Amherst as a ballpark.\n       He also worked to fulfill the dreams of his daughters. He \n     spent many hours building a dollhouse for his second \n     daughter. It challenged his skills to work in such a small \n     scale. Because she wanted it, he built it for her using left \n     over materials from his home remodeling projects. She has \n     that dollhouse in her home today. His last daughter wanted a \n     playhouse. He built her one that many would have considered a \n     starter home in early days. She still has the miniature \n     cupboards and kitchen cabinets from that treasured play area.\n       For many years he was a member of the volunteer fire \n     department. He regularly volunteered to help out with \n     community improvement projects bringing his skills and work \n     dedication to help make his hometown a better place. He \n     always was willing to help his church, friends and family. He \n     was a member of the local American Legion for many, many \n     years. He always marched in the Memorial Day parade, and was \n     especially proud when he was selected to be the flag bearer \n     for the parade. Last year, in spite of the cancer that was \n     slowly destroying him, he again was in the parade. He did \n     make the concession to ride in the pick-up truck rather than \n     march because of his loss of strength. He epitomized the \n     dedication of a citizen that is necessary to make a city a \n     true community.\n       Our father was never recognized as a celebrity. In fact, if \n     you met him on the street, he would have appeared to be just \n     an average American. In all so many ways he was just an \n     average American, but he was the type of everyday American we \n     need. He worked hard. He cared about his family and \n     community. He gave of himself to help others and to make his \n     small part of the world better. Most of all he set an example \n     for his children, an example of what it takes to be a good \n     person and to succeed in life by taking care of those things \n     that really matter. As we got older we tried to let him know \n     how well he had done in raising us and how much he meant to \n     us. I don't think I could ever truly express to him how much \n     he taught me by his example and his everyday kindness.\n       Edward J. Piotrowski, known to your family as Pops from the \n     time we boys felt too old to call you daddy, you will be \n     deeply missed.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to establish \na program to provide assistance through States to eligible weed \nmanagement entities to control or eradicate harmful, nonnative weeds on \npublic and private land; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to address an issue of \nenormous economic magnitude, but one that many are only vaguely \nfamiliar with. This issue is extremely important to those of us in the \nWest and around the country because it affects countless farmers, \nranchers, public land managers and private landowners, and it literally \nknows no boundaries.\n  Noxious weeds threaten fully two-thirds of all endangered species and \nare now considered by some experts to be the second most important \nthreat to bio-diversity. In some areas in the West, spotted knapweed \nand thistle grows so dense that big game wildlife are forced to move \nout of the area to find edible plants. Noxious weeds also increase soil \nerosion, and prevent recreationists from accessing land that is \ninfested with poisonous plants.\n  I believe stopping the spread of noxious weeds requires a two pronged \neffort. First, we must prevent new non-native weed species from \nbecoming established in the United States, and second, we must stop or \nslow the spread of the noxious weeds currently present in our country.\n  I have stood before Congress for a number of years pushing \nlegislation and speaking on the issue of noxious weeds. I know some in \nthe Senate tire of hearing me bring up this issue, but growing up on a \nfarm and ranch in western Idaho, I have experienced the destruction \ncaused when noxious weeds are not treated and are left to overtake \nnative species. Two-thirds of our land in Idaho is owned by the Federal \nGovernment. Our Montana, Washington, and Oregon neighbors all have \ncomparable Federal ownership. State and private land borders much of \nthese Federal lands. I have seen the devastation noxious weeds can have \nwhen unchecked and not effectively treated or managed largely due to \nlack of resources.\n  Because of these problems, during the 106th Congress I introduced and \nworked to pass the Plant Protection Act. That bill primarily dealt with \nthe Animal Plant Health Inspection Service's, APHIS, authority to block \nor regulate the importation or movement of a noxious weed and plant \npest, and it also provides authority for inspection and enforcement of \nthe regulations. Basically the bill focused on stopping the weeds at \nour borders.\n  Last Congress, along with 16 of my colleagues, I introduced S. 198, \nthe ``Noxious Weed Control Act.'' We held two Committee hearings on the \nbill, and it passed the Senate in November. Unfortunately there was not \ntime to reconcile the bill with the other body, so we are introducing \nthe legislation again.\n  To develop the Noxious Weed Control Act, I worked tirelessly with the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association, Public Lands Council, and The \nNature Conservancy. This legislation will provide a mechanism to get \nfunding to the local level where weeds can be fought in a \ncollaborative way. Working together is what this entire initiative is \nall about.\n\n  Specifically, this bill establishes, in the Office of the Secretary \nof the Interior, a program to provide assistance through States to \neligible weed management entities. The Secretary of the Interior would \nappoint an Advisory Committee of ten individuals to make \nrecommendations to the Secretary regarding the annual allocation of \nfunds. The Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Committee, \nwould allocate funds to States to provide funding to eligible weed \nmanagement entities to carry out projects approved by States to control \nor eradicate harmful, non-native weeds on public and private lands. \nFunds would be allocated based on several factors, including but not \nlimited to: the seriousness of the problem in the State; the extent to \nwhich the Federal funds will be used to leverage non-Federal funds to \naddress the problem; and the extent to which the State has already made \nprogress in addressing the problems.\n  The bill directs that the States may use 8 percent of their \nallocation to fund applied research to solve locally significant weed \nmanagement problems and solutions. States may also allocate 25 percent \nof available funding to encourage the formation of weed management \nareas and to carry out projects relating to the control and eradication \nof noxious weeds, and 75 percent for financial awards to eligible weed \nmanagement entities. To be eligible for funding, a weed management \nentity must be established by local stakeholders for weed management or \npublic education purposes, provide the State a description of its \npurpose and proposed projects, and fulfill any other requirements set \nby the State. Projects would be evaluated, giving equal consideration \nto economic and natural values, and selected for funding based on \nfactors such as the seriousness of the problem, the likelihood that the \nproject will address the problem, and the comprehensiveness of the \nproject's approach to the noxious weed problem within the State. A 50 \npercent of non-Federal match is required to receive the funds.\n  The Department of Agriculture in Idaho, ISDA, has developed a \n``Strategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds'' through a collaborative \neffort involving private landowners, State and Federal land managers, \nState and local governmental entities, and other interested parties. \nCooperative Weed Management Areas, CWMAs, are the centerpiece of the \nstrategic plan. CWMAs cross jurisdictional boundaries to bring together \nall landowners, land managers, and interested parties to identify and \nprioritize noxious weed strategies within the CWMA in a collaborative \nmanner. The primary responsibilities of the ISDA are to provide \ncoordination, administrative support, facilitation, and project cost-\nshare funding for this collaborative effort. Idaho already has a record \nof working in a collaborative way on this issue, my legislation will \nbuild on the progress we have had, and establish the same formula for \nsuccess in other States.\n  As I have said before, noxious weeds are a serious problem on both \npublic and private lands across the Nation. Like a ``slow burning \nwildfire,'' noxious weeds take land out of production, force native \nspecies off the land, and interrupt the commerce and activities of all \nthose who rely on the land for their livelihoods, including farmers, \nranchers, recreationists, and others.\n  I believe we must focus our efforts to rid our lands of this \ndevastating invader. Noxious weeds are not only a problem for farmers \nand ranchers, but a hazard to our environment, economy, and communities \nin Idaho, the West, and for the country as a whole. We must reclaim the \nrangeland for natural species. Noxious weeds do not recognize property \nboundaries, so if we want to win this war on weeds, we must integrate \nall stakeholders at the Federal, State, local, and individual levels. \nThe Noxious Weed Control Act is an important step to ensure we are \ndiligent in stopping the spread of these weeds. I am confident that if \nwe work together at all levels of government and throughout our \ncommunities, we can protect our land, livelihood, and environment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 145.

A bill to make permanent the moratorium on taxes on Internet \naccess and multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce \nimposed by the Internet Tax Freedom Act; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Internet Tax \nNondiscrimination Act of 2003, to permanently extend the moratorium on \nInternet access taxes, as well as prevent multiple and discriminatory \ntaxes on the Internet. There are two postulates in life that guide me \ntoday: first, always stand strong for freedom and opportunity for all \npeople; and second, always keep your word and keep your promises.\n  As many in this chamber know, I have made permanently extending the \nmoratorium on new taxes that discriminate against the Internet one of \nmy top priorities since coming to the Senate. Looking back two years \nago, as a rookie, I was pleased to work in the successful effort, with \nSenator McCain and others, to extend the moratorium on new Internet \ntaxes for two years. Of course, I would have preferred to have a \npermanent moratorium and introduced S. 777 to do so back in 2001.\n  I cannot ever envision a time when it will be desirable policy for \nany government to tax access to the Internet. I cannot ever conceive of \nany instance or event that will precipitate justification for multiple \nor discriminatory taxes on the Internet by any government, large or \nsmall, national, State or local.\n  This has been a position I have held from 1997 during my days as \nGovernor or Virginia when I was one of only four Governors with this \nposition. I have promised the first bill I'd introduce in the 108th \nCongress would be a permanent ban on discriminatory taxes and Internet \naccess taxes. I am one who stands on the side of freedom of the \nInternet, trusting free people and entrepreneurs, not on the side of \nmaking this advancement in technology easier to tax for the tax \ncollectors. My legislation will permanently ban taxes on Internet \naccess, as well as taxes on Internet transactions by multiple \njurisdictions, and discriminatory taxes that unfairly target Internet \ntransactions.\n  The current moratorium on Internet tax is set to expire in November \nof this year. I want the members of this body to understand that the \nmoratorium on Internet tax is completely unrelated to issues \nsurrounding sales tax simplification. I was here for the previous \ndebate when legislation extending this moratorium was bogged down and \nheld hostage on the extremely complicated and cumbersome issue of sales \ntax collection.\n  Since that time, I know State tax administrators have been working to \nsimplify their sales tax system. However, I encourage my colleagues in \nthe Senate that when considering the issue of sales tax simplification \nand business activity tax nexus that they do so separately from \nlegislation that deals with the Internet tax moratorium.\n  I understand most of the States are looking for more tax revenue, but \nthe Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act will not, and does not, prohibit \nStates from collecting sales and use tax on electronic commerce. \nRather, this legislation will permanently ban taxes placed on consumers \nto access the Internet, like the Spanish American War Tax on telephone \nservice, and prohibits multiple and discriminatory taxes on Internet \npurchases, which are taxes that would apply more than once on the same \nproduct or taxes that are higher because of the method by which a \nproduct is purchased.\n  The moratorium on Internet access taxes prohibits governments from \nplacing taxes on top of the monthly rates Americans already pay to \nconnect to the Internet. I am concerned that if this Congress were to \nallow new, discriminatory taxes on Internet access it would be allowing \nStates and localities to contribute to the economic ``digital divide.'' \nFor every dollar added to the cost of Internet access, we can expect to \nsee lost utilization of the Internet by thousands of lower income \nAmerican families nationwide.\n  Now, more than ever, with our Nation's economy emerging from a \nrecession and the Congress working with the President on an economic \nstimulus package, the people of this country need security with regard \nto their financial future. Any additional tax burdens on the Internet, \nwill mean additional costs that many Americans cannot afford, forcing \nthe poorest in our society to reduce or even forgo their use of the \nInternet as a tool for education, exploration and individual \nopportunity.\n  The more expensive the government makes Internet access, the less \nlikely people will be to buy advanced services, such as high-speed \nbroadband connections, Internet protocol software, wireless WiFi \ndevices and many other multimedia applications. In a time when \ntechnology and the Internet have grown into every aspect of our daily \nlives and where access to the Internet has become a necessity for \nAmericans, will imposing taxes to access the Internet or levying taxes \nthat discriminate against the Internet as a form of commerce ever be \nfair? The answer is that there will never be a time to tax access to \nthe Internet nor impose discriminatory taxes on Internet commerce.\n  The goal of the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act is simple and \nclear: the Internet should remain as accessible as possible to all \npeople in all parts of our country, forever.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me and cosponsor the Internet Tax \nNondiscrimination Act of 2003, permanently extending the Internet \nmoratorium on access, multiple and discriminatory taxes.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect to \nthe sexual exploitation of children; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a critically \nimportant piece of legislation, the PROTECT Act of 2003. As its name \nmakes clear, this bill will help to protect our children from the \nhorrors of child pornography. Disgusting as child pornography is, the \ngrowth of technology and the rise of the internet have flooded our \nNation with it. This is one area where we cannot afford to simply look \nthe other way. Child pornography is routinely used by perverts and \npedophiles\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\nnot only to whet their sick desires, but also to lure our defenseless \nchildren into unspeakable acts of sexual exploitation. In sum, child \npornography is a root from which more evils grow. It creates a \nmeasurable harm to children in our society. On this record, we must \nact.\n  I am proud to have Senator Leahy as the leading co-sponsor of the \nPROTECT Act. We jointly introduced an earlier version of this bill last \nyear in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free \nSpeech Coalition. That decision greatly weakened the laws pertaining to \nchild pornography and left some gaping holes in our Nation's ability to \neffectively prosecute child pornography offenses. We must now act \nquickly to repair our child pornography laws to provide for effective \nlaw enforcement in a manner that accords with the Court's ruling.\n  The PROTECT Act strikes a necessary balance between the First \nAmendment and our Nation's critically important interest in protecting \nchildren. This Act does many things to aid the prosecution of child \nPROTECT Act, and I highlight some of its most significant provisions \nhere.\n  First, the Act plugs the loophole that exists today where child \npornographers can escape prosecution by claiming that their sexually \nexplicit material did not actually involve real children. Technology \nhas advanced so far that even experts often cannot say with absolute \ncertainty that an image is real or a ``virtual'' computer creation. For \nthis reason, the Act permits a prosecution to proceed when the child \npornography includes persons who appear virtually indistinguishable \nfrom actual minors. And even when this occurs, the accused is afforded \na complete affirmative defense by showing that the child pornography \ndid not involve a minor.\n  Second, the Act prohibits the pandering or solicitation of anything \nrepresented to be obscene child pornography. The Supreme Court has \nruled that this type of conduct does not constitute protected speech. \nCongress, moreover, should severely punish those who would try to \nprofit or satisfy their depraved desires by dealing in such filth.\n  Third, the Act prohibits any depictions of minors, or apparent \nminors, in actual, not simulated, acts of bestiality, sadistic or \nmasochistic abuse, or sexual intercourse, when such depictions lack \nliterary, artistic, political or scientific value. This type of \nhardcore sexually explicit material merits our highest form of disdain \nand disgust and is something that our society ought to try hard to \neradicate. Nor does the First Amendment bar us from banning the \ndepictions of children actually engaging in the most explicit and \ndisturbing forms of sexual activity.\n  Fourth, the Act beefs up existing record keeping requirements for \nthose who chose to produce sexually explicit materials. These record \nkeeping requirements are unobjectionable since they do not ban \nanything. Rather, the Act simply requires such producers to keep \nrecords confirming that no actual minors were involved in the making of \nthe sexually explicit materials. In light of the difficulty experts \nface in determining an actor's true age and identity just by viewing \nthe material itself, increasing the criminal penalties for failing to \nmaintain these records are vital to ensuring that only adults appear in \nsuch productions.\n  Finally, the Act creates a new civil action for those aggrieved by \nthe depraved acts of those who violate our child pornography laws. This \nis one area of the law where society as a whole can benefit from more \nvigorous enforcement, both on the criminal and civil fronts.\n  I was disappointed that the PROTECT Act did not pass into law last \nyear, although it unanimously cleared the Senate in the final days of \nthe 107th Congress. As incoming Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \npassing this important bill will be one of my very top priorities. I \nremain open to hearing suggestions from all interested parties on how \nto improve the bill or make it even tougher against child \npornographers. I strongly urge my colleagues to work with me and join \nwith me in promptly passing this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 151\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prosecutorial Remedies and \n     Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of \n     2003'' or ``PROTECT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Obscenity and child pornography are not entitled to \n     protection under the First Amendment under Miller v. \n     California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (obscenity), or New York v. \n     Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (child pornography) and thus may \n     be prohibited.\n       (2) The Government has a compelling state interest in \n     protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, \n     including both child molesters and child pornographers. ``The \n     prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children \n     constitutes a government objective of surpassing \n     importance,'' New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982) \n     (emphasis added), and this interest extends to stamping out \n     the vice of child pornography at all levels in the \n     distribution chain. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110 \n     (1990).\n       (3) The Government thus has a compelling interest in \n     ensuring that the criminal prohibitions against child \n     pornography remain enforceable and effective. ``[T]he most \n     expeditious if not the only practical method of law \n     enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by \n     imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling, \n     advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.'' Ferber, \n     458 U.S. at 760.\n       (4) In 1982, when the Supreme Court decided Ferber, the \n     technology did not exist to: (A) create depictions of virtual \n     children that are indistinguishable from depictions of real \n     children; (B) create depictions of virtual children using \n     compositions of real children to create an unidentifiable \n     child; or (C) disguise pictures of real children being abused \n     by making the image look computer generated.\n       (5) Evidence submitted to the Congress, including from the \n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \n     demonstrates that technology already exists to disguise \n     depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable and \n     to make depictions of real children appear computer \n     generated. The technology will soon exist, if it does not \n     already, to make depictions of virtual children look real.\n       (6) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions \n     today involve images contained on computer hard drives, \n     computer disks, and/or related media.\n       (7) There is no substantial evidence that any of the child \n     pornography images being trafficked today were made other \n     than by the abuse of real children. Nevertheless, \n     technological advances since Ferber have led many criminal \n     defendants to suggest that the images of child pornography \n     they possess are not those of real children, insisting that \n     the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the \n     images are not computer-generated. Such challenges will \n     likely increase after the Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition \n     decision.\n       (8) Child pornography circulating on the Internet has, by \n     definition, been digitally uploaded or scanned into computers \n     and has been transferred over the Internet, often in \n     different file formats, from trafficker to trafficker. An \n     image seized from a collector of child pornography is rarely \n     a first-generation product, and the retransmission of images \n     can alter the image so as to make it difficult for even an \n     expert conclusively to opine that a particular image depicts \n     a real child. If the original image has been scanned from a \n     paper version into a digital format, this task can be even \n     harder since proper forensic delineation may depend on the \n     quality of the image scanned and the tools used to scan it.\n       (9) The impact on the government's ability to prosecute \n     child pornography offenders is already evident. The Ninth \n     Circuit has seen a significant adverse effect on prosecutions \n     since the 1999 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in \n     Free Speech Coalition. After that decision, prosecutions \n     generally have been brought in the Ninth Circuit only in the \n     most clear-cut cases in which the government can specifically \n     identify the child in the depiction or otherwise identify the \n     origin of the image. This is a fraction of meritorious child \n     pornography cases. The National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children testified that, in light of the Supreme \n     Court's affirmation of the Ninth Circuit decision, \n     prosecutors in various parts of the country have expressed \n     concern about the continued viability of previously indicted \n     cases as well as declined potentially meritorious \n     prosecutions.\n       (10) In the absence of congressional action, this problem \n     will continue to grow increasingly worse. The mere prospect \n     that the technology exists to create computer or computer-\n     generated depictions that are indistinguishable from \n     depictions of real children will allow defendants who possess \n     images of real children to escape prosecution, for it \n     threatens to create a reasonable doubt in every case of \n     computer images even when a real child was abused. This \n     threatens to render child pornography laws that protect real \n     children unenforceable.\n       (11) To avoid this grave threat to the Government's \n     unquestioned compelling interest\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\n     in effective enforcement of the child pornography laws that \n     protect real children, a statute must be adopted that \n     prohibits a narrowly-defined subcategory of images.\n       (12) The Supreme Court's 1982 Ferber v. New York decision \n     holding that child pornography was not protected drove child \n     pornography off the shelves of adult bookstores. \n     Congressional action is necessary to ensure that open and \n     notorious trafficking in such materials does not reappear.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend, the \nsenior Senator from Utah, in introducing the PROTECT Act, a bill \nproviding important new tools to fight child pornography. This bill is \nidentical to the measure that Senator Hatch and I worked so hard on in \nthe last Congress. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent in \nthe 107th Congress and I am proud to be the lead cosponsor of this \nlegislation for the 108th Congress as well, but unfortunately, it did \nnot become law last year because, even though the Senate was still \nmeeting, considering and passing legislation, the House of \nRepresentatives had adjourned. The House would not return to take \naction on this measure that had passed the Senate unanimously or to \nwork out our differences.\n  I hope that the full Senate will quickly pass this bill again, and I \nstrongly urge the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives \nto take this second opportunity to pass this important legislation. I \nalso urge the Administration to support this bipartisan measure, \ninstead of using this debate as an opportunity to push for legislation \nthat strives to make an ideological statement, but which may not \nwithstand Constitutional scrutiny.\n  I want to take a moment to speak about the history of this important \nbill and the effort that it took to get to this point. In May of 2002, \nI came to the Senate floor and joined Senator Hatch in introducing S. \n2520, the PROTECT Act, after the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft \nv. Free Speech Coalition, (``Free Speech''). Although there were some \nothers who raised constitutional concerns about specific provisions in \nthat bill, I believed that unlike legislative language proposed by the \nAdministration in the last Congress, it was a good faith effort to work \nwithin the First Amendment.\n  Everyone in the Senate agrees that we should do all we can to protect \nour children from being victimized by child pornography. That would be \nan easy debate and vote. The more difficult thing is to write a law \nthat will both do that and will stick. In 1996, when we passed the \nChild Pornography Prevention Act, (``CPPA''), many warned us that \ncertain provisions of that Act violated the First Amendment. The \nSupreme Court's recent decision in Free Speech has proven them correct.\n  We should not sit by and do nothing. It is important that we respond \nto the Supreme Court decision. It is just as important, however, that \nwe avoid repeating our past mistakes. Unlike the 1996 CPPA, this time \nwe should respond with a law that passes constitutional muster. Our \nchildren deserve more than a press conference on this issue. They \ndeserve a law that will last.\n  It is important that we do all we can to end the victimization of \nreal children by child pornographers, but it is also important that we \npass a law that will withstand First Amendment scrutiny. We need a law \nwith real teeth, not one with false teeth.\n  After joining Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act in the \n107th Congress, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee I convened a \nhearing on October 2, 2002 on the legislation. We heard from the \nAdministration, from the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, (``NCMEC''), and from experts who came and told us that our \nbill, as introduced, would pass constitutional muster, but the House-\npassed bill supported by the Administration would not.\n  I then placed S. 2520 on the Judiciary Committee's calendar for the \nOctober 8, 2002, business meeting. I continued to work with Senator \nHatch to improve the bill so that it could be quickly enacted. Senator \nHatch circulated a Hatch-Leahy proposed Judiciary Committee substitute \nthat improved the bill before our October 8 business meeting. \nUnfortunately the Judiciary Committee was unable to consider it because \nof procedural maneuvering by my colleagues that had nothing to do with \nthis important legislation, including the refusal of Committee members \non the other side of the aisle to consider any pending legislation on \nthe Committee's agenda.\n  I still wanted to get this bill done. That is why, for a full week in \nOctober, I worked to clear and have the full Senate pass a substitute \nto S. 2520 that tracked the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute \nin nearly every area. Indeed, the substitute I offered even adopted \nparts of the House bill which would help the NCMEC work with local and \nstate law enforcement on these cases. Twice, I spoke on the Senate \nfloor imploring that we approve such legislation. As I stated then, \nevery single Democratic Senator cleared that measure. I then urged \nRepublicans to work on their side of the aisle to clear this measure--\nso similar to the joint Hatch-Leahy substitute--so that we could \nswiftly enact a law that would pass constitutional muster. \nUnfortunately, they did not. Facing\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\nthe recess before the mid-term elections, we were stymied again.\n  Even after the last election, however, during our lame duck session, \nI continued to work with Senator Hatch to pass this legislation through \nthe Senate. As I had stated I would do prior to the election, I called \na meeting of the Judiciary Committee on November 14, 2002. In the last \nmeeting of the Judiciary Committee under my Chairmanship in the 107th \nCongress, I placed S. 2520, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, on the agenda \nyet again. At that meeting the Judiciary Committee amended and approved \nthis legislation. We agreed on a substitute and to improvements in the \nvictim shield provision that I authored.\n  Although I did not agree with two of Senator Hatch's amendments, \nbecause I thought that they risked having the bill declared \nunconstitutional, I nevertheless called both for the Committee to \napprove the bill and voted for the bill in its amended form. I will \ndiscuss these provisions later.\n  I then sought, that same day, to gain the unanimous consent of the \nfull Senate to pass S. 2520 as reported by the Judiciary Committee, and \nI worked with Senator Hatch to clear the bill on both sides of the \naisle. I am pleased that the Senate did pass S. 2520 by unanimous \nconsent. I want to thank Senator Hatch for all he did to help clear the \nbill for passage in the 107th Congress.\n  Unfortunately, the House failed to act on this measure last year and \nthe Administration decided not to push for passage. If they had, we \ncould have passed a bill, sent it to the President, and already had a \nnew law on the books.\n  Instead, I am here again with Senator Hatch asking yet again that \nthis bill be enacted. I am glad to have been able to work hand in hand \nwith Senator Hatch on the PROTECT Act because it is a bill that gives \nprosecutors and investigators the tools they need to combat child \npornography. The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act strives to be a serious \nresponse to a serious problem.\n  The provisions of the Hatch-Leahy bill, as we introduce it, are \nbipartisan and good faith efforts to protect both our children and to \nhonor the Constitution. At our hearing last October, Constitutional and \ncriminal law scholars--one of whom was the same person who warned us \nlast time that the CPPA would be struck down--stated that the PROTECT \nAct as introduced in the last Congress could withstand Constitutional \nscrutiny, although there were parts that were very close to the line. \nLet me outline some of the bill's important provisions:\n  I would like to emphasize some key provisions of the PROTECT Act. \nSection 3 of the bill creates two new crimes aimed at people who \ndistribute child pornography and those who use such material to entice \nchildren to do illegal acts. Each of these new crimes carry a 15 year \nmaximum prison sentence for a first offense and double that term for \nrepeat offenders. First, the bill criminalizes the pandering of child \npornography, creating a new crime to respond to the Supreme Court's \nrecent ruling striking down the CPPA's definition of pandering. This \nprovision is narrower than the old ``pandering'' definition for two \nreasons, both of which respond to specific Court criticisms: First, the \nnew crime only applies to the people who actually pander the child \npornography or solicit it, not to all those who possess the material \n``downstream.''\n  The bill also contains a directive to the Sentencing Commission which \nasks them to distinguish between those who pander or distribute such \nmaterial who are more culpable than those who solicit the material. \nSecond, the pandering in this provision must be linked to ``obscene'' \nmaterial, which is totally unprotected speech under Miller. Thus, while \nI would have liked for the provision to be crafted more narrowly so \nthat ``purported'' material was not included, and I acknowledge that \nthis provision may well be challenged on some of the same grounds as \nthe prior CPPA provision, it responds to some specific concerns raised \nby the Supreme Court and is significantly narrower than the CPPA's \ndefinition of pandering.\n  Second, the bill creates a new crime to take direct aim at one of the \nchief evils of child pornography: namely, its use by sexual predators \nto entice minors either to engage in sexual activity or the production \nof more child pornography. This was one of the compelling arguments \nmade by the government before the Supreme Court in support of the CPPA, \nbut the Court rejected that argument as an insufficient basis to ban \nthe production, distribution or possession of ``virtual'' child \npornography. This bill addresses that same harm in a more targeted \nmanner. It creates a new felony, which applies to both actual and \nvirtual child pornography, for people who use such material to entice \nminors to participate in illegal activity. This will provide \nprosecutors a potent new tool to put away those who prey upon children \nusing such pornography--whether the child pornography is virtual or \nnot.\n  Next, this bill attempts to revamp the existing affirmative defense \nin child pornography cases both in response to criticisms of the \nSupreme Court and so that the defense does not erect unfair hurdles to \nthe prosecution of cases involving real children. Responding directly \nto criticisms of the Court, the new affirmative defense applies equally \nto those who are charged with possessing child pornography and to those \nwho actually produce it, a change from current law. It also allows, \nagain responding to specific Supreme Court criticisms, for a defense \nthat no actual children were used in the production of the child \npornography--i.e. that it was made using computers. At the same time, \nthis provision protects prosecutors from unfair surprise in the use of \nthis affirmative defense by requiring that a defendant give advance \nnotice of his intent to assert it, just as defendants are currently \nrequired to give if they plan to assert an alibi or insanity defense. \nAs a former prosecutor I suggested this provision because it effects \nthe real way that these important trials are conducted. With the \nprovision, the government can marshal the expert testimony that may be \nneeded to rebut this ``virtual porn'' defense in cases where real \nchildren were victimized.\n  This improved affirmative defense provides important support for the \nconstitutionality of much of this bill after the Free Speech decision. \nEven Justice Thomas specifically wrote that it would be a key factor \nfor him. This is one reason for making the defense applicable to all \nnon-obscene, child pornography, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256. In \nthe bill's current form, however, the affirmative defense is not \navailable in one of the new proposed classes of virtual child \npornography, which would be found at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256(8)(D). This \nomission may render that provision unconstitutional under the First \nAmendment, and I hope that, as the legislative process continues, we \ncan work with constitutional experts to improve the bill in this and \nother ways. I do not want to be here again in five years, after yet \nanother Supreme Court decision striking this law down.\n  The bill also provides needed assistance to prosecutors in rebutting \nthe virtual porn defense by removing a restriction on the use of \nrecords of performers portrayed in certain sexually explicit conduct \nthat are required to be maintained under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2257, and \nexpanding such records to cover computer images. These records, which \nwill be helpful in proving that the material in question is not \n``virtual'' child pornography, may be used in federal child pornography \nand obscenity prosecutions under this Act. The purpose of this \nprovision is to protect real children from exploitation. It is \nimportant that prosecutors have access to this information in both \nchild pornography and obscenity prosecutions, since the Supreme Court's \nrecent decision has had the effect of narrowing the child pornography \nlaws, making more likely that the general obscenity statutes will be \nimportant tools in protecting children from exploitation. In addition, \nthe Act raises the penalties for not keeping accurate records, further \ndeterring the exploitation of minors and enhancing the reliability of \nthe records.\n  Next, this bill contains several provisions altering the definition \nof ``child pornography'' in response to the Free Speech case. One \napproach would have been simply to add an ``obscenity'' requirement to \nthe child pornography definitions. Outlawing all obscene child \npornography real and virtual; minor and `youthful-adult;' simulated and\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\nreal--would clearly pass a constitutional challenge because obscene \nspeech enjoys no protection at all. Under the Miller obscenity test, \nsuch material (1) ``appeals to the prurient interest,'' (2) is utterly \n``offensive'' in any ``community,'' and (3) has absolutely no \n``literary, artistic or scientific value.''\n\n  Some new provisions of this bill do take this ``obscenity'' approach, \nlike the new Sec.  2256(8)(B). Other provisions, however, take a \ndifferent approach. Specifically, the CPPA's definition of \n``identifiable minor'' has been modified in the bill to include a prong \nfor persons who are ``virtually indistinguishable from an actual \nminor.'' This adopts language from Justice O'Connor's concurrence in \nthe Free Speech case. Thus, while this language is defensible, I \npredict that this provision will be the center of much constitutional \ndebate. Although I will explain in more detail later, these new \ndefinitional provisions risk crossing the constitutional line.\n  It does not do America's children any good to write a law that might \nget struck down by our courts in order to prove an ideological point. \nThese provisions should be fully debated and examined during the \nlegislative process, and I will speak about them in more detail later.\n  The bill also contains a variety of other measures designed to \nincrease jail sentences in cases where children are victimized by \nsexual predators. First, it enhances penalties for repeat offenders of \nchild sex offenses by expanding the predicate crimes which trigger \ntough, mandatory minimum sentences. Second, the bill requires the U.S. \nSentencing Commission to address a disturbing disparity in the current \nSentencing Guidelines. The current sentences for a person who actually \ntravels across state lines to have sex with a child are not as high as \nfor child pornography. The Commission needs to correct this oversight \nimmediately, so that prosecutors can take these dangerous sexual \npredators off the street. These are all strong measures designed to \nprotect children and increase prison sentences for child molesters and \nthose who otherwise exploit children.\n  The Act also has several provisions designed to protect the children \nwho are victims in these horrible cases. Privacy of the children must \nbe paramount. It is important that they not be victimized yet again in \nthe criminal process. This bill provides for the first time ever an \nexplicit shield law that prohibits the name or other non physical \nidentifying information of the child victim, other than the age or \napproximate age, from being admitted at any child pornography trial. It \nis also intended that judges will take appropriate steps to ensure that \nsuch information as the child's name, address or other identifying \ninformation not be publicly disclosed during the pretrial phase of the \ncase or at sentencing. The bill also contains a provision requiring the \njudge to instruct the jury, upon request of the government, that no \ninference should be drawn against the United States because of \ninformation inadmissible under the new shield law.\n  The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act also amends certain reporting provisions \ngoverning child pornography. Specifically, it allows federal \nauthorities to report information they receive from the Center from \nMissing and Exploited Children, CMEC, to state and local police without \na court order. In addition, the bill removes the restrictions under the \nElectronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA, for reporting the contents \nof, and information pertaining to, a subscriber of stored electronic \ncommunications to the CMEC when a mandatory child porn report is filed \nwith the CMEC pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13032. This change may invite \nfederal, state or local authorities to circumvent all subpoena and \ncourt order requirements under ECPA and allow them to obtain subscriber \nemails and information by triggering the initial report to the CMEC \nthemselves. To the extent that these changes in ECPA may have that \nunintended effect, as this bill is considered in the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the floor, we should consider mechanisms to guard \nagainst subverting the safeguards in ECPA from government officials \ngoing on fishing expeditions for stored electronic communications under \nthe rubric of child porn investigations.\n  I also must express my disappointment in a recent Government \nAccounting Office, GAO, report that criticizes the Department of \nJustice information sharing regulations related to the CMEC tip line. \nEvidently, due to outdated turf mentalities, the Attorney General's \nregulations exclude both the United States Secret Service and the U.S. \nPostal Inspection Service from direct access to important tip line \ninformation. That is totally unacceptable, especially in the post 9-11 \nworld where the importance of information sharing is greater than ever. \nHow can the Administration justify support of this bill, which allows \nstate and local law enforcement officers such access, when they are \nsimultaneously refusing to allow other federal law enforcement agencies \naccess to the same information? I urge the Attorney General to end this \nunseemly turf battle and to issue regulations allowing both the Secret \nService and the Postal Inspection Service, who both perform valuable \nwork in investigating these cases, to have access to this important \ninformation so that they can better protect our nation's children.\n  This bill also provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction where a \ndefendant induces a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct \noutside the United States for the purposes of producing child \npornography which they intend to transport to the United States. The \nprovision is crafted to require the intent of actual transport of the \nmaterial into the United States, unlike the House bill from the last \nCongress, which criminalized even an intent to make such material \n``accessible.'' Under that overly broad wording, any material posted on \na web site internationally could be covered, whether or not it was ever \nintended that the material be downloaded in the United States.\n  Finally, the bill provides also a new private right of action for the \nvictims of child pornography. This provision has teeth, including \ninjunctive relief and punitive damages that will help to put those who \nproduce child pornography out of business for good. I commend Senator \nHatch for his leadership on this provision.\n  These provisions are important, practical tools to put child \npornographers out of business for good and in jail where they belong.\n  As to the administration proposal, unfortunately legal experts could \nnot also vouch for the constitutionality of the bill supported by the \nAdministration in the last Congress, which seemed to challenge the \nSupreme Court's decision, rather than accommodate the restraints \nspelled out by the Supreme Court. That proposal and the associated \nHouse bill from the 107th Congress simply ignored the Supreme Court's \ndecision, reflecting an ideological response rather than a carefully \ndrawn bill that would stand up to scrutiny. Last year, I received \nletters from other Constitutional scholars and practitioners expressing \nthe same conclusion, which I will place in the record with unanimous \nconsent.\n  With regard to the potential constitutional issues and suggested \nimprovements, as I mentioned previously, the PROTECT Act is a good \nfaith effort to tackle this problem, but it is not perfect and I would \nlike to see some additional changes to the bill. I hope that we can \nconsider these as the process moves forward.\n  First, regarding the tip line, I would like to clarify that law \nenforcement agents cannot ``tickle the tip line'' to avoid the key \nprotections of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. This may \ninclude clarifying 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13032 that the initial tip triggering \nthe report may not be generated by the government's investigative \nagents themselves. A tip line to the CMEC is just that--a way for \noutsiders to report wrongdoing to the CMEC and the government, not for \nthe government to generate a report to itself without following \notherwise required lawful process.\n  Second, regarding the affirmative defense, I would like to ensure \nthat there is an affirmative defense for the new category of child \npornography and for all cases where a defendant can prove in court that \na specific, non-obscene image was made using not any child but only \nactual, identifiable adults.\n  As a general matter, it is worth repeating that we could be avoiding \nall these problems were we to take the simple approach of outlawing \n``obscene'' child pornography of all types,\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\nwhich we do in one new provision that I suggested. That approach would \nproduce a law beyond any possible challenge. This approach is also \nsupported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nwhich we all respect as the true expert in this field.\n  Following is an excerpt from the Center's answer to written questions \nsubmitted after our hearing, which I will place in the Record in its \nentirety:\n\n       Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all child \n     pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges and \n     juries, even under a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt in \n     criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person under \n     community standards model, it is highly unlikely that any \n     community would not find child pornography obscene. . . .\n       In the post Free Speech decision legal climate, the \n     prosecution of child pornography under an obscenity approach \n     is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.\n\n  Thus, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, the approach that is least likely to raise constitutional \nquestions--using established obscenity law--is also an effective one. \nBecause that is not the approach we have decided to use, I recognize \nthat the PROTECT Act contains provisions about which some may have \nlegitimate Constitutional questions.\n  Specifically, in addition to the provisions that I have already \ndiscussed, there were two amendments adopted in the Judiciary Committee \nin the last Congress to which I objected that are included in the bill \nas we introduce it today. I felt and still feel that these provisions \nneedlessly risked a serious constitutional challenge to a bill that \nprovided prosecutors the tools they needed to do their jobs. Let me \ndiscuss my opposition to these two amendments offered by my good friend \nSenator Hatch last Congress.\n  As to the expansion of the pandering provision, although I worked \nwith Senator Hatch to write the new pandering provision in the PROTECT \nAct, I did not support Senator Hatch's amendment extending the \nprovision to cover ``purported'' material, which criminalizes speech \neven when there is no underlying material at all--whether obscene or \nnon-obscene, virtual or real, child or adult.\n  The pandering provision is an important tool for prosecutors to \npunish true child pornographers who for some technical reason are \nbeyond the reach of the normal child porn distribution or production \nstatutes. It is not meant to federally criminalize talking dirty over \nthe internet or the telephone when the person never possesses any \nmaterial at all. That is speech, and that goes too far.\n  The original pandering provision in S. 2520 was quite broad, and some \nargued that it presented constitutional problems as written, but I \nthought that prosecutors needed a strong tool, so I supported Senator \nHatch on that current provision.\n  I was heartened that Professor Schauer of Harvard, a noted First \nAmendment expert, testified at our hearing that he thought that the \noriginal provision was Constitutional, barely. Unfortunately, Professor \nSchauer has since written to me stating that this new amendment to \ninclude ``purported'' material ``would push well over the \nconstitutional edge a provision that is now up against the edge, but \nprobably barely on the constitutional side of it.'' I will place that \nletter and other materials in the record with unanimous consent of the \nSenate.\n  Because this change endangers the entire pandering provision, because \nit is unwise, and because that section is already strong enough to \nprosecute those who peddle child pornography, I hope that we can debate \nthe merits of that provision as the legislative process continues.\n  And as to the inclusion of 100 percent virtual child pornography in \n``Identifiable Minor'' provision, a change to the definition of \n``identifiable minor'' would expand the bill to cover ``virtual'' child \npornography that is, 100 percent computer generated pictures not \ninvolving any real children. For that reason, it also presents \nconstitutional problems. I objected to this amendment when it was added \nto the bill in the last Congress in Committee and I continue to have \nserious concerns with it now.\n\n  Senator Hatch and I agree that legislation in this area is important. \nBut regardless of our personal views, any law must be within \nconstitutional limits or it does no good at all. This change which \nwould include all ``virtual child pornography'' in the definition of \nchild pornography, in my view, crosses the constitutional line, \nhowever, and needlessly risks protracted litigation that could assist \nchild pornographers in escaping punishment. I hope we can work to \nnarrow this provision.\n  Although I joined Senator Hatch in introducing this bill, even when \nit was introduced last year I expressed concern over certain \nprovisions. One such provision was the new definition of ``identifiable \nminor.'' When the bill was introduced, I noted that this provision \nmight ``both confuse the statute unnecessarily and endanger the already \nupheld 'morphing' section of the CPPA.'' I said I was concerned that it \n``could present both overbreadth and vagueness problems in a later \nconstitutional challenge.''\n  The Supreme Court made it clear that we can only outlaw child \npornography in two situations: No. 1, it is obscene, or No. 2, it \ninvolves real kids. That is the law as stated by the Supreme Court, \nwhether or not we agree with it.\n  The original ``identifiable minor'' provision in the PROTECT Act may \nbe used without any link to obscenity doctrine. Therefore, what saved \nthe original version as introduced in the 107th Congress was that it \napplied to child porn made with real ``persons.'' The provision was \ndesigned to cover all sorts of images of real kids that are morphed or \naltered, but not something entirely made by computer, with no child \ninvolved. That is the provision as Senator Hatch and I introduced this \nbill last year.\n  The change adopted in the Judiciary Committee last year, however, \nredefined ``identifiable minor'' by creating a new category of \npornography for any ``computer generated image that is virtually \nindistinguishable from an actual minor'' dislodged, in my view, that \nsole constitutional anchor. The new provision could be read to include \nimages that never involved real children at all but were 100 percent \ncomputer generated.\n  That was never the goal of this provision and that was the reason it \nwas constitutional. There are other provisions in the bill that deal \nwith obscene virtual child pornography that I support. This provision \nwas intended to ease the prosecutor's burden in cases where images of \nreal children were cleverly altered to avoid prosecution.\n  I support the definition of ``identifiable minor'' as we originally \nwrote and introduced it last Congress. Because this new change \nseriously weakens the constitutional argument supporting this entire \nprovision, I oppose it and I hope that we can work to further narrow \nthis provision.\n  These provisions raise legitimate concerns, but in the interest of \nmaking progress I support consideration of the measure as introduced. I \nhope that we can work to debate these issues and improve it and produce \na bill with the best chance of withstanding a constitutional challenge.\n  That is not everyone's view. Others evidently think it is more \nimportant to make an ideological statement than to write a law. A media \nreport on this legislation at the end of the last Congress reported the \nwide consensus that the Hatch-Leahy bill was more likely than the House \nbill to withstand scrutiny, but quoted a Republican House member as \nstating: ``Even if it comes back to Congress three times we will have \ncreated better legislation.''\n  To me, that makes no sense. Why not create the ``better legislation'' \nright now for today's children, instead of inviting more years of \nlitigation and putting at risk any convictions obtained in the interim \nperiod before the Supreme Court again reviews the constitutionality of \nCongress' effort to address this serious problem? That is what the \nPROTECT Act seeks to accomplish.\n  Even though this bill is not perfect, I am glad to stand with Senator \nHatch to secure its approval by the Senate as I did in the last \nCongress.\n  As I have explained, I believe that this issue is so important that I \nhave been willing to compromise and to support a measure even though I \ndo not agree with each and every provision that it contains. That is \nhow legislation is normally passed. I hope that the Administration and \nthe House do not decide to play politics with this issue\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\nthis year as I fear they did at the close of the last Congress. I urge \nswift consideration and passage of this important bill aimed at \nprotecting our nation's children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters and materials \nto which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 October 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     express the views of the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children on these critically important issues for \n     our nation's children. Your stewardship of the Committee's \n     tireless efforts to craft a statute that will withstand \n     constitutional scrutiny is wise and in the long-term best \n     interest of the nation. The National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children is grateful for your leadership on this \n     issue.\n       Please find below my response to your written questions \n     submitted on October 9, 2002, regarding the ``Stopping Child \n     Pornography: Protecting our Children and the Constitution.''\n       1. Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all \n     child pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges \n     and juries, even under the standard of beyond a reasonable \n     doubt in criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person \n     under community standards model, it is highly unlikely that \n     any community would not find child pornography obscene.\n       There is a legitimate concern that the obscenity standard \n     does not fully recognize, and therefore punish the \n     exceptional harm to children inherent in child pornography. \n     This issue can be addressed by the enactment of tougher \n     sentencing provisions if the obscenity standard is \n     implemented in the law regarding child pornography. Moreover, \n     mere possession of obscene materials under current law in \n     most jurisdictions is not a criminal violation. If the \n     obscenity standard were implemented for child pornography the \n     legislative intent should be clear concerning punishment for \n     possession of child obscene pornography.\n       In the post--Free Speech decision legal climate the \n     prosecution of child pornography cases under an obscenity \n     approach is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.\n       2. Based on my experience all the images in actual criminal \n     cases meet the lawful definition of obscenity, irrespective \n     of what community you litigate the case. In my experience \n     there has never been a visual depiction of child pornography \n     that did not meet the constitutional requirements for \n     obscenity.\n       3. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \n     fully supports the correction of this sentencing disparity \n     and welcomes the provision of additional tools for federal \n     judges to remove these predators from our communities. These \n     types of offenders belong to a demographic that is the \n     highest percentile in terms of recidivism than any other \n     single offender category.\n       4. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \n     fully supports language that allows only ``non-government \n     sources'' to provide tips to the CyberTipline. The role of \n     the CyberTipline at the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children is to provide tips received from the \n     public and Electronic Communication Services communities and \n     make them available to appropriate law enforcement agencies. \n     Due in part to the overwhelming success of the system and in \n     part to the tragedies of September 11, 2001, federal law \n     enforcement resources cannot address all of the legitimate \n     tips and leads received by the CyberTipline. Allowing the \n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and \n     appropriate federal agencies to forward this information to \n     state and local law enforcement while at the same time \n     addressing legitimate privacy concerns is fully supported.\n       5. The victim shield provision is an excellent and timely \n     policy initiative and one that is fully supported by the \n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. This \n     provision should allow the narrow exception to a general non-\n     disclosure clause that anticipates the need for law \n     enforcement and prosecutors to use the victim's photography \n     and other relevant information for the sole purpose of \n     verification and authentication of an actual child victim in \n     future cases. This exception would allow the successful \n     prosecution of other cases that may involve a particular \n     victim and still provide the protection against the \n     revictimization by the criminal justice system.\n       6. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \n     fully supports extending the terms of authorized supervised \n     release in federal cases involving the exploitation of \n     minors. The evidence for extended supervision in such cases \n     is overwhelming. Without adequate treatment and continued \n     supervision, there is a significantly higher risk for re-\n     offending by this type of offender. Moreover, there is a \n     significant link between those offenders who possess child \n     pornography and those who sexually assault children. Please \n     see the attached studies that the National Center for Missing \n     and Exploited Children has produced on these issues.\n       Thank you again for the opportunity to address these \n     important issues. Should you need further input or assistance \n     please contact us at your convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Daniel Armagh,\n\n                                Director, Legal Resource Division,\n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            University of Virginia\n\n\n                                                 School of Law\n\n                               Charlottesville, VA, Nov. 28, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On October 2, 2002, I testified before \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee concerning S. 2520 and H.R. \n     4623. Each of these bills was drafted in response to Ashcroft \n     v. Free Speech Coalition, 122 S.Ct. 1389 (2002), in which the \n     Supreme Court threw out key provisions of the federal child \n     pornography laws. As I stated in my testimony, the new \n     sections contained in S. 2520 have been carefully tailored \n     with an eye towards satisfying the precise concerns \n     identified by the Supreme Court. Recently, Senator Hatch \n     offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2520 \n     (hereinafter ``the Hatch Substitute''). I have examined the \n     Hatch Substitute, and I believe that it contains a definition \n     of child pornography that is nearly identical to the \n     definition rejected by Free Speech Coalition. Therefore, the \n     Hatch Substitute is unlikely to survive constitutional \n     challenge in the federal courts, and the Committee should \n     decline to adopt it.\n       As you know, each of these bills contains some complicated \n     provisions, including especially their definition sections. \n     As you also know, this complexity is unavoidable, for the \n     Congress aims to intervene in and eliminate some of the \n     complex law enforcement problems created by the phenomenon of \n     virtual pornography. In the following comments, I will try to \n     state my concerns about the Hatch Substitute as concisely as \n     possible, while identifying the statutory nuances that are \n     likely to generate significant constitutional questions in \n     the event that the Hatch Substitute is enacted.\n       In Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme Court scrutinized \n     provisions of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 \n     (``CPPA'') that were designed to eliminate obstacles to law \n     enforcement created by virtual child pornography. The \n     proliferation of virtual pornography has enabled child \n     pornographers to escape conviction by arguing that it is so \n     difficult to distinguish the virtual child from the real one \n     that (1) the government cannot carry its burden of proving \n     that the pornography was made using real children and/or (2) \n     the government cannot carry its burden of proving scienter \n     because the defenders believed that the images in their \n     possession depicted virtual children, rather than real ones. \n     In order to foreclose these arguments, the CPPA defined \n     ``child pornography'' broadly so that it extended not only to \n     a sexually-explicit image that had been produced using a real \n     minor, but also to an image that ``appears to be of a minor'' \n     engaging in sexually-explicit conduct. Free Speech Coalition \n     rejected this definition on First Amendment grounds. The \n     Court reaffirmed the holding of New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. \n     747 (1982), under which the government is free to regulate \n     sexually-explicit materials produced using real minors \n     without regard to the value of those materials. However, the \n     Court refused to extend the Ferber analysis to sexually-\n     explicit materials that only appear to depict minors. The \n     Court noticed that many mainstream movies, as well as works \n     of great artistic, literary, and scientific significance, \n     explore the sexuality of adolescents and children. Such \n     works, including ones that are sexually explicit, are \n     valuable in the eyes of the community, and, as long as \n     their production involves no real children, such works are \n     protected by the First Amendment against governmental \n     regulation.\n       In Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme Court expressly \n     considered and rejected a number of arguments made by the \n     Solicitor General on behalf of the CPPA definition. One of \n     these arguments was that the ``speech prohibited by the CPPA \n     is virtually indistinguishable from child pornography, which \n     may be banned without regard to whether it depicts works of \n     value.'' In his opinion for the Court, Justice Kennedy \n     explained that this argument fundamentally misconceived the \n     nature of the First Amendment inquiry. Materials that satisfy \n     the Ferber definition are regulable not because they are \n     necessarily without value; to the contrary, Ferber itself \n     recognized that some child pornography might have significant \n     value. Indeed, the Court there reasoned that the ban on the \n     use of actual children was permissible in part because \n     virtual images--by definition, images ``virtually \n     indistinguishable'' from child pornography--were an available \n     and lawful alternative. Hence, as Justice Kennedy put it: \n     ``Ferber, then, not only referred to the distinction between \n     actual and virtual child pornography, it relied on [the \n     distinction] as a reason supporting its holding. Ferber \n     provides no support for a statute that eliminates the \n     distinction and makes the alternative mode criminal as \n     well.''\n       S. 2520 aims to reform the CPPA in ways that are sensitive \n     to these First Amendment value judgments. By contrast, the \n     Hatch Substitute proposes that the Congress should reenact a \n     definition that is almost identical to the one that the \n     Supreme Court just rejected. In the Hatch Substitute, the \n     definition of child pornography would cover,\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\n     among other things, sexually-explicit materials whose \n     production involved the use of an ``identifiable minor.'' The \n     Hatch Substitute defines ``identifiable minor'' as including \n     a ``computer or computer generated image that is virtually \n     indistinguishable from an actual minor.'' As I explained \n     above, the Solicitor General suggested in Free Speech \n     Coalition that the First Amendment would be satisfied if the \n     Supreme Court limited the CPPA to depictions that are \n     ``virtually indistinguishable'' from child pornography, and \n     the Court rejected that interpretation. To put it mildly, it \n     is hard to imagine that the Supreme Court would be inclined \n     to view the Hatch Substitute as a good-faith legislative \n     response to Free Speech Coalition when all it does is reenact \n     a definition that the Court there expressly considered and \n     disapproved. You will notice that I here am paraphrasing the \n     definition provisions in the Hatch Substitute and omitting \n     some of their complexity. In particular, the Hatch Substitute \n     provides a further definition of the phrase ``virtually \n     indistinguishable,'' requiring that the quality of the \n     depiction be determined from the viewpoint of an ``ordinary \n     person'' and providing an exception for ``drawings, cartoons, \n     sculptures, or paintings.'' But neither the definition of \n     ``identifiable minor'' nor these refinements of ``virtually \n     indistinguishable'' are calculated to satisfy the concerns \n     raised in Free Speech Coalition. As Justice Kennedy explained \n     for the Court, an absolute ban on pornography made with real \n     children is compatible with First Amendment rights precisely \n     because computer-generated images are an available \n     alternative, and, yet, the Hatch Substitute proposes to \n     forbid the computer-generated alternative as well. Likewise, \n     an exception for cartoons and so forth is insensitive to the \n     Supreme Court's commitment to protect realistic portrayals of \n     child sexuality, a commitment that is clearly expressed in \n     the Court's recognition of the value of (among other things) \n     mainstream movies such as Traffic and American Beauty.\n       In this regard, you will notice that the Hatch Substitute \n     closely resembles some of the defective provisions of H.R. \n     4623, which would prohibit virtual child porn that is \n     ``indistinguishable'' from porn produced with real minors. \n     Unlike S. 2520, both H.R. 4623 and the Hatch Substitute seem \n     to embody a decision merely to endorse the unconstitutional \n     portions of the CPPA all over again. The Committee should \n     refuse to engage in such a futile and disrespectful exercise. \n     The law enforcement problems posed by virtual pornography are \n     not symbolic but real, and the Congress should make a real \n     effort to solve them. In my judgment, S. 2520 is a real \n     effort to solve them, and the Committee should use S. 2520 as \n     the basis for correcting the CPPA.\n       The Hatch Substitute contains additional innovations that \n     the Committee should study carefully. Because this letter \n     already is too long, I will allude to only one of them here. \n     The ``pandering'' provision set forth in the Hatch Substitute \n     contains some language that strikes me as being both vague \n     and unnecessarily broad, and the provision therefore is \n     likely to attract unfavorable attention in the federal \n     courts. The Hatch pandering provision would punish anyone who \n     ``advertises, promotes, presents, distributes, or solicits . \n     . . any material or purported material in a manner that \n     conveys the impression that the material or purported \n     material'' is child pornography. To be completely candid, I \n     am not sure that I understand what problems would be solved \n     by defining the items that may not be pandered so that they \n     include not only actual ``material,'' but also ``purported \n     material.'' I suppose that there might be cases where a \n     person offers to sell pornographic materials that do not \n     actually exist and that the person might make the offer in a \n     manner that violates the pandering prohibition. If that is \n     the problem that the drafters of the Hatch Substitute have in \n     mind, it seems that they might solve that problem more \n     cleanly by adding the word ``offers'' to the list of \n     forbidden conduct and deleting the reference to ``purported \n     material.'' (In other words, the provision would punish \n     anyone who ``advertises, offers, promotes, presents, \n     distributes, or solicits through the mails . . . any material \n     on a manner that conveys the impression that the material'' \n     is child pornography.) If that is not the problem that the \n     Hatch Substitute has in mind, I would suggest that the \n     drafters identify the problem precisely and develop language \n     that is clearer and narrower than the phrase ``purported \n     material,'' for that ambiguous term is likely to generate \n     First Amendment concerns that otherwise could and should be \n     avoided.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                 Anne M. Coughlin,\n     Class of 1948 Research Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Oct. 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: I want to thank you for your efforts \n     to protect American children by filling the gap left by the \n     Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Child Pornography \n     Prevention Act. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition dealt a \n     blow to those who appreciate the important role the federal \n     government must ply in protecting young people from those who \n     would exploit them. Your efforts to craft a bill, the PROTECT \n     Act, that will withstand Constitutional scrutiny deserves the \n     public's applause.\n       I would like to draw your attention to a similar, but \n     separate, matter that also reflects on the health and \n     security of our children in regards to pornography. Like the \n     Child Pornography Prevention Act, the Child Internet \n     Protection Act (CIPA), which was passed by the 106th \n     Congress, has been struck down by the federal judiciary. In \n     American Library Association, et al. v. United States of \n     America, et al, a District Court in Pennsylvania threw CIPA \n     out, arguing that its efforts to prevent children from \n     exposure to harmful material on school and library computers \n     amounted to a violation of the First Amendment. The Justice \n     Department has appealed that case to the Supreme Court, where \n     the lower court's decision will very likely be upheld. \n     Unfortunately, as Harvard Law School professor Frederick \n     Schauer testified at the hearing you recently held on CPPA, \n     ``constitutionally suspect legislation under existing Supreme \n     Court interpretation of the First Amendment, whatever we may \n     think of the wisdom and accuracy of those interpretations, \n     puts the process of [prosecution] . . . on hold while the . . \n     . courts proceed at their own pace.\n       I think we ought not wait for what will likely be a \n     disappointing conclusion. Rather, I hope you will lead an \n     effort to craft new legislation which (1) passes \n     Constitutional muster, and (2) better enables schools and \n     libraries to protect children from harmful images and \n     websites. Let me take a moment to delimit how exactly a new, \n     improved Children's Internet Protection Act would differ from \n     the bill passed by the 106th Congress.\n       First, a new bill should distinguish clearly between \n     measures affecting adults and minors. Though the title of the \n     legislation is the Children's Internet Protection Act, it \n     requires technology protection measures on all computers with \n     Internet access, regardless of the age of the patron using \n     each computer. If the aim is to protect minors, it is \n     unnecessary to put filters on every computer in a library. \n     This, of course, was one of the District Court's primary \n     concerns. I hope you will draft legislation requiring \n     separate computers for adults and minors. All those under 18 \n     should be required to use filtered computers, unless \n     accompanied by a parent or teacher. Those over 18 should have \n     access to un-filtered computers in a separate area. I smaller \n     facilities, where only one computer is available, special \n     adult hours could be set during which the filter is disabled \n     and only adults may use the computer. The rest of the time a \n     filter would be in place.\n       Second, I would encourage you to incorporate language that \n     distinguishes children 12 and under from teenagers 13-18. \n     Teenagers have greater capacities to process information than \n     children, as well as different needs for information. In \n     recognition of this, I would hope that your new bill would \n     require different policies for children and teenagers, such \n     as providing different filter settings.\n       Third, I hope you will consider expanding the scope of your \n     bill to include provisions that protect minors from violent \n     images as well as sexual ones. I realize that limiting the \n     access of children to violent content poses a potentially \n     more difficult constitutional question, but based on the \n     weight of social science evidence showing the harm caused to \n     children by violence in the media, I believe that violence \n     must be included in any definition of content that is \n     ``harmful to children.''\n       To further explain the reasoning behind these \n     recommendations, I am enclosing a law review article, ``On \n     Protecting Children from Speech,'' which will be published \n     next fall in the Chicago-Kent Law Review.

Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our grave concern \n     with the legislation recently proposed by the Department of \n     Justice in response to the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Ashcroft, et al. v. The Free Speech Coalition, et al., No. \n     00-795 (Apr. 16, 2002). In particular, the proposed \n     legislation purports to ban speech that is neither obscene \n     nor unprotected child pornography (indeed, the bill expressly \n     targets images that do not involve real human beings at all). \n     Accordingly, in our view, it suffers from the same \n     infirmities that led the Court to invalidate the statute at \n     issue in Ashcroft.\n       We emphasize that we share the revulsion all Americans feel \n     toward those who harm children, and fully support legitimate \n     efforts to eradicate child pornography. As the Court in \n     Ashcroft emphasized, however, in doing so Congress must act \n     within the limits of the First Amendment. In our view, the \n     bill proposed by the Department of Justice fails to do so.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Jodie L.

Kennedy School of Government,\n                                   Cambridge, MA, October 3, 2002.\n     Re S. 2520.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Following up on my written statement \n     and on my oral testimony before the Committee on Wednesday, \n     October 2, 2002, the staff of the Committee has asked me to \n     comment on the constitutional implications of changing the \n     current version of S. 2520 to change the word ``material'' in \n     Section 2 of the bill (page 2, lines 17 and 19) to \n     ``purported material.''\n       In my opinion the change would push well over the \n     constitutional edge a provision that is now right up against \n     that edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side of \n     it.\n       As I explained in my statement and orally, the Supreme \n     Court has from the Ginzburg decision in 1966 to the Hamling \n     decision in 1973 to the Free Speech Coalition decision in \n     2002 consistently refused to accept that ``pandering'' may be \n     an independent offense, as opposed to being evidence of the \n     offense of obscenity (and, by implication, child \n     pornography). The basic premise of the pandering prohibition \n     in S. 2520 is thus in some tension with more than thirty-five \n     years of Supreme Court doctrine. What may save the provision, \n     however, is the fact that pandering may also be seen as \n     commercial advertisement, and the commercial advertisement of \n     an unlawful product or service is not protected by the \n     Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine, as the Court made \n     clear in both Virginia Pharmacy and also in Pittsburgh Press \n     v. Human Relations Commission, 413 U.S. 376 (1973). It is \n     important to recognize, however, that this feature of \n     commercial speech doctrine does not apply to non-commercial \n     speech, where the description on advocacy of illegal acts is \n     fully protected unless under the narrow circumstances, not \n     applicable here, of immediate incitement.\n       The implication of this is that moving away from \n     communication that could be described as an actual commercial \n     advertisement decreases the availability of this approach to \n     defending Section 2 of S. 2520. Although it may appear as if \n     advertising ``material'' that does not exist at all \n     (``purported material'') makes little difference, there is a \n     substantial risk that the change moves the entire section \n     away from the straight commercial speech category into more \n     general description, conversation, and perhaps even advocacy. \n     Because the existing arguments for the constitutionality of \n     this provision are already difficult ones after Free Speech \n     Coalition, anything that makes this provision less like a \n     straight offer to engage in a commercial transaction \n     increases the degree of constitutional jeopardy. By including \n     ``purported'' in the relevant section, the pandering looks \n     less commercial, and thus less like commercial speech, and \n     thus less open to constitutional defense I outlined in my \n     written statement and oral testimony.\n       I hope that this is helpful.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                Frederick Schauer,\n         Frank Stanton Professor of the First Amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/13/senate-section/article/S245-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
