Mr. President, today we will be in a period of morning \nbusiness for the purpose of making statements and introducing \nlegislation. At 2 o'clock this afternoon, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the District of Columbia appropriations bill. It is \nstill our desire to finish this bill this week. The managers were here \nFriday and will be here again today ready to make progress on the bill.\n  I announced last Friday that any amendments offered during today's \nsession will be stacked for votes beginning at approximately 5:30 p.m. \ntoday. If Members do not come forward with their amendments, it would \nbe my hope that the bill could be brought to third reading and the \nSenate will then vote on passage of the bill.\n  On the issue of DC school choice, we spent significant time last week \non it, and the Mayor came to the Capitol imploring us to allow the \nDistrict of Columbia schoolchildren to receive a decent education. We \nheard a lot of arguments from the other side as to why this should not \nhappen. We heard from the other side that the District's public \nschoolchildren should be only allowed to go to a better school if the \nDistrict's nonpublic schools submit a new, onerous, burdensome set of \nregulations. In other words, the nonpublic or private schools should \nhave to pay for the failure of some of the District's schools. The \nlogic of this type of argument simply is not clear. Children are not \nhorses. They cannot be traded and they should not be traded.\n  We also heard that because this plan is modest and cannot provide \nscholarships for all of the District's children, then none of the \nDistrict's children should have this opportunity to benefit. William \nRaspberry today in his syndicated column said it very well when he \nsaid, ``How does it follow that nobody should get life vests, because \nthere aren't enough to go around?'' That is a good question, made even \nmore puzzling by the fact that the same critics who charge the program \nfor not being generous enough say it is a radical departure from the \nstatus quo.\n\n  Thomas Sowell, in his syndicated column today, likens this to the \nclassic complaint that the food doesn't taste good, and even worse, \nthere is not enough of it.\n  Well, the fact of the matter is we have had three full debates on \nthis topic of the District appropriations but concentrating on \neducation in the District. Today will be our fourth day of debate and \ndiscussion on this issue.\n  Despite all of these alleged concerns, the other side--the \nopposition--has not yet offered any amendments. We have not had them \ncome forward and say this is our amendment; let's have a vote on the \namendment. Thus, I am left with the conclusion that the opposition \nwould prefer the schoolchildren in the District remain trapped in \nschools that are not giving them the opportunities to learn and to \ngrow. I hope this is not the case and that we will press forward and \nwork together to achieve passage of the bill this week.\n  If we are unable to make progress on the bill today in terms of \namendments, we will have votes this afternoon on our judicial nominees. \nSeven additional judges were reported last Thursday, and we will begin \nordering votes on those nominations this week.\n  This week, as I stated a couple of weeks ago now--almost two weeks \nago--my intentions are to have the Senate begin the urgent supplemental \nrequest for Iraq and Afghanistan security. That discussion and debate \nis very important, and I have set aside this week, recognizing that we \nare going on recess next week, to address this very important issue, \nwhich is important because it looks at security in Iraq and in \nAfghanistan with a real focus on our troops who deserve that support. \nThe full Senate will begin consideration of that bill as soon as it \nbecomes available for floor action.\n  I know we will have full and complete debate, looking at the various \naspects of that bill on the floor of the Senate, and thus as we talked \nabout on\n\n[[Page S12106]]\n\nthe floor at the end of last week in colloquies going back and forth, \nlate nights are to be expected.\n  We are at war. There is a war against terrorism. We are talking about \nsecurity in Afghanistan and Iraq. It deserves the focus of this body. I \nhave asked my colleagues to make their schedules available so we can \nhave full participation. It does mean that during the days and, I \nsuspect, well into the evenings this week, we will be participating in \nthat debate. We do want to finish this emergency appropriations bill \nthis week.\n  Again, as I mentioned, next week we will be out on recess and into \nthe week after that. The President has made it very clear that the \nurgency demands we address this bill as soon as possible. That will be \nthis week, and it is our intention to complete that this week.\n  I thank my colleagues in advance for what will be a challenging week \nfor all of us. I expect the American people can be proud this week as \nwe deliberate on the many complicated issues on which we will have \nvotes to decide those issues and we will then complete our work on this \nrequest by the end of the week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12106-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my remarks will not be lengthy, but I \nentitle them as follows: ``Putting $87 Billion Into Context.''\n  The Senate will soon consider the President's request for an \nadditional $87 billion to fund the U.S. occupation of Iraq and \nAfghanistan and to aid in their reconstruction.\n  The $87 billion supplemental brings to a total of $194 billion the \namount the United States is spending in Iraq and Afghanistan. Let me \nrepeat that. The $87 billion supplemental brings to $194 billion the \namount the United States is spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than \ntwice what the administration had led the public to believe just a few \nmonths ago.\n  The 1991 Persian Gulf war, by contrast, cost $61 billion, of which \nthe United States paid only $7 billion. That is $7 billion spent in \n1991 compared to $194 billion today, almost 28 times higher.\n  The Bush administration's $87 billion supplemental request is the \nlargest emergency spending request since 1977. The $87 billion request, \njust for Iraq and Afghanistan, just for next year, roughly equals, in \ncurrent dollars, the total amount of money spent to rebuild the entire \ncontinent of Europe after World War II. The request is larger than the \n$74 billion the Defense Department plans to spend on all new weapons \npurchases next year. The request is more than twice the \nadministration's entire $35 billion homeland security budget for next \nyear. That means that for every $2 spent on the President's \nsupplemental request for Iraq, the administration will spend less than \n$1 on homeland security here at home.\n\n  The $20 billion the President is seeking for Iraq's reconstruction is \n$2 billion more than we are spending for foreign assistance for every \nother nation on the planet. The $87 billion request is 50 percent more \nthan we spend on education for the entire United States. Let me say \nthat again. The $87 billion request is 50 percent more than we spend on \neducation for the entire Nation.\n  With $194 billion spent or requested, the President's war spending in \n2003 and 2004 already exceeds the inflation-adjusted cost of the \nRevolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War, the \nSpanish-American War, and the Persian Gulf war combined. The cost of \nthe war and postwar occupation of Iraq will soon surpass the $196 \nbillion inflation-adjusted cost of World War I. The monthly bill for \nthe United States military missions in Iraq and Afghanistan now rivals \nspending during the Vietnam war.\n  At $87 billion, the President's request is larger than the economies \nof 166 countries. It is larger than the individual economies of almost \nhalf the States of the Union. That is a lot of money.\n  If approved, the President's request would increase the Federal \nbudget deficit for fiscal year 2004 to $535 billion; in other words, \nmore than half a trillion dollars. I will say that once more. If \napproved, the President's request would increase the Federal budget \ndeficit for fiscal year 2004 to $535 billion. The White House is now in \ndanger of violating its own self-imposed limit for budget deficits, 6 \npercent of gross domestic product or $600 billion.\n  The administration hopes it will receive an additional $30 billion to \n$55 billion from other countries and Iraqi oil revenue over the next 2 \nyears, but that money may never materialize. Iraqi oil production is 1 \nmillion barrels per day less than before the war. The oil \ninfrastructure has been hobbled by severe looting and sabotage. Certain \npipelines have been struck by a series of attacks since the United \nNations lifted sanctions this summer. Iraq's oil revenues are likely to \nfall short of even the most modest expectations of this administration.\n  As for the tens of billions of dollars the Bush administration is \nhoping to receive from other countries and international financial \ninstitutions, President Bush's request has fallen on deaf ears. The \nBush administration has alienated most of the international community. \nAfter the Presidential swallowing of pride and having asked the United \nNations for help, the Washington Post summed up the President's \nfundraising efforts with the headline, ``Bush Fails To Gain Pledges On \nTroops Or Funds For Iraq.''\n  Increasingly, it appears as if we are on our own in financing the \noccupation and the reconstruction of Iraq. I urge my colleagues to \nexercise patience before approving this request. This is not just an \nordinary supplemental bill. This is not just a token amount of money. \nIt is the beginning of a major commitment of resources in behalf of the \nAmerican taxpayer. Before we act, we should make sure that taxpayers \nunderstand the size and consequences of this request and what will be \nasked of them in paying for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, one of the most important issues we may face \nall year is an issue we are going to be working on this week, and that \nis the urgent supplemental appropriations to continue and, we hope, \nwind up our efforts in Iraq. I know there are many different views. I \nthink a little historical perspective may be in order. Some people are \neven questioning why we are in Iraq. I run into people in my home State \nwho think, as some of the German media apparently does--I saw a report \ntoday--that September 11 was just a conspiracy of the United States, \nand that we really were not under a terrorist attack.\n  Well, we have known for some time the dangers that terrorism present \nto the world and to those of us here in America. It was very clear back \nin 1998:\n\n       One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the \n     capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the \n     missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.\n\n  President Clinton, February 4. Then again on February 17:\n\n       If Saddam rejects peace, we have to use force. Our purpose \n     is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by \n     Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.\n\n  President Clinton, February 17.\n  And even better, here is a quote from a day later:\n\n       Iraq is a long way from here but what happens there means a \n     great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue \n     State will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \n     against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we \n     face.\n\n  So stated by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, February 18.\n  Well, after the tragedy of September 11, 2001, President Bush very \nforcefully outlined a program to deal with terrorists. He said: We are \ngoing to bring terrorists to justice or we will bring justice to the \nterrorists. He pointed out that we would no longer permit States to \nharbor terrorist groups, to provide safe havens for terrorists who need \nthe opportunity and the time and the money and the financing to build \ntheir terrorist operations through which they could strike the United \nStates.\n  Well, during the 1990s we did not respond--Khobar Towers, our embassy \nbombings, USS Cole. We treated them as isolated instances when, in \nfact, they were part of a terrorist scheme. You cannot retaliate \nagainst a suicide bomber. You have to deal forcefully. That is why \nPresident Bush said we will go after the terrorists, wiping out \nterrorists where we find them and undoing the governmental structure \nwhich protects them.\n  Well, we have been successful. Magnificent military efforts in \nAfghanistan disbanded the Taliban. A magnificent, unbelievable effort \nin Iraq totally shredded the Saddam Hussein government of tyranny and \nauthoritarianism, a government of rape and poisoning of their own \ncitizens. But now we face what President Bush said is going to be an \nongoing battle, a continuing battle, the battle against terrorism \nitself--not just this particular Government or location.\n  We have before us a request from the President of the United States \nfor $87 billion. Most of it, about $67 billion, is to protect our \ntroops and to keep them there and to keep them safe. Another $21 \nbillion will help the Iraqi people build a country free after 30 years \nof terrorism, torture, and repression and to develop their own \nmilitary, their own police force, their own security, their own justice \nsystem so they can be safe and start to rebuild the economic structure \nof their country.\n  Now, $87 billion is a lot of money. Make no mistake about that. That \nis really a huge sum. But last week we had extensive hearings with \nSecretary Rumsfeld, General Myers, and representatives of the State \nDepartment and the Department of Defense. I asked them, What was the \ncost of 9/11? How much did it cost?\n  We know it cost 3,000 lives or more in the Twin Towers, in the field \nin Pennsylvania, and here at the Pentagon, and that is a huge tragedy. \nBut when you take a look at the monetary side, the best estimates are a \ncouple hundred billion dollars because we did not deal with terrorists \nbefore they dealt with us. They struck us on our territory, on their \nterms.\n  The President of the United States came to the Senate and, by a vote \nof 77 to 23, the Senate authorized him to wage war in Iraq. We did \nthat. We won. But the terrorists are there. The terrorists come back \ninto Baghdad like a roach motel. All the low life, the hideous \nassassins, the suicide bombers are coming back. And we are fighting \nwith them, we are dealing with them there. We need $66 billion. It \ncosts well over $4 billion a month to keep our troops there.\n  The people of Iraq, in response to opinion polls, have clearly said, \nby an overwhelming majority, that they want us there because they see \nthe difference that has happened in their country. They know with the \nBaath Party still functioning, remnants of the Republican Guard, al-\nQaida, and other terrorist groups coming in there, they are not safe \nunless they have a security shield. Right now, we are that security \nshield. And we are doing some good things as well.\n  One of the things Secretary Rumsfeld pointed out was the tremendous \nprogress we are making to help Iraq get back on its feet so it is safe. \nIn less than 5 months, virtually all major Iraqi hospitals and \nuniversities have been reopened. They are taking down huge caches of \nweapons that have been stored away by the Saddam government and by \nterrorists.\n  Mr. President, 70,000 Iraqis have been armed and trained and will be \ngraduating into the military, and 40,000 Iraqi police are conducting \njoint patrols with coalition forces. A new Iraqi council has appointed \ngovernment cabinet members. Iraqi municipal councils are functioning in \nalmost all towns and villages, and some 8,000 civil affairs projects \nhave been undertaken by our troops.\n  Now we need to do something more. We need to win the peace, and this \n$21 billion is the best investment we can make in winning the peace. \nBecause only when we have won the peace and put in place an Iraqi \nmilitary and police force and government that is able to protect itself \ncan we safely bring our troops home and not worry about having to go \nback 5 or 10 years later, after they have rejuvenated their chemical \nand biological weapons programs and perhaps achieved the goal of \nnuclear explosives. We will not have to go back again and do what we \njust did.\n  The terrorists are firing at our troops over there. The war on \nterrorism is going on in Baghdad. But make no mistake about it, they \nare not just shooting at our soldiers and innocent Iraqis and Iraqi \npolice; they are shooting at American public opinion because their \ngreatest hope is they can sow discord in the United States and force a \npullback of our forces before the peace is won, to allow all those \nhorrible terrorists to regroup and come together and launch another \nattack against their neighbors, against those who have been friendly \nwith us, and, yes, against the United States.\n  I hope we will have a good, vigorous debate. I hope we can move \nquickly to pass the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. Let's \nvote on it up or down. Let's get it moving and support our troops, but \nlet's also get it moving so we can win the peace. Right now, with our \nforces over there, the battle in the war on terrorism is focused on \nBaghdad. It is tragic it has to be anywhere, but we have carried the \nbattle to them. Because of the strong leadership of this \nadministration, we are fighting the battle of terrorism in Baghdad--not \nin Boston or Boise or Ballwin, MO or Belton, MO.\n  I believe that reports from our troops in the field, who say, ``Yes, \nthis is dangerous, this is deadly, but we would rather be fighting them \nhere than on our homeland,'' are right on. The people who are over \nthere know what their mission is. They know how important their \ncontributions are to safety and security, not just in Iraq, and in \ntheir neighborhood in the Middle East, but to our own safety, our own \nwell being.\n  Mr. President, 62 percent of the Iraqis in Baghdad, according to a \nZogby poll, believe the hardships they have faced since the war have \nbeen worth it to rid the country of Saddam Hussein, his evil sons, and \nthe brutal regime. That is an incredible vote of confidence for what \nthe United States has done.\n  In a different poll, when asked how long U.S. troops should remain in \nthe country, two-thirds of the Iraqis said the U.S. troops should stay \nat least another year. I am afraid those numbers are higher than we \nwould get in the Senate right now, but it tells you what\n\n[[Page S12108]]\n\nwe are doing is important for them as well as for us.\n  We want them to have a secure and peaceful country, but we want them \nto be able to enforce the law, to confront paramilitary troops with \ntheir own forces. That is what the $21 billion goes for. It is a lot of \nmoney, but if it gets our troops out just 5 months sooner, it will save \nus that much in supporting our own military. And we all know it will \nsave us much more in exposure of our fighting men and women to the \nterrorist attacks that are now going on in Baghdad.\n  I hope we can move effectively and quickly. Let's have some up-and-\ndown votes. Let's get on with it. We are at war. The President said all \nalong that the war on terrorism is going to be a long war. But we have \na chance to gain a major foothold. I hope we can move this emergency \nsupplemental for Iraq and Afghanistan as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2765, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2765) making appropriations for the government \n     of the District of Columbia and other activities chargeable \n     in whole or in part against the revenues of said District for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       DeWine/Landrieu Amendment No. 1783, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we are back on the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill. It is my hope that we will, within the next \nseveral days, be able to conclude our deliberations on this bill.\n  This bill, as we have discussed at length already, is a very positive \nbill. Senator Landrieu and I have worked on it with the help of the \nother members of the committee. It does a great deal for the children \nof the District of Columbia. One of the things Senator Landrieu and I \nare both proud of is the work it does for the foster care system, a \nsystem that has truly been broken in the District. The District of \nColumbia has had some serious problems in regard to its foster care \nsystem. The Washington Post and other news media outlets have reported \ntime and again about the foster care system. This legislation, for the \nfirst time, commits the Federal Government to try to assist in the \nrepair of the system.\n  The bill also continues the work of the Congress with the District to \ndeal with some very severe infrastructure problems--a sewer problem, \nfor example.\n  It also addresses the school problem in the District of Columbia, \nwhich is the one area that has been contentious. We have taken some \ntime already to debate the issue. As I have pointed out, this bill \ntakes a balanced approach to the school challenge. It is a program that \nhas been designed by the Mayor. It is an innovative program that \nprovides for $40 million of new money--I emphasize that this is new \nmoney--that will be injected into the system: $13 million that will go \nto public schools, $13 million to charter schools for the creation of \nnew charter schools, and $13 million used for a brand new program to \ncreate scholarships for the poorest children in the District of \nColumbia.\n  It is a program that, as the Mayor has said, was designed by him, a \nprogram he supports, as he has publicly stated, and that he has asked \nthe Congress, the Senate to approve. It is a program that will go a \nlong way to help the children of the District of Columbia.\n  I ask this afternoon for my colleagues who do have amendments--I know \nSenator Landrieu will be discussing in a moment an amendment she and \nSenator Carper will be proposing; I know Senator Durbin has an \namendment, and some of the other colleagues may have amendments--to \ncome to the Chamber and offer their amendments so we can move the bill \nforward. We are prepared to vote on the amendments. It is time for us \nto do that so we can move this legislation forward.\n  I yield to my friend and colleague, Senator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio who has \nbeen a great partner in this effort. He and I share a great deal of \npride in the underlying bill. It was built and crafted with a \ntremendous amount of bipartisan support.\n  As he mentioned, one of the cornerstones and key provisions is a \npush, an initiative, to help support, change, and transform the foster \ncare system in the District. Although it is not a Federal \nresponsibility directly, as the District of Columbia, and as a major \ncity in our country, we hope to have a model that is beneficial not \nonly to the District and the residents in the region but also a model \nthat shines as a bright line around the country as jurisdictions all \nover the country, including many jurisdictions in Louisiana, are \nstruggling with this same question of how to give the taxpayers the \naccountability they deserve, how to give the parents and families the \nrespect they deserve, and how and when to step in and separate \nchildren, for their own protection, safety, and health, from a family \nsituation that is disintegrating or dysfunctional and try to heal the \nsituation, reunite the child with the family, or, if that cannot \nhappen, move that child through a temporary nurturing foster care \nsituation until that child can either be reunited with the family or \nplaced with an adoptive family.\n  I commend the District leadership publicly for the improvements that \nhave been made, although we are a long way from where we need to go. \nWith Senator DeWine's leadership, we were able to put millions and \nmillions of dollars in last year's bill--as I recall, somewhere around \n$70 million--for a new court system to redesign the superior court, to \nactually identify--and Senator DeWine and Senator Durbin led this \neffort--and design a special court for domestic cases, for family \ncases, for child welfare cases, so hopefully we now have coming into \nplay one judge--one child and one judge, one family, so children do not \nget lost between courtrooms or their files are not lost between social \nworkers. We have one team, one judge working with the child for good \nresolution.\n  It takes not only good planning but it takes money. It takes \nresources. The mayor and the locals have stepped up to increase their \nbudgets. We have stepped up to try, even with things as tight as they \nare, to find additional funding to support that foster care reform. \nThat includes the courts, in getting the social worker ratios tighter \nso we do not have 1 social worker for every 50 children but 1 social \nworker for a manageable 15, 20, or 30, which is still a heavy caseload.\n  Those are two of the important initiatives. Having the right kind of \ndatabase, having the right kind of people step to the plate to become \nfoster care parents, to promoting adoption as a way to move children to \na permanent, loving home--that takes the cooperation of the social \nworkers, the families, the extended family, and the court.\n  All of those initiatives are funded in this bill to some degree--not \nto the extent, of course, that we would like but I think to the extent \nwe can begin to see some real headway in terms of improvement for the \nchildren of the District.\n  There are anywhere from 6,000 to 8,000 children ranging in age from \ninfants to 18 to 21 who need this assistance. The chairman has also \nbeen very eloquent regarding the needs of children aging out of the \nsystem, children who were taken away from their parents, where parental \nrights were terminated, and the system we created failed to find that \nchild a new family. So at the age of 18 or 21, the child ages out and \nis literally handed a plastic bag with a few pieces of clothing and not \nmuch else other than good luck, good wishes, and goodbye.\n\n  That, of course, is not sufficient. In this bill and other efforts \nthis Congress\n\n[[Page S12109]]\n\nis making, we are trying not only to help children aging out of the \nfoster care system in the District of Columbia but all over the Nation. \nThere are 25,000 such young children who age out each year. There are \nexciting projects underway to help these young people despite the fact \nthat they got a short straw in terms of the way their first 21 years of \nlife went. We are hoping to step in, in a more comprehensive way, and \ngive these young people opportunities for college, for skill \ndevelopment, for social development.\n  Of course, all the money in the world spent on the back end is not \nworth the effort that could be in the front end regarding prevention. \nThat is what Senator DeWine has so correctly done and why I support him \nin his efforts.\n  Now a word on the school reform proposal being considered and \ndebated. There were a number of points I tried to make on this proposal \nFriday. I agree with Senator DeWine; we should have our Members present \namendments to try to get some sort of idea in terms of time. Perhaps we \nwill have today and tomorrow to discuss this issue. Senator Durbin and \na few other Senators on our side will have amendments to lay down.\n  One of the issues I will discuss is the issue of choice. It was one \nof the goals of Leave No Child Behind, and an important goal. It was \nnot the central goal. It was not the underlying goal. It was a \ndesirable goal. The goal of Leave No Child Behind was excellence \nthrough accountability--excellence for the children in the public \nschool system and accountability to their parents and taxpayers who \npick up the tab for that system.\n  In that legislation, we laid down many ways that jurisdictions can \nprovide more choices for students all over this country, for the \nmillions and millions and millions of children who are in public \neducation. We want real choices, not false choices. I am afraid some \nvoucher proponents who continue to talk about vouchers for private \nschools say the real issue is choice. It is not choice; it is real \nchoice. It is informed choice. It is not just choice. And it is \naffordable choice.\n  Senator Carper and I, in one of eight points in an amendment we have \ndiscussed, tried to point out to the proponents that the $7,500 \nvoucher, while it sounds like a lot of money--and $7,500 is a lot of \nmoney--the average private school tuition in the District of Columbia \nis $10,800. We are trying to point out, as written in the proposal \nbeing considered, there is no guarantee that $7,500 voucher would \nactually get a child into the school of their choice for that amount of \nmoney because the school of their choice might have a tuition of \n$20,000 or $18,000 or $12,000.\n  One of the aspects of our amendment is, if you are for choice, then \nbe for a real choice; make the voucher real, not fake. We have been \ncriticized as having a filibuster on the cheap. I say that proposal is \nlike vouchers on the cheap.\n  It is not going to work if the tuition is $20,000 or $15,000 or \n$12,000. The proponents want to say the taxpayers should be prepared to \npick up whatever to give a real choice. Well, that is an expensive \nwhatever. But the opponents want to say we will pick up a voucher for a \nchild to go to a private school, then pick it up. That is what I say. \nPick it up. Why stop at $7,500?\n  One of the parts of our amendment is to have the voucher basically be \naccepted by the private school--this is all voluntary on the private \nschools' part, which is a very good part of the underlying bill. This \nis not mandatory. No private school has to participate, and there would \nbe many reasons, as written in many newspapers in the country, why many \nprivate schools in the District would not want to participate. If they \nare going to participate, they would have to follow certain \nguidelines--not cumbersome and, in my mind, not anything that would be \nvery difficult to follow--again, just trying to meet the minimum \naccountability standards. But if we are going to give children a \nchoice, let's give them a real choice and not vouchers on the cheap, \nNo. 1.\n  No. 2, one of the most important things about creating any system of \nchoices, whether you create more choice in a public school or more \nchoice for children to go to private schools, is to have informed \nchoices. I would think that we could be spending more money--or more \neffort and money than we are, and I would be surprised that the \nproponents who have argued for choice, choice, choice, have not put \nforward a proposal to try to help the parents of the District of \nColumbia to have more informed choices about the choices they have now, \nwhich is completely public school choice.\n  In order to make good choices--as we have seen, the choices you make \nare only as good as the information you have with which to make them. \nWe are experiencing this with our foreign policy as we speak. If your \ninformation is not as secure and as thorough and deep and as tight as \nyou would like it, maybe sometimes the choices you make would be \ndifferent if you had the right kind of information. It is the same \nthing about public schools and about school choice. If you could have a \nconsumer report, like many of us get for the appliances that we \npurchase, you could tell what kind of washing machine or dryer you \nwould like, or what car you would like to buy. It is quite easy. Not \nonly can you view the product in a number of different locations \nwithout a lot of pressure, but you can read in detail about the way the \nproduct carries out its work or the way the product functions. The same \neffort should be underway here.\n  That is one of the things that Leave No Child Behind put forward in \nits reform effort, trying to help improve choices, increase choices but \ninformed choices, and why is there now a report card, a report, \naccountability? It is so parents can know. If I have a choice to send \nmy child to this or that school, it is not just walking in the front \ndoor and shaking hands with a few individuals and observing if the \nschool looks like it is in good repair and observing the children in \nthe school; but it is also looking a little beneath the surface. What \nare the teacher/parent ratios? How large are the classrooms? Is my \nchild getting this kind of attention? What do the records show? How \nmany children have become national merit scholars at this school? How \nmany things do parents want to know about their children? If we are \ninterested in choice--of which I am a strong supporter, which is why I \nhave supported charter schools and this kind of accountability and \ninformation--then I would think that the voucher proponents would be \ninterested in that kind of information.\n\n  But, again, the amendment we have discussed, laid down--the necessity \nof gathering that kind of information and evaluation, not telling the \npublic schools what they have to do, or ratios, but reporting \nmechanisms that would allow parents to make wise choices and would also \nallow the taxpayer who is picking up this tab to have some sense of \nwhether their money was being used for a good purpose or not. Maybe the \ntaxpayers would have a different view. But no matter what we do, \nwhether we have a voucher that goes--which I have argued goes only to \nchildren in failing schools, not a broad-based voucher--to have an \nopportunity to put the system in place for those children to leave that \nschool and to move to a different school, you are going to have to have \nbetter information than the proposal that is before us. So the issue of \nbasically voucher on the cheap choice might sound good but it is not \nreal unless you have the right kind of information.\n  The third point I wish to make is this. My colleague just said this, \nand you could argue--and I hate to argue with him on any point because \nhe and I have agreed on so many issues for this bill. But I have to \ntake issue with one statement, and he is not the only one who said it. \nThe other Senators have talked about the concept of extra money or new \nmoney. This $40 million that exists in the Senate bill, which is a \nthird for vouchers, a third for charters, a third for traditional \npublic schools, is not new tax dollars. There was no new revenue stream \ncreated to pay for this. Part of the money came from the Defense \nallocation. Part of the money came from Commerce-State-Justice and part \nof it came from the allocation for the District of Columbia. So this \nmoney has come from other places in the budget to come to the District \nof Columbia. It is not new money. It was here before. It is here now. \nIt is just now shaped for this education initiative.\n  I agree that the District should get $40 million for a demonstration \nproject\n\n[[Page S12110]]\n\nfor any number of reasons. I don't agree with all of the details of the \nvoucher proposal, but I hope we can stop saying this is new money \nbecause, in my mind, unless there was a proposal like everybody is \ngoing to pay one more dollar for their parking tickets or one more \npenny for sales tax or everybody is going to pay one more something, it \nis not new money; it is coming from somewhere else to fund this \ninitiative--not from the education budget, that is true, but it is \ncoming from other budgets.\n  The Wall Street Journal writes about this every week in a very \ncritical way of my position. I say to them, as they wrote again today, \nseveral of us who have supported the modification, they want to remind \nme--they say:\n\n       Senator Landrieu should remind herself that this is extra \n     education money.\n\n  Let me say to the Wall Street Journal and to any other newspaper that \nwould be reporting on this, I don't know if you can convince any \neducator in America that there is any extra money anywhere for \neducation. I don't think you could argue with any educator anywhere and \nsay there is extra money. People may say we are spending too much in \nthis area, and our money is not being spent well, so let's move it and \nrepair schools; or we have too much money in the repair school budget, \nso let's move it to buy computers; or we have great computers but we \ndon't have the teachers who have the training to operate the computers \nand to teach them, so let's take that money and move it. But I don't \nknow anybody who thinks there is extra money in education, and \nespecially extra money for a program that doesn't accomplish the goals \nthat you have outlined and doesn't meet the objectives of Leave No \nChild Behind.\n  I will have some other things to say about this article as the day \nproceeds. I wanted to talk for a minute about the concept of new money, \nextra money, about choice and the difference between real choice, \ninformed and uninformed choices, and, again, the issue of vouchers on \nthe cheap, because $7,500 will not get many children in the District \nmuch because the schools here are quite expensive--not just in the \nDistrict but in the region and throughout the country. There are many \nexpensive schools that are much more than $7,500.\n  If we are going to try to help children who are in failed public \nschools to get a real informed choice, then at least give them a \nvoucher that will get them through the front door and they will not \nhave to go out and have a bake sale in their neighborhood to get the \nextra money to go because that is not a real choice.\n  Those are the comments I wanted to make. There are other Senators who \nwill be coming to the floor to speak. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I wish to respond to my colleague's \ncomment about ``new money.'' I hesitate to do this because my colleague \nand I agree on so many issues. We have worked so well on this bill. But \nwe disagree about this phrase. I will say why I have used this phrase.\n  First, this is new money. This is new money to the Mayor. If you ask \nhim, ``Mayor, is this new money to you,'' he is going to say: ``Yes, it \nis, Senator, new money. I didn't have this $40 million, and would I \nlike this $40 million for my schools, for my kids? Yes, I would. I \nwould like 13 million new dollars for my public schools. Yes, I would \nlike 13 million new dollars--new dollars--so I can have these \nscholarships; I would, indeed.''\n  It is new money. It is, in fact, new money. It is new to these kids. \nIt is new to their parents. It is new to the schools. It is 13 million \nnew dollars for charter schools, and it will create new charter schools \nand they will, in fact, be new.\n  Why do we use the term ``new''? We have to understand the context. \nOne of the arguments made many times against these scholarships, or, as \nmy colleague would say, vouchers, is that you can't do that or you \nshouldn't do that because it takes money away from public schools. As \nthe debate is taking place across the country, people will say: You \nshouldn't be taking money away from the public schools and putting it \ninto scholarships; that is not fair.\n  When this program was designed, when this bill was put together, the \ndecision was made that we were not going to do that. What we want to do \nand what the Mayor wants to do is make this a win-win-win situation, \nwith no money taken away from the public schools. In fact, money would \nbe given to the public schools. So, yes, in fact, it is new money. That \nis the context in which the term ``new money'' is used.\n  Those of us who are in favor of this bill and in favor of this \nprogram use the phrase ``new money'' simply to emphasize no money is \nbeing taken away from the public schools, and, in fact, it is new money \nto the public schools, new money for the charter schools and new money, \nyes, for these scholarships. That is why we use that phrase. Quite \nfrankly, that is why I am going to continue to use it, and I think it \nis very important to point that out.\n  I wish to go back to another point my colleague made about the $7,500 \nscholarship, that it might not be enough at some of these schools. \nFirst of all, I think in most cases it will be enough. Let me tell you \nwhy. A recent survey conducted by the Washington Scholarship Fund, with \nassistance from the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nstaff, found the average weighted tuition among DC private schools with \nvacancies to be $6,172, well within the $7,500 scholarship amount \nprovided by this program. That is something we need to keep in mind.\n  Furthermore, two-thirds of the schools that reported vacancies charge \ntuition under $7,300 and most have a sliding scale to accommodate a \nfamily's ability to pay. We think the fact is this is not going to be a \nproblem, but I say to my colleague, I already indicated to her when we \nwere negotiating earlier last week that I don't have a problem with \nthat particular language in her amendment. It certainly makes sense to \nme. I don't have any problem with that provision in her amendment.\n\n  We have reached the point in this debate when we need to know about \nthe amendments. We talked a lot about them. We need to get them. I am \nnot going to propound a unanimous consent request at this point, but I \nput everybody on notice, within an hour or two I am going to ask \nunanimous consent that we set a time certain later today that we have a \nspecific cutoff time so we can get these amendments noticed and so \neveryone will be notified what the amendments will be. There is no \nreason we can't put everyone on notice and have a time certain later \ntoday when these amendments all can be filed so that we know where we \nare so we can move forward.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week, the Senate begins a debate on \nthe most important question facing any government. It is not just about \nthe administration's policies and its conduct in Iraq. It is about the \nway we pursue American interests in a dangerous world. It is about the \nway our Government makes one of its most important decisions--whether \nto send young American men and women to war.\n  Everything we do this week--every amendment we consider and every \nword of our debate--should be focused on protecting our men and women \nin uniform, providing for the support and care of their families, and \nhelping them complete their mission and come home with honor.\n  It is wrong to put American lives on the line for a dubious cause. \nMany of us continue to believe that this was the wrong war at the wrong \ntime. There were alternatives short of a premature rush to a unilateral \nwar that could have accomplished our goals in Iraq with far fewer \ncasualties and far less damage to our goals in the war against \nterrorism.\n\n[[Page S12111]]\n\n  But above all, at this time, as our men and women face constant \ndanger, as American lives are lost almost daily in Iraq, it is not only \nwrong, but an irresponsible failure of leadership for the \nadministration to have no plan for Iraq. Our troops deserve a plan that \nwill bring in adequate foreign forces to share the burden and restoring \nstability and building democracy as part of a vision for the future of \nIraq, and bring us closer to the day when our troops will come home \nwith honor.\n  There is no question that the Senate owes it to our men and women in \nuniform to provide the support they need. But $87 billion cannot be a \nblank check. The administration must tell the country what it intends \nto do with $87 billion and its plans for sharing the burden with our \nallies at the U.N. and achieving our goals. The American people are \nentitled to know whether, with all the current difficulties, the \nadministration has a plausible plan for the future, instead of digging \nthe hole even deeper.\n  During this debate, my colleagues and I will raise questions about \nthe administration's failed policy in Iraq. We do so not only out of \nconcern for its effect on American security but especially out of \nconcern for the safety of American service men and women, who are \npaying for that failed policy with their lives.\n  In its effort to secure swift approval of this enormous $87 billion, \nthe administration and its allies undoubtedly will criticize those who \nraise questions about its policy in Iraq. Rather than acknowledging its \nfailures, the White House and its friends in Congress with attack those \nwho question its policies,and may even accuse us of undermining our \ntroops.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. It is the administration's \nfailure to consider other alternatives before rushing recklessly into \nwar that has now put our soldiers at risk. It is the administration's \nfailure to gain international support that has put our soldiers at \nrisk. It is the administration's failure to have a plan to win the \npeace that has created a breeding ground for terrorism in Iraq and put \nour soldiers at risk.\n  The embarrassing rebuff of President Bush by the United Nations last \nweek has made these errors even worse. We may never know for sure who \nor what persuaded President Bush to go to war in Iraq. We know now that \nwe should not have accepted at face value the claims that Iraq was \nlinked to al-Qaida, or that Iraq was building nuclear weapons, or that \nIraq had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. Our \nintelligence agencies clearly had inadequate information to justify \nsuch claims by the administration, but it is far from clear why \nPresident Bush was persuaded to accept that information as adequate.\n  There is a greater responsibility now than ever on Congress to have \nan open and honest debate about these failures, and do all that we can \nto put our country back on the right course in Iraq and in the larger \nongoing war on terrorism.\n  Our soldiers' lives are at stake. Patriotism is not the issue. \nSupport of our troops is not the issue. The safety of the 140,000 \nAmerican service men and women serving in Iraq today is the issue, and, \nit is our solemn responsibility to question, and question vigorously, \nthe administration's current plan to request for funds to restore \nstability in Iraq, achieve democracy in Iraq, and bring our soldiers \nhome with dignity and honor. So far, the administration has failed, and \nfailed utterly, to provide a plausible plan for the future of Iraq and \nto ensure the safety of our troops. America's military is the finest in \nhistory. It is no surprise that we won the war in just 21 days.\n  The war was a spectacular victory--but the postwar effort has been a \nresounding failure. Our soldiers and Marines in Iraq are displaying \ntheir extraordinary military skill, but their mission has become \ninfinitely more complex and difficult.\n  Our soldiers were told they would be welcomed as liberators. Instead, \nthey are increasingly resented as occupiers and are under siege every \nday. They face surprise attacks and deadly ambushes from an unknown \nenemy. It is increasingly difficult to tell friend from foe. The \naverage number of daily attacks against American troops has recently \nincreased from 13 to 22.\n  We are losing a soldier a day; 309 Americans have been killed in Iraq \nsince the war began. In the 150 days since President Bush declared \n``mission accomplished'' aboard the USS Liberty, 171 American soldiers \nhave died. Ten soldiers from Massachusetts have made the ultimate \nsacrifice in Iraq.\n  This chart shows the list of casualities and total deaths. We do not \nsee the number of wounded; we do not hear that number quoted in the \nSenate because it isn't published. I wonder why it isn't published. \nWhat possible justification is there for concealing the number of brave \nyoung men and women who have been wounded over there? Why can't the \npublic know the number of these young Americans who have been wounded \nso we have a better understanding of what the cost has been?\n  What possible national security threat is there to publishing of the \nnumber of American service men and women who are wounded, along with \nthose killed?\n  These are not just statistics. Each fallen soldier has someone who \nmourns. The loss--whether it is a parent, a husband or wife, a brother \nor sister, or a child--weighs heavily on us, and we must do our best to \nsee that their sacrifice is not in vain.\n  The administration's failure to plan for the security of our forces \nin Iraq has created a crisis for the military. It is already stretched \nthin. We do not have enough active-duty soldiers to sustain their \npresence.\n  Half of our Army divisions are in Iraq or Afghanistan. Of the 33 \nactive-component Army combat brigades, 18 are in the Middle East. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, by March of 2004, all of \nU.S. active-component combat units will be serving in Iraq or will have \nserved there in the last year.\n  Let me repeat that. By March of 2004, all of the U.S. active-\ncomponent combat units will be serving in Iraq or will have served \nthere in the last year.\n  To solve this urgent problem, some have advocated creating two new \ndivisions in the Army. But that is a long-term answer. These divisions \nwould not be available for another 5 years, and would cost more than \n$40 billion.\n  The real crisis in our troop levels comes this spring. If the \nadministration is unsuccessful at getting an additional multinational \ndivision, they will have to send in another division of American \ntroops--some combination of Marines and National Guard--and we don't \nhave enough Active-Duty Forces to do the job. Without those \ninternational troops, we would have to notify reservists before the end \nof the month to ensure they will be available by spring. This means \nmore American troops in Iraq.\n  Even with this large contingent of Active Forces, close to half of \nthe troops now in Iraq are reservists, and they are under increasing \nstrain.\n  Already, more than 170,000 National Guard soldiers and reservists are \non active duty. Of those, about 13,000 have been on active-duty for at \nleast a year. Others return home from deployments, only to turn around \nand head overseas for another tour.\n  One reservist I recently spoke to had only 17 days off between tours \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. The average reservist spends 13 times longer \non active duty today than during the 1990s. Many reservists cannot \nleave the service when their original time is up, and are repeatedly \nsent on new overseas deployments. As our colleague Representative John \nMurtha recently said, ``the reservists are stuck. . . . In fact, we \nhave a draft. We cannot sustain this force.''\n  Even worse, our National Guard soldiers and reservists believe they \nare being sent to combat with substandard equipment. Reservists have \ntold me that they used Vietnam-era night vision goggles that obscured \nmore than they revealed, when the latest technology is being used by \nthe regular military. They tell me that they used outdated and less-\neffective flak jackets. They didn't have the latest body armor with \nbulletproof ceramic inserts. They tell me that they had to wait for 3 \nmonths for appropriate gear. Many units lacked armored Humvees, and \nneeded to hang flak jackets in the windows to protect themselves from \nattack.\n  While we haven't seen a fall-off in recruitment or retention in \nmilitary to some extent, the high unemployment rate is keeping these \nnumbers high.\n\n[[Page S12112]]\n\nBut inevitably, the hardship and back-to-back extended deployments will \ntake their toll over time. One soldier I recently talked to said that \nhe was leaving the Reserves to avoid being sent away from his new \nfamily.\n  Other families feel the strain of deployment both emotionally and \nfinancially. Many give up large civilian salaries when they go on \nactive duty. Some reservists are unwilling to tell employers of their \nmilitary service obligation for fear they will not be hired.\n  This was a conversation I had 10 days ago, in my own State of \nMassachusetts. It is against the law to discriminate against those who \nare part of the Reserves or the Guard, but they are finding increasing \nnumbers of people who have found their jobs eliminated as a result of \nthe declining economy. They have been trying to find employment. But \nthere is a clear pattern that those who are part of the Reserves or the \nGuard are not being favorably considered for employment.\n  As a result, some reservists are unwilling to tell employers of their \nmilitary service obligation for fear they will not be hired. It is a \nsad day for patriotism that service to our Nation is considered a \nnegative by employers.\n\n  Despite these hardships, the administration proposes to rely even \nmore heavily on the Reserves in the months ahead, increasing their \nproportion of the force in Iraq to close to two-thirds. Last week, the \nadministration announced that the tours of the 20,000 Army Reserve and \nNational Guard in Iraq could be extended for up to a year, even though \nthose brave of men and women had planned to be home months earlier.\n  Our National Guard soldiers and reservists love their country. They \nare proud of their military service. They want to do their job, and \nthey expect to be called to service when the Nation needs them, and to \nendure periods of difficult separation from their families.\n  But enough is enough. It is one thing to spend occasional months away \nfrom their families and their careers, but it is quite another to spend \na year or more in active duty, only to have further callups possible in \nthe near future. Under this administration, they are no longer citizen \nsoldiers. They are treated as full-time troops, and this cannot be \nsustained.\n  Much of these problems would not exist if the administration had \nabandoned its go-it-alone, my-way-or-the-highway foreign policy, and \nhad worked with the international community. If the administration \nhadn't rushed to war without the broad support of other nations, \ngreater numbers of their peacekeepers would have joined our effort.\n  The administration agreed to go to the United Nations earlier this \nmonth to obtain a new Security Council resolution, but it was a flawed \nrequest. The administration still refuses to share power on the ground. \nThey are asking the international community to share the danger, but \nother nations will still have no say in the future course of Iraq. We \nhave an all ``take'' and no ``give'' policy that does nothing to \nencourage other nations of the world to share the heavy burden of \nsecurity.\n  America, for the foreseeable future, will continue to represent 85 \npercent of the forces on the ground and suffer 85 percent of the \ncasualties. Indeed, our failure at the United Nations last week led GEN \nJohn Abizaid to tell the Senate Armed Services Committee last week:\n\n       The fight against terrorism is far from over. The enemy's \n     ideological base, financial networks and information networks \n     remain strong. Indeed, the demographic and economic \n     conditions that breed terrorists may be worsening and those \n     conditions are heightening the ideological fervor associated \n     with radical Islamist extremism.\n\n  It appears to me that statement is a fundamental truth; that is, in \nthe battle against terrorism, for us to assume that there is a limited \nnumber of volunteers out there for terrorism is entirely inaccurate. \nThe number of recruits who are going to be resupplying these terrorist \ngroups can go on and on and on.\n  For us to imagine that with a certain number of troops we will be \nable to eliminate these terrorists or we will be able to use the \nmilitary force in such a way that in Iraq can free ourselves from the \ndangers of terrorism is a failure to understand history and to \nunderstand, in terms of political challenges and ideological \nchallenges--such as the British learned in Northern Ireland, as we have \nseen in Kosovo, we saw in Serbia, and we have seen in the West Bank of \nIsrael--that we have to deal with the idea behind the terrorism to get \nto the root causes as well as to deal with the immediate challenge.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld says that if we can train the Iraqis to police \nthemselves, we can turn the country over to them. But in many areas, \nIraqi police are afraid to leave their stations for fear that they will \nbe killed for collaborating with Americans. Terrorists bomb police \nstations and assassinate those who cooperate with us, including \nmoderate clerics and members of the governing counsel.\n  All of us are profoundly impressed by the dedication, \nprofessionalism, and commitment of our soldiers in Iraq. They are \nwilling to endure hardships and dangers in Iraq to complete their \nmission. But they want to know, their families want to know, and our \ncountry wants to know that our policy makes sense.\n  Today that policy, I believe, is a failure, and American servicemen \nand women are paying with their lives. Before Congress writes a check \nfor an $87 billion failed policy in Iraq, we must know that the \nadministration has changed course and developed a realistic plan to \nprotect our troops, win the support and respect of the international \ncommunity, and achieve long-term stability and democracy for Iraq. It \nis time for the administration to convince Congress and the American \npeople that they have a plan to achieve these goals.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I had planned to come to the floor at \nthis hour and discuss the issue of vouchers for the District of \nColumbia. I will still go back to that topic. However, having listened \nto my friend from Massachusetts and the comments he has made about \nIraq, I will divert from the discussion of vouchers for long enough to \nmake a few points with respect to the situation in Iraq.\n  I will go back to my first experience with respect to the issue of \nterrorism. It happened shortly after I was elected. It was back in the \nearly 1990s. I was elected in 1992, and I took office in 1993.\n  One of my staffers who has foreign policy experience said to me: \nThere are some people you ought to meet.\n  I said: Fine. What is the subject?\n  He said: Well, there is something you ought to understand, and these \npeople will come in and brief you on it. I can't sit in on the meeting \nbecause my security clearance has expired, and I am not cleared at a \nhigh enough level to be present when they brief you. But I think you, \nas a U.S. Senator, should hear this briefing and understand what it is \nthey have to say.\n  So not really understanding what was going to happen, I had this \nbriefing take place in my office. Two officers from the CIA came in and \nsat down with me and talked about the attack on the World Trade Center \nthat occurred in 1993. As they outlined the forces behind that attack, \nthey gave me my first glimpse of international terrorism. I won't go \nthrough the details of what they said other than this particular \ncomment. They said: From our point of view, harsh as it may sound, the \nmain thing wrong with the attack on the World Trade Center is that it \ndid not kill more people.\n  I said: That is a very harsh judgment. What do you mean by that?\n  They said: Because it killed only six people and the physical damage \nwas cleared up in a relatively short period of time, the American \npeople have been lulled into a false sense of security that they are \nnot at risk.\n  Then they outlined the full description of international terrorism, \nwhere it was, how it operated, and what its goals were. We talked about \nthe religious aspect. We talked about the ideological aspect. I \nremember saying, as they described the way it was organized: Let me see \nif I understand exactly what you are telling me. As I understand it, \nthis is basically a church\n\n[[Page S12113]]\n\nwithout a pope; that is, there is no hierarchical structure with a \nsingle individual or group of individuals at the top calling the shots \nall the way down. Instead, it is a series of cells of people who have \nthe same ideological fervor but report to no one. They coordinate but \nthey are not controlled.\n  These two briefers said: Yes, Senator, you have that about right.\n  Now, we know there was a center for training for indoctrination and \nfor finance. It was run by Osama bin Laden, and it had as its \nheadquarters, physically, the training camps in Afghanistan. But that \ndoes not mean Osama bin Laden or any other central group controlled or \ncoordinated everything that was done worldwide. These are freelancing \npeople, in many respects on their own. They would send people to \nAfghanistan to be trained and indoctrinated. They would contact Osama \nbin Laden for funds. But they would develop their own operations and \ntheir own initiatives of how they would attack Americans. And \nthis early briefing made it very clear to me that their target was, in \nfact, Americans. It has always been fashionable to think the primary \ntarget for people in the Middle East is Israelis. No, the primary \ntarget is Americans. Israelis are seen as surrogates for Americans, but \nthe primary target is Americans.\n\n  The concern is that the Americans somehow have entered that portion \nof the world where these people have previously been dominant, and the \nAmericans have contaminated that world with American ideas. The ideas \nthat are so repugnant are the ideas of freedom, the ideas of equality \nfor women, the ideas of education for children in secular ways to teach \nthem skills so that they can survive in the modern world rather than \neducation that is concentrated entirely on indoctrination of ideas that \ngo back centuries if not millennia.\n  I came out of that first briefing very disturbed. I tried to ask \nthose who came to brief me if they could give me any timetable. They \nsaid: No, we don't know when this will erupt. No one does. But it is \nthere. It is growing. It is powerful. We are the target.\n  They also said--I remember very clearly--that the primary challenge \nto Americans would be in chemical and biological weapons. This was \nbefore the attempt was made to put a chemical agent into the subway in \nTokyo and raised the specter of that kind of thing being done in \nAmerica.\n  Well, the years went by. Nothing happened. I tended to forget that \nbriefing and put it aside. I focused, as many in this Chamber know, on \nthe issue of cyber-terrorism and attacks through computers. I held a \nhearing where I asked the CIA witness who appeared before us: Isn't it \nlikely that the next attack on this country will come in the form of a \ncomputer attack because you could do more damage to the economy if you \ncould shut down the computers than any other way?\n  The CIA witness said: No, Senator, I don't think that is true. It is \ntrue that you could do more damage to the economy with computers, but I \ndon't think that is where the attack will come from. The terrorists \nwant something dramatic that will show on television around the world. \nTelevision pictures of computers not working just won't cut it for that \npurpose.\n  That hearing was held less than 60 days before September 11, 2001, \nwhen we saw that particular prophecy--they want something dramatic on \ntelevision--fulfilled enormously.\n  What does that have to do with the issues raised by the Senator from \nMassachusetts as he is complaining that there is no plan in Iraq? He is \ncomplaining that the reservists are going to be held too long in Iraq, \nthat we have not leveled with the world, that we don't have enough \nallies in Iraq, that everything is going terribly wrong in Iraq. It has \neverything to do with what the Senator from Massachusetts was talking \nabout because the Senator from Massachusetts--and others like him who \nhave chosen to focus on difficulties that America is having in Iraq--\nhas turned his gaze away from the overall challenge of terrorism in the \nworld.\n  That which I was told in that first briefing is still true. The \nprimary target of terrorists throughout the world is Americans. The \nprimary purpose of terrorism around the world is to drive America out \nof the Middle East. And the lesson that those terrorists have learned \nfrom America's activities since the Vietnam war says that if they just \nkeep chipping away at our resolve, if they just keep bloodying our nose \na little bit, Americans will tire, Americans will decide to pull back, \nand Americans will withdraw. That happened in Somalia. That happened \nwhen the first al-Qaida attacks occurred against American Embassies. \nThat happened after the attack on the USS Cole.\n  We protested; we made a brief military gesture, and then, afraid of \nAmerican casualties, afraid of what public opinion might say in \nAmerica, we pulled back. Thus emboldened by that kind of history and \nparticularly encouraged by the rhetoric in the United Nations, the \nterrorist groups are convinced that if they can just hang on in Iraq \nlong enough to cause us to lose resolve at home, we will withdraw our \ntroops from Iraq, we will say it wasn't worth it, we will say, yes, \nthere was some faulty intelligence, and therefore we must correct that \nby withdrawing altogether, and then we turn not only Iraq but \nultimately the entire Middle East over to the terrorists. If we think \nwe have a lot of problems with terrorists now, just wait until they are \nencouraged by America's lack of resolve.\n  Of course, things are not going well in Iraq, according to the \nrosiest of scenarios. They never do in wartime. Think back to the other \nwars America has fought--more traditional wars to be true, but \nnonetheless wars that were for our survival. Did the Second World War \nstart out with a series of American victories? Did the Second World War \nstart out with a series of American bungles because we didn't have an \nadequate plan to deal with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor? There \nwas a great deal of second-guessing about Pearl Harbor. Franklin \nRoosevelt was heavily criticized for not having known Pearl Harbor was \ncoming, and some even suggested the conspiratorial theory that he \nlooked the other way in order to provoke a Pearl Harbor. I don't \nbelieve that for a second, but that was a part of the political \nrhetoric of the time. We did not, as a nation, respond to that \nrhetoric. Instead, we said: Let the books about what may or may not \nhave been done be written later; let us concentrate now on the task at \nhand. We refused to be distracted or diverted from the task at hand.\n  My primary challenge and my primary problem with the position \nenunciated by the Senator from Massachusetts is not that he lacks \npatriotism. There are those who say that by challenging him, I am \nchallenging his patriotism. I don't do that for a moment. It is not \nthat I challenge his motives or his integrity. I don't for a moment. I \nchallenge his focus. He is focusing on everything that might be \nchallenged as not going correctly and perfectly from the beginning, and \nhe is ignoring the big picture. He is ignoring the primary threat that \nhas been with us for decades, finally exploded on our shores on the \n11th of September, and has not gone away. And the question must be \nasked: If we in fact refuse to put up the money for the $87 billion \nthat has been requested, if we refuse to proceed with the effort to \nestablish a stable and free market-oriented economy and government in \nIraq, if we refuse to stay the course and pull back now, all in the \nname of some abstract sense of balance because the intelligence might \nnot have been perfect, what will be the result?\n  If we lose focus on the war on terrorism, the terrorists will win. If \nwe decide that short-term political advantage is more important than \nlong-term success, the terrorists will win. It has been said--perhaps \nit is a cliche, but it is very true--that America is better off \nfighting terrorists in the streets of Baghdad--yes, even if soldiers \ndie--than we would be fighting them in the streets of Detroit or New \nOrleans or San Francisco.\n  One of the reasons we have not had successive events to the bombing \nof the World Trade Center with airplanes and the attack on the Pentagon \nsince September 11, 2001, is that we have been focusing on destroying \nthe terrorist infrastructure, hunting down their leaders, and \ndisrupting their financial networks. We came to the conclusion that one \nof the key factors in doing all of those things was an attack on Iraq. \nOh, some say, you cannot prove any connection between the people who \nflew\n\n[[Page S12114]]\n\ninto the World Trade Center and Saddam Hussein and, therefore, you made \na mistake in going into Iraq.\n\n  Is there anyone looking at the results of what happened after we went \ninto Iraq who would say the Iraqi people would be better off if we had \nnot done it? Two-thirds of the Iraqis are saying over and over again in \nvarious polls and surveys that are done that their lives are better now \nthan before the Americans came in.\n  Those who say the intelligence was faulty should look at all aspects \nof the intelligence we didn't have. I will acknowledge that there were \nmany things we did not know until we got on the ground and perhaps the \nintelligence people should have told us. One of those, about which we \nhear nothing from the Senator from Massachusetts and others who hold \nhis same position, is that we did not know there was a holocaust going \non in Iraq that, percentagewise, was almost as great as the one that \nwent on in Nazi Germany.\n  Tom Korologos, a friend to many of us in this Chamber, is now serving \nin Iraq. He takes the congressional delegations that go there to visit \nthe mass graves. He said that is the first place they go, and it gets \nvery quiet very quickly.\n  We didn't know Saddam Hussein was systematically murdering, \ntorturing, and burying his people in tremendous numbers. The \nintelligence didn't tell us that. If we had known that, would it have \nsaid to us, stay out? If we had had the correct intelligence, would we \nhave said, oh, we cannot go in there if that is going on? There are \nthose who criticized Franklin Roosevelt for not focusing on the \nHolocaust during the Second World War and not doing more to prevent it. \nIf we had known that, I believe it would have made us go in more \nquickly and more powerfully than we did. Now we know.\n  There are those who say we have no plan for the reconstruction of \nIraq. Look at how badly it is going. Look at the number of people who \nare without power and water, and look at all of the damage that was \ndone. Then we realize from the reports on the ground that the lack of \npower, the lack of water, and the lack of services in Iraq was because \nof Saddam Hussein, not because of anything the American bombs did. Many \nIraqis are saying they have more food, more power, and more water now \nthan they did before the Americans came. But you didn't hear that on \nthis floor from people who are complaining that we have not solved all \nof the problems in the time we have been there.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I did not come prepared to talk about that. \nI have more I want to say on that in a more prepared fashion. I will do \nthat later in the week when we get into the actual debate over the $87 \nbillion supplemental.\n  The point I want to make--and I will make it again--is that the true \nstory of what is really happening in Iraq is not being told to the \nAmerican people. That is primarily because those in control of the \nmedia, for whatever reason, are not anxious to tell that story. Maybe \nthey consider it as not news. Maybe they consider it will not get as \nmany viewers to show the progress that is being made in Iraq, as \ncompared to what they are showing now, which are the difficulties that \nare being created in Iraq. I will talk about that also later in the \nweek.\n  I believe that when the truth comes out, when everything that is \nreally happening in Iraq is truly known, the American people will \ndiscover this is an effort of which we can be enormously proud. This is \nan effort of America at its best. We have not gone into Iraq for \nterritory; we have not gone into Iraq for economic advantage; we have \ngone into Iraq for the highest possible humanitarian motives, and with \nall of the difficulties and all of the problems, and all of the \nguerrilla attacks, we are daily increasing our ability to fulfill those \nhumanitarian motives.\n  Let me close with this final comment. I was in this Chamber when the \nproposal was made that America invade Haiti. I was opposed to that. I \nvoted against it. But we were told it was our duty to invade Haiti, not \nbecause there was an imminent threat from Haiti, not because Haiti was \ndeveloping any weapons of mass destruction, not because Haiti was \nharboring terrorists, not because Haiti was financing terrorists, all \nof which applied to Iraq. No, we were told we had to invade Haiti \nbecause there was an illegitimate President in charge; that that alone \nwas sufficient reason for American military power to be applied to the \nsituation in Haiti. Obviously, there was no military challenge worthy \nof the name awaiting us in Haiti. That was an easy decision to make in \nterms of a military activity.\n  Colin Powell, then a private citizen, along with former President \nJimmy Carter and Senator Sam Nunn, went to Haiti in advance of the \ninvasion and essentially talked the Haiti regime into abandoning their \nposts and leaving peacefully. Sam Nunn reported to those of us in the \nSenate after that experience what went on, and basically the individual \nwho convinced the Haitian leadership to give up without a fight was \nColin Powell. He sat down with the leader of the Haitian armed forces \nand convinced him that military chivalry did not require that he die at \nhis post; that he had a responsibility to his troops and if there was, \nin fact, a shootout with the American military, his troops would be \ndestroyed for no good purpose. The man, responding as one military man \nto another, agreed with Colin Powell and left the country.\n  We can look back on that event and discover the following: We \nreplaced a brutal dictator, much beloved of American conservatives, \nwith a man who had the claim of being the legitimately elected \nPresident. So technically we replaced a usurper with a President who \nwas legitimate.\n  I remember raising the question on the floor of what would happen if \nwe put this man in charge because his past history suggested that he \nwould become just as brutal a dictator. Oh, no, I was told, no, because \nthe Haitian Constitution does not allow him to run for a second term. \nWe will put him back in power with the military might of America behind \nhim. He will serve out the balance of his term, and then he will step \naside because he is a democrat who responds appropriately to democratic \ninstitutions and his constitution says he cannot serve a second term. \nYou need not be concerned that he will seize power in a way that will \nbe dictatorial and brutal to his people, Senator Bennett, because the \nHaitian Constitution forbids it.\n  The Haitian economy was in terrible shape at the time the American \nmilitary invaded Haiti, and we were told: We will have to do something \nabout that; we will have to rebuild Haiti, so we will turn that \nresponsibility over to the United Nations.\n  Now, not quite a decade later, looking at Haiti, what do we find? \nYes, we replaced a brutal dictator who was much beloved of American \nconservatives, with a brutal dictator who is much beloved of American \nliberals, and he is still there, the Haitian Constitution to the \ncontrary notwithstanding. He is going to be dictator for life, as long \nas he can maintain his military power.\n  How has the United Nations done in rebuilding Haiti? How has the \nUnited Nations fared in bringing democracy and prosperity to Haiti? The \naverage Haitian at best is no worse off than he was prior to the \nAmerican invasion. And at worst he is considerably worse off \neconomically. The island's economy has continued to deteriorate. \nBrutality, government murder, and assassination has continued to \nthrive. Nothing is better; a great deal is worse.\n\n  I am not suggesting that Iraq is a perfect analogy with Haiti, but I \nfind it interesting that people who are now complaining that we went in \nto remove a brutal dictator should consider leaving quickly and, thus, \nopen the door to replacement by a brutal dictator and turn the \nresponsibility of seeing that the country is rehabilitated over to the \nUnited Nations.\n  I think the track record demonstrates that the Americans do a better \njob than the United Nations and, indeed, if the United Nations is to \nsucceed, should we do that in Iraq, the only way they could do it, and \nKofi Annan and others realize this, would be to plead with the \nAmericans to provide the security forces, to provide the money, to \nprovide the expertise to see that it happens. If we are going to \nprovide that, we should be in charge of it.\n  Mr. President, now I return to the subject I came to the Chamber to \ndiscuss, and I will do that much more expeditiously than I would have \notherwise, having taken that time to respond to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n\n[[Page S12115]]\n\n  The issue is the question of whether or not we should allow a voucher \npilot program to be tested in the District of Columbia. Let me make it \nvery clear the implication of what I have just said: a voucher pilot \nprogram to be tested in the District of Columbia. By voting for this \npilot program and the funds that would support it, I am not voting for \nvouchers in Salt Lake City, I am not voting for vouchers in Cleveland, \nDetroit, St. Louis, or Los Angeles, and I am not voting for a national \nvoucher system. I am voting for a pilot project to be tested in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Once we have tested that pilot project and learn how well it works in \nthe District of Columbia, then we can have the debate of whether or not \nit belongs in other cities around the country. Then we can have the \ndebate as to whether or not it works.\n  Right now we hear all kinds of rhetoric about how terribly \nirresponsible it will be. Do we know? No. Let's test it. We can't just \nturn the whole school system in the District of Columbia over to \nprivate schools. No, we can't. Let's have a pilot program.\n  A pilot program to be tested in the District of Columbia does not \nthreaten public education across the country, does not threaten the \nbudgets of school boards around the Nation, does not threaten anything \nexcept those who are in love with the status quo.\n  What is the status quo in the school system in the District of \nColumbia? On a per pupil basis, it is wonderful. On a per pupil basis, \nmore money is spent in the District of Columbia than any other \njurisdiction in the United States. That sounds terrific. We are \nspending more money per pupil to educate kids in the District than \nanyplace else. We are spending about a third more than the national \naverage, and we are spending about two-thirds more than we spend in my \nhome State of Utah. From a spending per pupil point of view, nothing is \nwrong with schools in the District.\n\n  The only problem is the vast majority of kids who are being educated \nin those schools are not being educated. The vast majority of the kids \non whom that money is being spent are coming out of the system badly \nshortchanged. They can't read. They can't figure. There are whole gaps \nin their knowledge of things they don't understand.\n  There are those who say we are just not supporting them enough; we \nare just not spending enough money. The late Senator from New York, Pat \nMoynihan, once said half facetiously, but also to make a point, that if \nyou drew a chart with one line being spending and the other line being \naccomplishments, you could draw the inference that the more money we \nspend on education, the worse it becomes because, he said, as the \nspending line has gone up, the accomplishment line had gone down. He \ndidn't want to suggest there was a cause-and-effect relationship there, \nand I don't either, but I do think from that chart, particularly with \nrespect to the District of Columbia, we can understand that more money \nfor the present system is not the answer.\n  The people who are most concerned about the education in the District \nof Columbia have come forward with a request. By that I mean the Mayor, \nI mean the president of the school board, and I mean ultimately the \npeople most concerned. The parents of the children have said: Will the \nCongress please give us the opportunity to do a test of a pilot program \nin the District of Columbia to see if it works? We in the Congress, in \nthe Appropriations Committee so far, have said: Yes, we will give you \nthe money to test a pilot project in the District of Columbia.\n  From the rhetoric we heard in the committee and the rhetoric I expect \non the floor, one would think we had challenged the entire structure of \npublic education in America from the time of Thomas Jefferson forward. \nWe are not. We simply want to have the money to test a pilot project in \nthe District of Columbia, a pilot project which the leaders of the \nDistrict of Columbia and the parents in the District of Columbia have \nasked for. I think it is time we gave them what they asked for.\n  I am perfectly willing to hold out the possibility that after 3, 4, \nor 5 years of experience, if we determine that it is a failure, I will \nvote to cut off all funds for it. I am perfectly willing to stipulate \nthat I don't guarantee in any way that this is a silver bullet that is \ngoing to solve all of the problems.\n  I anticipate that at the end of 4 or 5 years, reading scores are \nstill going to be lousy in the District, mathematics skills are still \ngoing to be lousy in the District, but maybe, just maybe they will get \na little better as the District schools decide they want to compete \nwith those private schools that are educating the children a little \nbetter. I am assuming that will happen.\n\n  Yes, but we are only providing this for a small percentage of the \nstudents in the District of Columbia, and therefore we are \nshortchanging the others if it is going to work.\n  Again, we don't know if it is going to work. We are just providing \nmoney for a test of a pilot project in the District of Columbia to see \nwhat will happen. I believe, as I say, that it will demonstrate better \nthings and more important things. But I say to those who say you are \nnot doing it for all of the kids, it is like the old story which I \nfirst heard from an educator. I know it is almost a cliche now that \nothers have used it, but it is appropriate here, and it is the proper \nway for me to conclude this presentation.\n  People are walking along the beach and they are seeing on the sand, \naway from the ocean, starfish that have been washed ashore by a heavy \nwave, and the wave has then receded and the starfish are in danger of \ndying outside of the water.\n  One of the two picks up a starfish and throws it into the water, and \nthe other says: Why are you wasting your time? Look at all these \nthousands of starfish that are going to die out here and you can't make \na difference. It won't make any difference what you do.\n  And as the first one threw another starfish back into the ocean he \nsaid: It will make a difference to this one.\n  I suggest that there are many children in the District of Columbia \nfor whom this will make a very significant difference. Just because we \ncan't, here, make a difference for them all, we can at least make a \ndifference for this one, and for that one, and for the next one. Let's \nhave the courage to test a pilot project for the District of Columbia \nand see what happens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah for a very \nstrong statement. I think he said it very well. We hope this pilot \nproject will cause the competition that we want to see. We hope it will \ncause the public school system in the District of Columbia to improve. \nCertainly, at the very least, what we hope to see is 2,000 children who \nwill directly benefit, who will receive these scholarships. We hope it \nwill make a difference in their lives. That is what we think will, in \nfact, make a difference.\n  As he said in his little story that he ended with, it will make a \ndifference in these children's lives. If we can make a difference in \none child's life or two children's lives or, in this case, 2,000 \nchildren's lives, isn't it worth doing? I think the answer is clearly \nthat it is.\n  The situation in the District of Columbia school system--my colleague \nhas described that. Other colleagues have described how bad the \nsituation is. We can't turn our backs.\n  The Mayor has said he will not turn his back. He has tried over the \nlast several years to do what he can to improve the school system. He \nhas dedicated himself to this. He has set it as a priority. He has come \nto us and said this package that is in front of us today is an integral \npart of his efforts as Mayor of the city of Washington, DC, an integral \npart of his efforts to try to improve the lives of the children who \nlive in this great city. Frankly, it is the least we can do to have the \ncourage to follow his direction and come forward with this well-\nbalanced approach.\n  Again, it is a well-balanced approach. We take this new money, $13 \nmillion for new charter schools, $13 million for public schools, and \n$13 million for the scholarship program. It is, in fact, the right \nthing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo pages we received today from the Mayor. It is entitled ``Government \nof the District of Columbia, Executive Office of the Mayor, Myths and \nFacts About the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.''\n\n[[Page S12116]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      MYTHS AND FACTS ABOUT THE DC OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM\n [Opponents of the District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program\n     have cited several concerns and criticisms about implementing a\n  scholarship (voucher) program in the Nation's capital.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I think the previous comments by our \ndistinguished colleague from Utah merit a brief response. Again, I \nthank the chairman of the committee, my colleague from Ohio, for being \nso cooperative on this issue. As I often say, there is usually no \ndisagreement between us, and this is an unusual situation where we have \na slightly different viewpoint on this particular education measure.\n  In reference to what the Senator from Utah said, I would like to make \na couple of points.\n  No. 1, I think part of the argument which he presented was that \nopponents to this voucher plan fail to accept the fact that the Mayor \nof the District of Columbia asked for vouchers.\n  I want to again reiterate for the record that at no time, to my \nknowledge--and I have talked with the Mayor privately; I have heard him \nspeak publicly; I have been at any number of meetings; I have heard his \ntestimony; and I have read his testimony--did he come to the Congress \nand to the President to ask for voucher money. He came to ask for money \nfor help with his school system and said he would be open to a variety \nof different suggestions.\n  The administration said--and wisely when we passed Leave No Child \nBehind--no to vouchers for about 10 or 15 good reasons. It said: Mr. \nMayor, we are happy basically to help, but you have to take a portion \nof this in voucher money. The original proposal was, as I said, $10 \nmillion in vouchers only, broad-based vouchers, no help for public \nschools, no help for charter schools, and vouchers to private schools.\n  No mayor should be blamed for wanting to have additional money for \nschools--additional money which is not coming out of his budget, it is \nnot extra to us, it is not new money to the Federal Government, but it \nis new money to the District--no mayor should be blamed for wanting to \nhave additional funding. So the Mayor said basically: I believe in our \ncharter school program, and I believe in our transitional program for \npublic schools. So I will basically take the vouchers portion and make \nit the best I can.\n  If the Mayor has a different position, I would like to hear that. But \nthat is my general understanding. I have said that again. The reason \nthat is important is because part of the amendment that Senator Carper \nand I wanted to lay down to clarify is one of the major issues in this \ndebate, which is that some of us don't mind having a demonstration \nprogram if it is done in the right way for the District of Columbia. \nBut under no circumstances do we want every mayor in this country--or \nevery Governor or every school board president or every reform leader--\nto think they have to come to Washington to ask for new money or \nadditional money. The only way they are going to get it is if they give \na portion of it to private schools for private school vouchers. We \ndon't think there should be a Federal presence. I don't think there \nshould be a Federal mandate, and certainly no Federal contingency, and \nin this proposal there is.\n  That is not right.\n  The hiding behind and saying the Mayor asked, the Mayor asked--I will \ntell you the Mayor asked, just as every mayor in the country is asking \nfor help, and every Governor is asking for help, and every school board \npresident is asking for help. Why? Because we raised the bar pretty \nhigh on them. We said if 50 percent of your teachers aren't certified \nby 2006, they have to be certified. We said we realize that you don't \nhave a 100-percent graduation rate. By X time--not mandated but \nunified--you are going to have to improve your graduation rate or else; \nand your testing scores, or you are going to have to close your schools \nand reorganize.\n  I supported that accountability. I am not complaining that we did \nthat, although the responsibility now is very great on the local level.\n\n  I also supported additional funding that would go along with those \nreforms. Unfortunately, this administration passed a law that left a \nlot of the funding, basically, on the cutting-room floor. It is not \ngoing to get to the communities around this country and in the District \nof Columbia itself. It fell short by $21 million.\n\n[[Page S12117]]\n\n  Yes. The mayor asked for help, but he didn't ask for vouchers.\n  The second thing I want to say is that I agree with my colleague from \nUtah. That is one of the reasons I supported a middle-of-the-road, if \nyou will, principled compromise, suggesting to the administration that \nif we really want to have a demonstration project, then I would be--as \none of the cosponsors of this historic No Child Left Behind Act, not \nall Democrats, not all Republicans--most certainly interested in a true \ndemonstration program that lasts for 5 years where the money was \ndivided a third, a third, and a third between charter schools, public \nschools under improvement, and then, perhaps for children in failing \nschools to go into other opportunities in this District of Columbia, if \nthe accountability were there and if the measurements were tight enough \nto show that truly at the end of 5 years we are making any progress.\n  The reason I think that is compelling is because the situation in \nMilwaukee--the ``test'' in Milwaukee that has been underway for 13 \nyears with private school choice and private school vouchers--is still \ninconclusive. The taxpayers in Milwaukee and in the United States want \nto know whether their taxpayer money is resulting in better academic \nachievement. There is some evidence to suggest that parents are more \nsatisfied, and that is most certainly a worthy goal. We want parents to \nbe satisfied with their children's education as consumers. But that is \nnot the central focus of Leave No Child Behind. The central focus is \nacademic excellence through accountability so that we can have a school \nsystem with as much choice, as much opportunity, and as much \ntransparency for the taxpayer to see if we really get our money's worth \nthrough our school system.\n  If we are going to have a test, the amendment that Senator Carper and \nI offer would basically guarantee that at the end of 5 years we would \nbe able to say definitively there are voucher proponents who do not \nwant to know whether a voucher works or not because they are not \ninterested in the accountability portion. They are just interested in \nthe choice or the freedom portion. As long as people have choices, as \nlong as parents generally are happy, what does it matter if their \nchildren are failing? If they had real choices and if they could go \nanywhere with money and informed decisions, that might be something on \nwhich we could rely. But they do not have informed choices because the \nsystem doesn't allow for that kind of information. It is the same as if \nyou are going to buy a car or an appliance. The vouchers are sort of \nvouchers on the cheap. You don't really get a voucher to go anywhere \nyou want. Some of these schools cost $20,000. Some of these schools \ncost $15,000. The voucher they propose doesn't really give you that \nchoice. It is a false choice based on absent information.\n  But the final point that the Senator from Utah made warrants some \ncomments as well. I have been searching for a way to describe this and \nto answer. I actually found a better way than I could have written \nmyself in the newspaper last Friday. It is written by Jarvis DeBerry, \nan African-American columnist who has written on this exact question.\n\n  Why not save a few, if you can? That was the story spoken of so \neloquently by the Senator from Utah about walking along the sand and \nsaving a starfish and being questioned: Why are you wasting your time? \nAt least I can save one.\n  I actually happen to agree with that philosophy. But I would like to \nread this article into the Record because it answers it in a way which \nI think helps frame this debate.\n  It is entitled, ``Vouchers No Way Out of a Failing Society.''\n  It is not too long. I think I have the time to read it here.\n  He says:\n\n       If you had a child at a failing school, which person would \n     you look toward for help? Harriet Tubman or Frederick \n     Douglass?\n       Let me state the question another way: If you had a child \n     at a failing school, would your primary concern be helping \n     your child escape or making sure the schools were improved so \n     that escape would no longer be necessary?\n       I understand that the question has the effect of reducing \n     Tubman and Douglass to one-dimensional characters: One who \n     escaped slavery, then subsequently worked for freedom by \n     plucking slaves from bondage one by one; the other who also \n     escaped but then became famous for taking the podium and \n     urging the country's leaders to live up to the written \n     promise of freedom and justice.\n       But what about a better way to illustrate the crossroads at \n     which many black people stand? Is it better to take one's \n     promising child out of the system or stay put and make \n     sure that the system gets better for everybody?\n       Judging from the attacks that have been aimed at Sen. Mary \n     Landrieu by a group called D.C. Parents for School Choice, \n     it's clear that her opponents want black people to believe \n     that Landrieu is indifferent to black people's interests. \n     Why? Because she sends her children to the tony Georgetown \n     Day and hasn't supported a voucher program that would give \n     about 2,000 D.C. families $7,500 each they could use towards \n     tuition and private parochial school.\n\n  It further states:\n\n       . . . the woman leading the charge against vouchers in D.C. \n     is black, as is the woman who's pushing for them. The \n     argument that support for vouchers is the more authentically \n     black position is usually made by folks who aren't black.\n       And what those people usually fail to comprehend is this: \n     While deep down nobody wants a life of poverty and \n     oppression, escaping such a fate often brings with it its own \n     kind of guilt. Why do you think so many young black men who \n     come into money are determined to ``keep it real'' or that \n     poor black people destined for success are admonished to \n     ``Remember where you came from?''\n       Because solo success seems empty. After she escaped from \n     slavery, Harriet Tubman would have been perfectly justified \n     if she'd never returned to the South. But she made 19 trips \n     back and helped about 300 people escape. The fact that she \n     had to pull out her pistol to keep some escapees on track \n     used to make me think that the people at the end of her \n     pistol were cowards.\n       But now I wonder if some of them were simply eaten up with \n     guilt because they were escaping and their loved ones \n     weren't.\n       If D.C.'s voucher program is to give private tuition money \n     to 2,000 students, it does not seem to me to be anti-black to \n     worry about the fate of the other 66,000 or so students who'd \n     be left behind.\n       But would I try to keep an individual student from trying \n     to escape to a better school? No, I wouldn't. Even though \n     that person's departure would further weaken an already \n     struggling school, and I know vouchers for everybody would \n     not be possible.\n\n  This might sound like an argument for the scholarship plan, but I \nmake two points: One, this columnist is writing about moving children \nout of failing schools, not just any school. And he is talking about \nonly 2,000 slots, allowing children to move out of a system that is not \ntheir fault. That is not what this proposal does. This proposal is not \nlimited to children in failing schools.\n  Although some people argue we should not allow children to move out, \nI have not. I have argued that under certain carefully crafted \ncircumstances, children could move out while we are fixing the system. \nBut the problem with some voucher proponents is they focus on moving \nchildren out and not helping the children still there.\n  As I have pointed out in this debate, although the proponents say \nthey support charter schools and public schools, there is no guarantee \nthat money will be divided the way it is represented. They state their \nintention, but there is no guarantee until the administration, the \nPresident, comes forward saying there will be no bill because I will \nveto it if there is not help for the kids left behind. Then the great \nefforts underway for reform, as well as giving these few 2,000 students \nan opportunity to a higher performing school; we actually know it is \nhigher performing because we have accountability--the proposal pending \nbefore the Senate--continues to have many deficiencies.\n  Again, Jarvis lays out in this article a key question to the debate. \nWhile fixing the public school system--and it is a system that needs \nfixing--it is not to be unaccounted for. It is clear how much work \nneeds to be done in fixing that system, but it is being fixed. Some who \nhave been working for 25 years to try to fashion the public spirit and \nfocus for fixing the system--some, not all--have also come to the idea \nthat if there are a few spots in schools that are available for these \nchildren and it can be done in a fair way with the right kind of \nevaluation and the right kind of parameters, am I going to stand in the \nway of a few children getting an opportunity? Not this Senator. There \nare other Senators who have a different view.\n  But to say that because I am of that position, that I should be for a \nwhole system of vouchers, which is what this voucher proposal is, \nhiding behind a DC demonstration project, then absolutely no.\n\n[[Page S12118]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record. I \nhope it answers points raised.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Times-Picayune, Sept. 26, 2003]\n\n                Vouchers No Way Out of a Failing Society\n\n                          (By Jarvis DeBerry)\n\n       If you had a child at a failing school, which person would \n     you look toward for help: Harriet Tubman or Frederick \n     Douglass?\n       Let me state the question another way: If you had a child \n     at a failing school, would your primary concern be helping \n     your child escape or making sure the schools were improved so \n     that escape would no longer be necessary?\n       I understand that the question has the effect of reducing \n     Tubman and Douglass into one-dimensional characters: one who \n     escaped slavery, then subsequently worked for freedom by \n     plucking slaves from bondage one by one, the other who also \n     escaped, but then became famous for taking the podium and \n     urging the country's leadership to live up to its written \n     promises of freedom and justice.\n       But what better way to illustrate the crossroads at which \n     many black people stand?

Besides, as The Washington Post points out, the woman \n     leading the charge against vouchers in D.C. is black, as is \n     the woman who's pushing for them. The argument that \n     support for vouchers is the more authentically black \n     position is usually made by folks who aren't black.\n       And what those people usually fail to comprehend is this: \n     While deep down nobody wants a life of poverty and \n     oppression, escaping such a fate often brings with it its own \n     kind of guilt.

Not always. Though I would argue that the \n     converse is generally true.\n       What proponents and opponents of vouchers have to do now is \n     frame their arguments in a way that doesn't suggest that \n     those who disagree with them hate black people.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I also have some letters from other \nAfrican-American leaders in the District who are opposed to the voucher \nplan, most notably the DC Delegate to Congress, Congresswoman Norton, \nwho gives a long and detailed explanation of why she is opposed.\n  Particularly of interest in her letter:\n\n       First, the city has the largest number of public charter \n     schools per capita in the nation.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       Charter schools are so popular here with residents that \n     they have long waiting lists, and many are housed in \n     inadequate facilities and need federal funds.\n\n  I am pleased to say part of this proposal is, in fact, for charter \nschools, except we have no guarantee the administration would veto \nanything if charter schools were not in the proposal. We are waiting \nfor clarification.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2003.\n     Senator Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: On behalf of the home rule majority \n     in the District of Columbia--the majority of the City \n     Council, of the elected members of the DC School Board, and \n     myself--I am writing to ask that no appropriation for private \n     school vouchers be added to the DC FY2004 appropriations bill \n     but that our public and charter schools be funded instead. \n     Especially today when the District, like your state, carries \n     large unfunded No Child Left Behind mandates, we strongly \n     oppose funding private school vouchers with federal money. \n     Our opposition to vouchers matches the consistent position of \n     the congressional majority as well, and we ask that you \n     respect our strong position to the same effect. District of \n     Columbia residents are no different from the almost two-\n     thirds of the American people who oppose private school \n     vouchers or the 37 states that have turned down vouchers.\n       Please also understand that the federal appropriations \n     voucher proposal is not additional money at no cost to the \n     District. Too little attention has been paid during this \n     controversy to the $25 million in combined federal and local \n     per pupil funding that private school vouchers would cost the \n     DC public schools. We ask that Congress refrain from forcing \n     this expensive additional burden on the District today when \n     the city has already made $40 million in cuts to its public \n     schools. Moreover, the private school voucher authorization \n     is for five years while the proposed public school funds are \n     a one-time appropriation.\n       We believe that the recent close House vote is an important \n     indication of the national significance of the DC voucher \n     proposal. On September 5, after several votes had been taken, \n     House leaders pulled the DC bill because of the strong \n     possibility of losing. On September 9, 2003, the House passed \n     a voucher proposal by only one vote, and my earlier amendment \n     to eliminate funding for DC vouchers tied 203-203. On both of \n     these votes the majority of House Members favored removing \n     vouchers, but the vote was held open for an extraordinarily \n     extended time in order to get a Member to change his vote so \n     as to achieve a voucher majority. Members understood the \n     precedent for the nation they would be setting in voting to \n     include private school vouchers in any bill for the first \n     time.\n       We hope that you retain the urgently needed funds for \n     charter school facilities and public schools in the Senate \n     appropriation, but we oppose the three-sector approach that \n     where one-year funding for public and charter schools has \n     been included the public school funding cannot erase the \n     precedent that would be set by funding private schools. Mayor \n     Williams testified that his major objective was to secure \n     funding for vouchers. The belated response to offer some \n     funds to private schools came only after D.C. residents and \n     officials demanded that all funds be directed to charter \n     schools and public transformation schools.\n       As the city's only congressional representative, I am \n     completely confident in assuring you that the majority of \n     D.C. residents remain as opposed to vouchers as they were \n     when they strongly supported the Clinton veto of the D.C. \n     appropriation bill that included federal money for vouchers, \n     as proposed now. Far from supporting vouchers, District \n     residents responded to the recent vouchers bill by forming a \n     broad coalition, the Coalition for Accountable Public \n     Schools, consisting of many organizations of every variety, \n     elected officials and individuals. Hundreds of D.C. \n     residents, led by ministers and rabbis, recently held a \n     Public Funds for Public Schools Lobby Day in the Senate and \n     House to ask that vouchers be removed from the D.C. \n     appropriation. The most recent resolutions of the D.C. City \n     Council and the School Board and the individual letters from \n     members that you have received strongly repudiate private \n     school vouchers paid for which federal money.\n       It would be particularly ironic if vouchers were forced on \n     the District. The city out flanks every state in offering \n     three thriving alternatives to its traditional public \n     schools, all publicly accountable, as private schools are \n     not. First, the city has the largest number of public charter \n     schools per capita in the nation. Charter schools here are so \n     popular with residents that they have long waiting lists, and \n     many are housed in inadequate facilities and need federal \n     funds. Second, the District also has established 15 public \n     transformation schools separate from the D.C. system, and the \n     transformation schools have achieved the first ever \n     breakthrough in raising the scores of low income children and \n     children in low performing schools. This success is due \n     almost entirely to additional services for parents and \n     children alike, which, tragically, the city is now in the \n     process of cutting for lack of funds. Third, the District has \n     long allowed any parent dissastified with the neighborhood \n     school to send the child to an out-of-boundary school. Please \n     do not force on the District of Columbia what Congress has \n     not required for the rest of the country, especially \n     considering that the city's track record in establishing \n     publicly accountable alternatives to traditional public \n     schools is better than that of virtually any of the states.\n       I am enclosing a short statement elaborating my position on \n     vouchers. I ask that you vote against including any proposal \n     for\n\n[[Page S12119]]\n\n     vouchers in the District of Columbia appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Eleanor Holmes Norton,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Vouchers--Where I Stand and Why\n\n                       (By Eleanor Holmes Norton)\n\n\n            WHERE SHOULD FEDERAL MONEY FOR D.C. CHILDREN GO?\n\n       Two groups of D.C. kids qualify for the federal grants: our \n     children in charter schools and our low-income students in \n     transformation schools where significant test score gains \n     have been made for the first time. The Mayor and Council have \n     made sizable cuts in our schools this year.\n\n\n      WITH FEWER STUDENTS, WILL D.C. PUBLIC SCHOOLS BE BETTER OFF?\n\n       The most serious problem with the proposed vouchers has yet \n     to be discussed or to be taken seriously. Our traditional \n     public and charter schools will be hit hard financially if \n     the predicted 2,000 students exit in the fall. Our public \n     schools will lose a combination of $12,557 per pupil in D.C. \n     and federal funds because every school system must be funded \n     on a per pupil basis. That would be a blow D.C. public school \n     funding cannot afford today when it has already been cut.\n\n\n   MUST D.C. KIDS WITHOUT VOUCHERS GO TO ``BAD'' D.C. PUBLIC SCHOOLS?\n\n       I have always believed that a child is entitled to a public \n     school alternative to a neighborhood school that does not \n     work for that child. For decades D.C. has allowed children to \n     choose schools elsewhere in D.C. In addition, D.C. leads the \n     country in providing many alternatives to our public school \n     system. Our extraordinary 42 charter schools are the most \n     extensive in the country. They are the most important \n     innovation in the history of public education here. However, \n     their success has brought charter schools mile-long waiting \n     lists and facilities in churches and other crowded facilities \n     that need federal funds.\n       The best hope for our low income children are our \n     transformation schools that surround these children and their \n     parents with extra services, including tutoring and other \n     services for the children and special services for the \n     parents. All 15 transformation schools have significantly \n     improved their Stanford 9 scores. The extra services these \n     children get are available in none of the other D.C. public \n     or private schools. These are our poorest children, often \n     with the least motivated parents. The least any bill should \n     do is to encourage and fund the improvements we see for the \n     first time in these children. Instead, cuts will make it \n     impossible to fund many of the extra resources that are \n     producing these results or to quickly expand transformation \n     schools.\n\n\n                         WHERE DOES D.C. STAND?\n\n       When the Congress tried to impose vouchers, the city \n     preferred to see its appropriation vetoed rather than accept \n     vouchers paid for with extra federal funding. Council and \n     School Board resolutions continue to go well beyond the \n     insult of congressional riders. The city's resolutions, \n     including the most recent, specifically argue that federal \n     money should be spent on publicly accountable schools.\n\n\n              DO VOUCHERS WORK BETTER THAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS?\n\n       Although the proposed voucher program is called a ``pilot'' \n     by some, the results are already in on vouchers. The GAO \n     study of the Milwaukee and Cleveland vouchers found no \n     evidence of student gains. Ten years of independent, verified \n     research of public and private voucher programs in Cleveland, \n     Dayton, D.C., New York, Chile, and New Zealand have shown no \n     substantial academic gains.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Members of Congress may remember Parents United \n     for the lawsuit that compelled the city to correct safety \n     violations and which led to the development of a master \n     facilities plan for the D.C. Public Schools (DCPS).\n       The majority of our membership has overwhelmingly voiced \n     strong opposition to funding vouchers in the District of \n     Columbia. As the public schools continue to work hard to meet \n     the needs of all students and are held to higher standards, \n     federal dollars should not fund private schools that will \n     choose their students and are held to no standards.\n       As parents who are engaged and involved with our local \n     schools as well as at the citywide level, we also want to \n     bring to your attention a particularly urgent concern. Since \n     our schools are formula funded, 2000 fewer students leaving \n     DCPS at once mean a loss of $25 million. Recently, the Board \n     of Education took a vote to rescind negotiated pay raises for \n     all staff, part of a $40 million cut in DCPS. More losses \n     would cripple school funding.\n       On behalf of thousands of D.C. Public School parents, we \n     ask that you cast a no vote for this and any other voucher \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Iris J. Toyer,\n                                                         Co-Chair.\n                                                 Darlene T. Allen,\n      President, District of Columbia Parent Teachers Association.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. And from Kathy Patterson, who represents Ward 3, I have \nanother thoughtful letter. She states in her letter:\n\n       There are several other education reforms proposed \n     previously in the District of Columbia schools. I urge you to \n     consider one of these alternatives when the D.C. \n     appropriation comes before the Senate.\n       Pre-kindergarten education. Today, District of Columbia \n     policymakers allocate sufficiently locally generated tax \n     revenues to provide pre-kindergarten education for roughly \n     half of the 4-year-olds in the city. Many of us view \n     expansion of pre-K education to ALL district 4-year-olds as a \n     top priority for funding. . . .\n\n  Not one of the priorities, it is a top priority.\n  So, again, we can understand why voucher opponents would say why are \nwe so intent on taking this $10 to $13 million to spend on a voucher \nprogram, not limited to children in failing schools, saying it is a \ndemonstration project but not really having the evaluation mechanisms \nto support that contention when you could ask a broad range of liberal \nto conservative, the whole range of people, what would be the most \nimportant thing we could do for education in the District. It would be \nto fund pre-K and early childhood education. Why? Because we know the \nbenefits of quality early childhood education.\n  She goes on to say the second great use of this money would be \nadditional bilingual schools.\n\n       The Oyster Bilingual Elementary School provides an \n     excellent education to District children, with English and \n     Spanish-speaking teachers in each classroom. While Oyster is \n     located in my Ward, Ward 3, it serves a broad cross-section \n     of children throughout the District. The D.C. Board of \n     Education has fought to replicate the successful program in \n     other areas, an effort that requires additional funding. The \n     Congress could earmark $10 million in support of a second \n     bilingual elementary school within D.C. public schools.\n\n  I understand that school is about 40 percent Hispanic and Latino, \nperhaps 20 to 30 percent African American, and 20 to 30 percent \nCaucasian children. It is a diverse, excellent school with a wonderful \nbilingual curriculum. We could create one or two other models based on \nthat with this money.\n  Finally, she discusses elementary English and math instruction, \ndescribing a well-received former initiative of a previous \nadministration of a grant program through the Department of Education \ndesigned to provide reading specialists and math specialists to each \nDistrict elementary school to strengthen instruction in these key \nareas. The grant was not continued.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 9, 2003.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I write concerning the District of \n     Columbia FY 2004 Appropriations Bill and, specifically, the \n     federal funding proposed for education reform in the District \n     of Columbia. I appreciate your leadership on this as well as \n     other District issues.\n       I appreciate the attention that the Congress has given to \n     the educational needs of District children, and understand \n     the amount of work undertaken to craft a package of financial \n     support for education reform in the District of Columbia, \n     including support for the District of Columbia Public \n     Schools. Federal support for a reform initiative here, \n     provided over several years and encompassing rigorous \n     evaluation, can benefit not only children in the District but \n     school children across the country, and I applaud such an \n     approach. At the same time, I cannot support the allocation \n     of taxpayer dollars for private school tuition, particularly \n     when there are so many competing needs.\n\n[[Page S12120]]\n\n       There are several other education reforms proposed \n     previously in the District of Columbia Public Schools. I urge \n     you to consider one of these alternatives when the D.C. \n     appropriation comes before the full Senate. The $10-$13 \n     million proposed for K-12 scholarships could very usefully be \n     transferred for one of these initiatives:\n       Pre-kindergarten education. Today District of Columbia \n     policymakers allocate sufficient locally-generated tax \n     revenues to provide pre-kindergarten education for roughly \n     half of the 4-year-olds in the city. Many of us view \n     expansion of pre-K education to ALL District 4-year-olds as a \n     top priority for funding, and we have allocated dollars \n     specifically for this purpose in previous budget cycles. The \n     Congress could earmark $10 million specifically for a pre-K \n     expansion, with the same kind of rigorous evaluation that has \n     been discussed with regard to other alternatives.\n       Additional bilingual schools. The Oyster Bilingual \n     Elementary School provides an excellent education to District \n     children, with English and Spanish-speaking teachers in each \n     classroom. While Oyster is located in my ward, Ward 3, it \n     serves a broad cross-section of children from throughout the \n     District. The D.C. Board of Education has sought to replicate \n     this successful program in other areas, an effort that \n     requires additional funding. The Congress could earmark $10 \n     million in support of a second bilingual elementary school \n     within D.C. Public Schools.\n       Elementary English and math instruction. A well-received \n     initiative of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton during her tenure \n     as First Lady was a grant program through the Department of \n     Education designed to provide a reading specialist and math \n     specialist to each District elementary school to strengthen \n     instruction in these key areas. The grant was not continued, \n     but represents another very high priority that could be \n     brought forward again, and subject to evaluation to measure \n     its validity as an education reform alternative.\n       These are just three examples of education reform \n     initiatives strongly supported by District of Columbia \n     policymakers, and, thus, a good menu for the consideration by \n     you in your role as ranking Democrat on the appropriations \n     subcommittee, and by other members of Congress who are also \n     committed to education reform. Each of these options could \n     provide very useful research information of value not only in \n     the District, but throughout the country.\n       I urge one of these initiatives as an alternative to \n     private school scholarships as a signal of the Congress's \n     strong commitment to improved education outcomes for District \n     children.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Kathy Patterson.\n\n  Think about that, a Federal grant to make sure there was a reading \nspecialist and a math specialist at every elementary school. That grant \nwas not continued but, instead, we hear from this administration: No, \nwe cannot afford that grant but we can afford vouchers.\n  That is why many Democrats are concerned. That is why they are \npuzzled. That is why they are perplexed. That is why they are \ndisappointed. That is why they are angry at why we pushed for vouchers \nwhen there are so many other needs.\n  The voucher program, as proposed, is, again, not limited to students \nin failing schools. It seems to be open-ended. There are no evaluation \ncomponents tight enough to let us all know--which would be extremely \nrefreshing to me, and a real relief if I could know definitively--\nwhether these private school scholarships or vouchers work. Because if \nthere were, then we could stop spending our time arguing about it and \njust deal with the facts and move on.\n  So for that alone I have told people on both sides of the aisle--some \nopposed and some for--that it might be worth spending the $200 million. \nIt is not $40 million. It is $200 million because for 5 years you are \ngoing to have to have $40 million a year.\n  Now, if this Congress is willing to put up that kind of money in \nthese times, then I most certainly could support it. Again, if it were \ndone in a certain way, meeting the accountability standards of Leave No \nChild Behind, it would be worth maybe the $200 million to know \ndefinitively does the scholarship or the voucher make a difference.\n  We already know that poor children do better when they leave \ndysfunctional schools and go to schools that are better organized, more \ndisciplined, and have better instruction. You do not need a study or \nany money to tell you that.\n  What we do not know is if a poor child receives a voucher or a \nscholarship to go to a higher performing private school, basically, or \nthat child receives an opportunity to go to a better public school, can \nyou track to see if the child would do better in the public environment \nor the private environment? Or does the scholarship matter? Or is it \nthe quality of instruction, class size, et cetera? That is the verdict \nthat is still out. So it would be worth knowing that.\n  Again, it is not going to cost us $10 million. It is not going to \ncost us $40 million. It is going to cost us $200 million because we \nhave to have the comparisons of the students in the new charter \nschools, in the public schools that we are trying to follow as well--\nthe control groups--as well as the scholarship recipients or the \nvoucher recipients.\n  In addition, I was handed a note that the shadow Senator from the \nDistrict, Paul Strauss, also opposes vouchers. And he is with us today.\n  So again there are many, many respected leaders on both sides of this \nargument in the District. Senator DeWine and I find ourselves in quite \na quandary because we work with all these leaders. We respect them all. \nWe have been working with a broad group of leaders to move the District \nforward. But this situation deserves debate. It deserves to have the \narguments put forward. As I said, if we just come to the floor and, of \ncourse, lay our amendments down and argue and debate, tone down the \nheat and raise the light, then perhaps the District and the country \nwill be helped because we will understand some of the nuances relative \nto this debate. I hope we are making progress in that regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ENZI). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me respond to a few comments which \nhave been made by my colleague from Louisiana.\n  First, we seem to keep coming back to this issue about what the Mayor \nis for and what he is not for. Unfortunately, my colleague keeps \ninferring that the Mayor of the District of Columbia, Anthony Williams, \nreally, truly is not for this scholarship program. I think we need to \nget beyond that issue.\n  I have a letter that I have already entered in the Record. It is \nalready part of this Record. It is dated September 11, 2003, to me from \nthe Mayor. The Mayor states in part:\n\n       This initiative--\n\n  He is talking about this three-pronged initiative that we are talking \nabout, which includes the scholarship program--\n\n       This initiative was designed by District leadership for \n     District [students] and is not being imposed on the District \n     from outside, as some would have you believe. As mayor, I am \n     trying to make the best choices for the residents of this \n     city, and without a state government to which, under normal \n     circumstances, I would make this request. In this regard, I \n     believe it is appropriate for the federal government to act \n     on behalf of the nation's capital when the local mayor and \n     school board president seek assistance.\n\n  Further, in a document that I, a few moments ago, asked to be made \npart of the Record, which is entitled ``MYTHS and FACTS''--I will read \na portion of this--\n  Myth:\n\n       D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams is reacting to pressure by the \n     White House and Department of Education to start a voucher \n     program. . . .\n\n  Now, this document came from the Mayor's office.\n\n  Fact:\n\n       In February 2003, Mayor Williams and . . . [the] Chair of \n     the District Council's Education Committee brought their \n     ideas for a Three Sector Educational Initiative [which] \n     (includes funding for public and public charter schools, and \n     private school scholarships for low-income families) to the \n     White House and the Department of Education. The White House \n     and Department of Education agreed to work with city \n     leadership on its plans for improving education and expanding \n     options for District families.\n\n  Again, in both of those documents, Mr. President and Members of the \nSenate, Mayor Williams has said they initiated these ideas. They are \nthe ones who came forward with the plan. They are wholeheartedly in \nfavor of it.\n  I wish we could put this behind us. The Mayor is in favor of this \nplan. This is the Mayor's plan. He wants it. I think we should put this \nbehind us and quit talking about it. This is something the Mayor of \nthis city wants.\n  We talk about accountability. Senator Landrieu is talking about \naccountability. I would ask any of my colleagues who are on the Senate \nfloor\n\n[[Page S12121]]\n\nor back in their offices to look at the bill as it now stands to see \nwhether or not they think there is enough accountability.\n  Senator Feinstein came to the floor last week and added some very \nhelpful language to this bill, which makes the accountability very \ngood. It certainly improved the accountability. We thought we had good \naccountability in the bill before, thanks, again, to Senator Feinstein \nand her work in the Appropriations Committee, but her amendment added \nto the accountability and requires that these scholarship students take \nthe same--the same--test that the District of Columbia public school \nstudents take.\n\n  Again, we are going to be able to measure how well this program \nworks. We are going to see it year after year after year. The report is \ngoing to be there. The parents are going to see it. The taxpayers are \ngoing to see it. The residents of the District of Columbia are going to \nsee it. We are going to be able to measure it. We are going to be able \nto tell how well this program is working--the same tests, identical.\n  Second, the Feinstein amendment, which has been adopted by this body, \nwhich is a part of the bill, requires the Secretary and Mayor to select \nan independent entity to evaluate the performance of the students \nparticipating in the scholarship program.\n  That is just the highlights. I will not read and take the time of the \nMembers of the Senate. But the accountability is built into this bill \nnow.\n  If my colleague has other things she wants to put into this bill, we \ncertainly would be more than happy to entertain them and to listen to \nthem, if she has other ideas to improve that accountability.\n  Again, she talks about vouchers on the cheap. I would say, again, our \nstudies show, and what the HELP Committee's staff has come up with, \nalong with what the District of Columbia officials have come up with, \nis that clearly most of the availability slots are less than the \n$7,500.\n  But for those that would be more, I have no problem with including \nlanguage in this bill, if my colleague wants to do so, that would \nrequire any school which is going to take the voucher to say that is \nit, they couldn't go back to the parent and say, we want additional \nmoney. You are either going to take it as the entire payment or you are \nnot going to accept the student. I have no problem with language in \nthat area to do that. That would be perfectly fine with me.\n  It is important for us to remember how we got here and why the Mayor \nwants to do this and why those of us who are strong advocates for this \nproposal came to the floor to do it. When you look at the statistics of \nwhat is going on in the District of Columbia, they are actually \nshocking figures. How bad are the schools in the District of Columbia? \nThey are bad. Everybody knows that.\n  If you look at the figures, if you look at the SAT scores, if you \nlook at ACT scores, if you look at graduation rates, all of the \nstatistics--and they have been cited, and I will not take the Members' \ntime to do that--if you look at the dropout rates, if you look at \nreading scores, the proficiency scores, the math scores, they are \nshocking. To think that within blocks of this Nation's Capitol, we are \ntolerating a school system that is not doing any better for the kids, \nthese poor kids who live in our Nation's capital. It is wrong. It is \nnot right. We have an obligation to do something differently.\n  What we have before us today is something different. In a sense, I \ncould argue it is a radical proposal. But it is really not. It is a \nconservative proposal. It is a cautious proposal in a sense, because \nwhat we do is we say we are going to put more money in the public \nschools. We are going to take the Mayor's lead, and we are going to put \nthat $13 million more into the public schools, and we will entrust it \nto the Mayor because that is what he wants.\n  My colleague from Louisiana has been very interested in charter \nschools and played a major role in the development of them. The Mayor \nwants to try to expand charter schools so we will put more money for \nthem. We are not going to put all our eggs in one basket. We are going \nto try that, too.\n  But then we are going to try something else, something we have not \ndone before in the District of Columbia; that is, we are going to put \nsome public money, some Federal tax dollars into scholarships for 2,000 \nkids. That doesn't seem to me to be such a radical proposal. At the \nsame time we are giving more money to the public schools, at the same \ntime we are giving more money to charter schools, let's put $13 \nmillion, the same amount as for the other two, let's put in $13 million \nto create these 2,000 new scholarships for poor kids. Yes, you have to \nbe poor to qualify. Yes, let's keep in mind under this bill the way it \nis written as to priority, the priority goes to kids from failing \nschools. Let's create that as well. So we are not putting all our eggs \nin one basket.\n  We are not saying we are going one way. We are saying we are going to \ntry something else. We are going to try a balanced approach. We are \ngoing to try an approach the Mayor approves of. Let's do something \ndifferent. We are going to do something a little different, because we \nare not satisfied with the status quo, because we don't think what is \ncurrently going on in our Nation's capital is good enough for the kids \nwho live there.\n  I say to my colleagues, if you are satisfied with the way things are \nin the District of Columbia, then take this out of the bill. Go ahead. \nAnd when the time comes, vote for the Durbin amendment. Take this out \nand say: We are going to continue to do things the way we have done \nthem in the past. That is OK.\n\n  But if you want to try something different, if you want to try this \nbalanced approach, this rational approach, an approach the Mayor wants \nto try, then vote down the Durbin amendment, keep the bill the way it \nis, and let's move forward. Members will have the opportunity tomorrow \nto do that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Concerns Over U.S. Policy In Iraq\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, over the past year, I have come to the \nfloor several times to express my concerns about the U.S. policy in \nIraq. I have raised questions about what I have called the \nadministration's ``shifting justifications'' for this war. I have \nraised questions, both before and after the conflict began, about the \nadministration's plans for finding and securing weapons of mass \ndestruction, for ensuring that the international community is willing \nto share the burden of reconstruction, and--perhaps most critically--\nfor making certain our action in Iraq does not detract from or \nundermine the fight against terrorism. I still have many of the same \nconcerns today. I still am not confident that the American people have \ngotten all the answers and all the information they deserve.\n  Now many in the administration clearly do not want to talk about \nweapons of mass destruction in too much detail. They don't really want \nto talk very much about distorted intelligence. These things are \napparently old news in their view.\n  We fought a war of choice. We remain deeply involved. American troops \ncontinue to die. Some don't want to talk anymore about those initial \nchoices that were made. The President told the American people that the \nmain reason he went to war was to prevent Iraq from using weapons of \nmass destruction against us. Now, however, we are told that the real \nreason for choosing to go to war in Iraq was to tip off a set of, in \neffect, democratizing dominos that will change the face of the modern \nMiddle East, perhaps even the entire Muslim world, and then, in so \ndoing, defeat the forces of terrorism. I guess that seems to be the \ngeneral thrust of the argument.\n  I don't believe it is a good thing for our democracy or for our \nstanding in the world to switch arguments for a war in midstream. But I \ndo think this idea that the administration is putting forth now, after \nhaving moved from many other justifications, also deserves to be \nseriously and critically considered by this Congress, especially given \nhow often the administration is now invoking this idea that we are \ngoing to create a domino effect of democracy throughout the Middle East\n\n[[Page S12122]]\n\nby invading Iraq and setting up a government there.\n  Let us consider three propositions that have been repeated by the \nadministration in recent weeks. First, the assertion that Iraq is now \nthe central front in the fight against terrorism--not Afghanistan, not \nSaudi Arabia, not Southeast Asia, or east Africa or the central Asian \nstates of the former Soviet Republic, Mr. President, but Iraq as the \ncentral focus of the war against terrorism.\n  In support of this assertion, the administration can, of course, \npoint to the influx of terrorists into Iraq since the United States \nmilitary campaign began. The country was not, however, a hotbed of \nterrorist activity directed at American interests before that campaign. \nBut the administration appears to be making a much broader point based \non a sort of new domino theory for our new century. This time, instead \nof propping up dominoes threatened by the forces of communism, we are \ntipping them over in the name of democracy. By tipping the Iraqi \ndomino, we will change the entire Arab world--or perhaps even the \nentire Muslim world--or so the argument goes--and this in turn will \nlead to the demise of the terrorist forces that have attacked America.\n  In other words, what the administration is really saying is that Iraq \nis now the central battle in the fight against terrorism because this \nis where we choose to tip the domino.\n  How likely is it that the battle for the future of the Middle East or \nthe future of modern Islam is going to be fought at a place and time of \nAmerican choosing? Are we really that all-knowing or that all-powerful?\n  I agree that a battle of ideas and wills is underway in the region. I \nam not at all sure that this kind of battle can be influenced by U.S. \nmilitary action or a U.S. occupation--at least not in the way we would \nhope.\n  I am even less sure that invading and occupying Iraq in an attempt to \nestablish a beachhead for democracy will help us in the campaign \nagainst terror. It is that campaign against terror that we should be \nfocused upon. How likely is it that the plans and capacities of \nterrorists operating, let's say, in the Philippines or Indonesia will \nbe greatly affected by the outcome in Iraq? How about the forces still \npresent along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan? Will a blow \nfor democracy in Iraq wipe them out?\n  Most importantly, are we more secure? Are we on a firmer footing in \nthe fight against terrorism if we somehow convince ourselves that this \nis so? Are we on the right track when the Vice President refuses to \nacknowledge that we know of no real link between Iraq and the attacks \nof September 11, and then goes on to insist that the Saudis are good \npartners in the fight against terrorism, as he did on ``Meet The \nPress'' earlier this month?\n  There is something else happening here. I fear that there is. Are we \ngetting distracted, muddled in our thinking, when it comes to our first \nnational security priority? I fear that we actually endanger our \nsecurity and detract from the fight against terrorism if we all accept \nthis new domino theory as fact.\n  I can remember hearing a domino theory before, when American troops \nwere fighting a different war. It was an overly simplistic idea that \njust did not capture all of the different agendas at play in the \nworld--the nationalistic, the self-serving, and the corrupt, to name a \nfew. I am highly skeptical that this theory is any more useful or \naccurate today.\n  That earlier conflict also taught me that the right thing to do is to \nask hard questions. That is the right thing for the country and the \nright thing for our brave men and women in uniform. GEN Anthony Zinni \nmade a good point when he spoke earlier this month at the Marine Corps \nAssociation and the U.S. Naval Institute Forum. He said the following:\n\n       This is the greatest treasure that the United States has, \n     our enlisted men and women. And when we put them in harm's \n     way, it had better count for something. . . . They should \n     never be put on a battlefield without a strategic plan, not \n     only for the fighting . . . but for the aftermath and winning \n     that war. . . . Our feelings and our sensitivities were \n     forged on the battlefields of Vietnam, where we heard the \n     garbage and the lies, and we saw the sacrifice. We swore \n     never again would we do that. We swore never again would we \n     allow it to happen. And I ask you, is it happening again?\n\n  This is what was said by General Zinni in front of the Marine Corps \nAssociation of the U.S. Naval Institute. These are powerful words from \none of our generals. They remind us of the stakes, and they remind us \nthat the questions about our planning, about the wisdom and \nintellectual honesty of the ideas that guide it, are very much in order \ntoday.\n  I support our troops and I support their families who are very \nanxiously waiting for their return. That is why it is so important to \nget some clarity on the nature of our involvement in Iraq and where we \nstand in the fight against terror.\n  The President is, of course, right to reject the notion that one can \nbe ambivalent about terrorism. If we don't have moral clarity when it \ncomes to the fundamentally evil nature of acts that target innocent \ncivilians, that murder noncombatants on a grand and gruesome scale as \nsome sort of perverse act of political theater, then, of course, we are \nreally lost. There is no halfway point on this. There is no middle \nground. The battle against terrorism is worth fighting. It is a battle \nwe did not begin, and it is a battle I have supported and will always \nsupport wholeheartedly.\n  I agree with those who say that states that knowingly harbor and \nsupport our terrorist enemies are enemies themselves. That is why I \nvoted to support using our military might in Afghanistan to defeat the \nforces that attacked us on September 11. I believe we have to stay \nfocused on that goal. No evidence that has been presented to me \nsuggests a meaningful link between Iraq and the forces that attacked on \nSeptember 11--at least not prior to our invasion. Iraq was not the \ninevitable next battleground in our fight against terrorism. It was a \nbattlefield that the administration chose for its own reasons and now \nsees as the lead domino that will start the region on the path to peace \nand democracy.\n  Second, let us consider the assertion that the forces attacking \nAmericans in Iraq do so precisely because they know we are onto \nsomething--they know that we are bringing freedom and democracy to Iraq \nand therefore are striking a blow against terrorism.\n  What if they are attacking us simply because we are there, because we \nare present and vulnerable and easier to target in a climate of \ndisorder and in the context of a population that regards foreign \noccupation, understandably, with some suspicion, even fearing that we \nwant to install a client regime that will provide us ready access to \nthe country's oil?\n  Disorder creates opportunity. Consider the lead of a recent Chicago \nTribune article:\n\n       Smugglers on motorcycles ferry Arab insurgents across the \n     rugged desert from neighboring Iran, while former Iraqi army \n     officers guide anti-American Afghan veterans through \n     minefields left over from the Iran and Iraq war. Meanwhile, \n     militants disguised as Iranian merchants, religious pilgrims \n     and charity truck drivers bring in illicit drugs, weapons, \n     and explosives into Iraq to fuel the guerrilla campaign.\n\n  Of course, terrorist forces do not want us to succeed in Iraq. They \ndo not particularly want us to succeed anywhere. And America should not \nand cannot hesitate to take the steps we need to protect our security \nagainst terrorist threats. But what I find so disturbing about this \nassertion is it seems to suggest that bad news somehow vindicates \ncurrent policy--that if they attack our troops, we are getting it \nright, that the Middle East peace process breaks down because spoilers \nare threatened by the winds of democratic change blowing from Iraq.\n  Recently, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz explained away \nthe bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad and a holy shrine in \nNajaf by asserting that ``Terrorists recognize that Iraq is on a course \ntowards self-government that is irreversible and, once achieved, will \nbe an example to all in the Muslim world . . . pointing a way out of \nthe hopelessness that extremists feed on.''\n  In other words, what he is saying is, these attacks happen because we \nare on the right track.\n  This is a somewhat disturbing formula. Are we to interpret every new \nhorror as an encouraging sign that we have it right, that we are really \ngetting to the bad guys? If an increased terrorist presence and \nactivity in Iraq\n\n[[Page S12123]]\n\ntells us we are on track, what will tell us we are off track?\n  Associated with this is a third idea--the assertion that fighting \nterrorists in Iraq means we will not have to fight them closer to home. \nI heard the President say a number of statements like this.\n  If only this were true. Do we really believe that somehow we can \nattract all the terrorists to Iraq, bring them all in there and then \ndefeat them? Do we really believe there is a finite number of \nterrorists whom we can finish off by goading them into attacking us in \nIraq? Do any of us believe that right now terror cells are not plotting \nand planning and operating elsewhere in the Middle East, in East \nAfrica, in Southeast Asia, in central Asia? Global terrorist networks \nwould be a great deal easier to deal with if they could be contained \nwithin some national boundaries, such as Iraq, clearly identified and \nengaged. But this is simply not the reality we confront today.\n  We have to be honest with ourselves about what is really accomplished \nin these skirmishes in Iraq in terms of the long-term security of the \nUnited States. Unquestionably, there is value in helping the people of \nIraq take control of their own destiny. I am enthusiastic about helping \nthe forces fighting for democracy and accountability and human rights \naround the world to triumph because I believe their success will create \na more stable and just world for my children and my children's children \nto live in. And there are very real threats associated with allowing \nIraq to become a failed state--the same kind of threats I have warned \nare associated with weak states elsewhere, including weak and failed \nstates in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n  To tell ourselves this is the central front of the fight against \nterrorism strikes me as more dangerous self-delusion, and we cannot \nafford to be anything less than clear and focused and relentless in \nfighting the forces that attacked this country on September 11.\n  That task is complex. It requires military strength, but military \nstrength alone is not sufficient. It also requires international \ncooperation in sharing intelligence, disrupting terrorist \ncommunications, and planning and cutting off their access to financial \nresources. It requires international good will to sustain that kind of \ncooperation, and it requires a robust public diplomacy effort founded \non respect and honesty so we can win the trust of those who fear we are \nhostile toward Islam and the Arab world.\n  We have a lot of work to do, both in Iraq and in the fight against \nterrorism. This is as serious business as we will ever confront. Lives \nare on the line--the lives of Americans both in and out of uniform. \nRather than relying on simplistic theories and constantly shifting \njustifications, we need to be honest about the threats we face and the \nmeans to overcome them.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Wisconsin leaves the \nfloor, I wish to express my respect for him. He represents the State of \nWisconsin so ably. The one aspect I like about this Senator is you \nnever have to worry how he stands on an issue. He is always very \nforthright and public in his statements.\n  As the Chair knows, I spend a good deal of my personal time finding \nout where the votes are on our side of the aisle. With the Senator from \nWisconsin, there is never a problem. He doesn't say: Let me get back to \nyou. Or if he does say that, he does get back to me.\n  I have the greatest respect and admiration for the Senator. I have \nalso watched how he has been engaged in the international relations of \nthis country. I know how he has been engaged in issues that are \nimportant to sometimes only him, but sometimes that is all it takes to \nfocus the attention of the Congress on an issue in which he has been \ninvolved.\n  I had the good fortune when I served in the House to serve on the \nForeign Affairs Committee. I do not serve and have not served on the \nForeign Relations Committee in the Senate, but I do understand what an \nimportant committee it is. I say to my friend from Wisconsin, I feel \nvery good in that he is serving on this committee and, in effect, in \ndoing so is also representing me in his efforts to make sure the \nAmerican public is advised to what is going on in the rest of the world \nand our Government is involved, as it should be, around the world.\n  I publicly applaud and congratulate the Senator from Wisconsin for \nhis speech. I think he has, as usual, studied the issue and has made \nsome tremendous and significant points.\n  Mr. President, I have a statement I wish to give. It is my \nunderstanding the majority wants to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest for a vote later today; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Nevada, no \nrequest has been propounded thus far.\n  Mr. REID. I knew that, but I was trying to be as polite as possible \nto not get in the way of one being offered. So I will just go ahead \nwith my speech and at some later time I can give everyone a hint that \nthere is going to be a vote at 5:30. That is my understanding.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reid are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 5:30 today the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider the following nomination on today's Executive Calendar: \nCalendar No. 380, the nomination of Carlos Bea to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat following 2 minutes equally divided for debate the Senate proceed \nto a vote on the confirmation of the nomination with no intervening \naction or debate; further, following the vote, that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then return \nto legislation session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I recently \nreceived a call at home and the person was enraged that we were holding \nup judges. I explained to the person that that was not factual. I want \nthe record to reflect that tomorrow morning we will approve the 160th \njudge for President Bush. We have turned down three. So that is 160 to \n3 is what I told my friend from Nevada.\n  I have no objection. I further agree that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for the debate prior to the vote tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I further ask consent that at 9:15 a.m., on Tuesday, \nSeptember 30, the Senate proceed to executive session and an immediate \nvote on the confirmation of Calendar No. 381, Marcia Crone, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Eastern District of Texas, to be \nfollowed immediately by a vote on the confirmation of Calendar No. 384, \nthe nomination of Ronald White to be United States District Judge for \nthe Eastern District of Oklahoma; provided further that following those \nvotes the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend from Ohio. I was \nnot paying close enough attention. I thought he had finished the entire \nrequest. So I am not going to restate my remarks where I was talking \nabout the number of judges. I wanted to do that now rather than \nearlier, but my friend gets the point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided for debate prior to each of the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, during the course of our debate last \nThursday, we had the opportunity to share a number of thoughts about \nthe President's proposed voucher demonstration for the District of \nColumbia. I have appreciated the opportunity this last week to engage \nin discussions and negotiations, if you will, with my friend, Senator \nDeWine from Ohio, Senator Landrieu, and others.\n\n[[Page S12124]]\n\n  I know there has been some discussion today. I just arrived moments \nago. I want to revisit it a little bit. I think we have a vote in about \n20 minutes, but I want to take the next few minutes to review some of \nthat conversation.\n  I said on Thursday and say it again today, I think the measure as it \nis being amended on the Senate floor is a significant improvement over \nwhat was offered in the House and approved by the House. It was a very \nclose partisan vote. I think it passed by one vote. I appreciate the \nwillingness of the other side to at least engage in what I think were \ngood-faith discussions and negotiations.\n  Among the problems we found with the legislation that came out of \ncommittee to the floor was that eligible participating students need \nnot take the same tests that other District of Columbia students take. \nMost States around the country have adopted academic standards. Once \nacademic standards are adopted, most States are developing tests to \nunderstand the students' progress in math or science or English or \nsocial studies or other subjects. I understand the District of Columbia \nhas been involved in the process of developing their own academic \nstandards for their own students. I believe they are in the process of \ndeveloping tests which would reveal student progress.\n  In the meantime, I think they use a proxy test. If one of my \ncolleagues wants to correct me, feel free, but I think the District of \nColumbia uses as a proxy test the Standard of Achievement Test to \nmeasure how students are doing with respect to reading, writing, and \nmath.\n  In the State of Delaware, we adopted our standard in 1995 and began \ngiving Delaware State tests in 1998. We actually use the Stanford 9. We \nactually embed the Stanford 9 achievement test within the Delaware \nState test so we have some idea how Delaware students are doing with \nrespect to progress against Delaware standards on math, science, and \nsocial studies, and also because of the Stanford Achievement Test we \nhave an idea how we are doing with regard to the rest of the country, \nat least as it relates to reading and mathematics. But I believe the \nDistrict of Columbia uses only the Standard of Achievement Test at this \ntime. They are developing a standard of achievement test that will find \nout how local students are doing against the standards that have been \nadopted. They will now begin using it.\n  The reason it is important to make sure all our students are taking \nthe same test, whether they happen to be in a traditional public school \nor a public charter school or in a private or parochial school, that at \nleast once a year they take the same test, is we want to have some way \nof objectively measuring whether students are making progress and know \nwe are measuring apples and apples and oranges and oranges, and not \napples and oranges.\n  I believe that with the adoption by voice vote of the Feinstein \namendment last week, this measure has been amended so now students in \nparochial, private, traditional public schools and in charter schools \nhere in the District will all be at least taking the same test. That is \nan important step.\n\n  The next step, though, is for us to figure out what we do with the \nresults from that test. That is critically important.\n  What do we do with the results of those tests? We measure the \nstudents' progress toward the District of Columbia's academic \nstandards. It is all well and good if they take the same test, but what \nif we don't act on those tests or use those tests as most States, \nincluding mine, are using the test to help make sure we hold everybody \naccountable, hold schools accountable, school districts accountable, \nstudents accountable, educators accountable?\n  I used the example last week. I will use something similar to it \ntoday to try to make clear we are not interested in creating an \nadministrative nightmare for the parochial schools or the private \nschools. I don't know how difficult it would be for them 1 or 2 days a \nyear, a couple of days a year, for those schools to ensure the students \nattending those schools with vouchers take the District's test. On top \nof that, we are not interested in imposing on a private school or \nparochial school the accountability system that we find in No Child \nLeft Behind.\n  There is going to be an independent entity created here in the \nDistrict of Columbia if this voucher demonstration program is actually \nadopted and implemented. There would be an entity created called an \nEligible Entity. That is what it is actually called. As I understand \nit, that Eligible Entity would be responsible for, among other things, \nnegotiating with the private and parochial schools, making sure the \nstudents who receive these vouchers--actually, I understand the voucher \nfunding would come from the Federal Government through the Eligible \nEntity to the parents of the students. Then they would choose from \namong a variety of schools. The schools, if they were oversubscribed, \nwould have a lottery system.\n  We are not interested in seeing that the parochial and private \nschools that participate have to go through the No Child Left Behind \nrules. That is not what we are interested in doing. We do want to know, \nhowever, if there are 2,000 kids in this voucher demonstration program, \nhow they are doing relative to the District of Columbia's academic \nstandards. We want to know if we are making good progress with respect \nto those standards. We want to know if the various subgroups that we \nare responsible for tracking are doing well, just as we would similar \nsubgroups that are still in traditional public schools in DC or in \ncharter schools here in the District of Columbia.\n  The data for those students enrolled in private or parochial schools, \nhow well they do on their test scores, can fairly easily be aggregated \nand pulled out either by the Eligible Entity, collected by the Eligible \nEntity, or by some appropriate entity in the District of Columbia, and \nthey will know how kids are doing in the sixth grade and the seventh \ngrade to the eighth grade. They will know how they are doing with \nrespect to reading and how they are doing with respect to mathematics, \nif those kids were receiving their education on a voucher.\n  Again, we are not trying to make things unduly complicated or \ndifficult for the parochial or private schools. But if this is going to \nhappen, if we are going to try this experiment, I think it is in the \ninterest of everybody, including the kids, including us as \ndecisionmakers, to not impede the ability of students to enroll in a \nprivate or parochial school that is interested in participating. The \nkey, though, for us is to make sure that at the end of the day we have \ndata that we can look at as decisionmakers, and the folks in the \nDistrict of Columbia can look at, and they will actually know with some \ncertainty whether or not the students using those vouchers are making \nacademic progress using the same standards, the same kind of \naccountability that we are imposing on all the public schools, \nincluding the charter schools.\n  I don't think that is too much to ask. I cited last Thursday a quote \nfrom the President. I don't have it with me here, but this is what he \nannounced when he rolled out this proposal last July here in the \nDistrict of Columbia and talked about these kids. I will paraphrase \nhim: These kids have to operate under the same system of accountability \nthat other kids here in the District would be expected to operate \nunder, to which I would say terrific; I couldn't agree more.\n\n  In talking with one of the President's top senior people over in the \nWhite House last week, I was concerned to hear that one of the reasons \nwe couldn't have expectations for accountability for progress for kids \nusing these vouchers to go to private or parochial schools is because \nthere is kind of an expectation that given their backgrounds and the \nproblems and academic difficulties they bring to the school, we \nprobably couldn't reasonably expect them to make the kind of progress \nkids in traditional public schools or public charter schools would be \nmaking.\n  It reminded me that the President is fond of talking about the soft \nbigotry of low expectations. Boy, as soon as I heard those words, I \ncouldn't help but think that strikes of something akin to soft bigotry \nof low expectations.\n  We say we expect kids who are in some of these deplorable schools in \nthe District--we are going to take kids out of those miserably failing \npublic schools and put them in a parochial school or a private school \nand not expect them to perform in those schools or at least match or \nexceed the scores\n\n[[Page S12125]]\n\nin the schools from which they came. Something is wrong here. Maybe I \nmisinterpreted or misunderstood what was being said on the phone. I \nhope I was.\n  But the scores of those kids who get out of the environment they are \nstudying in should soar.\n  The last point I want to make is, if you have 2,000 vouchers to hand \nout to a pool of kids, where do you find the students to give them to? \nHow do you make that determination? As far as I know, we still haven't \nbridged our differences here.\n  Senator Landrieu and I, along with others on both sides--but more \nDemocrats and some Republicans--have contended that we ought to make \nevery effort to ensure that those vouchers, whether it is 2,000 or \nhowever many we have, go to kids in schools that are failing. There is \na question about whether we have enough failing schools in the District \nof Columbia in order to make sure that those vouchers are fully \nimplemented and exercised and used.\n\n  I am at a loss as to what to say on that. If the schools in this \nDistrict are half as bad as we have all heard, there are more than \nenough kids in schools that any of us would deem failing to use those \n2,000 vouchers for, and argue for more. There are 15 public schools in \nthe District of Columbia that are deemed to be failing by the standards \nthat are currently being used. I think that is going to change as this \nDistrict of Columbia test is developed and implemented in the next \ncouple of years.\n  In my State, we have been making great progress academically for the \nlast year or so. We have several times the number of failing schools as \nthe District of Columbia has.\n  I know in talking with Senator Landrieu in the last week or so that \nthe State of Louisiana has a whole lot more--just in New Orleans alone \nmany times more than 15--failing schools. There are going to be plenty \nof kids in failing schools here a year or so from now when it is up and \nrunning, if it is ever up and running--more than enough kids in these \nfailing schools.\n  I would suggest to our friends on the other side of the aisle and to \nthe administration that we shouldn't get bogged down on this point. Let \nus just give the vouchers to kids in failing schools, be done with it, \nand move on.\n  The last piece that is troubling--and it was troubling to us before \nbut even more so now--is when legislation comes to the Senate, whoever \nthe President is, whether it is a former President, President Bush, \nPresident Clinton, the former President Bush, President Reagan, there \nis a statement of administration policy that comes with regard to the \nlegislation. Senator Landrieu and I were trying to obtain from our \nRepublican colleagues and from the administration an agreement that \nwhat emerges from conference would actually be the language and the \nprinciples that were laid out that we and our friends talked about a \nwhole lot last week. We are asking for assurances from the \nadministration and our Republican colleagues that regardless of what we \nvote on or agree to on the Senate floor--and the whole package could be \nagreed to on the Senate floor, but when we go to conference with the \nHouse of Representatives, you just never know what is going to come out \nof the conference. We didn't want to be hoodwinked. We didn't want to \nenjoy a period of victory on the Senate floor only to find that what \nemerges from the conference of the House of Representatives is \nsomething that looks quite different.\n  Our concerns were underlined, maybe with an exclamation point at the \nend, when we saw the statement of administration policy.\n  I don't have it before me. Does Senator Landrieu happen to have a \nstatement of administration policy?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. President, I do have a statement of administration policy. I \nappreciate my colleague raising that issue. I know we are scheduled for \na vote at 5:30. We only have a few more minutes for this discussion.\n\n  But as my colleague from Delaware has stated, there is a statement of \nadministration policy that basically focuses on the $13 million voucher \nproposal. It does not mention charter schools. It does not mention \nadditional funding for traditional public schools.\n  We subsequently received a letter from Secretary Paige after this \ndocument was presented indicating that his Department is in support of \nthe three-sector approach. But the Senator from Delaware is correct. \nUntil we have a more definitive statement from the administration and \nour Republican colleagues, even if we accept that language in this \nbill, there would be really no confirmation.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Nevada wishes \nto say something before we vote at 5:30. I don't want to impede him.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague will yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. CARPER. Yes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I was really asking my colleague if Secretary Paige's \nletter--and, of course, my colleague from Louisiana just referenced \nthat letter--I wonder if my colleague would agree that the letter from \nthe Secretary is a pretty definitive letter. The Secretary is the \nSecretary and does represent the administration. So it seems to me that \nit is, in fact, the administration's policy to support the three-\npronged approach that we have been talking about here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Mr. CARPER. I am encouraged that the Secretary has promulgated a \nletter. I don't know to what extent it also bears an imprimatur of OMB \nand the senior folks in the White House. I am encouraged by the letter.\n  The point I am trying to make is that we are uneasy in the first \nplace about entering into some kind of agreement on the Senate floor, \nand then just seeing that dissipate in conference. In the \nadministration's statement they don't even mention the $13 million for \npublic and charter schools, which just further exacerbates our \nuneasiness.\n  Let me yield, if I may, to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, how much time remains before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nspeak for 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have to object. I am going to have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Right after the vote, we can agree to time, if the \nSenator wishes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask my colleague, Mr. President, is there a reason 4 \nminutes is a big deal?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. There is actually a reason. I am sorry. After the vote, \nwe would be pleased to have the Senator speak.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will take the remaining time.\n  I make a couple of comments. We call this a voucher bill, a \nscholarship bill, Pell grants for kids, GI bill for some of the most \ndisadvantaged students in the District of Columbia. What we are talking \nabout is the children. Are we going to leave children behind in \narguably one of the worst school districts in America or are we going \nto allow them to at least have a chance, a couple of thousand of them, \nto have a chance they otherwise would not have? Not only that, can we \nshow something that works? The current system in Washington, DC is not \nworking. At least give the kids and their parents a chance. Instead of \nputting the bureaucracy first, put the children first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12125-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12125-S12127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF CARLOS T. BEA, OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT \n                      JUDGE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 5:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider the following nomination which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Carlos T. Bea, of \nCalifornia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes divided for debate on the \nnomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are considering the \nnomination of Judge Carlos Bea to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit. He has had an exemplary legal career in \nCalifornia as a successful attorney and an impartial\n\n[[Page S12126]]\n\njurist, and will serve with honor and distinction on the ninth circuit.\n  After a distinguished 32-year career in private practice, Judge Bea \nwas appointed and subsequently elected to his current position as a \njudge on the San Francisco Superior Court in 1990. He was re-elected, \nwithout opposition, to the Superior Court bench in 1996 and 2002. In \nthis capacity, he has handled literally thousands of cases and presided \nover hundreds of trials. In fact, his colleagues and attorneys who \npractice before him have commented publicly that Judge Bea is at his \nbest when handling complex trials and difficult legal issues.\n  As with other nominees to the ninth circuit that this committee has \nconsidered this year, Judge Bea's colleagues overwhelmingly support his \nconfirmation to the Federal appellate bench. Thirty-seven judges of the \nSan Francisco Superior Court, who serve with Judge Bea and work with \nhim every day, sent a letter to the committee praising his skills as a \njurist, and recognizing his service on many of the Superior Court's \nmanagement committees. He also serves, at the State level, on the \nCalifornia Judicial Council's Advisory Committee on Access and \nFairness.\n  In addition to his Superior Court colleagues, California Supreme \nCourt Justice Carlos Moreno, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, and \nrepresentatives of the San Francisco Bay Area's Hispanic community all \nwrote to the Judiciary Committee, expressing enthusiastic support for \nJudge Bea's confirmation to the ninth circuit.\n  I join them in strong support for Judge Bea's confirmation and urge \nmy colleagues to do likewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tonight the Senate votes on the nomination \nof Judge Carlos Bea of California to the ninth circuit. In just 9 \nmonths this year, the Senate has confirmed 58 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees, which is more than Republicans allowed to be \nconfirmed for President Clinton in 4 of the 6 years of Republican \ncontrol. In fact, in just 9 months this year, the Republican led Senate \nhas confirmed the same number of judicial nominees as they allowed for \nPresident Clinton in all 12 months of 1995. I recall well that the \nfollowing annual session, 1996, Republicans allowed only 17 judicial \nnominees to be confirmed all year and not a single circuit court \nnominee was allowed a confirmation vote by the Senate.\n  I am glad that, in moving the nomination of Judge Bea to the ninth \ncircuit, the Republican leadership has chosen not to follow the \ndelaying approach they took on the nominations of two other Latino \ncircuit court nominees of President Bush, Judge Edward Prado to the \nfifth circuit and Judge Consuelo Callahan to the ninth circuit. The two \nDemocratic home State Senators support the nomination of Judge Bea and \nhave worked to expedite his consideration. I expect most if not all \nDemocratic Senators will vote to confirm him, just as they did Judge \nPrado and Judge Callahan and the scores of Hispanic nominees we have \nworked so hard to confirm over the last 11 years.\n  For 2 full years this White House refused to nominate any Latino for \nthe circuit courts other than the highly divisive and controversial \nnomination of Miguel Estrada. Then the White House refused to work with \nthe Senate to provide the information needed to consider that \nnomination. Ultimately Mr. Estrada asked that his nomination be \nwithdrawn so that he could devote his attention to his law practice at \na prestigious law firm. The Republican leadership delayed Senate \nconsideration of Judge Edward Prado's nomination for a month, then \ndelayed consideration of the nomination of Judge Consuelo Callahan. \nTheir false claim of anti-Hispanic bias among Democrats has been \nrebutted by the facts.\n  Democrats have voted to confirm 13 Latinos nominated by President \nBush to the Federal courts. Last Congress, Senate Democrats swiftly \nconfirmed six Latino judicial nominees chosen by President Bush--\nChristina Armijo of New Mexico, Judge Phillip Martinez of Texas, Randy \nCrane of Texas, Judge Jose Martinez of Florida, Magistrate Judge Alia \nLudlum of Texas, and Jose Linares of New Jersey. This Congress, \nDemocrats have unanimously supported the confirmation of seven other \nLatino judicial nominees--Edward Prado of Texas to the fifth circuit, \nConsuelo Callahan of California to the ninth circuit, S. James Otero of \nCalifornia, Cecilia Altonaga of Florida, Xavier Rodriguez of Texas, and \nFrank Rodriguez Montalvo of Texas. And today we vote on the nomination \nof Judge Bea.\n  Democrats supported the appointment of 11 Latinos nominated by \nPresident Clinton to the appellate courts, but Republicans blocked 3 of \nthem. Of the 12 Latino appellate judges currently seated in the Federal \ncourts, 8 were appointed by President Clinton and 2 by President Bush.\n  Republicans blocked six Latino nominees of President Clinton from \never receiving a vote--three for the circuit courts and three for the \ndistrict courts. Republicans blocked Enrique Moreno, who President \nClinton nominated to the fifth circuit; Jorge Rangel, who President \nClinton nominated to the fifth circuit; and Christine Arguello, who \nPresident Clinton nominated to the tenth circuit. In addition, \nRepublicans refused to allow votes on district court nominees, Ricardo \nMorado, R. Samuel Paz, and Anabelle Rodriguez. Although Republicans \ndenied confirmation votes for six Latinos nominated by President \nClinton, among the more than 60 other judicial nominees, Democrats have \nopposed only a handful of President Bush's judicial nominees.\n  Many Hispanic nominees of President Clinton were also delayed by \nRepublicans including immigrants Judge Rosemary Barkett and Judge Sonia \nSotomayor, as well as Mexican-Americans Judge Richard Paez and Judge \nHilda Tagle. Republicans filibustered Judge Paez's nomination for more \nthan 4 full years before finally allowing him a confirmation vote.\n  Like many of President Clinton's Hispanic nominees, Judge Bea's \nnomination is supported by the Mexican American Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund and others in the local community.\n  After today's vote, the Senate's tally is 158 to 3 with 158 lifetime \njudicial nominations confirmed and three of the most extreme having \nbeen blocked. This stands in stark contrast to the Republican record \nduring their prior 6 years of control of the Senate, when Republicans \nallowed the confirmation of 248 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees and blocked confirmation votes on 63 of his judicial nominees, \n20 percent. The historical record shows that in 6 years of control, \nRepublicans blocked votes on almost two dozen of President Clinton's \ncircuit court nominees, including five nominees for the fourth Circuit, \nthree for the fifth Circuit, three for the sixth Circuit, three for the \nninth Circuit, two for the tenth Circuit and two for the D.C. Circuit. \nIndeed, in the third and fourth year's of President Clinton's second \nterm, when they controlled the Senate majority and timetable, less than \nhalf of President Clinton's circuit nominees were confirmed. Despite \nthis history, Democrats held the first hearings and votes in years for \nPresident Bush's nominees to the fourth, fifth, sixth, tenth and D.C. \nCircuits. Only a handful of the most extreme or controversial nominees \nof President Bush have been blocked from receiving votes.\n  Despite the recent past when Republicans blocked so many more circuit \ncourt nominees of President Clinton, they seem determined to use \njudicial nominations for their 2004 election strategy. As the Los \nAngeles Daily Journal reported last week:\n\n       Despite the fact that judicial nominations barely register \n     on the public's radar screen, Republicans say the issue is a \n     good one for them. They plan to continue to push hard for \n     Bush's nominees, even in the face of firm Democratic \n     opposition. And, they believe, the more nominees that \n     Democrats block, the more the Republican charge of Democratic \n     ``obstructionism'' will resonate with voters, ultimately \n     paying dividends in the 2004 elections, especially in the \n     South. ``Our strategy has been: We don't want to see these \n     people go down, but if they're going to go down, the \n     Democrats have to hurt for it,'' said the [Republican] aide. \n     Bush himself has said he intends to make his judicial \n     nominees an issue in 2004. ``I'm reminding people of the \n     issue of judges,'' Bush said in a round-table meeting with \n     Texas reporters last week. ``I will elevate this issue as the \n     course of the campaign goes on.''\n  For 5 of the 6 full years that Republicans controlled the Senate \nduring the Clinton administration they did not allow 12 circuit court \nnominees to be confirmed all year. With Judge Bea's\n\n[[Page S12127]]\n\nconfirmation, Democrats will have joined in the confirmation of far \nmore circuit court nominees of this President than Republicans allowed \non average for President Clinton. In the years 1995 through 2000 just \nseven circuit court nominees were allowed to be confirmed per year on \naverage. This is the twelfth circuit judge confirmed in the last 9 \nmonths. This is in addition to the 17 circuit judges confirmed while I \nchaired the Judiciary Committee and Democrats made up the Senate \nmajority in 2001 and 2002. That totals 29 circuit judges confirmed in \nthe last 26 months.\n  Republicans do not want to discuss these facts and seem to hope that \nthe American public is not closely watching the actual work of the \nSenate since 1995. Far from being obstructionist, Senate Democrats have \nbeen accommodating in confirming the vast majority of President Bush's \njudicial nominees, 150 so far. Despite the very real Republican \nobstruction of dozens and dozens of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees, we have turned the other cheek in voting for President Bush's \nvery conservative nominees to seats kept open by Republican obstruction \nof President Clinton's nominees.\n  As a consequence, there are now fewer vacancies on the Federal courts \ntoday and earlier this year than at any time in the past 13 years. Had \nwe not created new seats for this President to fill, we would be at the \nall-time low vacancies of the Reagan administration. There are more \nlifetime appointed Federal judges serving on the bench today than at \nany time in American history. This is hardly the portrait of \nobstructionism that Republicans will try to sell to the American \npeople.\n  We have been fair but we will not be rubberstamps for this or any \nadministration. The stakes are too high and the Constitution is too \nimportant to do otherwise.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to comment on the nomination \ncurrently pending before the Senate, Judge Carlos Bea for the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  I was delighted to meet Judge Bea and his family at his Judiciary \nCommittee hearing earlier this month.\n  Judge Bea was born in Spain but has lived in California for most of \nhis life. He received both his undergraduate and law degrees from \nStanford University. He practiced law in the San Francisco area for \nover 30 years before he was appointed a judge on the San Francisco \nSuperior Court. He was elected to the seat in 1990 and has been \nreelected twice by the voters of San Francisco. He has also taught at \nStanford and Hastings law schools.\n  In addition to his accomplishments in the legal community, Judge Bea \nis also an Olympic athlete. He played on the Cuban national basketball \nteam during the 1952 Olympic games.\n  As a judge, he is widely respected for his keen intelligence. As one \nreporter noted, ``he has received high marks for his specialty, \nhandling complex civil litigation disputes.''\n  I intend to support this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non the nomination.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last week, in a hearing of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, I listened to some of the most disturbing \ntestimony I have heard in my entire almost 3 years now in the Senate. \nTestifying were members of a congressional panel investigating the \nsexual harassment charges raised at the U.S. Air Force Academy. The \nhearing, which is the third one this year on this matter, is a great \ncredit to its chairman, Senator Warner. There is no one in this body \nfor whom I have greater respect than the senior Senator from Virginia, \nnow in his 25th year of outstanding service to the State of Virginia \nand to our Nation. He and his colleague of 25 years, Senator Levin of \nMichigan, don't always agree, but they always work cordially and \nconstructively together to lead that committee and establish a \nbipartisan or nonpartisan relations way.\n  As former Secretary of the Navy, the chairman, who strongly supports \nthe services, clearly does not relish in this kind of critical review \nof one of the Academies. He does not evade it either. To the contrary, \nhe faced up to it responsibly and resolutely, which led to the hearing \nlast week and to another one scheduled for tomorrow. Last week's \ntestimony was provided on behalf of the congressional panel established \nby the Congress to investigate sexual misconduct allegations at the Air \nForce Academy. It was eloquently\n\n[[Page S12128]]\n\npresented by its chairwoman, the Honorable Tillie Fowler, a former U.S. \nCongresswoman from the State of Florida. Seven other members of the \npanel appeared with Chairwoman Fowler and answered a number of the \ncommittee's questions.\n  I cannot do justice to the outstanding work of this panel. In just a \nmatter of 2 months, they accomplished more than most Government \ninvestigations do in 2 years, or even longer. They probed more deeply, \nthey assessed the conditions at the Academy over the past 10 years more \ncomprehensively, and they reported more concisely, yet insightfully and \nincisively, than grander commissions with more time and costing much \nmore money. They have all performed a very important service to their \ncountry and this Congress, which established and charged them with this \nmission. They did so with great distinction, and I thank them.\n\n  While the report was excellent, its findings were by far the \nopposite. My colleagues will recall that our colleague, Senator Allard, \nin whose State the Academy is located, brought complaints from a couple \nof his constituents to the Academy and then to the Secretary of the Air \nForce when he was not satisfied with the Academy's responses. Senator \nAllard also deserves great credit for bringing those deplorable \noffenses to the Air Force Academy's leadership to deal with them and \nbring them to the attention of the full Senate and bring the larger \nspotlight of public attention on to these abuses.\n  As the first abuses were reported, other women, present and former \ncadets at the Academy, disclosed rapes and other sexual assaults \nagainst them, and Senator Allard has heard from a total now, at this \ntime, of 39 women. That number could be even higher by this time.\n  After denying there was a serious problem, first, by Academy \nofficials, then by the Air Force service and civilian leaders, and the \ngrowing number of victims making accusations of being sexually \nassaulted at the Air Force Academy and continued pressures of Senator \nWarner and Senator Levin and Senator Allard, there was finally forced \nthe necessary attention and investigations and initial actions by those \nwho have been accused.\n  The publicly reported experiences of women cadets were truly \nhorrible. In fact, twice horrible--horrible in the rape or the physical \nattack against them by another cadet at the Academy, and horrible in \nthe callous indifference or even putative responses of Academy \nofficials--toward them, the victims, not toward their alleged \nattackers.\n  Here is a brief summary of one first year female cadet's nightmare at \nthe Air Force Academy. This is a published report in the Washington \nPost:\n\n       Once not very long ago, [her] eyes shown bright when she \n     spoke of piloting airplanes. Few her age seem to be too \n     promising in a future in aviation. But now when the \n     conversation turns to flying, the former Air Force academy \n     cadet dips and stares at the floor. Ever since, she says, a \n     fellow cadet raped her a year ago in her freshman year at the \n     academy, her dreams of flying F-16s and her love of the Air \n     Force have crumbled. At age 18, she was a first-year cadet at \n     the academy. But even in that elite group she was one of a \n     very few in her class who had a private pilot's license. In \n     November, 2001, she was chosen as the year's first freshwoman \n     to fly an Air Force plane, roaring above the academy's \n     football stadium before a game. Her downward spiral began a \n     year ago when a cadet whom she knew slightly from the academy \n     raped her in her dormitory room, she said. What she did not \n     know then is that the same senior, once a star of the academy \n     boxing team, had been accused of sexually assaulting a \n     civilian in California 3 months earlier, as well as another \n     freshman cadet at the academy more than a year before that.\n\n  Thus began her dizzying fall from grace. Struggling academically and \nathletically, emotionally devastated, and she said, harassed and \nhounded by the academy leadership for minor disciplinary infractions, \nshe finally quit last Christmas. The Academy did not discipline the \nmale cadet for his alleged on-campus assault because Academy officials \nsaid evidence was lacking. However, it did expel and court martial and \nconvict him on the charge of forcible sodomy in California. He is now \nserving an 18-month sentence in a Navy brig.\n  While the female cadet remains angry about the sexual assault, she is \nangriest at her treatment by the Academy's majors, colonels, and \ngenerals who she said turned the tables on her after she reported the \nassault. She said some officers criticized her for acting \naffectionately with her boyfriend, who is a different person from the \nindividual who committed the rape. They said she was ``no lady'' and \nsuggested her behavior was generally promiscuous. It is not a problem \nof a few bad cadets, the woman now says, the problem is a few bad \ngenerals.\n  For a long time, after first denying there was a significant problem \nwith cadet sexual assaults at the Air Force Academy, the Academy and \nAir Force leadership questioned how extensive the problem really was. \nOn a couple of occasions during the past decade when students were \nsurveyed on the subject, an alarmingly high percentage of female cadets \nreported they had been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted during \ntheir 1 to 4 years at the Air Force Academy.\n  The response of the Academy administration was to claim the surveys \nwere not statistically valid, and in two instances, simply not to ask \nthat question in the next year's survey, just defies belief. Talk about \nsticking their heads in the sand. They really didn't want to know how \nbad the problem was at the Academy. Now we have a good idea.\n  One of the accomplishments of the Fowler panel was to obtain from the \nDepartment of Defense and inspector general preliminary data from its \nMay 2003 survey of female cadets at the Air Force Academy. Of 579 women \nin the classes of 2003 to 2006, 88 percent of all women cadets at the \nAcademy at that time responded to this survey: 43 cadets, 7.4 percent, \nsaid they had been victims of at least one rape or attempted rape \nduring their 1 to 4 years at the Air Force Academy. That is 1 out of \nevery 13 women. In the senior class, those women who had been there for \n4 years, 11.7 percent, or 1 out of 8 female cadets were raped or \nvictims of attempted rape during their 4 years at the Academy; 109 \nfemale cadets, 19 percent of all respondents, said they suffered one or \nmore sexual assaults during their years there. That is almost 1 out of \nevery 5 female cadets being sexually assaulted at the Air Force \nAcademy.\n  The Air Force response to this survey? They consider the definition \nof ``sexual assault'' used in the survey too broad and thus the \npercentage too high. That definition is a sexual assault is:\n\n       Cadet victim, witness, assistance, and notification \n     procedures--the touching of another without their consent in \n     a sexual manner, including attempts in order to arouse, \n     appeal to, or gratify the lust or sexual desires of the \n     accused, the victim, or both. Sexual assault includes, but is \n     not limited to, rape, sodomy, fondling, unwanted touching of \n     a sexual nature and indecent sexual acts the victim does not \n     consent to or is explicitly or implicitly forced into. It \n     is immaterial whether the touching is directly upon the \n     body of another or is committed through a person's \n     clothing.\n\n  That sounds like a clear definition of sexual assault to me, and the \nkeywords are ``without their consent.''\n  A couple of the other survey findings were that over two-thirds of \nwomen cadets, 68.7 percent, reported they had experienced sexual \nharassment, defined as unwanted and uninvited sexual attention in the \nform of ``sexual teasing, jokes, remarks or questions'' while at the \nAcademy--over two-thirds of women cadets.\n  Of the sexual assault victims, only 19 percent, less than 1 in 5, \nwere reported to the authorities, and of those who did report these \nincidents, almost half, 46 percent experienced what they called \nreprisals. That is how extensive these atrocities were if the Academy \nor Air Force leadership had wanted to know, but they didn't.\n  An internal Academy working group decided whatever problem did exist \nthere was attributable to, according to the report, among other things, \nthe definition of ``sexual assault'' in the Academy instruction book \nwas confusing, the training had little focus on the moral leadership or \ncharacter components of deterrence, and, amazingly enough, the self-\ndefense training given to fourth class women cadets often occurred too \nlate in the semester to be effective.\n  Let me repeat that. The self-defense training given to fourth class--\nin other\n\n[[Page S12129]]\n\nwords, first-year women--often occurred too late in the semester to be \neffective. In other words, the Academy didn't get around to giving them \nself-defense training before they were raped or sexually assaulted \nthere.\n  The Fowler panel, which is a document I commend to all of my \ncolleagues as being both incisive and insightful in its own right, and \nthe example of what an outside panel can accomplish in a brief period \nof time, stated other than the reassignment of recent Academy \nleadership and retiring the immediate past superintendent in lower \ngrade, the Air Force has not held any member of the Academy leadership \naccountable for a decade of ineffective action or, in many cases, \ninaction concerning sexual assaults and the culture that tolerated \nthem.\n  While the record is not complete, the evidence before the panel shows \nthe highest levels of leadership had information about serious problems \nat the Academy, yet failed to take effective action. It may be \nimpossible to ever fully know what the Air Force leadership knew or \nsuspected about sexual assault problems in the past 10 years, \nnonetheless the panel uncovered substantial information showing Air \nForce headquarters had serious and repeated indicators of a problem. If \nthe Air Force headquarters did not act on this information or did so \ntepidly, it should be held accountable for avoiding its responsibility \nand accepting sexual misconduct as an unavoidable condition at the Air \nForce Academy.\n  By contrast, when the general counsel of the Air Force, who had led a \nreview of a working group and a report issued by the same, stated that, \nin the words of the Fowler panel, despite the considerable evidence of \nlong-term knowledge by the Air Force and the persistence of sexual \nmisconduct problems at the Academy, the working group, headed by the \nAir Force general counsel, concluded that ``there was no systemic \nacceptance of sexual assault at the Academy or institutional avoidance \nof responsibility.'' In other words, nobody was responsible for all of \nthese atrocities occurring over the previous 10 years, probably longer \nbut not reported or documented before that time. Nobody in positions of \ncommand at the Air Force Academy or the Air Force itself is responsible \nfor any of this, and the Fowler report clearly documents instances time \nafter time over that decade where the top command knew, was informed, \nand failed to act, failed to follow through, replace, failed to \ncommunicate, failed to even hold meetings as frequently as required, \nfailed time after time in a myriad of ways to assume the responsibility \nthat they had for the young lives that had been entrusted to them by \ntheir families and who were recommended for those appointments by \nMembers of this body and the House of Representatives, who placed their \nfaith and trust in that institution, and not just let down, they were \nabused, their lives were emotionally devastated, their careers at the \nAir Force Academy were, in many instances, destroyed, and the \nperpetrators of these violent crimes, these rapes and sexual assaults, \nhave gone untouched, unsanctioned, and now are pervasive throughout the \nAir Force itself.\n\n  It is so bad, in fact, that in one survey taken by the panel, over 20 \npercent, over one-fifth of those cadets the Air Force surveyed didn't \nbelieve women belonged at the Air Force Academy. The Air Force Academy \nhas been accepting women since 1973--in other words, since before those \ncadets were born.\n  How did they conclude, based on the history, since the time they came \ninto consciousness, that women who are an integral part of the Air \nForce Academy ``did not belong'' there? How could they not belong any \nmore or less than male cadets?\n  The panel concluded, as one of them said, the culture at the Air \nForce Academy is infected. This is not a matter of misguided young \nadults. In fact, I know from my experience, as I am sure my colleagues \nhave had approximately the same experience, the young men and women who \nwe nominate for appointment to the Air Force Academy, or any of the \nservice academies, are extraordinary young men and women. At least in \nmy State of Minnesota they have to compete with other extremely well-\nqualified young men and women, and they are selected only after a \ncareful review process. They have to have distinguished careers in high \nschool with their curricula. I have not seen and I would not nominate \nanybody who has had problems with sexual misconduct or problems in \nunderstanding their responsibilities at such an academy to be \ninclusive, to be honorable, and that they report any violations cited \nby a commission of these kinds of actions.\n  According to the panel, what has happened--and I would concur from my \nown brief experience--is that the culture is infecting those cadets \nwith the wrong ideas, with the wrong views, and with the notion that \nthey can commit those acts with no consequence, that those who are the \nvictims are the ones who are going to be punished, and the honor code \nnotwithstanding, they should just look the other way or ignore what \nthey see happening.\n  What a terrible climate to create at this institution which is paid \nfor with taxpayer dollars and which is producing men and women who we \nare going to rely on to pilot Air Force planes and defend this Nation \nfor years to come.\n  As I said, the very distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner, deserves such enormous credit for \nspiriting this inquiry on the part of our committee. He has scheduled \nanother hearing tomorrow where the Secretary of the Air Force and the \ngeneral counsel of the Air Force are scheduled to testify. I look \nforward to that hearing so we can get answers to some of these \nunresolved questions, answers that better be found by the time this \nmatter has been concluded, because, otherwise, I have serious questions \nwhether the Air Force Academy is in a fit position to continue to \nreceive the young men and women of this country and whether, despite \nthe new leadership, it is so systemically ``infected,'' to use the \npanel's word, with these cultural biases that it is simply not fit to \ncontinue to provide training, especially the training of moral conduct \nand leadership, that these young men and women deserve and which our \nNation requires.\n  To be continued, I will report to my colleagues on my impressions \nafter that hearing, after receiving that report.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I remember when I was a young boy, right \ntowards the end of World War II, and there was a famous sign I saw at \nthe American Legion club in my small town in Iowa. The sign said, \n``Loose Lips Sink Ships.''\n  Later on when I went into the military and served in the military, I \nalways remembered that, especially when it came to dealing with \nsensitive information, that we had to be very careful, very cautious \nabout how we dealt with information which, if it got into the wrong \nhands, could be injurious to the United States of America.\n  I mention that because if what I have been hearing and reading about \nin the news media is anywhere near the truth, then we have a very \nserious breach of national security emanating from the administration. \nThis is no small matter, about the disclosure of the identity of a CIA \nagent, an undercover agent, the identity of whom could not only be \nharmful to that individual herself but to persons with whom she had \ncontact and dealings in other countries.\n  This July a noted columnist, Robert D. Novak, on July 14, disclosed a \ncovert operative's identity. That is a violation of Federal law. I am \nnot certain Mr. Novak knew that was a violation of Federal law. He \nshould have. He has been in this business a long time. But he printed \nthis disclosure. Where did he get the information? Mr. Novak said he \ngot the information from two senior administration officials. The story \ngoes on to say that:\n\n       Yesterday, a senior administration official said that \n     before Novak's column ran, ``two top White House officials \n     called at least six Washington journalists and disclosed the \n     occupation of Wilson's wife [who is the undercover agent who \n     was disclosed by Mr. Novak]. ``Clearly it was meant purely \n     and simply for revenge,'' the senior official said of the \n     alleged leak.\n\n  What happens when a disclosure like this goes out is that if agents \nin the field are on pins and needles about whether they are going to be \ndisclosed at some time, it is going to threaten our intelligence \ncapabilities around the globe. And in fighting international terrorism, \nthe most important thing we need is not the U.S. military, it is not \nbombers and missiles or a nuclear arsenal or nuclear submarines--in \norder to combat and beat international terrorism, what we need is good \ninformation. Intelligence--intelligence sharing with our allies. If our \nagents in the field--working undercover with the contacts, the kind of \nsources they need--if they believe their identity is going to be \ndisclosed in a newspaper column, what does that say to them about how \nthey can do their business? This threatens our intelligence-gathering \ncapabilities.\n  In fact, I can think of no single action that probably has done more \nto hurt our ability to fight international terrorism than this \ndisclosure of this undercover agent's name. I say that because it is \ngoing to cast a cloud over those who risk their lives daily who are \nalready out there gathering information to protect our country.\n  You might ask: What precipitated this? Why was this leaked? Evidently \nit was leaked because this person's husband had revealed the truth \nabout President Bush's deception in his State of the Union Message \nabout Iraq trying to get uranium from Niger.\n  This individual, Joseph C. Wilson, IV, former U.S. Ambassador, \npublicly challenged President Bush's claim that Iraq tried to buy \n``Yellow Cake'' uranium from Africa for possible use in nuclear \nweapons. Because Mr. Wilson had such good credibility when he put this \nout, it raised questions about whether the President was being \nforthright in his State of the Union Message. That is why one senior \nofficial said that clearly it was meant purely and simply for revenge.\n  We have the leaking of an undercover individual's name because her \nhusband had revealed the truth about the deception in the State of the \nUnion Message.\n  I don't know who these two individuals are in the administration, nor \nhow high up they are. Mr. Novak said they were two senior \nadministration officials. Another senior administration official said \ntwo top White House officials. Who are they? I guess I would have to \nask if President Bush is really serious about cooperating and finding \nout who it was that violated Federal law--a criminal activity \npunishable by up to 10 years, a felony. If the President is really \nserious, and he said he was here--Mr. McClellan, the President's press \nsecretary, said it is a serious matter and it should be looked into.\n  If the President is serious about cooperating and getting the truth \nout, ABC News ``The Note'' today posed these questions which I agree \nshould be answered:\n  Has President Bush made clear to White House staff that only total \ncooperation with the investigation will be tolerated? If the President \nhas not done this, why hasn't he?\n  Has the President insisted that every senior staff member sign a \nstatement with legal authority that they are not the leaker and that \nthey will identify to the White House legal counsel who is? If the \nPresident hasn't asked his staff to do that, why hasn't he?\n  Has President Bush required that all of his staff sign a letter \nrelinquishing journalists from protecting those two sources? If he \nhasn't, why hasn't he?\n  Has President Bush said that those involved in this crime will be \nimmediately fired? If he hasn't, why not?\n  Has Mr. Albert Gonzalez distributed a letter to White House employees \nrequiring them to preserve documents, logs, and records? It is very \nimportant. Has Albert Gonzalez distributed a letter to White House \nemployees telling them to preserve documents, logs, and records? If he \nhasn't, why hasn't he?\n  Has Mr. Andrew Card named someone on his staff to organize compliance \nwith these? If he hasn't, why hasn't he?\n  These are things the President has to do if he really and truly wants \nto cooperate, if he truly wants to get these two individuals \nidentified, and if he truly wants to have them prosecuted to the \nfullest extent of the law, which they ought to be.\n  This is not some obscure real estate deal out in the middle of \nnowhere. I repeat this is not some obscure real estate deal out in the \nmiddle of some wilderness area. This has to do with our fight against \ninternational terrorism and whether or not those who are charged with \nthe responsibility of collecting and gathering intelligence for us will \nbe protected and their identities protected. Or will we send a signal \nthat they are fair game, that someone in the White House can leak their \nname, that some columnist will print it in the paper and identify them \nas an undercover agent for the CIA?\n  This is serious business. The sooner the President of the United \nStates gets\n\n[[Page S12131]]\n\nto the bottom of it and complies--and, yes, as soon as we have a \nspecial counsel, an independent counsel, not from the Justice \nDepartment but a special independent counsel needs to be appointed \nimmediately to make sure that logs, records, and phone logs are not \ndestroyed, that computer files are not erased, and to make sure that we \nfind out who it was who did this to our intelligence communities. \nNothing less than a special counsel with full investigative powers, \nwith the full powers of subpoena, nothing less than that will suffice \nto clear this up and to assure the American people that the President \nand those close around him had nothing to do with this.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I haven't heard all of the Senator's statement, but what I \nhave heard leads me to believe after having read about this myself that \nwhoever did this is a traitor. Whoever leaked this is someone who has \nsubjected someone who is an undercover spy for this country to being \nmurdered. I think that it even puts the columnist at risk, Bob Novak, \nwho I like very much. I don't always agree with his politics, but he is \na person who has always been very good to me.\n  I am very happy that the Senator from Iowa has weighed in on this.\n  I also acknowledge that something should be done. It is my \nunderstanding that the majority and the Democratic leader, the ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, the ranking member of the \nDefense Committee, and the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee \nhave written a letter to the Attorney General and the President tonight \ncalling for just what the Senator from Iowa has asked--that there be a \nspecial counsel selected to go into this. Some of the things that the \nspecial counsel went into during the last few years are minor compared \nto the gravity of this.\n  I personally applaud and congratulate the Senator from Iowa for \nbringing this to the attention of the people of America.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Nevada. I am glad to hear that \nthose individuals have sent a letter to the President and to the \nAttorney General. I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle \nwill do the same. I hope the majority leader and the chairmen of those \nrespective committees will do the same and ask for a special \nindependent counsel.\n  The word ``traitor'' is not misleading. It is not trying to blow this \nout of proportion. I think the Senator is absolutely right. Whoever \nleaked this and put not only this agent at risk--think about all of the \ncontacts this agent had in other countries. Think about the chilling \neffect this puts on our intelligence gathering to combat international \nterrorism. The word ``traitor'' is certainly not going beyond the \nbounds.\n  I think the Senator is right. This is not some obscure little thing. \nThis is not some obscure real estate deal out in the middle of nowhere. \nThis affects the security and safety of our country.\n  I don't know who did this. But they have to be punished.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another brief comment?\n  We have had some espionage people who have turned on us in recent \nyears. They have had very high publicity. I think of the man in Kansas \nwho turned and became a double agent, so to speak, which led to the \ndeaths of American operatives in other countries.\n  Is this any less than that? It is on the same plane. Whoever did that \nis certainly guilty of crimes--not punishable by death, perhaps, as \nHanssen was subject to, but certainly punishable for many years in \nFederal prison. I appreciate the Senator bringing this to the attention \nof the American people through speaking in the Senate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12131-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12131-S12132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A CROSSROADS FOR U.S. ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last month a power blackout stranded \nmillions of commuters and shut down businesses in the northeast and \nmidwest. A few weeks later we saw the sharpest weekly increase ever in \ngasoline prices, just in time for Labor Day. And in Nevada, California \nand other western States, consumers are still smarting from energy \nmarket manipulation by Enron and other companies.\n  It is clear, as President Bush recently pointed out, that our Nation \ndesperately needs an energy policy.\n  But not just any energy policy. It must be the right policy, one that \nprotects consumers, safeguards our environment, and bolsters our \nnational security.\n  That means we must ensure the reliability of our electricity markets, \nmake a serious commitment to conserve energy, balance the interests of \nbig oil companies against the interests of consumers, and kick our \naddiction to oil from the Middle East.\n  Unfortunately, some of the ideas that seem likely to emerge from the \nconference committee on the Energy bill would make matters worse, not \nbetter. Although the need for a new energy policy is urgent, we must \nnot be stampeded down the wrong path.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency took a dangerous step in that \ndirection just a few weeks after the August blackout, when it relaxed \npollution rules for some electric power plants.\n  Allowing old plants to spew more pollution into our air is not the \nway to create a reliable supply of electricity. It is certainly not a \ngood thing to spew this into the air for my children and my \ngrandchildren. Instead, we must develop our abundant sources of clean, \nrenewable energy: water, the wind, the sun, and the heat within the \nEarth.\n  These resources can provide steady, reliable power that is not \nsubject to wild market swings, protecting consumers from shortages and \nprice spikes. Developing renewable energy also creates new jobs. And \nrenewable energy is made in the USA, not subject to the whims of \nforeign powers.\n  I am proud that Nevada is a leader in developing our renewable \nresources. By 2013, the State of Nevada has committed to produce 15 \npercent of our electricity from renewable sources. State initiatives \nlike this are important and good.\n  These State initiatives that require a certain percentage of \nelectricity is generated from renewable energy is spurring the growth \nof geothermal power in Nevada, California and other western states.\n  Our Nation also needs to set an ambitious but attainable goal for \ndeveloping renewable energy. Unfortunately, it appears that the \nconference committee will not include such a goal in the bill that will \nbe offered for our consideration.\n  We not only need goals for renewable energy, we need incentives that \nwill help us reach them.\n  Thanks to rapidly improving technology and tax incentives, \ndevelopment of wind power has exploded in the past several years.\n  I have introduced legislation to expand the production tax credit \nfrom wind to include geothermal and solar power. This bipartisan \nlegislation, co-sponsored by Senator Smith of Oregon and 14 others, \nwould also extend the tax credit so businesses could invest in \nrenewable energy with more certainty.\n  If we are serious about an energy policy that helps consumers and our \nenvironment, these provisions must be included in any eventual \nagreement with the House.\n  Another bad idea that is being promoted as the panacea for our energy \nproblems is nuclear power.\n  Nuclear power sounds okay until it is time to dispose of the \ndangerous radioactive waste. Then nobody wants the stuff anywhere near \ntheir community including those scientists who insist it is ``safe.''\n  As most of my colleagues are aware, Nevadans are fighting a plan to \ndump the Nation's nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, about an hour away \nfrom the fastest-growing urban area in the country, Las Vegas. We want \nour State to be a proving ground for renewable energy, not a dumping \nground for nuclear waste. That should also be the thrust of our \nnational policy for producing more electricity.\n  When it comes to fueling our cars and trucks, we have to kick the \nMiddle East oil habit. It compromises our national security and leaves \nconsumers vulnerable to market manipulations by nations like Saudi \nArabia, which contributed to the recent spike in U.S. gas prices by \nslashing exports.\n  Unfortunately, we can not drill our way to energy independence. The \nU.S. currently uses 25 percent of the petroleum produced in the world, \nyet we\n\n[[Page S12132]]\n\nhold only about 3 percent of the Earth's known reserves. We can not \ncreate more oil under the ground, and drilling in a pristine area like \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would do very little to boost total \nproduction.\n  There is a solution, however: We can do a better job of conserving \noil, with stricter fuel standards for all vehicles, including popular \nSUVs. By reducing our dependence on foreign oil, conservation will make \nus more secure; it will also help consumers and the environment.\n  Some people suggest that fuel cell technology will allow us to \nconvert our vehicles from petroleum to hydrogen, but that will not \nhappen overnight. In the meantime we need a clean way to produce \nhydrogen fuel. Burning fossil fuels to make hydrogen will still pollute \nour air and increase global warming. Clean, renewable energy should be \npart of the hydrogen solution.\n  As we move into the 21st century, we face tremendous energy \nchallenges, but we also have great opportunities.\n  We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil and make a bold \ncommitment to clean, renewable energy.\n  I hope the members of the conference committee will keep these \nprinciples in mind as they work to prepare a bill for our \nconsideration. Anything less would be a failure of vision and \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12132-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 STRENGTHENING CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate has a special bipartisan \ntradition of support for child nutrition, and I am pleased to promote \nthat tradition by joining with Senators Elizabeth Dole and Pat Roberts \nin cosponsoring S. 1549, which would expand children's access to the \nfree school lunch and breakfast programs.\n  This idea was first suggested to me by Senators Bob Dole and George \nMcGovern at a conference last year at Dakota Wesleyan College in \nMitchell, SD. Since our conversation, I have heard from a number of \nschools in South Dakota that many families whose children qualify for a \nreduced price lunch find it difficult to pay even the reduced fee. For \nsome families, the fee can actually be an insurmountable barrier to \nparticipation.\n  The main purpose of the school lunch program is to make sure that \nchildren have a reliable, nutritious lunch every day. If a lower income \nfamily can't afford to pay for a reduced price lunch, it follows that \nthey will also struggle to afford to provide a bag lunch for their \nchild.\n  S. 1549 has strong support within my State. The South Dakota State \nBoard of Education and more than two dozen local school boards have \npassed resolutions urging Congress to eliminate the reduced price \nschool meal program.\n  Expanding children's access to the free school lunch and breakfast \nprograms would unquestionably help promote better child nutrition in \nAmerica. I have cosponsored S. 1529 because I support that goal.\n  I also support other equally important child nutrition and food \nprogram improvements. For example, lowering the area eligibility \nguideline in the summer and child care food programs from the current \n50 percent to 40 percent would provide services to more children in \nlow-income communities. Increasing children's access to fresh fruits \nand vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and lean meats \nare important steps in improving overall health and reducing obesity. \nReducing the paperwork burden for participants in the Summer Food \nProgram would help make sure more children have access to healthy food \nwhen school is not in session. Making for-profit child care centers \nthat serve low-income children eligible to participate in the Child and \nAdult Care Food program, and additional improvements to other nutrition \nprograms, including food stamps, are long overdue.\n  Strengthening food support for low-income families is a sound \ninvestment in the long-term health and well-being of our children, and \neach of these initiatives is a worthy goal. Collectively, they are \ngoals, I believe, a nation as great as the United States should strive \nto achieve. However, the current budgetary climate makes any of these \ninvestments extremely difficult.\n  Just 2 years ago, record budget surpluses were projected that could \nhave been used to fund this priority. Today, the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, projects massive deficits for many \nyears to come, nearly 40 percent of which CBO attributes to the Bush \ntax cuts.\n  The President chose to make tax cuts his economic priority, \neffectively at the expense of investments in our children. The \nRepublican budget resolution, adopted earlier this year, made the same \nchoice. It prioritized additional tax cuts, while providing no \nadditional resources to the Senate Agriculture Committee for child \nnutrition or other improvements to food programs.\n  Unless we can take steps to reorder the priorities in the federal \nbudget, this means any costs resulting from improvements we might make \nin nutrition programs must be paid for by cutting the same programs or \nby increasing the deficit.\n  The administration has proposed to require schools to increase their \nefforts to verify participating families' incomes which would have the \nresult of generating budget savings. Sound reasonable? But the \nDepartment of Agriculture just released results from several new \nstudies that show increasing income verification does virtually nothing \nto reduce errors but will significantly diminish participation by \neligible children. The burden would be particularly acute for small, \nrural schools, like many in my state, that do not have the personnel to \nhandle the increased paperwork. We clearly should not attempt to feed \none group of children by forcing another group of eligible children out \nof the program.\n  I support harmonizing the school meal income guidelines with the WIC \nincome guidelines, as S. 1549 proposes. Under current circumstances, \nthis may take some time to achieve. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis to explore how we might make \nimprovements in our nutrition programs, including advancing the goal of \nS. 1549. I encourage my colleagues to take a serious look at S. 1549 \nand consider promoting this legislation as part of a comprehensive, \nlong-term strategy to invest in important national nutritional \npriorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12132-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Islip \nTerrance, NY.

The incident, in \nwhich anti-Hispanic epithets were spoken, occurred in a hallway of the \nschool.

I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12132-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12132-S12133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DIABETES PREVENTION & TREATMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be a sponsor with \nSenator Cochran of S. 1666, the Diabetes Prevention & Treatment Act of \n2003.\n  Today, our health care system spends 1 out of every 4 Medicare \ndollars on diabetes. Almost 200,000 Americans die because of diabetes \neach year, and almost one-third of Americans alive today are not aware \nthat they have the disease.\n  The tragedy is that with the simple preventive and treatment measures \navailable today, we can dramatically improve the likelihood that \npatients will never develop type 2 diabetes, and we can give good care \nto those who have type 1 diabetes. With only 30 minutes of walking a \nday and a healthy diet, people can reduce their chance of developing \ntype 2 diabetes by 58 percent.\n  Despite these innovations far too many citizens do not realize they \nare\n\n[[Page S12133]]\n\nat risk for diabetes or that they may already have the disease. Even \nmore shocking is the disproportionate manner in which diabetes affects \nchildren and communities of color. Our bipartisan legislation is \nintended to see that as many citizens as possible receive the \neducation, treatment, and care they need at the earliest and most \ntreatable stages of the disease.\n  The Diabetes Prevention and Treatment Act will apply proven methods \nof prevention and control throughout the country.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to be a sponsor with \nSenator Cochran of S. 1666, the Diabetes Prevention & Treatment Act of \n2003.\n  Today, our health care system spends 1 out of every 4 Medicare \ndollars on diabetes. Almost 200,000 Americans die because of diabetes \neach year, and almost one-third of Americans alive today are not aware \nthat they have the disease.\n  The tragedy is that with the simple preventive and treatment measures \navailable today, we can dramatically improve the likelihood that \npatients will never develop type 2 diabetes, and we can give good care \nto those who have type 1 diabetes. With only 30 minutes of walking a \nday and a healthy diet, people can reduce their chance of developing \ntype 2 diabetes by 58 percent.\n  Despite these innovations far too many citizens do not realize they \nare\n\n[[Page S12133]]\n\nat risk for diabetes or that they may already have the disease. Even \nmore shocking is the disproportionate manner in which diabetes affects \nchildren and communities of color. Our bipartisan legislation is \nintended to see that as many citizens as possible receive the \neducation, treatment, and care they need at the earliest and most \ntreatable stages of the disease.\n  The Diabetes Prevention and Treatment Act will apply proven methods \nof prevention and control throughout the country. Its success will \nproduce major improvements in health, and major reductions in diabetes-\nrelated costs.\n  The bill authorizes quality improvement grants for diabetes.

Mr. President, this November marks 10 years since our \nNation imposed the discriminatory law known as ``Don't Ask, Don't \nTell'' on the lesbian, gay, and bisexual patriots of our Nation. During \nthe past decade, almost 10,000 men and women have been fired from our \nArmed Forces simply because of their sexual orientation.\n  Many of those men and women have sought the assistance and advocacy \nof Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, SLDN, the Nation's only legal \naid and advocacy organization for those harmed by the military's gay \nban. In August, SLDN's executive director, C. Dixon Osburn, \ncommemorated 10 years of service to the organization he founded and the \nbrave Americans it serves. Mr. Osburn cofounded the organization in \n1993 with former Army CPT Michelle Benecke.\n  Under Mr. Osburn's leadership, SLDN has provided legal services to \n5,000 service members and obtained 35 changes in military policy and \npractice related to ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue, Don't \nHarass.'' Also under his leadership, SLDN's policy efforts have \nincluded obtaining new Pentagon and Service policies on anti-gay \nharassment, an Executive order on hate crimes in the military and an \nExecutive order providing, for the first time, a limited \npsychotherapist privilege in the armed forces.\n  Due in large part to Mr. Osburn's work, The Boston Globe has said \n``[SLDN] knows far more than the Pentagon about what reality is like in \nthe military and helps individuals caught in the mess.'' Deb Price of \nThe Detroit News also commended their work, nothing that: ``SLDN has \nrepeatedly forced the Pentagon not just to take notice, but to \nchange.'' And the Nation reports, ``It's amazing how much this small \nlegal-aid group has accomplished already.''\n  Mr. Osburn received the 1994 GAYLAW Distinguished National Service \nAward, and the 1998 Kevin Larkin Award for Public Service from the \nMassachusetts Lesbian and Gay Bar Association. In 1998, Mr. Osburn was \nnamed by the Advocate magazine as one of the Top 10 National Gay \nLeaders. In 2000, under Mr. Osburn's leadership, SLDN received \n``Organization of the Year'' awards from both the District of Columbia \nBar Association Young Lawyers Division and the International Lesbian & \nGay Museum of History. I am honored today to recognize his decade of \nleadership at the helm of SLDN and his unparalleled advocacy for our \nmen and women in uniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12133-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12133-S12134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF ROD L. BETIT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to a \nwonderful public servant, Rod L. Betit, who is retiring after a long \nand distinguished career in public health policy and administration for \nthe State of Utah. His leadership and integrity leave the Utah \nDepartment of Health with a long legacy of initiative and excellence.\n  In 1992, Utah Gov. Norman Bangerter appointed Rod as the Executive \nDirector of the Utah Department of Health making him the longest \nserving Health Director in the country. This appointment put him in \ncharge of more than 1,300 employees with an annual budget in excess of \n$1 billion. While serving in this position, Rod established himself \nearly on as an innovator, and someone who was not afraid to try new \nthings. He developed a priority management approach for the Department \nwhich significantly improved the Department's ability to make progress \nin areas such as childhood immunization rates, tobacco control, \nAmerican Indian health care system issues, youth suicide prevention, \nand health information systems development.\n  In addition, Rod has designed and launched a number of innovative \nhealth access programs by obtaining special federally-approved waivers. \nSome of his greatest achievements have included the nation's only \ncomprehensive public mental health system, a managed care program that \nfocuses on moving nursing home residents back into the community; and \nmore recently an initiative that uses a unique 1115 waiver under \nMedicaid that establishes a Primary Care Program that brings basic \nhealth coverage to 25,000 working Utahns whose employers do not offer \nhealth care coverage. More than 11,000 adults had enrolled in the first \nsix months of this program. United States Health and Human Services \nSecretary Tommy Thompson had this to say about the new program: ``I am \napproving this waiver over the objections of my staff because I see \ngreat potential for this approach to help reduce the number of working \nuninsured throughout the country once its success has been demonstrated \nby Utah.''\n  Rod's leadership abilities and vision prompted Utah Gov. Michael \nLeavitt to call on him for additional service in 1995 when he asked him \nto assume the role of the Executive Director of the Utah Department of \nHuman Services while retaining his position with the Department of \nHealth. This is the only time in Utah history that one person has been \nappointed to oversee two key agencies in state government. The \nDepartment of Human Services was facing some very difficult challenges \nat that time, and Rod, in true capable and courageous fashion, was able \nto step in\n\n[[Page S12134]]\n\nand make a difference. He solved some key problems and was able to \nreturn to running only the Department of Health 2 years later.\n  Prior to assuming the role of Executive Director in 1992, Rod served \nas the Utah Director of the Division of Health Care Financing. In this \nposition he was responsible for all facets of the state Medicaid \nprogram and the Utah Medical Assistance Program. Rod's experience \ndirecting the Alaska Medical Assistance Program for 12 years before \ncoming to Utah had served him well, and established him as a capable \nleader.\n  Rod has not only made a name for himself in Utah he is widely \nrespected throughout the Nation. He is frequently called upon to \nrepresent the States' perspectives before Federal officials. He is a \nrecognized expert on Medicaid and health care financing, and is widely \nviewed as an expert on health care reform.\n  Rod is returning to his native Alaska to become the President and CEO \nof the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association. He will also \nbe able to pursue his love of King salmon fishing, and to be near his \nfamily. He will be deeply missed throughout Utah for his expertise, \ncommitment and leadership. I want to commend Rod for the exemplary \nservice he has given to the Utah Department of Health, Utah State \nGovernment, and to our nation. He is not only a truly great public \nservant, he is a loving husband and father to his wife, Ellen, and \ntheir three children. I wish Rod the very best life has to offer and \npray for his continued good health, success, and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12134-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A TRIBUTE TO TENNIS GREAT ALTHEA GIBSON\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, some 40 years ago while investigating a \ncase near the intersection of US 15 and State Highway 26, up a dirt \nroad, there were located four shacks. One was the home of Ms. Elizabeth \nGibson. I asked her if she had ever heard of Althea Gibson. She pointed \nto the shack and said she was born right there in that shack. That was \nthe first time I had ever heard that Althea Gibson was a native South \nCarolinian.\n  Of course, she had to leave South Carolina to become a success. The \ngood news now is that you can stay in the State and succeed. Over the \nweekend we lost Althea Gibson. We lost this championship athlete at the \nage of 76. USA TODAY has an interesting article of her success, and I \nask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Tennis Trailblazer Althea Gibson Dead at 76\n\n                            (By Doug Smith)\n\n       She took the snap from center, faded back like a seasoned \n     quarterback and then threw a perfect spiral on target to a \n     receiver 35 yards down field. Althea Gibson was 58 at the \n     time, testing her arm in a friendly game of touch football in \n     Washington, D.C.\n       ``I'm a little rusty, but I can still chuck it,'' she said.\n       In her younger days, Gibson, who was 76 when she died \n     Sunday of respiratory failure at an East Orange, N.J., \n     hospital, played tennis with the same unexpected boldness and \n     talent.\n       A trailblazer for African-Americans as well as women, \n     Gibson fulfilled her dreams of becoming a great tennis \n     champion despite the racial barriers of that era. She won 11 \n     major titles, including the 1956 French Open, Wimbledon \n     (1957-58) and U.S. Open (1957-58) and was the first African-\n     American to play in Grand Slam events.\n       She was named Associated Press and Babe Zaharias Woman \n     Athlete of the Year in 1957-58 and was honored with a New \n     York ticker-tape parade in July 1957 after becoming the first \n     African-American to win Wimbledon.\n       Gibson won her first tournament at 15, becoming the New \n     York State black girls' singles tennis champion. Boxer Sugar \n     Ray Robinson helped pay for her travels.\n       ``We all know people who influence us and, if we are lucky, \n     we meet a few in our lives who improve us,'' tennis legend \n     Billie Jean King said. ``Althea Gibson improved my life and \n     the lives of countless others. She was the first to break so \n     many barriers and from the first time I saw her play, when I \n     was 13 years old, she became, and remained, one of my true \n     heroines.\n       ``It was truly an inspiration for me to watch her overcome \n     adversity,`` King added. ``Althea did a lot for people in \n     tennis, but she did even more for people in general. In a \n     tribute, Arthur Ashe once said, 'Politically, Althea's \n     acceptance was crucial to my own. It made it easer for other \n     blacks to follow.' ''\n       Zina Garrison, a 1990 Wimbledon finalist, Lori McNeil, \n     Leslie Allen and Serena and Venus Williams say they were \n     inspired by Gibson's success. Gibson had lived as a recluse \n     in her East Orange home since suffering a stroke in 1994. \n     Besides her longtime friend Fran Gray, Garrison and former \n     New York mayor David Dinkins were among only a few who spoke \n     to or visited Gibson over the last few years.\n       Garrison said she made a surprise visit to Gibson in her \n     home last month after the U.S. Open.\n       ``I just decided that I wanted to see her,'' Garrison said. \n     ``She looked at me and said `What are you doing here?' I \n     said, `I came to see you. Looks like you're doing OK. You're \n     still feisty.' She started laughing and said, `I might look \n     good, but I don't feel that great. I'm just tired, tired of \n     being here.''\n       ``I think of all that she had done in golf, as a singer, \n     her tennis, the music that she played, and I realize that she \n     broke barriers for women, not just for African-Americans.''\n       Born on a cotton farm in Silver, S.C., on Aug. 25, 1927, \n     she moved with her family to New York when she was 3. She \n     grew up on the rugged streets of Harlem and made the \n     transition from farm girl to city girl without missing a \n     step. She excelled in baseball, basketball, football and was \n     unbeatable in paddle tennis and stickball champion in the \n     Police Athletic League.\n       When not involved in tennis or team athletics, Althea spent \n     most of her teenage years in pool halls and bowling alleys. \n     In 1946, Gibson was rescued from a possible life of poverty \n     by two black physicians--Hubert Eaton and Robert Walter \n     Johnson--when she showed potential as a tennis player.\n       With her mother's approval, the physicians devised a plan \n     that allowed Gibson to live with Eaton in Wilmington, N.C., \n     during the school year and spend the summers training on \n     Johnson's backyard court in Lynchburg, Va. She quickly became \n     the premier African-American woman player in the country.\n       She took up golf in 1960 and became the first black woman \n     on the LPGA Tour two years later, but she never won a \n     tournament and earned little money.\n       Recently, Gibson, Fran Gray and others had collaborated on \n     a book, ``Born to Win: The Althea Gibson Story,'' to be \n     published next year.\n       ``I called her champ and still do,'' Dinkins said. ``We say \n     everybody stands on somebody else's shoulders, and we're \n     talking about people like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, \n     Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman. A whole lot of people--\n     tennis players and many who are not tennis players--stand on \n     Althea's shoulders, because when any black achieves in any \n     discipline, it helps everybody else. It's unfortunate that \n     she never realized and reaped the rewards that she was due.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12134-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12134-S12136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO ROBERT J. ``BOBBY'' PFEIFFER\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, one of Hawaii's most widely \nrespected business and community leaders has passed away. Robert J. \n``Bobby'' Pfeiffer was, as his friends described him, ``an old sea \ndog'' who rose from deck hand aboard tugs and steamers to become Chief \nExecutive of one of Hawaii's most important companies, Alexander & \nBaldwin, Inc., and of its subsidiary, Matson Navigation Co., Inc.\n  He was a man of vision who was always in touch with the concerns of \nall of the people of Hawaii. He often said, ``What is good for the \ncommunity is good for business.''\n  I would like to honor the late Mr. Pfeiffer by asking to have the \nfollowing biography of Mr. Pfeiffer printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n     Robert J. ``Bobby'' Pfeiffer, March 7, 1920-September 26, 2003\n\n\nChairman Emeritus, Alexander & Baldwin, Inc.; Chairman Emeritus, Matson \n                        Navigation Company, Inc.\n\n       ``Old sailors never die, they just drop the anchor,'' \n     Robert J. ``Bobby'' Pfeiffer said over a decade ago as he was \n     contemplating retirement. Pfeiffer, one of Hawaii's most \n     renowned sailors and captains of industry, dropped the anchor \n     on September 26, 2003, at age 83, at his home in Orinda, \n     Calif., after a lengthy illness\n       During his 12\\1/2\\ years at the helm of Alexander & \n     Baldwin, Inc., Bobby Pfeiffer became practically synonymous \n     with business leadership in Hawaii. He charted a course of \n     modernization and diversification, and led A through one of \n     its strongest periods of growth and prosperity. At the same \n     time he earned a reputation for leadership--personal as well \n     as corporate--in support of charitable and other community \n     causes.\n       Mr. Pfeiffer's maritime and business career spanned 58 \n     years, nearly 38 of them with A and its ocean \n     transportation subsidiary, Matson Navigation Company, Inc. \n     During that nearly four-decade period, he served as A's \n     chief executive longer than all but two of his predecessors, \n     and he piloted Matson for 19 years, longer than any of that \n     company's chief executives since its founder, Captain William \n     Matson.\n       For his significant contributions to the mid- and late-\n     20th-century modernization of American shipping, Bobby \n     Pfeiffer was recognized with the transportation and maritime \n     industries' highest honors.\n\n[[Page S12135]]\n\n                              Early Years\n\n       The descendent of an eight-generation line of sea captains, \n     Bobby Pfeiffer was born in Suva, Fiji, in 1920. He came to \n     Hawaii with his family the following year and spent his early \n     childhood in Hilo and Ka'u on the Big Island. It was there, \n     in a mostly Hawaiian community, that he learned to speak \n     Hawaiian--``otherwise you couldn't eat!'' he would later \n     explain--and ``developed an affection for the Hawaiian people \n     that [he] never lost.'' He even learned to dance the hula. \n     His affection for Hawaiian people deepened when, as a young \n     man, he worked on interisland steamers with Hawaiian \n     shipmates. He developed enormous respect for their seagoing \n     skills and ``friendly, compassionate, generous'' qualities.\n       Mr. Pfeiffer moved to Honolulu in 1929 with his family, and \n     he was soon spending all his spare time at the waterfront, in \n     the holds and on the docks, helping unload freight, checking \n     cargo, riding forklifts without permission, and learning to \n     run equipment. By age 12 Bobby Pfeiffer was working summers \n     for Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company, Ltd. His first \n     assignment: deckhand on a harbor tug. Within three years he \n     earned an operator's license for vessels up to 75 feet long \n     and could legally skipper harbor tugs.\n       He showed leadership qualities and initiative early. By the \n     eight grade, already captain of Roosevelt Intermediate \n     School's junior police squad, Bobby Pfeiffer was chosen \n     president of all junior police on Oahu. As he entered high \n     school, his ambition was to attend West Point and make the \n     Army his career. Knowing that McKinley High School had an \n     excellent ROTC program, he decided on his own to transfer \n     from Roosevelt, then one of Hawaii's elite ``English-\n     standard'' schools. ``I attended McKinley for three weeks \n     before my parents found out,'' he remembered. He worked his \n     way up to cadet colonel of the ROTC Brigade and earned an \n     appointment to West Point. Shortly before graduation in 1937, \n     however, Bobby Pfeiffer's father lost his job, which prompted \n     the young man to abandon his plans for West Point.\n       Instead, Bobby Pfeiffer went to work full-time for Inter-\n     Island Steam Navigation, starting the day after graduation. \n     Being a sailor ``was a hard life,'' he said. ``Many times we \n     collapsed on mail sacks in the 'tween decks to snatch an hour \n     or two of sleep.'' His hard work was rewarded and he was soon \n     made an officer. By 1941 he was back ashore, serving as \n     terminal superintendent.\n       During World War II, Mr. Pfeiffer served in the U.S. Navy. \n     At the end of the war, he married a fellow naval officer, \n     Mary Elizabeth worts, at Koloa Union Church on Kauai. While \n     he would remain in the Naval Reserve until 1965 (retiring \n     with the rank of commander), he soon returned to Inter-Island \n     Steam Navigation, where by 1950 he had risen to executive \n     vice president. Later that year a U.S. Department of Justice \n     order split the company in three; Bobby Pfeiffer was picked \n     to head one of the successor companies, Overseas Terminal, \n     Ltd. He remained with the company until 1955, when he moved \n     to Alhambra, Calif., to become vice president and general \n     manager of Pacific Cut Stone and Granite Co.\n\n                                 Matson\n\n       Mr. Pfeiffer began his long association with Matson in \n     1956, when he was named vice president and general manager of \n     Matcinal Corporation, a Matson stevedoring and terminal \n     subsidiary in Alameda, Calif. Except for the two years (1958-\n     60) that he managed Pacific Far East Line's terminal and \n     cargo operations division in San Francisco, Bobby Pfeiffer \n     would spend the rest of his career with Matson and its \n     corporate parent, Alexander & Baldwin.\n       Returning to Matson in 1960--as vice president and general \n     manager of Matson Terminals, Inc.--Bobby Pfeiffer promptly \n     earned a place in U.S. maritime annals by helping negotiate \n     the historic labor agreement that made possible the most \n     significant advance in shipping since steam replaced sail: \n     containerized cargo. Today the standard method of shipping, \n     containerized cargo was then in its infancy, having been \n     pioneered in the Pacific by Matson, beginning in 1958.\n       The Pacific Maritime Association, the shippers' group, made \n     Bobby Pfeiffer chairman of its steering committee, charged \n     with negotiating the ground rules for containerized cargo \n     with the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's \n     Union (ILWU), headed by Harry Bridges. Over ``months of \n     intense negotiations,'' that Bobby Pfeiffer would later call \n     ``labor-management statesmanship at its finest,'' the parties \n     created the Mechanization and Modernization (M and M) \n     Agreement. ``The union held a coast-wide caucus to consider \n     whether to resist [containerization] . . . or to bargain for \n     a `share of the machine.' '' Bobby Pfeiffer said. ``The \n     caucus opted to go after a share of the machine.'' The result \n     was a significant rise in longshore workers' wages and a new \n     lease on life for the U.S. merchant fleet.\n       In 1962 Mr. Pfeiffer was named president of Matson \n     Terminals, the first step in an 11-year rise to the \n     presidency of parent Matson Navigation Company. He was made a \n     Matson vice president in 1966, in charge of the company's Far \n     East freight division. In 1970 Matson promoted him to senior \n     vice president for operations, and in 1971 to executive vice \n     president. In 1973 he was named Matson president and, at the \n     same time, senior vice president of its corporate parent, \n     A\n       During his nearly two decades at the helm, Bobby Pfeiffer \n     led Matson's transformation into one of the world's most \n     efficient ocean transportation companies, shaping and \n     directing a $400 million capital investment program that \n     modernized both the company's fleet and its terminals in \n     Hawaii and on the West Coast.\n\n                                  A\n\n       Noting Bobby Pfeiffer's successes at Matson, A promoted \n     him to executive vice president in 1977, appointed him to its \n     board of directors in 1978, and, in October 1979, named him \n     president and chief operating officer. Less than three months \n     later, in January 1980, A appointed him CEO. In October of \n     the same year, he was elected chairman of the board. After 25 \n     years, the former deckhand had sailed home to Hawaii.\n       Mr. Pfeiffer established a far-reaching legacy at A He \n     developed a strategic plan that focused on completing the \n     technological renewal of Matson--which he continued to head \n     personally for some years--as well as on reinvigorating the \n     company's property development and management activities, and \n     revitalizing its roots in agriculture. He made the Hawaiian \n     word imua--``go forward''--his motto.\n       To help realize the potential of A's extensive \n     landholding as a revenue generator--a full-fledged ``third \n     leg,'' alongside Matson and sugarcane--Bobby Pfeiffer began \n     diversifying the company's real estate assets, starting with \n     the sale of the Wailea Resort on Maui, which A had been \n     developing for nearly two decades. He reinvested the proceeds \n     in a new portfolio of income-producing commercial properties \n     on the U.S. mainland, which were managed not only for current \n     income, but also with an eye to appreciation and resale, so \n     as to keep the portfolio growing in value. He also expanded \n     the development and management activities of subsidiary A \n     Properties from Maui to Kauai. By 1985, profits from A's \n     real estate activities surpassed those from sugar.\n       Mr. Pfeiffer also led the battle to keep A's sugar \n     business viable. He oversaw the completion and expansion of \n     investments in drip irrigation of the company's sugar \n     plantations on Maui and Kauai, and the pioneering automation \n     and computerization of its sugar mills. Together with his \n     success in bringing plantation operating costs under control, \n     these steps kept A's sugar business profitable when most \n     other plantations in Hawaii were failing. Bobby Pfeiffer also \n     diversified into coffee on a portion of the company's Kauai \n     lands. A's Kauai Coffee Company is now the largest coffee \n     grower in Hawaii.\n       As a result of these efforts, under Bobby Pfeiffer's \n     leadership, A's annual revenue and total assets both nearly \n     tripled, while shareholder equity practically doubled.\n       Enroute to these achievements, Bobby Pfeiffer saw his \n     leadership seriously challenged. In 1985 investor Harry \n     Weinberg, who had gradually purchased more than a quarter of \n     the company's stock and wished to boost its value by more \n     aggressively capitalizing on A's extensive landholdings, \n     attempted to replace Bobby Pfeiffer and the board with his \n     own slate of directors. After a hard-fought proxy battle, the \n     majority of stockholders voted with Mr. Pfeiffer; Weinberg \n     subsequently sold his shares back to the company.\n       Bobby Pfeiffer kept his hand on the tiller at A for more \n     than a dozen years. After devising and testing a succession \n     plan--one of his proudest achievements--and acquiescing in \n     requests by the board that he remain at his posts, Bobby \n     Pfeiffer retired as president in 1991, as CEO in 1992, and, \n     finally, as chairman of the board and director in 1995. He \n     returned to all three posts--and also to the chairmanship of \n     Matson's board--in mid-1998, after his successor, John Couch, \n     had to take a medical leave of absence. Bobby Pfeiffer \n     retired again as president and CEO after three months and as \n     chairman of A and Matson a year later. After stepping down \n     as chairman in 1995, and again in 1999, the boards of both \n     A and Matson named him chairman emeritus, and he continued \n     attending their meetings regularly until his health began to \n     fail. He kept regular office hours at Matson headquarters in \n     San Francisco until shortly before his death.\n\n                               Community\n\n       Mr. Pfeiffer's legacy at A was not all business. He was \n     concerned with the well-being of the community as well. In a \n     landmark 1985 speech to the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii, he \n     announced A's adoption of a policy of making charitable \n     contributions equal to two percent of pre-tax income, and \n     urged his listeners also ``to consider the two percent \n     solution.'' Bobby Pfeiffer explained that he viewed giving a \n     portion of profits ``back to the community where they are \n     earned, not so much as an obligation, but as an opportunity \n     to help shape the kind of community we would like to see.'' \n     In an editorial, Pacific Business News said, ``Pfeiffer's \n     `call to giving' boils down to what's good for the community \n     is good for business.'' In 1992 Bobby \n     Pfeiffer institutionalized what he called ``A's long \n     tradition of investing in the community's social fabric'' \n     by creating the Alexander & Baldwin Foundation.\n       Bobby Pfeiffer did not merely lend his name, but worked \n     hard for many of the causes he supported. He played an \n     instrumental role in saving the Hawaii Theatre from the \n     wrecker's ball, lending much-needed credibility to the \n     efforts of the band of dedicated volunteers who wished to \n     restore\n\n[[Page S12136]]\n\n     it. He was generous with his own money too. In the late \n     1990's, according to columnist Bob Krauss, a member of the \n     board of the Hawaii Maritime Center, Bobby Pfeiffer made ``an \n     exceptionally generous personal gift'' to establish an \n     endowment for the Falls of Clyde, the world's last four-\n     masted, full-rigged vessel, now permanently moored at the \n     foot of Bishop Street, alongside the Hawaii Maritime Center. \n     ``It was a noble deed that will help save her for the people \n     of Hawaii forever,'' said Krauss.\n       Experiences early in life help explain Mr. Pfeiffer's \n     strong charitable instincts. ``Most of us at McKinley came \n     from poor families, so we learned to share,'' he recalled \n     half a century later. ``Some of my classmates lived in a \n     Japanese commune at the foot of Alapai Street at King, and I \n     visited them often. I always was struck by the fact that as \n     poor as they were, . . . there always was something to eat, \n     which was shared with visitors.'' Poverty was a condition \n     Bobby Pfeiffer knew well, but learned to deal with. He would \n     later tell how, as a schoolboy, he could get a good meal at \n     the Central YMCA for a nickel, the price of a plate of rice \n     and gravy, which he would wash down with ``tomato juice'' he \n     made by stirring ketchup into a glass of water. He also \n     recalled how, as a young sailor, he would sometimes sail to \n     the Hansen's disease colony at Kalaupapa on Molokai. At the \n     pier in Honolulu, ``fathers, mothers, children, husbands and \n     wives said good-bye forever. It was a heartrending situation, \n     and all of us on ship felt badly for days after.''\n       Bobby Pfeiffer had a zest for life. He not only danced the \n     hula, but sang and played the ukulele. Four times a week he \n     would begin his day with a four-mile run, a habit he \n     continued into his eighth decade. In 1965 he learned to fly. \n     He earned certification as a flight instructor and developed \n     his skills to the point that he took up aerobatics and \n     purchased his own aerobatic plane. While he was president \n     of A, the company acquired two jets, Imua, a Cessna C-\n     550 for interisland flights, and Manukapu (Treasured \n     Bird), a BAe 1000 for transoceanic and transcontinental \n     flights. Bobby Pfeiffer was certified to fly them both, \n     and whenever he was on the board, he was never to be found \n     in the cabin, but always in the cockpit--in the left seat, \n     as pilot in command.\n       Mr. Pfeiffer freely admitted he ``thrived'' on work. He \n     began his day in the office at 5:15 a.m. and was renowed for \n     his puntuality at meetings. It was a trait he expected others \n     to share. A self-described hands on, people-oriented manager, \n     he made it a point to get to know employees personally. He \n     managed by walking around and was famous for greeting or \n     phoning employees on their birthdays.\n       Bobby Pfeiffer had a deep affection for the ships and crews \n     of the Matson fleet. Even after this retirement and his move \n     back to California to be closer to his children, when a ship \n     concluded a voyage to the West Coast, he would telephone the \n     captain to see how the voyage went and how the captain and \n     crew were faring.\n\n                                 Awards\n\n       Bobby Pfeiffer earned many honors over the course of his \n     career. The most distinctive was the naming of a Matson ship \n     for him, the $129 million, 713-foot MV R.J. Pfeiffer--\n     completed in 1992, the only commercial vessel built in a U.S. \n     shipyard since 1984. The name was an initiative of the Board \n     of directors--he had entered the meeting intending to \n     recommend another name for the new ship.\n       Bobby Pfeiffer was also particularly proud to have been \n     honored with: The National Transportation Award (for which he \n     was selected by the U.S. Secretary of Defense on the \n     recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, putting him in \n     the company of such previous recipients as Juan Trippe of Pan \n     American, William M. Allen of Boeing, Donald W. Douglas of \n     Douglas Aircraft, and helicopter pioneer Igor Sikorsky), \n     1975; the Admiral of the Ocean Sea Award, by United Seamen's \n     Service, the maritime industry's highest honor, 1985; the \n     ``Connie'' Award of the Containerization & Intermodal \n     Institute (``for significant contributions to the \n     development and promotion of containerization and \n     intermodal transportation''), 1985; and the Charles Reed \n     Bishop Medal, by Bishop Museum (citing his ``leadership \n     and personal example'' in making A ``a leader in \n     corporate citizenship''), 1995. The Order of the \n     Splintered Paddle, Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii, 1996.\n       Having no formal education beyond high school, Mr. Pfeiffer \n     also took great pride in his three honorary doctorates--from \n     the Maine Maritime Academy (Doctor of Science, 1986), the \n     University of Hawaii (Doctor of Humanities, 1986) and Hawaii \n     Loa College (Doctor of Humane Letters, 1987).\n       Among Bobby Pfeiffer's many other honors: distinguished \n     Service Award, United States Coast Guard Foundation, 1995; \n     Bay Area Trade/Transportation Executive of the Year Award, \n     San Francisco Daily commercial News, 1978; Person of the Year \n     Award, Transportation Clubs International, 1986; \n     Distinguished Citizen Award, Gannett Foundation, 1986; Junior \n     Achievement Hawaii Business Hall of Fame laureate, 1998; \n     Historic Hawaii Foundation Kama'aina of the Year Award, 1990; \n     Distinguished Citizen of the Year Award, Aloha Council, Boy \n     Scouts of America, 1986; Sales & Marketing Executives (SME) \n     of Honolulu Salesperson of the Year, 1989; Brass Hat Award, \n     Propeller Club of the United States, Port of the Golden Gate, \n     1973; Ship-in-the-Bottle Award, International Organization of \n     Masters, Mates & Pilots, 1981; and McKinley High School Hall \n     of Honor (he was among the inaugural 38 members inducted), \n     1986.\n       Bobby Pfeiffer was a life member of National Defense \n     Transportation Association Among the many professional, civic \n     and charitable organizations he served in a leadership role \n     were A Committee on Excellence, State of Hawaii (chairman); \n     American Bureau of Shipping (member, Board of Managers); \n     Bishop Museum (member, board of trustees); Chamber of \n     Commerce of Hawaii (member, board of directors); \n     Containerization & Intermodal Institute (member, Honorary \n     Board of Advisors); Hawaii Business Roundtable (vice \n     chairman); Hawaii Community Foundation (member, board of \n     governors); Hawaii Maritime Center (vice chairman); Hawaiian \n     Sugar Planters' Association (chairman); Institute for Human \n     Services (member, board of directors); Joint Maritime \n     Congress (Advisory Committee member); Marine Exchange of the \n     San Francisco Bay Region (director); Maritime Transportation \n     Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences \n     (chairman); McKinley High School Foundation (honorary co-\n     chairman); National Association of Stevedores (president); \n     National Cargo Bureau, Inc.

(chairman). He \n     served as a director of at least two dozen other companies, \n     and he was a member of the prestigious Bohemian and The \n     Pacific-Union clubs in San Francisco and of the Oahu Country \n     Club and The Pacific Club in Honolulu. Bobby Pfeiffer was \n     also a life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n       Mr. Pfeiffer is survived by his children, Elizabeth \n     ``Betsy'' Tumbas and her husband Stephen; Margaret ``Marga'' \n     Hughes and her husband William; George W. ``Skipper'' \n     Pfeiffer and his wife Julie; Kathleen ``Kappy'' Pfeiffer; and \n     nine grandchildren. His wife, Mary Worts Pfeiffer, died on \n     December 4, 2002, five days after the couple's 57th wedding \n     anniversary.\n       Services are pending. In lieu of flowers, the family \n     suggests that donations in Pfeiffer's memory be made to the \n     Hawaii Maritime Center or to one's favorite charity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12136-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12136-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12136-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12136-S12137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE SECRETARIES OF STATE AND \n   HOMELAND SECURITY CONCERNING IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 428 OF THE \n                  HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002--PM 51\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\nMessage to the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 428(e)(8)(A) of the Homeland Security Act of \n2002 (Public Law 107-296) (the ``Act''), I am pleased to report that \nthe Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security have \ncompleted a Memorandum of Understanding concerning implementation of \nsection 428 of the Act.

A bill to expand the Rest and Recuperation Leave program for \nmembers of the Armed Forces serving in the Iraqi theater of operations \nin support of Operation Iraqi Freedom to include travel and \ntransportation to the members' permanent station or home; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, S. \n1670, which would pay for the travel of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, \nor in that theater, to and from their homes for the 2-weeks leave they \nare being granted.\n  Incredibly, while asking the Congress for an additional $87 billion \nfor the war in Iraq, the Department of Defense wants to drop soldiers \non leave off at the Baltimore Airport and then make them pay for their \ntransportation home and back. Those service men and women are serving \nwith great courage in 115-degree temperatures and other truly awful \nconditions. They are being given 2 weeks leave--many of them--because \nthey are in the Reserves or National Guard and they have just had their \n5- or 6-month tour extended by another 6 months. This will be the only \ntime that many of them will have a chance to see their families during \nan entire year.\n  The least we can do is get them home and back at Government expense. \nIf all 138,000 troops who are stationed in Iraq were to take this leave \nto travel to their homes, the total cost would be approximately $69 \nmillion. My legislation would not increase the $87 billion requested by \nthe President, it would just direct that up to $69 million be available \nto be expensed for this purpose.\n  Last week, I also cosponsored legislation introduced by Senator Bob \nGraham, which exempted soldiers wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan from \nhaving to pay for meals while they are hospitalized. I was astonished \nto learn that the military would otherwise dock their pay for the cost \nof their meals. We are appropriating over $400 billion for our military \noperations next year through the regular appropriations and \nsupplemental bills. Surely, that provides enough money that U.S. troops \nwho are fighting, risking their lives, being wounded, and dying can be \ntreated compassionately and fairly, not nickeled and dimed with travel \nand meal costs while on leave, or, even worse, while being hospitalized \nwith combat wounds and injuries.\n  The American people are generous enough to support our troops \nproperly and care for the wounded compassionately. The Department of \nDefense should not have to be required to do the right thing. It should \nbe obvious enough to them, but if not, they should give me a call and I \nwill let them know.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1670\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the Timucuan Ecological and Historic \nPreserve, Florida; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \nbill that will preserve a part of the history of Florida and America. \nMy bill will allow 20 acres of untouched, undeveloped sand dune land on \nAmerican Beach, Amelia Island, FL to become part of Timucuan Ecological \nand Historic Preserve.\n  The history of American Beach is partly the chronicle of Africa-\nAmerican achievement and economic autonomy during the Jim Crow era. \nAmerican Beach was purchased in 1932 by the Afro American Life \nInsurance Company and its President, A.L. Lewis. This insurance company \nwas the first insurance company owned by any Floridian, either a black \nor white. Mr. Lewis' granddaughter, affectionately referred to as the \n``Beachlady,'' still resides on American Beach and is revered for her \ncolorful life and her work to preserve the American Beach from \ndevelopment and environmental degradation.\n  American Beach was an integrated beach when all beach communities \nthroughout the United States were segregated. For decades, it \nflourished as an ocean-side paradise for blacks from all parts of the \ncountry. American Beach is still owned primarily by African Americans \nwho are the descendants of the original owners. But, developers are \nslowly moving in to destroy this property that holds a chapter of \nAmerican history. The sand dunes tell many stories of generations long \npast--writer Zora Neale Hurston, heavy-weight champion Joe Louis, \nentertainer Cab Calloway, and civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph \nvacationed on American Beach. But, most of the beach dwellers and \nvisitors were ordinary working-class African Americans.\n  This legislation merely seeks to expand the boundaries of a wonderful \nnature preserve already in place to preserve this unique and special \nplace called American Beach.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1672\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenators Lugar, Lieberman and Bayh to offer legislation to honor our \nservicemen and women in Iraq, who serve far from home, and far from \nfamily and friends. They left the freedom and security of home to \nprovide freedom and security to those who have not known it for many \nyears. The human cost has been great, over 300 American fighting men \nand women will never come home, and over 1,500 will return wounded. \nToday, over 130,000 troops remain in the region. They remain to ensure \nthat those who paid the ultimate sacrifice did not die in vain. They \nare also there to build a new Iraqi nation of stability and freedom. My \nfellow Senators, the liberation of Iraq is turning out to be the most \nsignificant military, occupation and reconstruction effort since the \nend of World War II.\n  Despite their sacrifice and courage, these brave young men and women \nwill not be specifically recognized for their service in Iraq. Instead, \nthe Department of Defense has decided to award them the Global War on \nTerrorism Expeditionary Medal. I believe that this is a mistake, and \nthat our military deserves better. Along with my colleagues, Senator \nLugar, Senator Bayh and Senator Lieberman, I propose to correct this \nmistake by offering legislation authorizing the Iraqi Lieberation Medal \nin lieu of the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.\n  While some of us in this body have not shared the administration's \nview on this war, we are united when it comes to supporting our troops. \nThese young men and women from active duty, National Guard, and \nReserves are all volunteers and exemplify the very essence of what it \nmeans to be a patriot. They continue to serve even though they do not \nknow when they will return home to family and friends. They continue to \nserve despite the tremendous hardships they face and they continue to \nserve despite the constant threat to their lives. The President agrees \nwith our view of the exemplary service of these young men and women. On \nthe deck of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, President Bush proclaimed: ``In \nthis battle, we have fought for the cause of liberty and for the peace \nof the world. Our Nation and our coalition are proud of this \naccomplishment, yet it is you, the members of the United States \nmilitary, who achieved it. Your courage, your willingness to face \ndanger for your country and for each other made this day possible.''\n\n  I was extremely disappointed when I learned that those serving in \nIraq would not be specifically recognized for their efforts. There will \nbe no Iraqi campaign medal. Instead, the Department of Defense will \naward them a Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary. I think this is a \ngrave mistake.\n  During Operation Desert Storm, service members received three \nseparate military decorations for their service: the Armed Forces \nExpeditionary Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal, and the \nLiberation of Kuwait medal. For service in Kosovo, our service men and \nwomen received the NATO Service Medal, and the Kosovo Campaign Medal.\n  Many within the military share this view; according to the Army \nTimes: ``Campaign medals help establish an immediate rapport with \nindividuals checking into a unit.'' An expeditionary medal like the \nGWOT does not necessarily denote combat. A campaign medal is designed \nto recognize military personnel who have risked their lives in combat.\n  Campaign medals matter. ``When a Marine shows up at a new duty \nstation, commanders look first at his decorations and his physical \nfitness score--the first to see where he's been, the second to see if \nhe can hang. `They show what you've done and how serious\n\n[[Page S12140]]\n\nyou are,' said Gunnery Sgt. James Cuneo. `If you're a good Marine, \npeople are going to award you when it comes time . . .'.''\n  My fellow distinguished colleagues, it is time.\n  We must recognize the sacrifice and courage of our young men and \nwomen who liberated Iraq, including great Americans like Army \nSpecialist Joseph Hudson from Alamogordo, New Mexico, who was held as a \nprisoner of war. The Nation was captivated as we watched Specialist \nHudson being interrogated by the enemy. Asked to divulge his military \noccupation, Specialist Hudson stared defiantly into the camera and \nsaid, ``I follow orders.'' Those of us with sons and daughters were \nunited in worry with Specialist Hudson's family. The entire Nation \nrejoiced when he was liberated.\n  We have also asked much from our reserve and National Guard forces. \nThe reconstruction of Iraq would not be possible without the commitment \nand sacrifice of the 170,000 Guard and Reservists currently on active \nduty. As recently as this weekend an additional 10,000 troops from \nWashington State and North Carolina were activated for service in Iraq.\n  My colleagues, Senator Lugar, Senator Lieberman, Senator Bayh, and I \nare committed to honoring our over 200,000 heroes who liberated Iraq. \nWe believe that current administration policy does a disservice to our \nfighting men and women. Therefore we propose, in lieu of the GWOT \nmedal, a new decoration that characterizes the real mission in Iraq, \none that is distinctive and honors their sacrifice, the Iraqi \nLiberation Medal.\n\n  What we do today is not without precedent; Congress has been \nresponsible for recognizing the sacrifice and courage of our military \nforces throughout history. Congress has had a significant and \nhistorically central role in authorizing military decorations. Our \nNation's highest military decorations were authorized by Congress, \nincluding: The Congressional Medal of Honor; the Air Force Cross; the \nNavy Cross; the Army's Distinctive Service Cross; the Silver Star; and \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross.\n  We have also authorized campaign and liberation medals similar to \nwhat we hope to accomplish with this legislation. A partial list \nincludes: Spanish War Service Medal; Army Occupation of Germany Medal; \nWorld War II Victory Medal; Berlin Airlift Medal; Korean Service Medal; \nand Prisoner of War Medal.\n  And the list goes on and on. The great men and women of our military \nforces are doing their jobs everyday in Iraq. It is time to do our job \nand honor them with a medal that truly stands for their heroic service, \nthe Iraqi Liberation Medal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an Air Force Times article also be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Air Force Times, Sept. 1, 2003]\n\n                           One Size Fits All?\n\n                           (By Vince Crawley)\n\n       Despite the weight of well over a century of military \n     tradition and precedence, the Pentagon has no plans for \n     campaign-specific medals for the most recent wars in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq, the nation's most protracted conflicts \n     since Korea and Vietnam--both of which were deemed medal-\n     worthy.\n       Military duty in Antarctica, Kosovo and the 1991 Persian-\n     Gulf War also rates medals, as does ``humane action,'' \n     ``humanitarian service'' and ``outstanding volunteer \n     service.'' Past generations of veterans have qualified for \n     medals and their accompanying ribbons for a wide range of \n     operations, from the Civil War and both World Wars to China's \n     Boxer Rebellion, the Spanish-American War and military \n     actions against Mexico.\n       But troops involved in the current battle against terrorism \n     instead will get two recently approved awards, the Global War \n     on Terrorism Service Medal and a Global War on Terrorism \n     Expeditionary Medal, which are intended to cover all the \n     bases in an effort that President Bush says likely will last \n     many years and be fought on many shores.\n       In addition, veterans of these 21st-century wars may \n     receive each medal only once. In theory--and in current \n     practice--troops could spend years fighting in Afghanistan, \n     Iraq, the Philippines and elsewhere and end up with a single \n     medal that doesn't reflect their specific duty history or \n     even the fact that they deployed multiple times in the global \n     war on terrorism.\n       The Pentagon isn't saying much about its rationale for the \n     decision. Defense officials believe ``these two medals will \n     provide appropriate recognition for our service members \n     participating in the global war on terrorism, whether that be \n     in Afghanistan, Iraq, or elsewhere,'' said Air Force Maj. \n     Sandra Burr, a Pentagon spokeswoman.\n       Not all troops agree. Marine 1st Lt. Zeb Philpott, 26, \n     weapons platoon commander for Alpha Company, 2nd Light \n     Armored Reconnaissance Battalion at Camp Lejeune, N.C., said \n     campaign medals help establish an immediate rapport with \n     individuals checking into a unit.\n       ``You can tell what he's done,'' Philpott said. ``I can \n     look at a gunny and tell that he was in the Gulf War.''\n       And people look. When a Marine shows up at a new duty \n     station, commanders look first at his decorations and his \n     physical fitness score--the first to see where he's been, the \n     second to see if he can hang.\n       ``They show what you've done and how serious you are,'' \n     said Gunnery Sgt. James Cuneo, Alpha Company gunny. ``If \n     you're a good Marine, people are going to award you when it \n     comes time. My ribbons don't make me who I am, but they show \n     my experience level.''\n       After 15 years, he's got quite a bit to show for his \n     efforts--four full rows and the start of a fifth. They \n     include the Navy/Marine Corps Achievement Medal with three \n     stars, a combat action ribbon for Desert Storm with a star \n     pending for recent Iraq ops, the Southwest Asia Service Medal \n     with three stars and the Kuwait Liberation Medal.\n       ``I think they ought to have an Iraq ribbon,'' Cuneo said. \n     ``They ought to have a Djibouti ribbon. And they ought to \n     have an Afghanistan ribbon. They all mean different things.''\n       Lt. Col. Keith Schultz, a B-52 Stratofortress pilot with \n     the Air Force Reserve's 917th Wing at Barksdale Air Force \n     Base, La., spent 9\\1/2\\ months deployed to Operations \n     Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.\n       On his last deployment, Schultz flew Iraqi Freedom missions \n     from England and then headed to the Indian Ocean and flew \n     Enduring Freedom assignments.\n       ``I saw them as separate conflicts,'' Schultz said.\n       If one medal is issued to represent both operations, \n     Schultz hopes the citation will explain the operations in \n     which the recipient fought.\n       Tech. Sgt. Michael Pierce, a B-52 weapons loader with the \n     917th Wing, deployed to Enduring Freedom.\n       He said there should be some way to show, such as with a \n     device on the ribbon, how many times an airman deployed or in \n     what conflicts he served.\n       Others are fine with the GWOT medals. ``It's nice to \n     receive awards and decorations, but I was just there doing my \n     job,'' said a field artillery major who recently returned \n     from Iraq with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division.\n       ``This is my job, my profession,'' he said. ``There are \n     people doing things everywhere. All of us are a part of this \n     big [global war on terrorism].''\n       Bush signed an executive order March 12 to create the \n     Global War on Terrorism medals on the recommendation of \n     Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. But none has yet been \n     officially issued because Rumsfeld's staff is working out the \n     fine print for eligibility.\n       The Army Institute of Heraldry said June 13 that Rumsfeld's \n     staff is ``finalizing'' the criteria and implementation rules \n     for the two medals.\n       Asked Aug. 18 when the medals would be issued, Burr said \n     she could not predict when coordination on the eligibility \n     policy would be complete.\n       A March 15 Pentagon news release referred to the medals as \n     the GWOT Service Medal and GWOT Expeditionary Medal, using \n     the Pentagon's acronym for the global war on terrorism.\n       The Expeditionary Medal will recognize service in \n     operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. The Service \n     Medal will recognize duty in Operation Noble Eagle, the \n     homeland defense mission against further terror attacks, as \n     well as duty in support of operations Enduring Freedom and \n     Iraqi Freedom performed in geographic areas that don't \n     qualify for the Expeditionary Medal.\n       In the past, some medals have been created years or decades \n     after the conflict they represent. The medals can be \n     established by the president or Congress.\n       They typically include official orders and become part of \n     the service ribbons that appear on service members' dress \n     uniforms.\n       Below are examples of other campaign and service medals. \n     Most can be awarded more than once; commonly, a small bronze \n     star device is attached to the ribbon for each additional \n     award.\n       The Southwest Asia Service Medal was awarded for the 1991 \n     Gulf War, with an eligibility period from Aug. 2, 1990, to \n     Nov. 30 1995.\n       In October 1990, when U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia began \n     preparing for a possible offensive against Iraq, Pentagon \n     personnel officials asked the Institute of Heraldry to \n     provide proposed designs for a Southwest Asia Service Medal. \n     Proposals were forwarded Oct. 30 to then-Defense Secretary \n     Dick Cheney. A proposed executive order to authorize the \n     medal was drafted by Cheney's office Feb. 11, 1991, before \n     the ground war began. The medal was established by executive\n\n[[Page S12141]]\n\n     order March 12, less than two weeks after the cease-fire.\n       Three separate campaigns are recognized: the defense of \n     Saudi Arabia, the liberation of Kuwait and patrolling the \n     cease-fire agreement through Nov. 30, 1995, and service \n     members can be awarded the medal up to three times.\n       The Kosovo Campaign Medal was established by President \n     Clinton on May 3, 2000, to recognize service in the U.S.-led \n     Kosovo war, form March 24 to June 10, 1999, or in ongoing \n     Kosovo peacekeeping operations. It may be awarded more than \n     once to troops who took part in multiple Kosovo missions.\n       The Antarctica Service Medal was established by Congress in \n     1960 for military members and civilians, such as scientists, \n     who have supported U.S. government programs in the antarctic \n     since Jan. 1, 1946. The medal most commonly goes to aircrews \n     and Navy personnel.\n       The Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal was established by \n     President Kennedy on Dec. 4, 1961, for operations on or after \n     July 1, 1958, to recognize service in peacekeeping and peace \n     enforcement missions. The Joint Chiefs have authorized 22 \n     missions for this medal, including operations in Somalia and \n     Bosnia, as well as actions against Iraq in the late 1990s. \n     Multiple awards are allowed.\n       The Armed Forces Service Medal was established by Clinton \n     Jan. 11, 1996, within weeks of U.S. troops entering Bosnia. \n     It is for troops participating in large military operations \n     who face no armed opposition or threat of imminent hostile \n     action. The medal is intended to fill a void in the criteria \n     between the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the \n     Humanitarian Service Medal. It has been awarded for service \n     in the Balkans since June 1, 1992, and for service in Haiti.\n       Previous wars and military actions have resulted in a host \n     of campaign medals, though in some cases they were approved \n     years or even decades after the fighting. They include:\n       The Vietnam Service Medal, established by President Johnson \n     in 1965. Multiple campaigns are recognized.\n       The Korean Service Medal, established by President Truman \n     in 1950. Multiple awards are allowed for up to 10 wartime \n     campaigns.\n       The Medal for Humane Action, established by Congress in \n     1949 for those who took part in the Berlin Airlift from June \n     1948 to September 1949.\n       World War II saw three campaign medals--the American \n     Campaign Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal and the \n     European-African-Middle Eastern Medal, approved by President \n     Roosevelt in 1942. All allow for multiple awards.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1673\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF AWARD OF IRAQI LIBERATION MEDAL \n                   AS CAMPAIGN MEDAL FOR SERVICE IN SOUTHWEST ASIA \n                   IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to President George W. Bush, Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom was ``fought for the cause of liberty, and for the \n     peace of the world . . .'' and ``to free a nation by breaking \n     a dangerous and aggressive regime''.\n       (2) The military victory in Iraq has been characterized by \n     President George W. Bush as one of the ``swiftest advances in \n     heavy arms in history''.\n       (3) There are more than 130,000 Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, \n     and Marines of the United States serving in the Iraqi Theater \n     of Operations, far from family and friends, and for an \n     unknown duration.\n       (4) Since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, almost \n     300 members of the Armed Forces of the United States have \n     died in Iraq and nearly 1,500 have been wounded in action.\n       (5) Congress has authorized and Presidents have issued \n     specific decorations recognizing the sacrifice and service of \n     the members of the Armed Forces of the United States in the \n     Korean War, the Vietnam conflict, and the liberation of \n     Kuwait.\n       (6) Current Department of Defense guidance authorizes the \n     award of only one expeditionary medal for overseas duty in \n     Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Iraq.\n       (7) The conflict in Iraq is significant enough in scope and \n     sacrifice to warrant a specific military decoration for the \n     liberation of Iraq.\n       (b) Authorization of Award of Campaign Medal.--The \n     Secretary concerned may award a campaign medal of appropriate \n     design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to any person who \n     serves in any capacity with the Armed Forces in the Southwest \n     Asia region in connection with Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       (c) Name of Medal.--The campaign medal authorized by \n     subsection (b) shall be known as the ``Iraqi Liberation \n     Medal''.\n       (d) Prohibition on Concurrent Award of Global War on \n     Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.--A person who is awarded the \n     campaign medal authorized by subsection (b) for service \n     described in that subsection may not also be awarded the \n     Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal for that service.\n       (e) Other Limitations.--The award of the campaign medal \n     authorized by subsection (b) shall be subject to such \n     limitations as the President may prescribe.\n       (f) Regulations.--(1) Each Secretary concerned shall \n     prescribe regulations on the award of the campaign medal \n     authorized by subsection (b).\n       (2) The regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) shall \n     not go into effect until approved by the Secretary of \n     Defense.\n       (3) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the \n     regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) are uniform, so \n     far as practicable.\n       (g) Secretary Concerned Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``Secretary concerned'' means the following:\n       (1) The Secretary of the Army with respect to matters \n     concerning members of the Army.\n       (2) The Secretary of the Navy with respect to matters \n     concerning members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard \n     when it is operating as a service in the Navy.\n       (3) The Secretary of the Air Force with respect to matters \n     concerning members of the Air Force.\n       (4) The Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to \n     matters concerning members of the Coast Guard when it is not \n     operating as a service in the Navy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bunning, \n        and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1676. A bill to permanently authorize the National Oilheat \nResearch Alliance; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nNational Oilheat Research Alliance Act of 2003, and to be joined by \nSenators Smith, Leahy, Warner, Bunning, and Jack Reed. This bill \npermanently authorizes the National Oilheat Research Alliance, commonly \nreferred to as NORA, which was created by a referendum of oilheat \nretailers and wholesalers in February of 2001.\n  I was proud to sponsor the Senate bill that originally authorized the \ncreation of NORA during the 106th Congress, and I am pleased to report \nthat during its almost three years of existence, NORA has proved an \nunqualified success. Its activities have created genuine, tangible \nbenefits for the heating oil industry and its consumers in the areas of \nresearch, education, safety and training, as well as providing \ninformation about the industry to existing and potential customers.\n  This bill is necessary because the original authorization statute for \nNORA included a sunset provision that, without congressional action, \nwill force NORA to cease operations four years after its creation. The \nprovision was included to allow Congress to assess its performance and \ndetermine whether it deserved continued authorization. It is readily \napparent, from its numerous activities and the wide support it enjoys \nfrom consumer, environmental, and labor groups, along with the industry \nitself, that NORA should continue in perpetuity.\n  In a short time, NORA has set the standard for industry-wide \ncooperative activity with its professionalism, effectiveness, and most \nimportantly, satisfaction from its supporting members. Through its \nrigorous commitment to activities that benefit all of its members, \ncustomers and the public at large, NORA is able to harness the \ncollective strength of its companies and their resources to share \ncutting-edge technological advances, the latest in training methods, \nand promising environmental initiatives throughout the industry.\n  Of particular note is the creation of the National Oilheat Research \nInstitute, or NORI, which oversees valuable study as the industry moves \ntoward the introduction of low sulfur heating oil to help reduce the \namount of sulfur emissions in the industry. This forward-looking work \nhighlights NORA's genuine commitment to building an environmentally \nsound oil heat industry.\n  Other research undertaken by NORI includes a thorough, systematic \nevaluation of the fuel component of the oil heat system to maximize \nfuel performance--and therefore lower heating costs--for oil heat \ncustomers. These and other consumer-friendly activities have won NORA \nthe support of the Consumer Energy Council of America, the oldest \npublic interest energy policy organization in the Nation.\n  In fact, NORA's research and development activities were identified \nin a report from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, which concluded \nthat the NORA program ``will provide economic support to millions of \nAmerican households by reducing fuel bills, and thousands of small \nfamily businesses in the United States who will gain from having \nsatisfied consumers and reduced operating costs.''\n  NORA is also playing a leading role in continuing education and \ntraining for oil heat technicians through the introduction of new and \nupdated training\n\n[[Page S12142]]\n\nmaterial, creation of a standardized certification program to encourage \nprofessional development, partnerships with community colleges to \nprovide equipment for training, and a new website to provide easy \naccess to NORA safety and training material.\n  NORA also understands that new homeowners who buy houses with \nexisting oil heat systems have questions about the best way to make use \nof and maintain their heating source, and publishes a Homeowner's Guide \nthat describes the cleanliness and efficiency of their system, and \noffers helpful information for real estate purchasers.\n  This is just a sampling of the many activities taking place in states \nusing oil heat all over the country. Numerous State associations \nbenefit from their partnership with NORA, which supports local and \nstatewide initiatives for the heating oil industry, its customers, and \nthe professionals working within it. Indeed, the Maine Oil Dealers \nAssociation has provided me with uniformly positive feedback about its \npartnership with NORA, including its assistance with development of \ninformation brochures and production of safety manuals in both printed \nand electronic form.\n  I am persuaded that NORA's performance has exceeded all expectation \nand deserves permanent authorization from the Congress. I look forward \nto helping make sure that NORA can continue its beneficial activities \nlong into the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1676\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1 SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Oilheat Research \n     Alliance Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2 FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 2000, Congress enacted the National Oilheat Research \n     Alliance Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 6201 note), authorizing a \n     referendum to create the National Oilheat Research Alliance;\n       (2) before enactment of that Act, similar legislation had \n     passed the Senate by unanimous consent with 21 bipartisan \n     Senate cosponsors and the House of Representatives with 148 \n     bipartisan cosponsors;\n       (3) the Alliance was approved by an industry-wide \n     referendum held in January 2001, with 97 percent of oilheat \n     retailers and 99 percent of oilheat wholesalers voting in \n     favor of creation of the Alliance;\n       (4) during its nearly 3 years of existence, the Alliance \n     has operated in 21 States and the District of Columbia, \n     providing benefits for its members and oilheat consumers in \n     the areas of research and development, safety, energy \n     efficiency, training, and education;\n       (5) the Alliance successfully created the National Oilheat \n     Research Institute, which is leading the way toward \n     developing a low-sulfur heating oil product that will allow \n     significant progress in reducing emissions;\n       (6) the Institute is also at the forefront of developing \n     new efficiency techniques for existing heating oil units, \n     providing substantial savings for the energy costs of \n     consumers;\n       (7) the Alliance is providing improved and up-to-date \n     training material for oilheat technicians, establishing a \n     standardized certification program and encouraging continuing \n     education methods that result in efficient and highly trained \n     professionals to service their customers;\n       (8) the Alliance has prepared material for realtors and \n     prospective home buyers for houses with existing heating oil \n     systems, explaining how to make the best use of oilheat and \n     providing crucial safety and energy efficiency information;\n       (9) the legislation providing for the creation of the \n     Alliance included a sunset provision that will require the \n     Alliance to terminate activities in February 2005 unless \n     Congress acts to extend the authorization; and\n       (10) the outstanding progress of the Alliance in the fields \n     of research and development, safety and training, and \n     education, the nearly unanimous support from industry, and \n     the strong potential to yield future benefits for industry \n     and consumers make the Alliance deserving of permanent \n     authorization by Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to encourage partnerships between community colleges \nand 4-year institutions of higher education; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the most \nimportant issues facing our country today. How we prepare our students \nto compete for the jobs that are still in demand today and the jobs \nthat will be in demand tomorrow. In order to address this issue, we \nmust increase our support for the entire education and training \ncontinuum--incuding secondary schools, community colleges, 4-year \ncolleges and universities.\n  Today, I want to focus on one key part of this continuum: community \nand technical colleges. Nationwide, there are now more than 1,100 of \nthese institutions, which enroll 10.4 million students. For over a \ncentury, community colleges have grown and changed with the times. No \nother segment of higher education is more responsive to its community \nand workforce needs than the community college. Whether providing \nacademic preparation for a 4-year degree, or technical training for a \njob requiring a community college credential, 2-year institutions play \na very significant role in creating a skilled workforce.\n  However, transfer rates are low: only about one quarter to one third \nof those students who intend to transfer to a 4-year institution \nactually do so. These low transfer rates and the continuing challenges \nemployers face in finding skilled workers mean that we must strengthen \nthe connections between community colleges and 4-year institutions and \nbetween community colleges and employers.\n  I am introducing a bill today that will address these issues. The \nCommunity College Partnership Act of 2003 will encourage partnerships \nbetween community and technical colleges and 4-year colleges and \nuniversities. This bill will provide $70 million for 6 to 12 grants to \npartnerships between 2- and 4-year institutions to identify and address \nbarriers to staying in school, to transferring to a 4-year institution, \nand to responding to the demand for skilled workers in high-quality, \nemerging and established industries.\n  The fact is employers depend on skilled workers to provide services \nand produce goods. Even in this time of high unemployment, some \nemployers are having hard times finding skilled workers. For example, \naccording to the American Hospital Association, there are 126,000 \nnursing positions that are unfilled across the country. In Washington \nState, there are currently 2,564 nursing vacancies even though our \nState ranks as one of the highest unemployment States. Why are these \njobs going begging? The answer is that we have a lack of trained \nworkers.\n  From personal experience as both an employee and as an employer, I \nunderstand the importance of skills in the private sector. When I \nchanged careers several years ago, I was able to succeed as a software \ncompany executive because I had the chance to get a good basic \neducation. I come from a working-class family, but I was able to be the \nfirst in my family to get a college degree, thanks to the Federal Pell \nGrant program.\n  As an employer in that software company, I realized that because of \nthe fast pace of change we needed to hire a workforce of people who \nwere prepared to respond quickly to changing situations. We also had to \nhire people who could create new ways of doing business literally \novernight. I strongly believe that a good basic education coupled with \nlifelong training opportunities are key to equiping workers with the \ntypes of decision-making abilities necessary to be successful in \ntoday's economy.\n  Yet, we are failing at our job of preparing workers. There is a \ncrisis in our education and training system. Underfunding is a \nsignificant issue. Both 2- and 4-year institutions lack the capacity to \nrespond to demand. More State and Federal investment is essential. \nHowever, to truly close the skills gap, we must also address the other \nproblems 2- and 4-year institutions face. These problems center on \nkeeping students in the system and advancing them to the next level.\n  The sad reality is that along the way to a good basic education, \nstudents get diverted away from their goals. In high school, they may \nlack information about the opportunities higher education promises. If \nthey make it into a community college, they may be forced to abandon \ntheir education because the opportunity cost of not earning a wage is \ntoo high. If they do earn an associate's degree, the transition to a 4-\nyear institution is fraught with challenges.\n\n[[Page S12143]]\n\n  Agreements between 2- and 4-year institutions to accept students may \nnot exist. Credits may not easily transfer. Community or technical \ncollege students may need additional tutoring, mentoring or support to \nsucceed in a 4-year institution. Programs and schedules may be \nstructured to preclude work and study--a growing necessity as college \ncosts rise.\n  These are significant barriers than can and should be addressed. That \nis why I am introducing the Community College Partnership Act today. I \nam proud of this bill and believe that it will go a long way toward \nclosing our skills gap. In addition, however, I remain committed to \naddressing the significant funding shortfalls that our educational \ninstitutions face. Ensuring students get the skills necessary for our \nnew economy is essential. We must meet the needs of employers who have \nunfilled jobs now, as well as employers in emerging technologies that \nwill provide significant job opportunities in the coming years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n        Sununu, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S.J. Res. 18. A joint resolution commending the Inspectors General \nfor their efforts to prevent and detect waste, fraud, abuse, and \nmismanagement, and to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in \nthe Federal Government during the past 25 years; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint \nresolution recognizing the accomplishments of the inspectors general \nduring the past 25 years. I am very pleased to be joined in this \nundertaking by Senator Lieberman and many of our distinguished \ncolleagues in both Houses of Congress.\n  Since 1978, the inspectors general (IGs) have made valuable \ncontributions to the efficient and economical operation of the Federal \nGovernment. They have made thousands of recommendations, which \nultimately saved the American taxpayers literally billions of dollars.\n  We've all heard the horror stories of $500 hammers and roads build to \nnowhere: those are examples of the kind of wasteful spending that the \nIGs have exposed. The waste of scarce Federal resources not only picks \nthe pockets of taxpayers but also places severe financial pressures on \nalready overburdened programs, forcing cutbacks in vital government \nservices.\n  Investigations by inspectors general have also resulted in the \nrecovery of hundreds of millions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury from \ncompanies and individuals who defrauded the Federal Government. These \ninvestigations have been the basis for thousands of criminal \nprosecutions, debarments, exclusions, and suspensions.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and \npreviously as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \nI have had the opportunity to work hand-in-hand with IGs to combat \nfraud and waste in a variety of programs.\n  To cite just one example, I worked with the Office of Inspector \nGeneral for the Department of Health and Human Services to uncover \nflagrant examples of Medicare fraud. We found that the Federal \nGovernment had been sending Medicare checks to 14 fraudulent health \ncare companies that had provided no services whatsoever. Indeed, the \naddress listed by one company did not exist, and, if it had, the \naddress would have been located in the middle of the runway of the \nMiami International Airport.\n  The Offices of Inspector General have demonstrated a record of \ntremendous success over the past 25 years, and we wish to commend them \nand their employees for their dedication and professionalism in the \nperformance of their duties.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Lieberman and me in passing \nthis resolution commending the IGS for their many accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/29/senate-section/article/S12143-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12143-S12144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 236--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nLEADERSHIP OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE BY YASSER ARAFAT IS A HINDRANCE TO \n PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THAT SUCH PEACE DEPENDS ON INSTITUTIONS \n                    FREE FROM THE TAINT OF TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 236\n\n       Whereas unemployment among Palestinians has risen to 50 \n     percent, and 59 percent of the Palestinian people live below \n     the poverty line;\n       Whereas a June 2003 independent poll indicated that the \n     Palestinian people do not see Yasser Arafat, the president of \n     the Palestinian Authority, contributing to an end to their \n     suffering;\n       Whereas the June 2003 poll found that 84 percent of \n     Palestinians believe corruption exists in the institutions of \n     the Palestinian Authority, and \\2/3\\ of those who believe \n     there is corruption also believe that corruption will \n     increase or remain the same in the future;\n       Whereas Yasser Arafat has steadfastly blocked attempts at \n     political, judicial, and economic reforms by using the Fatah \n     Central Committee and the Palestinian Legislative Council to \n     obstruct efforts to bring greater transparency and \n     accountability to the Palestinian Authority;\n       Whereas the international community has lost confidence in \n     the ability of the current Palestinian leadership to confront \n     terrorism;\n       Whereas Palestinian Security Forces have refused to \n     confront and dismantle Palestinian Islamic Jihad, whose \n     express goal is the elimination of the State of Israel, and \n     Hamas, both of which have been responsible for terrorist \n     attacks that have killed over 800 Israelis in the last 3 \n     years;\n       Whereas Abu Mazen, the first ever Palestinian Prime \n     Minister, recently resigned because Yasser Arafat refused to \n     turn over full control of the Palestinian Authority's 53,000-\n     man security apparatus to the duly appointed government and \n     continued to wield power over the General Intelligence \n     Apparatus, the National Security Force, and the elite \n     bodyguard unit known as Force 17;\n       Whereas the dismantling of terrorist organizations is a \n     precondition to a comprehensive peace in the Middle East;\n       Whereas Yasser Arafat can no longer be trusted by the \n     international community or the 3,500,000 Palestinian people \n     living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to be an honest broker \n     for peace; and\n       Whereas Yasser Arafat has presided over a period of decay \n     in economic and security conditions affecting the Palestinian \n     people and has impeded any meaningful progress toward peace \n     in the Middle East: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the leadership of the Palestinian people by Yasser \n     Arafat, who has condoned terror and refused to dismantle \n     terror organizations, is a hindrance to efforts to reach a \n     comprehensive peace in the Middle East; and\n       (2) peace in the Middle East depends on the construction of \n     independent, transparent, and accountable institutions that \n     are free from the taint of terrorism.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the struggle to win peace in the Middle \nEast is at a critical juncture. In one direction lies more of the same: \nConstant fear, the old hatreds, terrorist murders and retaliations that \ntoo often claim innocent lives, as well.\n  Down the other road are lasting peace and security for Israel and a \nself-ruled homeland for the people called Palestinians.\n  If we want to move in this direction, we must shed the baggage of the \npast. If we stick with the same old formula, we will only repeat the \nviolent cycle that has persisted for far too long. I don't claim to \nhave all the answers about how to achieve peace in this very troubled \nregion. But there is one thing I do know: Yasser Arafat must go. He \nmust go now.\n  We look all over at his tracks. They are tracks he cannot cover.\n  In the Las Vegas Sun newspaper on September 28 there was an editorial \nwritten by Michael O'Callaghan who has been in the newspaper business \nsince 1978. Prior to that he was Governor of the State of Nevada for \ntwo terms, probably the most popular Governor ever elected in the State \nof Nevada. But for many years he has been a newspaper man. He writes in \nthis column, among other things:\n\n       What peace lovers over the world have received from Arafat \n     is more bloodshed and the increased use of suicide bombers. \n     Arafat in return has become wealthy from funds provided by \n     the United States and other nations trying to encourage him \n     to practice good government to provide for his people. His \n     siphoning off of funds was exposed years ago . . .\n\n  This practice is not acceptable even though it is by some leaders in \nthat part of the world, he writes, in part.\n\n[[Page S12144]]\n\n  He further states:\n\n       Ten days ago a new audit was released that shows that \n     Arafat has diverted at least another $900 million of public \n     money into his own special bank account. This is being done \n     while the Palestinian people continue to suffer from housing \n     shortages and high unemployment. Arafat makes sure they have \n     enough explosives and weapons to kill Israelis when they get \n     bored. The Palestinian people continue to live in misery \n     while Arafat's wife and daughter reside in France living in \n     luxury.\n\n  Michael O`Callaghan writes more, but I think we get the point.\n  Arafat must go. He is a man of hate. Arafat is a man of hate. Since \n1948 he has resented the very existence of Israel. He might say his \nviews have changed, but as my mother used to say, actions speak louder \nthan words. And by his actions we know Arafat for what he is, a \nbankrupt and corrupt leader of a badly suffering people, and someone \nwho is not serious about achieving lasting peace.\n  We know that elements with varying degrees of affiliation with the \nPLO, including the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and Force 17, have \nfrequently been involved in violence against innocent Israelis.\n  We know that documents found at Arafat's compound, with his \nsignature, authorized cash payments to members of the Martyrs Brigade. \nWe know the leader of the Martyrs Brigade said he is ``following the \norders of Yasser Arafat.'' We know that former Palestinian Prime \nMinister Mahmoud Abbas resigned because Arafat refused to surrender \nsecurity for Palestinian security forces.\n\n  Why did Arafat undermine Abbas? It is simple. He does not want peace \nwith Israel. Forget what he says, look at his actions.\n  Since the cease-fire in the Middle East was announced 3 months ago, \nthere have been at least 240 terrorist attacks on Israel. This happened \nwhile Arafat stood by failing to engage security forces of the \nPalestinians.\n  Since Arafat took control of the Palestinian Authority, hundreds of \nIsraelis have been murdered. But his stubborn refusal to accept peace \nhas made life miserable for the 3.35 million Palestinian people in the \nwest bank and the Gaza strip.\n  We know that Prime Minister Barak courageously gave Arafat everything \nhe asked, but Arafat could not take yes for an answer because he is a \nterrorist and cannot get that out of his blood.\n  Today, half of all Palestinians are unemployed and 59 percent live in \npoverty. This misery breeds desperation which suits the purposes of \nArafat and other terrorists. In the midst of this desperation he \ncontrols personal war chests of tens of millions of dollars, if not \nhundreds of millions, with investments across the world. He spends his \nmoney as he pleases and is accountable to only one person: Yasser \nArafat, himself.\n  It is in this milieu that Arafat stands by as desperate young men and \nwomen commit suicide murders in exchange for large sums of money for \ntheir families and a promise of eternal paradise for themselves. They \nwaste their young lives and murder innocent Israelis.\n  It is now time to hold Yasser Arafat accountable. If he cares about \nhis people, there are other leaders there who could carry on and do a \ngood job for the Palestinian people. But he cares about Yasser Arafat. \nIt is time we hold this man accountable.\n  I am submitting this resolution right now, along with Senator \nDaschle, calling upon Arafat to immediately resign his position as \nPresident of the Palestinian National Authority because he is a \nhindrance to peace in the Middle East and that such peace depends on \ninstitutions that are free from the taint of terrorism. That is the \nonly way Palestinian people will ever achieve their dream of a free, \nself-governed homeland.\n  Let me be clear, I support the people of Palestine. They have a right \nto self-rule. They have a right to control it themselves. But I also \nsupport strongly Israel's right to live in peace and to defend itself \nagainst terrorism. Israel is at war against terrorism just as we are, \nbut even more amplified. We can never accept or tolerate terrorism in \nany form at any time any place in the world.\n  In the name of peace in the middle East and in the world, in the name \nof prosperity and self-rule for the Palestinian people, Yasser Arafat \nmust go.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor and rise in strong \nsupport of the resolution submitted by the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader, Senator Reid, this afternoon.\n  It was 3 years ago that we had an opportunity to bring real peace to \nthe region. In September of 2000 there was a great deal of optimism, a \ngreat deal of hope, a great promise that after months and months of \nnegotiation we could have finally found a peaceful resolution and move \nto the next step in the peaceful coexistence of people in the Middle \nEast.\n  For reasons still unclear, Yasser Arafat walked away from that \nagreement, disappointing, disillusioning, and, in so many ways, \nundermining the peace process.\n  Over the course of the last 3 years, 800 Israelis have been killed, \n2,400 Palestinians have died.\n  Where he has had an opportunity to renounce violence, he has condoned \nit. Where he has had an opportunity to embrace peace, he has repelled \nit. At virtually every turn, regardless of circumstance, Mr. Arafat \nsends the wrong message about leadership, about commitment, about the \nspirit that was so alive just 3 years ago.\n  In the creation of a new government, Mr. Arafat had yet another \nopportunity to stand behind his new Prime Minister, Abu Mazen, and to \nsay, through him and through this new office: We will resolve our \ndifferences. We will bring violence to an end. We will find ways with \nwhich to establish a peaceful coexistence. Yet he chose once again to \nwalk away from that opportunity, if not undermine it in every way.\n  Now there is a new government, at least under consideration. Again, \nArafat sends all the wrong messages about what he expects from that new \ngovernment, its allegiance to him, not to the process, not to the \npeople, not to a commitment for a better future--it is to him.\n  Some of us want to use this occasion, through this resolution, to \nmake it clear that Mr. Arafat has been an impediment to peace. Mr. \nArafat has done virtually everything to thwart peace. As a result, we \nfind ourselves in a situation far worse than it was just 3 years ago. \nIt is a tragedy--a tragedy that has amounted to the loss of 3,200 lives \nin 3 years.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in sending a clear message that we \ncannot have peace, we cannot have any expectation, any hope of \nstability and the realization within our grasp that death can end, \nwithout sending a clear message to those responsible: We cannot \ntolerate this kind of leadership. We cannot tolerate this kind of \nirresponsible and dangerous direction. We will speak out in every way, \nshape, and form we can until this matter is resolved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID.
