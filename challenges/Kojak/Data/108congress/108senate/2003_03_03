Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Craig \nbe recognized for 15 minutes and then Senator Bingaman for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n\n          Massive Government Subsidies to Hynix Semiconductor\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to visit with my colleagues \nabout something that is going on in Idaho and across this Nation at \nthis moment that is critical to our economy, and especially critical to \nthe economy of the State of Idaho. The situation that a company in \nIdaho finds itself in at this moment has resulted in its need to lay \noff 10 percent of its workforce because of actions taken by the Korean \nGovernment to prop up a bankrupt competitor of Micron.\n  Micron is a company in Idaho that has been in place and is the \nworld's second largest producer of memory chips. As a result of the \nKorean Government's propping up of the Hynix Semiconductor Corporation, \nthe market now is tremendously softened and layoffs are occurring.\n  In the mid-1980s, Micron almost went out of business because of \ndumping by Japanese companies. At that time, I acted in concert with \nthe Bush Government. President Bush at that time worked with the \nDepartment of Commerce to put duties on that offset, but eventually \nthat overrode that impact and it allowed that company, Micron, to \nbecome the second larger of the semiconductor companies in the world \ntoday.\n  Micron, as I mentioned, is critical to the technological base of the \nUnited States. It employs 13,000 people--invaluable high-tech jobs in \nthe U.S. and in other parts of the world. It produces D-RAM \nsemiconductors, or random memory chips, a key component in countless \nelectronic systems, from personal computers to satellites to military \ncommand and control systems.\n\n  Most importantly, Micron is the only remaining producer of D-RAM \nchips in the United States. There used to be a half dozen of these \ncompanies a decade ago, but they all left the business in large part \ndue to the unfair trade practices of other countries such as and \nincluding Korea.\n  Now I believe I must do what I can to address this new situation that \nis costing U.S. jobs in the United States, is weakening our technology \nbase, and is having a substantial impact on the State of Idaho.\n  My bill, introduced last week, S. 492, reflects just how far, in my \nopinion, the Government of Korea has pushed with what I call illegal \nsubsidies, and it reflects just how far I think we must go to respond \nto that situation.\n  My bill would impose a duty on Hynix semiconductors as they come into \nthe country. My bill ``suspends liquidation'' for these Korean \nsemiconductors, which is another way of saying it watches them at the \nborder. Then my bill requires a cash deposit of estimated \ncountervailing duties in the 80-percent range. That is a serious step. \nYet it is a legal and an appropriate step and, yes, it is actionable \nunder the WTO, but it focuses us as a country on the problem we are \nfacing with this kind of competition that I believe is illegal and is \nheavily Government supported.\n  I am angry, and I say that straightforwardly, at the Government of \nKorea and their continued unrelenting campaign of illegal subsidies to \nHynix in an attempt to bring our domestic producer not only to its \nknees, but to destroy it altogether and then dominate the semiconductor \nindustry.\n  Since October of 2000, the Korean Government, acting through the \nbanks it owns and controls, has provided an incredible $16 billion--let \nme repeat that--the banks of Korea have provided an incredible $16 \nbillion in subsidies to Hynix, the Korean producer of D-RAM \nsemiconductors. How much has our Federal Government subsidized Micron? \nNada; not one bit.\n  I think it is time we at least put up a barrier and test the \ninternational trade community to understand whether this is or is not \nan illegal action. We have that argument before the ITC at this moment. \nWe hope there is a finding soon. But until then, I hope this Senate and \nthe Finance Committee can come on point to recognize the critical \nenvironment that is being created by a company such as Hynix and a \ngovernment backing them that strictly supports them for the purpose of \ndominating a world market and keeping its people employed.\n  In the 1990s, Government-controlled banks in Korea lent heavily to \nHynix at cheap rates, and Hynix built up massive capacity, over 90 \npercent of which it exports. Ninety percent of what it produces in \nKorea leaves for the world market.\n  The Government of Korea built up this company with one goal in mind: \nto create an export powerhouse. It succeeded, and Hynix became the No. \n3 producer of D-RAM chips in the world.\n  When Hynix became unable to repay the debt coming due in 2001, the \nGovernment of Korea stepped in and essentially wiped out the debt by \nproviding over $16 billion in debt forgiveness and debt restructuring \nover the past 2\\1/2\\ years. There is no rational economic justification \nfor Government support for Hynix. Hynix has been unable to repay its \ndebt, and it has lost $8 billion over the past 3 years. The subsidies \nit has received have permitted Hynix to stay in business and continue \nto run all its D-RAM plants at full capacity, flooding the market with \nsubsidized product.\n\n  They cannot make money. They have lost money, $8 billion over the \nlast 3 years; and yet the Government still dumps money into them, and \nthey are dumping money into them at a time when they are out building \nnew capacity. The most recent Hynix bailout came 2 months ago when the \nGovernment provided $4.1 billion in debt relief and another $4.1 \nbillion in subsidy. Hynix only had $2.4 billion in sales last year. It \njust does not add up. Take a chalkboard out and outline that for the \nworld to see, and the world will say that is a Government-controlled, \nGovernment-subsidized plant that is not even making a profit and, in \nfact, is losing large amounts of money.\n  Hynix will use the debt forgiveness to continue to expand capacity. \nJust last week--this is almost like a slap in the face to the American \nworkforce and to Micron and its companies--just last week Hynix \nannounced it would begin work on new fabrication lines to produce D-\nRAMs on state-of-the-art 300 mm wafers which will result in even more \nsubsidized D-RAM from Hynix. They cannot make a profit, they are being \nsubsidized heavily, and they are going to build more capacity. That \ndoes not make any sense at all, but then again putting a lot of people \nout of work in Idaho does not make any sense either when we are asking \na company to compete against this producer at well below market prices.\n  Now we read in the papers that Hynix and other Hyundai companies are \nbeing investigated for illegally transferring $500 million to North \nKorea in 2000. If that is true, that is a real slap in the face of \nAmericans and the American worker. Of course, they did that for \nlucrative contracts. It did so with the help of South Korean banks and \nwith the approval of the President of South Korea. I say that again. \nNorth Korea is being investigated for illegal actions with that \ncountry. This is the country that plans to reactivate its nuclear arms \nprogram and, we are now told, has just started one of its reactors. I \nhope the world will not tolerate this situation, and I hope our Senate \nwill speak up to the issue.\n  Korea is a developed country. It is one of the most developed \neconomies in Asia. The Korean Government has absolutely no business \nkeeping a company going when it would otherwise be bankrupt, and there \nis no question about it. Like I said, pull a chalkboard out, and run \nthose figures. You have one conclusion: Unless your banker or your best \nfriend--and in this instance, the bank is the best friend. The \nGovernment owns the bank and the bank owns the company and you bail \nthem out for $16 billion. The purpose is obvious.\n  The purpose of my legislation is to urge the Department of Commerce \nand other U.S. trade agencies to do everything in their power to fix \nthis problem. That is what our trade laws are for. Do I like doing what \nI am doing? Absolutely not. Will I apologize for trying to protect an \nAmerican company and a workforce against a heavily subsidized \ndominating company that wants to control the world marketplace with an \nundercost product? No, I will not apologize for that whatsoever.\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\n  Is the action I take if the Senate were to pass my bill and were it \nto become law actionable at the WTO? Absolutely, and it ought to be to \ntest whether what we have done is appropriate or whether, in fact, what \nKorea is doing at this moment is illegal, as I believe it is, and as I \nthink the world marketplace would believe and the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Once again, the ITC is reviewing this. We hope by late March that \ndecision will be out there. The European Union is already reviewing \nHynix. I am told they are finding them in violation. Why should \nAmerican workers, Idaho workers, a great American company, one of the \ngreat American success stories, have to shut itself down and put itself \nin financial stress because it is being dumped on in a world market?\n  Those are the problems we face. That is why I have introduced the \nlegislation. My colleague, Senator Crapo, has introduced a resolution \nand has spoken to it. On the House side, Congressman Butch Otter speaks \nto it. Clearly, Idaho and Idaho's economy will take a tremendous hit \nbecause the Koreans are illegally playing the world trade game, heavily \nsubsidized by their banks and by their government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous consent, the \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 1 \nminute. I do have the approval of the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Idaho. He \nhas called it exactly the way it is. What is going on is a matter of \nunfair competition. It is a matter of improper governmental \nsubsidization in competition with a company that is doing it all \nwithout government subsidization. I personally thank him for his good \nremarks; I agree with them and I would like to be associated with them.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Lack Of SPR Policy\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to speak for a \nfew minutes about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the lack of \naction by the administration to deal with the problems we see in our \noil markets today. What we are seeing by the administration is not bad \npolicy, as such. What it is is a lack of policy for how we will use the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve at a critical time such as the one we are \nin today. This indecision, this failure to articulate a policy, is \nhurting consumers and it is hurting our economy.\n  We have an oil supply crisis on our hands right now. Oil prices hit \n$40 a barrel last week. Domestic crude and product stocks are at an \nall-time low and oil prices are now hovering at levels that we have not \nseen since the gulf war. High energy prices such as this do hurt \nconsumers and the economy. The question is, What has the administration \ndone to minimize this economic pain that Americans are feeling?\n  The average consumer may not know what the price of oil is on a daily \nbasis, but the average consumer does know the price of gasoline at the \npump, and American consumers have had to bear the brunt of several \nweeks of very high gasoline prices while Saudi Arabia has been ramping \nup their production to maintain, if not to increase, their market \nshare.\n  I do not know the connection between our national policy and Saudi \nArabia's maintenance of market share. That has not been explained to \nme. But last fall, after the elections, when crude supply was first \nimpacted and prices began to rise, the administration was urged to act \nto do a test sale of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil by several oil \nanalysts.\n  A Strategic Petroleum Reserve release on this small scale would have \nbeen appropriate then. It would have been a simple statement outlining \nthe administration's SPR policy, and it would have helped to calm \njittery markets, which is certainly what we have seen in recent days \nand weeks. The situation we now face, in which the curtailment of oil \nsupplies is hurting our national economic security, is precisely what \nwe foresaw when Congress created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The \ncurtailment has been months in the making. The current crisis in \nVenezuela has pushed the supply situation to a level that is beyond \n``severe''.\n  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established in 1975, in direct \nresponse to the Arab oil embargo. Today, the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve contains a total of 599.3 million barrels, almost 60 days' \nworth of imports. When this body considered the Omnibus Appropriations \nAct for 2003, I offered an amendment to extend our authority to use the \nSPR. That authority was set to expire later this year. I am pleased \nthat the Senate adopted that provision and that as a result we have \nanother 5 years of authority during which we can use SPR as a response \nto oil supply crises.\n  However, the authority was enacted for a reason. There is a supply \nproblem. We have known this for some time now. In December, 3 million \nbarrels of Venezuelan crude came off the market altogether. This has \nhad a larger supply impact than removing all Iraqi crude will have \nunder a war scenario, which we all, I believe, consider to be very \nlikely.\n  Prior to December 2002, Venezuela was one of the world's five largest \noil exporters. Its net exports averaged 2.4 million barrels per day. \nDuring the first 9 months of 2002, oil from Venezuela supplied \napproximately 14 percent of U.S. net oil imports, or about 1.5 million \nbarrels per day.\n\n  The United States depends on Venezuela for substantial volumes of \ngasoline imports as well as oil imports. A 10-week general strike in \nVenezuela has resulted in a sharp decrease in Venezuela's exports to \nthe United States. The strike comes at a time when markets are already \ntight.\n  On Tuesday, in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, we \nheard testimony from the Secretary of Energy that everything was \ngetting better in Venezuela, that the crisis was passing. Recent \nevents, though, suggest that this may not be the case. A key factor in \nthe uncertainty that is keeping prices up is the uncertainty \nsurrounding the administration's intentions about using the SPR. A \nclear statement from the administration of the conditions under which \noil would be released from the SPR would have an immediate effect on \nlowering oil prices.\n  A cryptic phrase that is used by the administration is that they \nwould release oil from the SPR only in the case of ``a severe supply \ndisruption.'' But since the administration will not elaborate on what a \nsevere supply disruption entails, the suspicion is that they will never \nrelease oil from SPR absent an all out war in the Persian Gulf that \ninvolves major damage to Saudi oilfields. For that reason, the \npsychology of the market largely discounts the existence of the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve at this time, and consumers are paying all-\ntime high prices at the pump.\n  Gas prices have risen more than 30 cents a gallon since December. Gas \nprices are high in part because our crude stocks are down. We are \noperating at minimum operating levels in the refining sector. With high \ncrude prices, increased refining output means even higher prices at the \npump.\n  Demand for gasoline is high as we head into the driving season. Since \nmost spare capacity in the market is in the Middle East, it is going to \ntake awhile to get the oil we need. It does not take much to send \nprices spiking again. Cold weather can do it. Disruption in supply from \nVenezuela or Nigeria could do it. War in the gulf could do it.\n  My colleagues have listened to many speeches over the last year \nbemoaning the fact we do not have an energy policy. I am not going to \nask that we come to closure today on a universal, all-encompassing, \ncomprehensive energy policy. I would settle for a single action by the \nadministration. That would be a clearly enunciated and understandable \npolicy for when we will use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  The administration may be sufficiently captive to a minimalist \nideology in dealing with this oil crisis, that they never actually plan \nto use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and I hope very much that is \nnot the case.\n  I call on the President to give us a clear and understandable signal \nas to what his policy is. Merely saying we\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nwill wait for a severe supply disruption is not an adequate response. \nConsumers deserve more. The costs to our economy may become \nunacceptable. It certainly is a severe issue weighing down our economy \nat the present time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Measure Placed on Calendar--H.R. 534\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as in legislative session, I understand \nH.R. 534 is at the desk and is due for its second reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The clerk will read the title of the bill for the second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 534) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \n     prohibit human cloning.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I object to further proceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection having been heard, the bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask we now go back into executive \nsession.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in executive session.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it has now been nearly 4 weeks since we \nbegan debating the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. We have heard all of the \narguments for and against his nomination. What we have not heard is a \ngood reason why this filibuster should continue. We have not heard any \ngood reason why his nomination should not be brought for an up or down \nvote.\n  One of the reasons that some of my Democratic colleagues say they \noppose Mr. Estrada is because he allegedly did not answer their \nquestions at his hearing. I do find this complaint unpersuasive, \nparticularly given that (1) the hearing was chaired by a Democratic \nSenator, (2) the hearing lasted all day, (3) Mr. Estrada answered \nquestion after question on a broad variety of topics, and (4) every \ncommittee member had the right to ask Mr. Estrada follow-up questions \nin writing but only two did.\n  Nevertheless, in a letter dated last Thursday, February 27, 2003, \nWhite House Counsel Alberto Gonzales sent a letter to all 100 Senators \ndirecting them to additional sources of information on Miguel Estrada. \nThis is an important letter, and I will take a moment to read the \nletter:\n\n       Dear Senator Frist, Senator Daschle, Senator Hatch, and \n     Senator Leahy: I write in connection with the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada. Some Democrat Senators have indicated that \n     they would like to know more about Mr. Estrada's record \n     before a vote occurs. As I stated in my letter of February 12 \n     to Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy, we believe that the \n     Senate has had sufficient time and possesses sufficient \n     information to vote on Miguel Estrada. More important, a \n     majority of Senators have indicated that they posses \n     sufficient information and would vote to confirm him.\n       But if some Senators believe they must have more \n     information before they will end the filibuster of this \n     nomination, we respectfully suggest that there are three \n     different and important sources of information that have been \n     and remain available and that would appropriately accommodate \n     the request for additional information. We ask that you \n     encourage interested Senators to avail themselves of these \n     sources as soon as possible.\n       First, as I have written to you previously, individual \n     Senators who wish to meet with Miguel Estrada may and should \n     do so immediately. We continue to believe that such meetings \n     could be very useful to Senators who wish to learn more about \n     Mr. Estrada's record and character.\n       Second, Senators who have additional questions for Mr. \n     Estrada should immediately pose such questions in writing to \n     him. We propose that additional questions (in a reasonable \n     number) be submitted in writing to Mr. Estrada by Friday, \n     February 28. Mr. Estrada would endeavor to answer such \n     questions in writing by Tuesday, March 4. He would answer the \n     questions forthrightly, appropriately, and in a manner \n     consistent with the traditional practice and obligations of \n     judicial nominees, as he has before.\n       Third, Senators who wish to know more about Mr. Estrada's \n     performance and approach when working in the United States \n     Government--and, in particular, how that relates to his \n     possible future performance as a Circuit Judge--should \n     immediately ask in writing for the views of the Solicitors \n     General, United States Attorney, and Judges for whom Mr. \n     Estrada worked and ask them to respond by Tuesday, March 4. \n     In particular, interested Senators could immediately send a \n     joint letter to each of the following individuals for whom \n     Mr. Estrada has worked in the United States Government: Judge \n     Amalya Kearse, Justice Anthony Kennedy, former United States \n     Attorney Otto Obermaier, former Solicitor General Ken Starr, \n     former Solicitor General Drew Days, former Solicitor General \n     Walter Dellinger, and former Solicitor General Seth Waxman. \n     In our judgment, these men and women could provide their \n     views on Mr. Estrada's background and suitability to be a \n     Circuit Judge by March 4 without sacrificing the integrity of \n     the decisionmaking processes of the Judiciary, United States \n     Attorney's office, and Solicitor General officer. And their \n     views could assist Senators who seek more information about \n     Mr. Estrada.\n       We believe that these sources of information, which have \n     been available for some time, would readily accommodate the \n     desire for additional information expressed by some Senators \n     who have thus far supported the filibuster of a vote on this \n     nominee. We ask that you encourage Senators who have objected \n     to the scheduling of a vote to avail themselves of these \n     sources of information. And we respectfully ask that the \n     Senate vote up or down as soon as possible on Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination, which has been pending for nearly two years.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. As far as I know, none of the Senators who have sought \nmore information about Mr. Estrada have availed themselves of any of \nthese sources. This brings to mind the story of the young man who \nkilled both his parents, then threw himself on the mercy of the court \nbecause he was an orphan. Here, my Democratic colleagues who are \ncomplaining the loudest about not having enough information about Mr. \nEstrada are the very ones who are apparently not interested in finding \nout more about him through readily available means. Meanwhile, the \nfilibuster goes on and on.\n  Another significant letter was circulated on Wednesday of last week, \nthis one signed by more than 50 of our colleagues in the House. This, \ntoo, is a powerful letter. Let me read the letter:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                February 26, 2003.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: It is our understanding that the major \n     objection raised by the Senate Democratic Leadership and many \n     members of the Senate Democratic Caucus to the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District \n     of Columbia Circuit is that you have not been provided \n     sufficient information about his legal views. Specifically, \n     we understand that you are opposing his nomination because of \n     the Administration's failure to provide you with internal \n     memoranda prepared by Mr. Estrada while he served as \n     Assistant to the Solicitor General.\n       We are deeply concerned that your objection to the \n     Administration's refusal to produce these memoranda not only \n     breaks with precedent but is also a threat to the ability of \n     Executive Branch Officials, members of the Judiciary, and \n     Members of Congress to receive confidential legal advice.\n       As you are no doubt aware, the Clinton Administration \n     memoranda you are requesting in the case of Mr. Estrada were \n     not requested for the seven previous nominees to the Courts \n     of Appeals who had worked in the Solicitor General's office. \n     Understandably, the improper appearance of a double standard \n     for this particular nominee has been created. In addition, \n     every living former Solicitor General--Democrat and \n     Republican--signed a joint letter to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, stating that the memoranda request would have a \n     debilitating effect on the ability of the Department of \n     Justice to represent the United States before the Supreme \n     Court.\n       Forcing the disclosure of confidential memoranda in this \n     instance would do serious institutional harm to all three \n     branches of government. For example, should legal memoranda \n     prepared for you by one of your staff be available for review \n     by future senators (or by the Administration) in the event \n     that the staff member were to be nominated or be considered \n     to a judicial or other post? This appears to be the precedent \n     you are attempting to set. As we trust you understand, such a \n     precedent would no doubt impact the type and quality of \n     advice we seek and receive from our staff.\n       We strongly urge you to reconsider your objections and drop \n     your request for the confidential memoranda of the Clinton \n     Justice Department.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stood on the Senate floor last week when \nthe debate on Mr. Estrada's nomination entered its third week, and I \nsaid that there is a simple solution to the logjam\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\nthat has become the Senate. It is a straightforward solution that does \nnot require the release of confidential memoranda or questionable \nclaims that Mr. Estrada failed to answer questions before the \ncommittee. The solution is for Senators to vote on Mr. Estrada's \nnomination. Vote for him or vote against him; do what your conscience \ndictates. Just vote.\n  One reason I believe we are not voting, and the filibuster continues, \nis because our friends on the other side of the aisle know Mr. Estrada \nhas enough votes to be confirmed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia.\n  I have mentioned before that Mr. Estrada has a substantial and \nimpressive record, despite the claims to the contrary of some of my \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  One very substantial part of his record consists of the 15 cases he \nhas argued before the United States Supreme Court. In each of these \ncases, a brief was filed that is publicly available for everyone and \nanyone to review. And in each of these cases, there is a transcript of \nMr. Estrada's argument before Supreme Court.\n  The briefs and transcripts of each of Mr. Estrada's 15 Supreme Court \ncases are right here. As you can see, there is a very substantial \nrecord on Mr. Estrada. I invite any one of my Democratic colleagues who \nhave not reviewed or acknowledged this record to do so. You can get a \npretty good idea of the cases he argued, the reasoning he used, the \nlegality that he cites, the law he applies--more than almost any other \nnominee for the Circuit Court of Appeals in the history of the country.\n  But in case any of my Democratic colleagues are finding themselves \nshort on time these days--after all, perpetuating a filibuster does \nrequire a substantial amount of effort--I want to spend a few moments \non the cases Mr. Estrada argued before the Supreme Court. A look at \nthese cases and the significance of the legal issues argued in them \nshould dispel any notion that Mr. Estrada has no record.\n  Let's start with the 1999 case of Strickler v. Greene, which Mr. \nEstrada argued pro bono on behalf of a death row inmate. He argued that \nthe Commonwealth of Virginia violated the seminal Supreme Court case of \nBrady v. Maryland by withholding material exculpatory evidence. \nAlthough he spent hundreds of hours in his quest to overturn Tommy Lee \nStrickler's death sentence, he lost the case by a 7-2 margin.\n  In another case, Richards v. Wisconsin, Mr. Estrada argued on behalf \nof the United States as amicus curiae that it generally is reasonable \nfor police officers who have a warrant to search a dwelling for \nevidence of drug trafficking, to enter the dwelling to execute the \nwarrant without a prior announcement of their presence and purpose. A \nunanimous Supreme Court agreed with him; he won 9-0.\n  In the case of Old Chief v. United States, Mr. Estrada argued for the \nUnited States that the district court properly exercised its \ndiscretion, in a prosecution of a convicted felon for possession of a \nfirearm, to admit evidence of the defendant's prior felony conviction \neven though the defendant offered to stipulate to that fact. He \nnarrowly lost that case by a 5-4 margin.\n  The case of United States v. Gonzales dealt with 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 924(c), which provides that ``[n]otwithstanding any other \nprovision of law'' prison terms under the statute ``shall [not] run \nconcurrently with any other terms of imprisonment.'' Mr. Estrada argued \non behalf of the United States that a court may not order that a \nsentence imposed under Sec. 924(c) is to run concurrently with a State-\nlaw sentence that the defendant is already serving. He won this case 7-\n2.\n  In Montana v. Egelhoff, Mr. Estrada argued for the United States as \namicus curiae that the Due Process Clause does not bar a State form \npreventing a jury in a criminal case from considering evidence of the \ndefendant's voluntary intoxication in determining whether he possessed \nthe mental state required for the crime charge. He won this case 5-4.\n  In Degen v. United States, Mr. Estrada argued for the United States \nthat the district court had properly invoked the so-called fugitive \ndisentitlement doctrine to bar the petitioner from contesting a civil \nforfeiture action. A unanimous Supreme Court ruled against him in this \ncase, which, of course, just goes to show that you can't win them all.\n  Mr. Estrada did score a unanimous victory in Citizens Bank v. \nStrumph. In that case, Mr. Estrada argued on behalf of the United \nStates as amicus curiae that a bank's temporary refusal to pay a debt \nupon the debtor's demand was not an exercise of its setoff right in \nviolation of Sec. 326 of the Bankruptcy Code, which stays a creditor's \nright of setoff pending an orderly determination of the debtor's and \ncreditor's rights.\n  The case of Reno v. Koray considered 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3585, which \nprovides that a criminal defendant generally must ``be given credit \ntoward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent \nin official detention prior to the date the sentence commences.'' Mr. \nEstrada argued for the United States that a Federal prisoner does not \nreceive credit on his sentence for time he spent released on bail. He \nwon this cases 8-1.\n  In United States v. Robertson, Mr. Estrada argued on behalf of the \nUnited States that the interstate movement of goods and people in \nconnection with the operation of a gold mine is sufficient to justify \nthe conclusion that the activities of the gold mine affect interstate \ncommerce within the meaning of the RICO statute. He won this case 9-0.\n  In United States v. Mezzanatto, Mr. Estrada argued on behalf of the \nUnited States that the Government may use statements made in the course \nof plea discussions to impeach a criminal defendant's contrary \ntestimony at trial, when the defendant and his counsel expressly agreed \nbefore those statements were made that the government would have the \nright to use them. He won this case 7-2.\n\n  In United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, Mr. Estrada argued for the \nUnited States that a delay between a defendant's arrest on State \nnarcotics charges and presentment to a Federal magistrate on subsequent \nFederal charges did not require suppression of an inculpatory statement \nto Federal agents that was made while defendant was in custody on the \nState charges. He won this case 9-0.\n  The case of Powell v. Nevada considered the rule of County of \nRiverside v. McLaughlin, which provides that a judicial probable cause \ndetermination must be made within 48 hours of a warrantless arrest. Mr. \nEstrada argued on behalf of the United States as amicus curiae that the \nrule did not apply retroactively. The Supreme Court ruled against his \nposition 7-2.\n  In NOW v. Scheidler, Mr. Estrada argued on behalf of the United \nStates as amicus curiae that RICO does not require proof that either \nthe racketeering enterprise or the predicate acts of racketeering were \nmotivated by an economic purpose. It just so happens that in this case, \nthe defendant against whom Mr. Estrada argued was an abortion \nprotestor, and Mr. Estrada argued on the same side as NOW. His position \nprevailed when an unanimous court agreed with him.\n  In Austin v. United States, Mr. Estrada argued for the United States \nthat the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines clause does not apply to \ncivil forfeiture proceedings. He lost this case 9-0.\n  Last but not least, in Deal v. United States, Mr. Estrada argued for \nthe United States that a defendant who is convicted in a single \nproceeding of multiple violations of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c) is not \nsubject to the statute's provisions imposing a more severe sentence for \na ``second or subsequent conviction.'' He won this case 6-3.\n  What these cases show, Mr. President, is that in 6 years Mr. Estrada \ncompiled an impressive record before the Supreme Court. He argued 15 \ncases, winning 10 of them. In half of those cases, he won in a \nunanimous decision. There can be no question that Mr. Estrada has a \nrecord that anyone would be proud of by any standard.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2996]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there are a couple things I will speak \nabout during this period of time: One, I do want to address myself to \nthe issue now before us; that is, the issue of whether or not Miguel \nEstrada should proceed to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Then I will talk a little while about the events over the \nweekend as they pertain to the looming war in Iraq.\n  But as pertains to Mr. Estrada, as long as this person is in front of \nus on the floor of the Senate, as long as my good friend from Utah \nkeeps taking the floor to ask for a vote on Mr. Estrada, this Senator \nwill continue to take the floor to continue to remind my good friend \nfrom Utah of what happened to Bonnie Campbell under the Clinton \nadministration when the Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee.\n  My friend, the Senator from Utah said:\n\n       An up-or-down vote, that is all we ask. If the Democrats \n     have enough votes to defeat Miguel Estrada, I am not going to \n     complain about it. I might feel badly about it. I might think \n     it is the wrong thing to do, but they have a right to do \n     that. If my colleagues disagree, and don't like this, they \n     can speak out, they can give their reasoning and vote no. \n     Politics ought to be left out of it.\n\n  It is unfortunate we did not hear that when President Clinton's \nnominees were sent to the Senate for confirmation. In fact, I said the \nsame thing as my friend from Utah said at the time on the nomination of \nBonnie Campbell to serve on the Eighth Circuit. Bonnie Campbell is a \nformer attorney general of the State of Iowa, an individual who, by all \nreckoning, did an outstanding job at the Department of Justice, heading \nthe Office of Violence Against Women.\n\n  She was nominated by President Clinton to be on the Eighth Circuit, \nand we could not even get a vote on her. She received her hearing in \nMay of 2000 and answered whatever questions were propounded to her. She \nstood willing to produce any and all documents she had ever written for \nanyone. No, not once did any Republican Senator complain that Bonnie \nCampbell was not forthcoming. In fact, I am told that not once did a \nRepublican Senator complain that a Clinton nominee did not adequately \nanswer these questions.\n  So here she was, ready to answer, ready to move on. The hearing was \nheld. She had the ABA stamp of approval. As I said, she had a long and \ndistinguished history in the field of law. There were Members on both \nsides of the aisle who supported her nomination. Both Senator Grassley \nand I, from the State of Iowa, supported her nomination.\n  On September 21, 2000, I said right here:\n\n       If, for some reason, you think she is unqualified--I can't \n     imagine why--then cast your vote, but at least let's bring \n     the nominee to the floor. This, I think, is a black mark on \n     the operations of the Senate, another indication of how the \n     leadership of this Senate refuses to do the people's \n     business, to let things come out on the floor so we can vote \n     things up or down.\n\n  On October 3, 2000, I said:\n\n       It is clear who is playing politics with judgeships.\n       The Republican leadership of the Senate is playing the most \n     bold-faced politics. It is not alleged these nominees are not \n     qualified; it is simply they were nominated by a Democratic \n     President. That is all.\n\n  I have not heard one person on the Republican side tell me that \nBonnie Campbell is not qualified to be a circuit judge.\n  Then during the month of October 2000, I brought up Bonnie Campbell's \nnomination seven times on the floor. I asked unanimous consent to go to \nit on the executive calendar, and seven times the Republican majority \nobjected.\n  My friend from Utah has talked about the Democrats' double standard. \nMy first instinct is to call that laughable, but in reality, it is \noutrageous because so many extremely well-qualified Clinton nominees \nnot only never got an up-or-down vote on the floor, they never got a \nvote on committee. In many cases, they didn't even get a hearing.\n  I mentioned this a week or so ago. My friend from Utah said Bonnie \nCampbell's nomination came too late in the last year of the last \nadministration. Well, I know for a fact two of Senator Kyl's district \njudges were nominated after Bonnie Campbell was nominated, and they \nwere confirmed on October 3, 2000. In fact, I have a list of all the \nClinton judicial nominees who were never allowed a vote. There were 79 \nwho were not confirmed--31 circuit, 48 district. Fifty-nine were never \neven allowed a vote. Allen Snyder, DC Circuit, never given a vote by \nRepublicans; Elena Kagen, DC Circuit, never given a vote by \nRepublicans; Robert Cindrich, Third Circuit, never given a vote by \nRepublicans. I will not read the whole list. There are 59 of them. But \nobviously one of those is Bonnie Campbell.\n  As long as Mr. Estrada is going to be here, I will keep reminding \npeople of what they did to someone eminently well qualified who \nanswered all the questions, was open to giving any writings, documents, \nor whatever anyone had asked of her. Yet she was stopped and wasn't \neven given a vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of all the \njudicial nominees who were not confirmed that President Clinton \nnominated, with a list of how many were never even given a vote.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSEVENTY-NINE CLINTON JUDICIAL NOMINEES NOT CONFIRMED IN CONGRESS FIRST \n                               NOMINATED\n\n(31 Circuit/48 District--59 of These Never Allowed Votes by Republican-\n                           Controlled Senate)\n\n     91 circuit court nominees (22 blocked from getting vote or \n     being confirmed)\n       Merrick Garland, D.C.

I want to address briefly the issue of whether or not \nthis is anti-Hispanic, something like that. I keep hearing this talk \nthat Democrats are going to be accused of being against Hispanics. \nAgain, we do have to point out some history.\n  Enrique Moreno, Jorge Rangel, and Christine Arguello were all \nnominated to the circuit courts by President Clinton, but were never \nafforded a hearing or vote in the Judiciary Committee under \nRepublicans. My colleague from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, was quoted in the \nDallas Morning News of January 31 of this year:\n\n       If we deny Mr. Estrada the position on the DC circuit, it \n     would be to shut the door on the American dream of Hispanic \n     Americans everywhere.\n\n  Well, let's take a look at the reality and the record. There are more \nthan 1,000 local, State, or Federal judges of Hispanic heritage. Yet \nPresident Bush has nominated only one Hispanic to any of the 42 vacant \nappellate positions. This administration has failed to nominate a \nsingle Hispanic judge for any of the circuits covering Texas, \nCalifornia, Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, New York, New Jersey, or \nPuerto Rico, where there are sizable minorities of Hispanic Americans. \nIn contrast, President Clinton nominated 11 Latinos to these circuit \ncourts and 21 to the district courts--quite a difference.\n  Again, my friend from Utah said on February 12:\n\n       What gets me is, we are in the middle of a filibuster of a \n     Federal judge when the Constitution says we should give \n     advice and consent, not advice and obstruction, not advice \n     and filibuster, not advice and unfairness.\n\n  Again, I wish I would have heard that when Bonnie Campbell had come \nup before the committee. As long as Mr. Estrada is here, I will \ncontinue, as I have today and as I have in the past, to bring up the \nissue of Bonnie Campbell because obviously it remains a dark mark on \nthe Senate, one that was held up simply for purely partisan political \nreasons and nothing else.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to talk about some of the events over the \nweekend as it pertains to the looming war in Iraq. I didn't listen to \nall of the talk shows, but if you listen to some of them and then you \nread some of the quotes in the paper by some of the people high up in \nthis administration, particularly meaning Under Secretary Paul \nWolfowitz and also Mr. Pearl, you come away with the feeling and the \nsense that they decided some time ago they were going to go to war \nagainst Saddam Hussein and Iraq, regardless. There is really nothing \nthat could be done that would in any way turn away the full force and \neffect of the U.S. military from a full scale war in Iraq. Because no \nmatter what happens, they have a counter, and they keep coming back to \nthe fact that it is too little, too late, we can't wait any longer for \ndisarmament. But the fact is, over the last 12 years, containment has \nworked. Even though we did not back it with as much force as we \nprobably should have at that time and the fact that we did withdraw our \ninspectors in the latter part of the 1990s, when that never should have \nbeen done, the fact is, during those 12 years, Saddam Hussein never \nmarched on another country, never started another war, and even though \nthis administration has tried their darnedest, they have never made a \nlink between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida.\n  Now they are talking about some guy who got injured in Afghanistan \nand he came to Baghdad to get his leg treated because he had his leg \namputated. He is somewhere around Baghdad, we don't know where. We \ndon't even know if he is there. They suspect he is there and that is \nproof that Saddam is working with al-Qaida.\n  Perhaps one of the most outlandish statements was a couple weeks ago \nwhen this purported tape of Osama bin Laden came out. Secretary Powell \nsaid at that time that--I am paraphrasing--this just goes to show you, \nonce again, the link between al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden and Saddam \nHussein, when in fact on the tape whoever is speaking, whether it was \nOsama bin Laden or not, is basically saying, it is all right to use \nSaddam Hussein to defeat the Americans, but it is not all right to \nsupport Saddam Hussein because he, too, is an infidel, not a true \nIslamist. Somehow we just ignore that. But there has never been a \nproven link, even though they have tried awfully hard to find one. So--\n--\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure, I will yield for a question, without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been listening to the Senator, and I will rebut his \nearlier remarks later.\n  Is the Senator aware of Mr. Zarqawi, who is in Iraq right now, who is \ndefinitely connected with the al-Qaida people?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator, is this the guy who went to get his \nleg amputated?\n  Mr. HATCH. He is an operative working within Iraq----\n  Mr. HARKIN. He was injured in Afghanistan. I don't remember the name.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is the fellow known to be in Iraq right now--or at \nleast has been in the last number of months--and who is one of the \nprincipal operatives for the al-Qaida group, and who has been \norganizing and doing other matters within Iraq itself, and who appears \nto have at least the go-ahead from the Iraqi Government.\n  If the Senator is not aware of that, then I understand why he is \nmaking these comments. But that is only one illustration. Is the \nSenator aware that there may be other illustrations as well?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I have read about them and heard about them--that \nthere may be some people in and out, or some who may have come in. The \nmost I have heard is the one I think the Senator is talking about, but \nI think he came there to get his leg fixed or something. No doubt he \nwas well connected with al-Qaida.\n  But I say to my friend from Utah, the Government of Iraq said they \ncannot find this guy. Well, our people have said it is ridiculous; of \ncourse, you can find him. Well, we cannot find Osama bin Laden in \nAfghanistan. We have more spy satellites and listening equipment than \nIraq ever dreamed of having. I don't know whether this guy is there or \nnot. There have been some in and out of Iraq.\n  Again, it is very tenuous as to whether or not there are any \nconnections. I am sure the Senator from Utah also knows that there has \nbeen a longstanding feud between Osama bin Laden and his \nfundamentalists and the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein. I say a pox on \nboth their houses. But the fact is, in the eyes of Osama bin Laden and \nthose fundamentalists, Saddam Hussein is a secular leader, not a true\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\nIslamist. What they have always wanted was to get rid of Saddam Hussein \nto put in power a religious government in Iraq. So there never has \nbeen, in all the briefings I have ever had, any love lost between \nSaddam Hussein and the al-Qaida network. They just have different \nideologies and a different way of approaching how they should govern. \nSo, again, they have been trying to make these links between al-Qaida \nand Saddam Hussein, and they have never done it.\n  I say to my friend from Utah, there is an interesting piece in the \nSunday Washington Post. When they caught Khalid Sheik Mohammed, one of \nthe most dangerous men in al-Qaida, they captured him in Pakistan. On \npage A-26, there was a picture of all the high-value targets, those who \nhave been involved with al-Qaida. No. 1 is Osama bin Laden. And then \nthere is Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the one they just caught. Then there is \nAbu Zubaida, still at large. Others have died or have been captured.\n\n  What is interesting about all of this--tier 1, tier 2, tier 3, is \nOsama bin Laden is a Saudi. Zawahiri is Egyptian. Saif Al-Adil is \nEgyptian. Khalid Sheik Mohammed is Pakistani. Then down here is a \nJordanian, a Palestinian, a Saudi, a Yemeni, an Indonesian, a Kuwaiti, \nand an Egyptian. One thing kind of leaps out at you: Not one of them is \nan Iraqi.\n  You would think that if Iraq were so closely tied in with al-Qaida, \nthey might have some operatives in there. Not one is Iraqi. So we are \ngoing to go kill a lot of innocent Iraqis, innocent civilians, women \nand children. Where are the Iraqis in that lineup? You would think, \nwith that list, we would go to war against Egypt. Look at all the \nEgyptians--or even the Saudis. Look at all the people who are in tier \n1, tier 2, and tier 3 of the high-value targets, and more than just a \nfew are Saudis. Maybe that ought to be the target of our invasion.\n  After all, we know it has been the Saudis who, with their deep \npockets, have been funding the fundamentalists in their efforts in that \npart of the world. It is the Saudis, with their deep pockets, who have \nbeen buying and paying for Al-Jazeera television with all of the \ninflammatory tirades against the United States and Israel that come \nacross that television station. Not Iraq. It wasn't Saddam Hussein \npaying for that. It was the Saudis paying for it.\n  So over the weekend we have the capture of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, \nperhaps, as they say, the brains behind al-Qaida, and the brains behind \nSeptember 11--the operations chief and mastermind. That is a great \ncapture. I applaud the FBI agents, CIA agents, whoever was involved in \ntracking this guy down and getting him. They did a great job, and I \nhope they get whatever commendations and medals that is appropriate for \nthat. But there is someone else that also helped capture Khalid Sheik \nMohammed, and that is the Government of Pakistan.\n  I have taken this floor many times in the past several years to talk \nabout our relations with Pakistan and how through the years, clear back \nto the founding of Pakistan as a nation, they have been on our side in \nevery war. There isn't one conflict in the world that the U.S. has been \ninvolved in that the Pakistani Government and troops have not been on \nour side. Even in Haiti we had Pakistani soldiers with us. In Korea. In \nVietnam. In the gulf war in 1991, Pakistan was there with us. Every \nsingle time that we have had a capture and a turnover to us of a \nterrorist, it has been Pakistan that has helped us.\n  The first bombers at the World Trade Center caught--almost a dozen \nyears ago now--were turned over to us by Pakistan. The shooter at the \nCIA in the mid-1990s who killed so many people escaped and went to \nPakistan. Pakistan caught him and turned him over to us. The bombers of \nthe embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were caught by Pakistan and turned \nover to us. And now this is the latest in a long string of terrorists \nwho have killed Americans here at home and abroad. Here is the latest. \nKhalid Sheik Mohammed was captured in Pakistan.\n  Yes, with the help of our FBI and CIA, and I don't know what other \nintelligence agencies, but it mentions the FBI here, but also with the \nhelp of the Pakistani Government. It could not have happened unless \nPresident Musharraf and others came to our aid and assistance to \ncapture this guy. Yet how do we treat Pakistani Americans? So many \nPakistani Americans who are in this country, who have been working, \nmany have children who are Americans, have provided health care in our \ncountry in many cases and in many situations. They are university \nprofessors, businesses entrepreneurs all over America. Yet we have told \nthem they have to march into INS and get fingerprinted and do all this \nwithin a month. In other words, it is treating Pakistani Americans as \nif they are part of this network of Saudis, Yemenis, Egyptians, \nJordanians, and everybody else. One might find a Pakistani in there \nsomeplace, I do not know.\n\n  The Pakistanis have always helped us out, and they are continuing to \nhelp us out today. We need to help them to combat terrorism in their \nown country.\n  After the war in Afghanistan was over, there were over a million \nrefugees from Afghanistan and Pakistan. They now think it is probably \nbetween 1 and 2 million. We provided little--I can almost say no help \nto the Pakistanis to take care of these refugees, to help them get \nresettled, and, as far as I know, we are not doing anything to help \nthem now to get back into Afghanistan to resettle. They remain a burden \non the Pakistani Government.\n  It makes one wonder sometimes just what our response is going to be \nif, in fact, we do have a war in Iraq and we have an occupation, when \nwe see how we have treated the Pakistanis for all these years.\n  There were a couple other interesting events this weekend. The Iraqi \nGovernment has continued to destroy some of the Al-Samoud missiles. I \nthink it is up to 10 now. They said they destroyed six more missiles. \nThere is an interesting quote in the paper this morning. It said:\n\n       ``If it turns out at an early stage this month that America \n     is not going to a legal way, then why should we continue?'' \n     Saddam Hussein's scientific adviser, Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, \n     said Sunday.\n\n  In other words, what he is saying is--I read the story--we are \nwilling to destroy the missiles, it takes time, but if the United \nStates is going to commit war on us anyway, why should we?\n\n       A Senior U.S. official--\n\n  There is always one of those--\n\n     said today the White House remained unimpressed with Iraq's \n     move. ``The standard for cooperation demanded by U.N. \n     Resolution 1441 is full and immediate, not grudging and \n     late,'' the official said. The resolution approved last fall \n     authorized a new round of weapons inspections in Iraq.\n\n  You wonder sometimes what the rush to judgment is. If we can continue \nwith more inspectors and Iraq continues to destroy the missiles, and to \ncontinue the containment policy on Saddam Hussein, isn't that what we \nwant?\n  There is another unnamed military source that says these missiles \nhave questionable accuracy anyway. I am told they went over the line by \n26 miles.\n  It was 100 kilometers, and they went over by 26 miles. I had a \nconversation this weekend with someone who said: These missiles could \nbe used to hit Israel or hit Europe or maybe even America. That is not \nthe case at all. They went 26 miles over the line. Again, it was more \nthan what was allowed and they should be destroyed and they are being \ndestroyed.\n  I guess the point I am making is why are we in such a rush to say \nthat is not enough; we are going to go to war anyway? As I said at the \nbeginning of my remarks, every time I listen to Mr. Wolfowitz, it seems \nas if this man has made up his mind: We are going to war no matter \nwhat, unless, as I read between the lines of what he is saying, someone \nassassinates Saddam Hussein and they set up a government and invite us \nin to run operations, then maybe we will not go to war. That seems to \nme about the only scenario that would keep a war from happening, \naccording to Mr. Wolfowitz and those around him.\n  The other important event that happened this weekend was the vote in \nthe Turkish Parliament. The vote was close. We lobbied heavily. We put \nup, I do not know, I am told $15 billion or $26 billion--take your \npick--to get the Turkish Government to allow us to use their territory \nfor our troops, for loading troops, the provisioning of troops, and the \nmovement of troops across\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\nTurkish national territory to Iraq. Even with that, the Parliament \nturned it down. It was a close vote, but they turned it down.\n  Then I saw a poll--you can get a lot of information off the Web on \nthe weekend when you are working on these issues--there was a poll \ntaken in Turkey. I do not know, I have no knowledge of how accurate \nthis poll is or who took the poll, but it was a public opinion poll \nthat showed that 94 percent of Turkey's citizens were opposed to the \nwar in Iraq--94 percent. Even if the poll is off a little bit, one can \nunderstand why the Turkish Parliament was so reticent even in the face \nof billions of dollars of U.S. money pouring in.\n  Someone said on the floor last week, this is not the coalition of the \nwilling; it is the coalition of the bought confronting Iraq. If we have \nto go to those measures, $26 billion is what I was told--I stand \ncorrected if that is not right. Even if it is $15 billion or someplace \nin between, we are not funding education, we have a problem in \nMedicare, our deficits are going out of sight, but somehow we have $26 \nbillion to give to Turkey to allow our troops to go across their \nterritory. That should raise some real questions as to what is \nhappening here.\n  Lastly, one has to question what is it we are about underneath it \nall?\n  Again, I read from a speech that President Bush gave last week to the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute and some of the comments that were made \nregarding that issue. President Bush said in his speech that we are \ngoing to have an Iraqi Government that will be representative of the \npeople and that we would ensure that happened.\n  I went back because I wanted to check to make sure this was official, \nso I looked at the White House document that was sent to us on January \n20, 2003. It is the report from the President required by the Iraqi \nresolution that was passed by Congress last fall.\n  Of course, it was supposed to have been in in 60 days. It was just \nanother 30 days overdue. I read it over. There is an interesting part \nin the report that President Bush signed and sent to us. I will venture \nto say that not many Senators have read this report. But it is called \nthe ``Future of Iraq.'' It is in the report of the President sent to us \non January 20. I am going to quote from it. It says:\n\n       Should it become necessary for the United States and \n     coalition armed forces to take military action against Iraq, \n     the United States, together with its coalition partners--\n\n  Who are getting fewer and fewer, by the way--\n\n       will play a role in helping to meet the humanitarian, \n     reconstruction, and administrative challenges facing the \n     country in the immediate aftermath of a conflict. . . .We \n     will work to transfer authority as soon as practical to the \n     Iraqis themselves, initially in an advisory role. . . .The \n     U.S. is fully committed to stay as long as necessary to \n     fulfill these responsibilities, but is equally committed to \n     leave as soon as the Iraqi people are in a position to carry \n     out these responsibilities themselves.\n\n  Interesting. ``The U.S. is fully committed''--I do not remember us \never having a debate about that commitment, that we are committed to \nstay as long as necessary to fulfill these responsibilities, but are \nequally committed to leave as soon as the Iraqi people are in a \nposition to carry out these responsibilities themselves.\n  The question is: Who decides that? Who decides when the Iraqi people \nare in a position to carry out these responsibilities themselves?\n  There is a quote in the paper from Youssef Ibrahim from the Council \non Foreign Relations. He said:\n\n       I think Arabs almost without exception would welcome more \n     democracy and more freedom of expression and to be liberated \n     from the police states they all--in one form or another--live \n     under.\n\n  Mr. Ibrahim goes on:\n\n       It does not follow that they would trust America to do this \n     for them. The view over there is totally different from the \n     view expressed here.\n\n  Critics also warn that the Bush administration must overcome a \ncredibility gap borne of long memories and unpopular U.S. policies.\n  University of Maryland Professor Shibley Telhami warned that an \ninvasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation by United States-led forces \nwould feed an image of United States imperialism and undermine the very \ngoals the administration has set.\n  Keep in mind, if we do, in fact, go to war in Iraq and occupy Iraq \nand set up this military type of government for however long we want \nto, it will be the first time ever that the United States has occupied \nan Arab country, the first time ever that we will be seen by the Arabs \nas occupiers, as establishing some kind of colonial power in the Arab \nworld. And I think that is going to have severe ramifications.\n  Army Chief of staff Shinseki told the Senate Armed Forces Committee \nthat several hundred thousand soldiers would be needed to secure \npostwar Iraq. Assistance from friends and allies would be helpful, he \nsaid.\n  Well, I wonder how much help we will get.\n  Mr. Wolfowitz is quoted as saying:\n\n       If, when Iraq is liberated, it can come up with a \n     representative government that treats its people decently, \n     I think it can have significant effects throughout the \n     Middle East.\n\n  David Mack, vice president of the Middle East Institute, said they \nmake it look like a no-brainer. Put me down as a skeptic. Americans are \nin such a hurry. The people in the region are not. They are worried \nthat they are jumping over a precipice.\n  By one estimate, 65 million adults in the Middle East cannot read or \nwrite, 14 million are unemployed, and 10 million school-aged children \nare not enrolled in class.\n  When I listen to Mr. Wolfowitz and I read the report from President \nBush of January 20--I have not seen the movie yet, but I have read the \nbook a couple of times, and I looked at it again this weekend, ``The \nQuiet American'' by Graham Greene. You read that and you think about \nhow we got into Vietnam--the same kind of thing. We were going to build \na democracy in Vietnam. We were going to end all this internal fighting \nand take care of the north, and we were going to set up democratic \nforms of government. That was the first, and then there were several \nothers that followed. How many thousands of Americans lost their lives \nthere? What did it do to our country, for a generation?\n  Now one goes to Vietnam and we have diplomatic relations. When we \nlook at what is happening in Vietnam, we have to say, what was it all \nabout? It was really about the misguided adventurism of, yes, well-\nmeaning people in this country--I have no doubt that they meant well--\nto put a pax Americana, sort of a stamp of America, on a country in \nSoutheast Asia, to set up a country that would look like us, mirror us. \nWe were going to do it through military force.\n  I am sorry, it did not happen then, and it is not going to happen in \nIraq. It may happen in Iraq at some point. We can encourage that. But \nit is not going to come about through a war that is going to kill \ncountless civilians through the establishment of a military occupation \nand through us trying to impose upon the Iraqis our sense of what good \ngovernment is. If only that were true. But history shows it is not.\n  We keep hearing from Mr. Wolfowitz and others what a grave threat \nSaddam Hussein is to us. They believe the war in Iraq will be quick, \nmaybe 2 or 3 weeks and it will be over with. And that is probably true. \nI have no doubt that could possibly be true. Then one has to ask, if \nthat is the case, are they really that big a threat?\n  Iraq has no navy. It has no air force to speak of. Its military is \nreally in shambles. What kind of a threat are they, especially if we \ncan keep inspectors there?\n  The other thing I wanted to check on was: Is there a limit on the \nnumber of inspectors U.N. Resolution 1441 permits? Or any previous \nresolution? Was there any limit by the surrender resolution in 1991 \nwhich first started the inspections? And the answer is no. There is no \nlimit on the number of inspectors that the United Nations is allowed to \nhave in Iraq. So why have 100? Why do we not have 500? Why do we not \nhave 1,000 inspectors, duly trained and qualified, all over that \ncountry? Saddam Hussein cannot say, no, that is not allowed, because it \nis allowed. I submit, those 1,000 or 500 inspectors fully trained in \nIraq, even if it takes the next 5 years, is cheaper monetarily than \nwhat the war is going to cost us, and certainly cheaper in terms of the \nloss of human life, both American lives and innocent lives in Iraq. \nPlus, I believe through that process we will have\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\nthe support and the admiration of other Arab countries.\n  A war in Iraq, I believe, will give the backup to the terrorists who \nare out there. I am not so naive to think that there are not terrorists \neven yet in this country, and in other parts of the world, who want to \ndo us in. They are there, but it seems like right now they do not have \na backup. There is not much of a backup. We are tearing up the network \nwith the recent capture of Khalid Sheik Mohammed in Pakistan. We are \ndestroying this network, and we should keep at it, too. But a war in \nIraq then will give, I think, people in the Arab world who today are \nnot feeling us any ill, will give them the reasons to support \nmonetarily, through encouragement, through processors, those terrorists \nwho are out there. It is one thing to be a terrorist by yourself \nsomeplace; it is another thing to be a terrorist backed up, backed up, \nand backed up, like countless other people who are willing to give \nmoney and support and intelligence to help in your terrorist \nactivities. To me, that is what could happen if we go to war in Iraq.\n\n  Lastly, the civilian causalities. I remember the pictures that came \nback from 1991 after the war in Kuwait against the Iraqi Army--tanks, \ntrucks, vehicles bombed and burned out, bodies lying all over in the \ndesert. That did not provoke any outpouring of ill-will in the Arab \nworld. It did not provoke any outpouring of a sentiment that somehow \nall of those people who were killed were somehow innocent. They were \nnot. These were soldiers. These were Iraqi troops, used to invade and \nplunder Kuwait.\n  It will be different this time. This time it is not just the Iraqi \nArmy. It will be innocent men and women in Baghdad who will get killed. \nAnd those are the pictures that will go around the Arab world. If we \nare just confronting the Iraqi Army, that is one thing. But with all \nthe cruise missiles and the bombing and everything else that will go on \nin Baghdad, cruise missiles are very accurate, but sometimes they go \nastray and sometimes people are not where they are supposed to be. \nSometimes they are in the wrong place at the wrong time. That is what \nwill happen, the image of innocent women and children killed by the \nmight of the American military in Baghdad.\n  That is why the best course of action is to continue the inspections, \nand if we need to, make 500 inspections, make 1,000 inspections. And \nthen continue the program: planned destruction of weapons of mass \ndestruction and others that Saddam Hussein now possesses in his \narsenal. It may take more than a week, it may take more than a month, \nit may take 6 months or a year or 2 years or 4 or 5 years.\n  The article asked, what is the hurry? If it means less loss of human \nlife, and it will certainly cost a lot less, it seems to me that would \nbe the wise course of action.\n  We have a gang down there at the White House, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard \nPearle, Negroponte, Elliot Abrams, Poindexter--do these names conjure \nup memories of the past? Sure does. A lot of the misguided adventures \nwe got into in the 1980s--in Iran, in Central America, places like \nthat--all these names kept popping up at that time because they were \nall involved in the misguided adventures. Now they got the adventure \nthat will save us all, it will save America in the future--war in Iraq. \nAnd occupy Iraq with several hundred thousand troops, stay there as \nlong as necessary to set up a government that somehow looks like ours.\n  I close my remarks by saying these people ought to go visit Vietnam. \nI have, several years ago, to find out how the people are getting along \nthere. They seem to be getting along fine. I still may not approve of \nthe kind of government they have. But the people seem to be getting \nalong just fine. Saigon is bustling, Hanoi is bustling, the tourist \nindustry is going up, manufacturing is going up. Again, it might not be \nthe mirror image of our kind of government, but they seem to be doing \nall right.\n  So go visit Vietnam, and then go down to this wall down on The Mall \nand remember the misguided adventures of well-meaning politicians of \nthe past before we commit our military to a massive invasion of Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I notice some of my colleagues are here. I ask unanimous \nconsent, after my few remarks, Senator Dorgan be permitted to speak for \nup to 25 minutes, and the Senator from South Carolina be permitted to \nspeak for up to a half hour, then Senator Sessions for such time as he \nmay use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will answer some of the questions that have been raised. \nThe more I hear from some of my colleagues, I believe they believe the \nClinton nominees, President Clinton's nominees were mistreated. The \nmore I hear them say this, the more I believe, especially after \nlistening to the distinguished Senator from Iowa, that what we are \nseeing here on Mr. Estrada, the filibuster is more about pay back than \nabout Mr. Estrada.\n  Senator Boxer, the distinguished Senator from California, even said \nas much last week when they said, ``What goes around comes around.''\n  Let me take a minute or two to set the record straight. I have heard \nmy colleague from Iowa say we Republicans are applying a double \nstandard because some Clinton nominees, such as Bonnie Campbell, were \nnot confirmed. Let me remind my friend that there were more nominees of \nthe first President Bush--54--who were not confirmed than there were \nClinton nominees not confirmed at the end of his administration. Two of \nthese nominations were renominated by the current President Bush, John \nRoberts and Terrence Boyle. John Roberts for Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia, and Terrence Boyle for the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  John Roberts was reported out of the committee last week with \nbipartisan support. He has been sitting here for 12 years through three \nnominations by two different Presidents. He is considered one of the \ntwo greatest appellate lawyers in the country today by members of the \nSupreme Court, as well as others. I look forward to seeing him \nconfirmed. It is about time that he was. Terrence Boyle has been \nsitting there for 12 years, nominated three times, by two separate \nPresidents.\n  President Bush has nominated not only Miguel Estrada for the Federal \nappellate bench, but these other two qualified nominees who have been \nsitting there for 12 years. He also nominated, contrary to what the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa said, two other Hispanic nominees for \ncircuit courts of appeals, one for the Fifth Circuit and one for the \nNinth Circuit, as well as Miguel Estrada.\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa is trying to make a comparison \nbetween Bonnie Campbell and Miguel Estrada. Let me first say, I like \nBonnie Campbell. I feel badly she did not make it to the floor. She was \nnot on the floor. There was no filibuster. Her experience was nowhere \nnear that of Miguel Estrada. In fact, to my knowledge, she never tried \na case either before a trial court or on appeal. She never argued an \nappellate case. She never appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court. As a \nmatter of fact, you could go into more and more. But compare her ABA \nrating with Miguel Estrada's. Her ABA rating was a ``majority \nqualified,'' which is a step below Mr. Estrada's rating of \n``unanimously well qualified,'' the highest rating the American Bar \nAssociation gives. Hers was ``qualified'' by a majority of the standing \ncommittee and ``not qualified'' by a minority of the standing \ncommittee. There is quite a bit of difference between the two nominees, \nplus the fact that Miguel Estrada is on the floor and there is a \nfilibuster, a totally partisan filibuster being conducted against him.\n\n  I hope my colleagues are not going to continue that filibuster, but I \nunderstand that is what they intend to do. I hope some of my colleagues \non the other side who are thinking more clearly will admit this is a \ndangerous thing to do. It is a wrong thing to do. I think it is an \nunconstitutional thing to do. I think it diminishes both the executive \nand the judicial branches of Government while increasing the power of \nthe Senate, the congressional branch, or legislative branch.\n  Since the topic has been raised of the committee's confirmation \nrecord during the Clinton administration, I want to take a moment to \nset the record straight. During President Clinton's 8\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\nyears in office, he had 377 Federal judges confirmed, just 5 less than \nPresident Reagan, who was the all-time champion. But President Reagan \nhad 6 years of a Republican Senate to help him--of his own party. \nPresident Clinton only had 2 years of his own party, the Democrats, to \nhelp him. There were 6 years where I was chairman, and we still put his \njudges through as much as we could. If you compare the number confirmed \nto the number nominated, President Clinton enjoyed an 85-percent \nconfirmation rate on individuals he nominated. That is one of the \nhighest ratings. What is more, President Reagan, like I say, had 6 \nyears of a Senate controlled by his own party, while President Clinton \nhad only 2.\n  Here is what happened to the 56 Clinton nominees who did not get \nconfirmed during those 8 years. Some of them were multiple nominees. \nThree were left at the end of the 103rd Congress when the Democrats \nwere in control, so those three cannot count against the Republicans. \nThat leaves 53. Nine were nominated too late in the Congress for the \ncommittee to feasibly act on them or they were lacking the appropriate \npaperwork. That leaves 44. Seventeen of those lacked home State \nsupport, which often resulted from the White House's failure to consult \nwith home State Senators. There was no way to confirm those nominations \nwithout completely ignoring the senatorial courtesy that we afford to \nhome State Senators in the nominations process. That leaves only 27. \nOne nominee was defeated on the Senate floor, which leaves only 26 \nremaining Clinton nominees. Of those, some had reasons for not \nmoving that I simply cannot comment on. So in all 6 years that I \nchaired the committee while President Clinton was in office, there were \nfewer than 26 nominations left in committee.\n\n  Let's compare this record to the first Bush administration when the \nDemocrats controlled the committee. The Democrats failed to confirm 58 \nBush 1 nominees over the course of only 4 years. Let's look at the \nnumber of nominees pending at the end of the Clinton and Bush 1 \nadministrations. While there were 41 Clinton nominees left in the \ncommittee at the end of the 106th Congress when Clinton left office, \nthe Democrats left 13 more, a total of 54 nominees hanging at the end \nof the first Bush administration. Moreover, of the 41 Clinton nominees \nleft at the end of the 106th Congress, one was renominated and \nconfirmed in the 107th Congress, 12 lacked home State support, and 9 \nwere nominated too late for the committee to act or had incomplete \npaperwork. That really leaves only 20 nominees who did not go forward \nduring the last year of the Clinton administration.\n  All this goes to show that any allegation that this committee was \nsomehow unfair to President Clinton's nominees is simply untrue, and \npayback is not the right thing to do. In fact, I treated the Clinton \nnominees better than the Democrats treated the Bush 1 nominees and I \nthink better than the current Senate leadership is treating the current \nPresident Bush's nominees. I just wanted to set that record straight. \nYou cannot compare the Bonnie Campbell matter with the Miguel Estrada \nmatter. They are completely distinguishable. And with regard to \nability, there is no comparison.\n  Miguel Estrada not only has graduated at the top of his respective \ncollege and law school classes, at Colombia and Harvard, but he also \nwas an editor of the Law Review; worked as a clerk for Amalya Kearse, a \nCarter appointee in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals; worked as a \nclerk to Anthony Kennedy, currently a Justice in the U.S. Supreme \nCourt; worked in the Solicitor General's Office; was highly respected; \nhas four of the--worked for three, if not four, of the Clinton \nSolicitors General; worked 4 years for Clinton; 1 year for Bush; argued \n15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, winning 10 of them even though \nhe has a speech impediment, a disability. It is amazing what this man \nhas been able to do, and it is amazing to me that he has gone through \nthis. I do not see one justifiable reason in the world for this.\n  On the other hand, I don't understand, sometimes, my colleagues on \nthe other side. I know they do not all agree. We have a total of 55 \nvotes we know will vote for Miguel Estrada. It seems to me that is what \nwe ought to be doing is voting up or down. We should not be setting \nthis awful precedent of a filibuster against any judicial nominee or, \nfor that matter, any person on the Executive Calendar because I believe \nit does fly in the face of the separation of powers doctrine, to \nrequire, from here on in, if this precedent is set, 60 votes to confirm \nany ``controversial'' nominee. If that happens, then the Presidency \nwill have been diminished, the judiciary will have been diminished, and \nwe will not be able to get the top people in the country to even take \nthese seats.\n  Keep in mind, we pay the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme \nCourt $192,000 a year. Any one of these top nominees makes four or five \ntimes that or more. So these jobs are not plums as far as their salary. \nThese jobs are taken because people want to give service to the Federal \nGovernment. They want to serve the public and they are willing to \nsacrifice the monetary remuneration they are making as attorneys in \norder to serve. We ought to keep that in mind.\n\n  I would hate to see the day we only get the lesser of the less to be \nnominated because nobody else of any qualifications would want to go \nthrough this type of an awful procedure. I don't want to see the day \nwhen the only ones who can make it are those who do not have any \nrecords, have written nothing, have never said anything, whom you don't \nknow anything about, and who may be good judges but may very well not \nbe. It is going to be tough even for the American Bar Association to \nmake their evaluations because they won't have anything to make them \non, other than the local attorneys who may be practicing law in the \nsame area.\n  I have said enough. I just wanted to set the record straight.\n  Also, I totally disagree with the distinguished Senator from Iowa in \nhis comments about the Iraq situation. We do have evidence of al-Qaida \npeople being in Iraq. We do have evidence of organization within Iraq. \nWe do have evidence that I think would rebut almost everything the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa said. But since my colleagues are on \nthe floor and desire to speak, I do not want to take their time. So I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Under the previous agreement, \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, is recognized for 25 \nminutes, to be followed by Senator Hollings of South Carolina for 30 \nminutes, to be followed by Senator Sessions.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have voted for over 100 judges nominated \nby President Bush. In North Dakota, we have had vacancies in both the \nwest and east district judgeships. President Bush nominated two \nRepublicans for those judgeships. I was happy to support them, and to \nwork with President Bush to make sure that their confirmation went \nsmoothly. One has been confirmed, the other I am convinced will be \nconfirmed, and both will make us proud as Federal judges.\n  I make that point only to say that I expect to be supportive of most, \nif not all, of the President's nominees. And I wish that we could have \na vote on Mr. Estrada.\n  Mr. Estrada's nomination is problematic, however, in that he has \nrefused to answer some basic questions. My colleagues, the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee and the minority leader, have \nindicated by letter that Mr. Estrada needs to be forthcoming, and \nanswer provide some basic information about his judicial philosophy and \ntemperament. Considering that Mr. Estrada is seeking a lifetime \nappointment to the bench, one would expect that he would be eager to \nprovide that information.\n  Judge Hovland, whom the President nominated to the Western District \nof North Dakota, answered the very questions that Mr. Estrada would \nnot. I was happy to support Judge Hovland. I wish Mr. Estrada would be \nforthcoming.\n  When and if he does that, I hope we proceed to vote. And then we can \nmove on to any number of pressing matters.\n\n\n                    U.S. International Trade Deficit\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take the floor to talk about one very \npressing matter, which all of us should be concerned with: that is, our \ncountry's record trade deficit in 2002.\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\n  I spoke on Wednesday about it, and the very next day, the U.S. Trade \nAmbassador, Bob Zoellick, was on CNN's ``Moneyline'' with Lou Dobbs, to \ntalk about the deficit.\n  Mr. Dobbs, whom I really admire, asked Mr. Zoellick the following \nquestion:\n\n       What would you say, [Mr.] Ambassador, is the most important \n     [issue for] a country that has a $430 billion trade deficit?\n\n  Ambassador Zoellick's answer: Let's negotiate new trade agreements.\n  He said:\n\n       That's what we've been doing over the last couple years, \n     reversing some of the slowdown in the past. We just completed \n     two new trade agreements with Singapore and Chile. We're \n     trying to move ahead working with the global trade \n     negotiations, working with the Europeans and others.\n\n  Then Lou Dobbs noted that manufacturing jobs are being exported \nabroad.\n  Again quoting Mr. Dobbs, he said:\n\n       Is there anything that can be done about that or is this a \n     historical trend that is going to continue for years to come?\n\n  Ambassador Zoellick said:\n\n       Jobs [have] gone down, but that's because productivity has \n     gone up. So where have those jobs gone? Well, you've got more \n     people in the service industry. You have cable television and \n     others.\n\n  OK, so now I understand it, I guess. The Trade Ambassador said we are \nshipping manufacturing jobs overseas but we have cable television. \nHooray for us.\n  So Mr. Dobbs tried again, asking Ambassador Zoellick to identify the \nmost important trade issue for the United States, and the Ambassador \nsaid:\n\n       Well, the most important issue I frankly think is keeping \n     the United States in [a] leadership [role] in global trade. . \n     . .\n       I just came back from China. I was in Latin America not \n     long ago. And what they look to is U.S. leadership in terms \n     of various negotiations, the global negotiations, the \n     hemispheric negotiations, and individual ones.\n\n  That's the biggest trade issue for this country? We have the highest \ntrade deficit in human history--and Mr. Zoellick thinks the answer is \nto negotiate even more trade deals?\n  Maybe Mr. Zoellick thinks that the deficit is really not that big of \na problem. He would not be alone in that belief.\n  On February 24, the Wall Street Journal published an editorial \nentitled ``Hooray for the Trade Deficit!'' The Journal argued that the \ntrade deficit was propping up the economies of Europe and Japan, and \nwere a sign of our economic strength.\n  I have no idea what water they have been drinking. But let me quote \nfrom the editorial:\n\n       Pundits claim that ``financing'' the U.S. current account \n     deficit requires that foreigners purchase some $1.5 \n     billion in U.S. assets a day, and warn darkly of the time \n     when that need cannot be met.\n\n  And they say:\n\n       But the current account deficit is by definition the \n     inverse of net capital inflow. So it can very easily be \n     argued that U.S. assets are in such demand, even with \n     Treasury yields at historic lows and after three down years \n     in the U.S. stock market, that Americans have to find $1.5 \n     billion a day worth of foreign goods just to spend all the \n     money that's coming in.\n\n  I do not understand that at all. Have they not taken the first basic \ncourse in economics? I just do not understand that. Total nonsense.\n  We have been running record trade deficits through all kinds of \neconomic conditions: through the economic boom of the 1990s, through \nthe more recent recession, through a peacetime economy, through a \nwartime economy. The trade deficit keeps going one way: up, dangerously \nup.\n  If the economies of Europe and Japan need our trade deficits to stay \nhealthy, then they ought to get busy revamping their economies, because \nthere is no way this situation is sustainable.\n  Does anybody really believe our economy is so strong right now, as \nthe Wall Street Journal suggests, that we have to find $1.5 billion a \nday worth of foreign goods just to spend all the money that is coming \nin? The fact is, we are mortgaging our children's future with these \ntrade deficits. It is irresponsible, and it ought to stop. If the Wall \nStreet Journal were truly a conservative newspaper, it would be leading \nthe charge to demand that we do something to rectify this trade \nimbalance.\n  I have been on the floor of the Senate critical of trade policies in \nthe Clinton administration time after time after time, and I am \ncritical of the trade policies of this administration. The fact is, you \ncannot tell the difference between Republican and Democratic \nadministrations on trade policies. Year after year after year, we have \nTrade Ambassadors who talk about the advantage of doing another trade \nagreement; and every single time we do another trade agreement, our \ntrade deficit ratchets up.\n  This chart show the merchandise trade deficit we face: $470 billion \nin 2002, after exploding increases during the nineties.\n  The Washington Post reported that this trade deficit put ``a \nsignificant damper on U.S. economic growth.'' In fact, the fact that \nthe Post article talks about the deficit is very surprising, \nincidentally, because the Washington Post, of all newspapers, is the \nmost ecstatic about this fast-track trade authority, global trade, and \nthe trade deficits we have inherited. They excuse them away at every \nsignificant opportunity.\n  Yet the Washington Post story said:\n\n       . . . a combination of increasing imports and falling \n     exports clipped more than half a percentage point off the 2.4 \n     percent increase in U.S. gross domestic product last year. . \n     . .\n\n  The Post further noted that:\n\n       . . . .nearly one-fourth of the year's [trade] deficit in \n     goods trade was with China, which sold $103 billion more \n     goods to the United States than it bought here.\n\n  What does this mean? It means jobs. That is what it means. These \nnumbers describe where the jobs are, who wins and who loses. With \nrespect to the global economy, and with respect to trade agreements, we \nare losing, we are losing jobs.\n  That does not mean much to the economic thinkers and the newspaper \neditorialists and others whose jobs are not in jeopardy, but it means a \nlot to the millions of people who used to have good jobs that paid \nwell, with good benefits, whose jobs are now gone. Because they cannot \ncompete in global trade when a U.S. manufacturer moves its plant \nabroad, so they can produce where they can hire 14-year-old kids, work \nthem 14 hours a day, pay them 14 cents an hour, and dump the chemicals \ninto the streams and into the air, and then ship the product back to \nToledo or Fargo or Los Angeles or Denver, and then say to the American \nproducer: You cannot compete with this; tough luck; you cannot compete \nin the global economy.\n  That is not what we ought to allow in terms of global trade.\n  We have deficits as far as the eye can see. With China, we have trade \ndeficits of $103 billion; with Canada, deficits of $50 billion.\n  This chart shows the deficits we have: $50 billion with Canada, $37 \nbillion with Mexico. And, by the way, before we did the United States-\nCanada-Mexico trade agreement, so-called NAFTA, we had a very small \ntrade deficit with Canada and a small trade surplus with Mexico. Now we \nhave turned both of them into very large trade deficits.\n  On the chart, you can see virtually the only trading partner with \nwhich we have a surplus at this point is Australia. But this \nadministration is going to remedy that because now they are engaged in \ntrade talks with Australia, to set up a free trade agreement with \nAustralia. So we may not have a trade surplus with Australia for long. \nIf those same trade negotiators who negotiated all of our trade \nagreements are engaged in Australia, we will lose within a week or two \nand be back to red ink with respect to Australia.\n  Not only do we have trade deficits with virtually every major trading \npartner, we have deficits in almost every sector of goods trade. We \nhave a $110 billion deficit in vehicles, $47 billion deficit in \nconsumer electronics, $58 billion deficit in clothing.\n  Some might say: Well, agriculture is a bright spot because we are a \nnet exporter of agricultural goods. But the fact is, we are losing in \nagriculture as well. Our modest surplus in agricultural products was \nreduced 30 percent over just last year. And major areas of agricultural \ntrade are now in deficit. Our surplus in meat declined by $1 billion. \nWe have a deficit in livestock trade which reached $1.5 billion last \nyear. We had a deficit in vegetables and fruits of $2.5 billion last \nyear.\n  Now, let me talk just a for moment about China.\n  We have a trade deficit with China.\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\n  We did a bilateral trade agreement with China. I don't have any idea \nwho negotiated that either, but the fact is it is a trade agreement \nthat doesn't work. It works for them, but not for us.\n  After we negotiated a bilateral agreement with China, our negotiators \nagreed that following a phase-in period, we will allow China to have a \ntariff on automobiles that is 10 times higher on U.S. automobiles going \nto China than any Chinese automobiles sold in this country. We agreed \nwe would allow China, a country that has a $100 billion trade surplus \nwith us or we in deficit with them, to impose tariffs on automobiles 10 \ntimes higher than the tariffs on Chinese automobiles sent to this \ncountry. I don't know who does this kind of negotiating. On whose \nbehalf do they think they are negotiating?\n  We have a deficit in toys with China, $14 billion in toys. The \nfollowing Post article describes why. The title is ``Worked Until They \nDrop; Few Protections for China's New Laborers.''\n  This is a story about Li Chunmei, a 19-year-old. She was literally \nworked to death at a factory in China. They made stuffed animals for \nthe U.S. marketplace. Let me read a couple portions of the article. \nThis is a picture of that young lady.\n  On the night she died, they said, she had been on her feet for 16 \nhours running back and forth inside the toy factory carrying toy parts \nfrom machine to machine. Long hours were mandatory, and at least 2 \nmonths had passed since Li and other workers had enjoyed even a Sunday \noff--2 months had passed since they were allowed even a Sunday off. Her \nroommates had already fallen asleep when Li started coughing up blood. \nThey found her in the bathroom a few hours later, curled up on the \nfloor, moaning softly in the dark, bleeding from her nose and mouth. \nThey called an ambulance and she died before it arrived. The cause of \nher death was unknown, but what happened to her last November in this \nindustrial town in southeast Guangdong province is described by family, \nfriends, and coworkers as an example of what China's more daring \nnewspapers call guolaosi. The phrase means overworked to death. They \nactually have a phrase for being worked to death in China.\n  This is the playing field for international competition. Children \nbeing worked to death. This is what we are competing with.\n  Aside from this, the tragedy of this, the fact is, our market is open \nto Chinese goods. Shoes, shirts, trousers, trinkets, toys, every day \nand every way we are flooded with Chinese goods. But Chinese markets \nall too often are still closed to ours.\n  The Farm Bureau, a conservative farm organization, says the Chinese \nmarket is really no more open today than it was when China entered the \nWTO. The Farm Bureau has supported fast track, has been largely \nsupportive of the trade approaches, but the fact is they are critical \nof the implementation of China's WTO accession, saying:\n\n       At the end of [WTO] negotiations, China was a $2 billion \n     market. We expected substantial growth, but we haven't seen \n     [it] because China hasn't done what it's supposed to do.\n\n  That is from Teresa Howes, senior director of trade for the American \nFarm Bureau. Good for them.\n  The bottom line is, our agricultural products aren't getting into \nChina. Yet Chinese goods move into our marketplace all the time.\n  You don't have to travel to China to figure out why we have this kind \nof trade deficit. Go to Canada. Take a look at our wheat trade with \nCanada.\n  The fact is, we have a massive quantity of Canadian grain coming into \nour country sold by a monopoly, the Canadian Wheat Board, that would be \nillegal in this country, undercutting farmers, taking money directly \nout of their pockets, and you can't do much to stop it. We now do have \na couple of trade actions, but it has taken forever to get them. I have \nno idea what the result will be, but the fact is, this has gone on for \n8 to 10 years, and our farmers have not gotten effective action to stop \nit.\n  Our trade deficit with Europe I mentioned last week. We can't get \nAmerican beef into Europe. We take Europe to the WTO. We go there and \nwe win. Europe says: So what; it doesn't matter to us. We don't intend \nto let your beef in.\n  So our country ratchets up its backbone, stiffens its resolve, and we \nsay: OK, you do that, we will stick it to you. And what does our \ngovernment do? It imposes import duties on Roquefort cheese, goose \nliver, and truffles. That will scare the dickens out of the EU, won't \nit? We will take action against Roquefort cheese, goose liver, and \ntruffles.\n  I would like to meet those officials in the trade ambassador's \noffice. That was under the previous administration. I don't understand \nthat at all. When will our country decide it is going to stand up for \nour economic interests?\n  How about trade with Korea? We have a very large deficit with Korea. \nLast year Korea sent us 618,000 automobiles. Do you know how many U.S. \ncars got into Korea? Two thousand eight hundred. Is it because Koreans \ndon't like U.S. automobiles? No. It is because Korea has the strategy \nto ship their cars to the American marketplace and keep American cars \nout of theirs. What does that mean? That means jobs. We lose them. \nKorea gains them. Is it fair trade? Absolutely not. Shame on us for \nallowing it.\n  If you don't want to talk about cars and Korea, talk about potato \nflakes. We raise a lot of potatoes in my part of the country, potato \nflakes for confection foods. There is a 300 percent tariff on potato \nflakes to Korea.\n  I just don't understand how we continue to allow this sort of thing. \nHow does it make sense for our country to allow this to happen?\n  What about Japan? In Japan we have had a trade deficit of $50 to $60 \nbillion every year forever since I have come to Congress. It keeps \ngoing up. Fourteen, 15 years ago we reached a beef agreement with \nJapan. You would have thought we won the Olympics. The negotiators had \nfiestas and jubilation, and the Washington Post had huge stories about \nour beef agreement with Japan. Good for us. Our negotiators were on the \nball. But nearly 14 years after the beef agreement, there is still a 40 \npercent tariff on every pound of American beef going into Japan. They \ndon't have enough T-bone steaks in Tokyo; their market is closed. We \ncan't get more in. We have a 40 percent tariff on every pound. That \ndoesn't make any sense to me.\n  What is our country doing? We just sit around and chant a mantra, \nlike a religious group on a street corner with a mantra: Free trade, \nfast track, free trade, fast track, the global economy.\n  The fact is, the global economy has moved forward much faster than \nthe rules for the global economy. The result is that the American \nworkers and farmers and businesses have been injured because of it. It \nis just a plain fact. There isn't anyway you can explain it away. A \n$470 billion trade deficit in the year 2002 in merchandise trade cannot \nbe explained away by anyone.\n  This is either a priority and crisis or it is not. If you believe it \nis--and I do--then this country needs to do something about it.\n  It is not to build walls around our country, but it is to say to the \nEuropeans, the Koreans, the Chinese, the Mexicans, the Canadians, and \nothers, we are open for business. Our market is open to you, but on the \nbasis of fair trade. If your markets are closed to us, don't come to us \nasking for admission to our marketplace.\n  If you are going to work 14-year-old kids and pay them 15 cents an \nhour and work them all day, don't come to our marketplace. We don't \nallow it. This country fought for 100 years for the basic principle of \na safe place in which to work, minimum wages, child labor laws, \npreventing dumping of chemicals into the streams and the air, the \nability and the right to collectively bargain. All of these things were \ndeveloped through great strife over a century. Now we have people \ndeciding, we can fly our jet around the world and look down and find a \nmore friendly place in which to produce, move our factory there, and \nnot have to worry at all about those issues. And so they moved their \nfactory--and, incidentally, some of those companies decided to renounce \ntheir citizenship as well, to become citizens of the Bermuda. Why? Why \nwould they want to become citizens of the Bermuda? To save on their tax \nbill and not pay taxes in this country.\n\n  Bermuda has a navy that has the strength of 26 people; there are 26 \npeople in the Bermudan military. My feeling is if a company renounces \ntheir\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\nAmerican citizenship to become a citizen of the Bermuda, the next time \ntheir assets are threatened anywhere in the world through \nexpropriation, have them call in the Bermudan Navy; see if there is a \nBermudan destroyer to move into the region. I don't think so.\n  What I want is for this country to say, yes, we are the leader in \nexpanded trade, and, yes, expanded trade helps all in the world--but \nonly if it is done on a basis that is not a race to the bottom, and on \nthe basis that it brings everybody up.\n  The White House doesn't want to talk about it. The President won't \ntalk about it. Neither did President Clinton. The Congress doesn't want \nto deal with it. Why? Because the minute you do talk about this, they \nsay, well, you are raising this trade issue, you are some sort of \nxenophobic isolationist stooge who doesn't get it, but we get it; we \nall see over the horizon. They say, you don't understand the global \neconomy.\n  What I understand is that when last year we imported $470 billion or \nmore in goods than we sent out, this country is obligated to repay that \nat some point with a lower standard of living. You can argue that our \nbudget deficit is money that we owe to ourselves. You cannot argue that \nwith a trade deficit. A $470 billion trade deficit means we owe that \nliability to those living outside this country, which gives them a \nclaim on this country's assets and a claim on a lower standard of \nliving in the future for American citizens.\n  We must get at the business of solving this problem. I am not saying \nwe should put walls around our country. I want our marketplace to be \nreasonably open, but I want us to be a leader in developing the basic \nrules of trade that are fair to this country's interests.\n  That has not been the case, regrettably. I wish I didn't have to make \nthis speech. I made it repeatedly during the Clinton administration, \nand I will probably make it during the Bush administration because \ntrade deficits are consistently going one way, and that is up. Jobs are \nconsistently going one way, and that is out.\n  We were told by the economists in support of those who wanted NAFTA \npassed--and I voted against it--that what we will get from Mexico under \nNAFTA is the product of low-skilled labor. Do you know what we get from \nMexico now, with the big trade deficit we have with them? We get the \nproduct of high-skilled labor. The three largest imports from Mexico \nare the products of high-skilled, not low-skilled labor: automobiles, \nautomobile parts, electronics. They are all products of high-skilled \nlabor. This is exactly the opposite of what economists and politicians \nsaid who pushed this fast-track NAFTA onto this Congress.\n  What we are doing now, having passed fast track over my objection in \nrecent months, is once again negotiating new trade agreements. When \nthose agreements come back to Congress, nobody in Congress will have \nany opportunity to offer even one amendment to change an obvious \nproblem in the trade agreement. I think that shortchanges this country. \nI hope very much the trade ambassador, for whom I have a lot of \nrespect, but a great deal of disagreement with--I hope he and others in \nthis town will understand, including my colleagues, that this is a very \nserious abiding problem for this country. We cannot ignore it.\n  This country ignores this growing trade deficit of nearly $1.5 \nbillion a day, 7 days a week, at its own peril. We must solve this \nproblem, and the sooner the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                        America's Trade Deficit\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from North Dakota \nbecause his words are music to my ears. He is a student of competition. \nHe knows there is no such thing as free trade. It is only competitive \ntrade. Every nation necessarily tries to build up its manufacturing, \nits production, its economic strength not only in finished products, \nbut in agriculture.\n  The significance of the words of our distinguished colleague, Senator \nDorgan, is that he is an agricultural Senator. For years, I have been \ntrying, with the textile industry in my home State, to get some \nawareness of the fair competition in our textile industry, which is the \nmost productive in the entire world. But since NAFTA, we have lost \n58,100 jobs. As we have passed textile bills through the Senate over \nthe past almost 37 years that I have been here, it has been the \nairline/aircraft industry that has been so strong. Well, Boeing is \nfinally joining me. They have 7\\1/2\\-percent unemployment up in \nSeattle, WA, and Boeing is manufacturing in China. And our $435 billion \ntrade deficit also includes a deficit in agriculture. No one has been a \nbetter protector of the interests of agriculture than the distinguished \nPresiding Officer.\n  It is only the second time in our history that we have a deficit in \nthe balance of trade in farm products. That is not news to this Senator \nfrom South Carolina. I remembered when we finally, just in the last few \nyears, got a deficit in the balance of trade in cotton with China. So I \nunderstand it is going to all agricultural products.\n  We have the facts and figures. I am ready to join in the debate for \nus to start treating foreign trade as foreign aid. It was good that the \nMarshall plan worked, but now we have to rebuild our economy, and that \nis a very important problem.\n  But there is one more important thing, and that is this war in Iraq. \nWhat we are saying--and I talk advisedly--to that GI is this: Look, we \nwant you to go into Iraq and we hope you come back home safely. The \nreason we want him or her to come back safely is not for their welfare, \nbut for our welfare. We want them to come back because we are going to \ngive them the bill. My generation is not going to pay for it. The \nfellow fighting the war is going to have to pay for the war.\n  For the first time in the history of wars in the United States of \nAmerica, we said the Army is going to war, but the country is not. The \nPresident is not going. The Congress is not going. Oh, we are going to \nwear that flag on our lapels. Yes, we are patriotic and we will give \nyou patriotic talk anytime you want it.\n  But as far as actual support, let's find out what the record shows \nbecause I had to listen to Bob Novak, the distinguished columnist on \nTV, the other night when he said: How are we going to pay for it? Just \nlike we did in Vietnam. We borrowed the money.\n  No, sir, we paid for Vietnam. I was in the room with George Mahone, \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee. We called over to Marvin \nWatson and said: Ask the President if we can cut another $5 billion. He \nsaid cut it. Why? Because the President of the United States was very \nsensitive about guns and butter. He wanted to pay for both, and \nPresident Lyndon Baines Johnson paid for both. That is the last time we \nhad a balanced budget in the history of this particular Senator being \nup here--back in 1968. Yes, we paid for guns and butter in Vietnam \nunder President Johnson.\n  Let's go back to the Civil War.\n  I was amazed that President Abraham Lincoln instituted not only the \nincome tax to pay for the Civil War, he instituted a tax on dividends. \nThey have the unmitigated gall to say what we need now is a cut of all \ntaxes on dividends when they were giving Trent Lott the bum's rush. The \nparty of Lincoln, the party of Lincoln; that is all I heard on my TV at \nhome. Where is Abraham Lincoln when we need him? He taxed dividends and \ninstituted the income tax in 1861. They had to repeal it--they said it \nwas unconstitutional--by 1870, but they paid for that war. They \nsacrificed.\n  When you have a mutual sacrifice, then we are all committed. I \nbelieve the country is going to war in Iraq, not just the army. I want \nto pay for it. I put in a 1-percent value-added tax to pay for that \nwar, and I can't get a hearing before the Finance Committee.\n  I had a hearing before the Finance Committee when Lloyd Bentsen was \nthe chairman. I brought in Dr. Cnossen, the expert who not only \ninstituted that plan in Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada, but knew \nall the ins and outs. He was my expert. He testified. As we were \nleaving the Dirksen Building that day, former Senator John Chafee \nturned to Chairman Bentsen and said: If we had a secret ballot, we \nwould vote that matter out of the Finance Committee unanimously because \nwe were beginning to run into these astronomical deficits as a result \nof voodoo 1 under President Ronald Reagan.\n  In World War I, we raised taxes to pay for the war. During World War \nII,\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\nwe had a marginal tax rate of 94 percent to pay for it. In the Korean \nwar, we had a marginal rate of 91 percent. In Vietnam, we had a 77 \npercent rate. So we paid for wars. But not this Congress; no, no, we \nare not going to go. That is their war. I do not know whether it is for \noil, for democracy, whatever the arguments--get rid of Saddam--but one \nthing is positive, I say to the Senator from Alabama, this Congress is \nnot going to go. We are going to give the bills to the poor GI who \nfights the war. I think it is a dirty shame. It is an embarrassment to \nme that I cannot even get a hearing and nobody to even talk about \npaying for the war.\n  This is a time of national sacrifice because it is a time of national \ncommitment, but not a national commitment on the part of this \nparticular war, I can tell you that now. I have a 1-percent tax \nproposed.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  Let me talk about our friend, Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve. He came out last week and suggested Congress consider \nswitching to an inflation measurement that would trim billions of \ndollars from all cost-of-living adjustments provided to the 46 million \nSocial Security recipients.\n  He said:\n\n       Lawmakers should consider trimming the benefits, raising \n     the retirement age, or other ideas before raising the payroll \n     tax.\n\n  Chairman Greenspan also debunked the idea advanced by some \nconservatives that faster economic growth alone would be able to deal \nwith the shortfalls in the Government's two biggest benefits.\n  He finally came out against this so-called voodoo or economic growth. \nThe buzzword is growth. It is cut the taxes to grow the economy. We can \nonly go back to what Mr. Greenspan said in 1983 in his annual report \nfrom the National Commission on Social Security Reform, section 21. I \nask unanimous consent to print that section of the report in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Report of the National Commission on Social Security Reform--January \n                                  1983\n\n\n                 social security and the unified budget\n\n       (21) A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI, and SMI \n     Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget. Some \n     of those who do not support this recommendation believe that \n     the situation would be adequately handled if the operations \n     of the Social Security program were displayed within the \n     present unified Federal budget as a separate budget function, \n     apart from other income security programs.\n       Before fiscal year 1969, the operations of the Social \n     Security trust funds were not included in the unified budget \n     of the Federal Government, although they were made available \n     publicly and were combined, for purposes of economic \n     analysis, with the administrative budget in special summary \n     tables included in the annual budget document. Beginning \n     then, the operations of the Social Security trust funds were \n     included in the unified budget. In 1974, Congress implicitly \n     approved the use of a unified budget by including Social \n     Security trust fund operations in the annual budget process. \n     Thus, in years when trust-fund income exceeded outgo, the \n     result was a decrease in any general budget deficit that \n     otherwise would have been shown--and vice versa.\n       The National Commission believes that changes in the Social \n     Security program should be made only for programmatic \n     reasons, and not for purposes of balancing the budget. Those \n     who support the removal of the operations of the trust funds \n     from the budget believe that this policy of making changes \n     only for programmatic reasons would be more likely to be \n     carried out if the Social Security program were not in the \n     unified budget. Some members also believe that such a \n     procedure will make clear the effect and presence of any \n     payments from the General Fund of the Treasury to the Social \n     Security program. (Under present procedures, such payments \n     are a ``wash'' and do not affect the overall budget deficit \n     or surplus.)\n       Those who oppose this recommendation believe that it is \n     essential that the operations of the Social Security program \n     should remain in the unified Federal budget because the \n     program involves such a large proportion of all Federal \n     outlays. Thus, to omit its operations would misrepresent the \n     activities of the Federal Government and their economic \n     impact. Furthermore, it is important to ensure that the \n     financial condition of the Social Security program be \n     constantly visible to the Congress and the public. \n     Highlighting the operations of the Social Security program as \n     a separate line function in the budget would allow its impact \n     thereon to be seen more clearly.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, section 21 said to put Social Security \noff budget in trust, not to be expended on anything other than Social \nSecurity. We spend Social Security trust funds on any and everything \nbut Social Security. Has Mr. Greenspan thought of that solution: Just \ndo not spend the Social Security taxes on every endeavor that we could \npossibly imagine but Social Security?\n  I had a dickens of a time trying to get that written into law. It \ntook me 7 years, and finally on November 5, 1990, George Walker Herbert \nBush signed into law section 13301 of the Budget Act. It is the law of \nthe land: You shall not report from the Congress or the President a \nbudget including Social Security. But we do, and Alan Greenspan started \nthat nonsense back in the eighties because he wanted to cover taking \nthose moneys to go along with what Vice President Bush at that \nparticular time called voodoo.\n  Let me get up to voodoo 2 because we ought to understand, when this \nrecession in the economy started. I am not an economist, but I am a \npolitician. I have been chairman of the Budget Committee. I have worked \nwith Alan Greenspan. I went over in 1980, right after the elections, to \nbrief President-elect Reagan on the budget. We walked in the snow over \nto the Blair House. I will never forget it. President Reagan said he \nwas going to balance the budget in 1 year, and after the briefing he \nsaid: Oops, I never realized how bad it was. It is going to take me 3 \nyears. That is when we went from 1-year budgets to 3 years, and then \nunder Gramm-Rudman-Hollings we went to 5 years, and later under Vice \nPresident Bush we went to 10 years. I suggest for this irresponsible \nCongress, let's go to 20. You can project anything and just keep on \nspending because that is exactly what we are doing.\n  But let's jump back to September of the year 2000 when Governor Bush, \nnow President Bush, was running. He said he was going to cut taxes. I \nknew how we had just gotten the best 8 years of economic growth in the \nhistory of the United States: with an increase in taxes. We were on the \ntail end of our recovery. We still had a deficit. We were trying to \nwork toward a balanced budget, and I will give my colleagues the facts \nand figures.\n  The point is, when he talked about cutting taxes, I thought, oh, \nheavens, we can't start that again; we are just getting back into the \nblack. We had not gotten into the black in September 2000 nor in \nNovember, the Friday after the Tuesday election, when Vice President \nnominee Cheney, our good friend, said: Yes, that is exactly what we are \ngoing to do--cut taxes. When Vice President Cheney made that statement, \ngo back and look at the market in October, November, December, and into \nJanuary.\n  The Republicans are trying to say the recession started in March \n2000. No, it started in the fall of 2000 because of this tax cut idea \nand running up these enormous deficits and running up the interest \ncosts and the borrowing.\n  So what happened was, on January 25, Alan Greenspan appeared before \nthe Budget Committee. What did the gentleman say? We were paying off \ntoo much debt. When he said we were paying off too much debt, that was \nright, title, and interest to this young new President, George W. Bush, \ncoming into office for him to spend up to the ceiling. On February 27, \nI'll be darned if he didn't do just that. The new President came before \nthe Senate in a joint session on February 27 and said: Here is my \nbudget. I have $2.6 trillion to protect Social Security. I have $2 \ntrillion for domestic and defense programs, and that leaves another $1 \ntrillion for unforeseen circumstances.\n  We had an unforeseen circumstances on September 11, later that year, \nbut let's go down now and find out when this recession started and when \nwe were really in the black and in the red. I have here the public debt \nto the penny as reported by the Secretary of the Treasury. The latest \nwe have--February 27, 2003--is $218 billion. That is this fiscal year--\nincluding September, October, November, December, January, and \nFebruary, we got this country another $218 billion in debt.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          The debt to the penny\n \n

5,413,146,011,397.34\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on January 25, 2001, when Chairman \nGreenspan spoke, we were $65 billion in the red according to the \nSecretary of the Treasury. On February 27, 2001, when the distinguished \nnew President gave his speech before the Senate--we were $53 billion in \nthe red.\n  On April 15, 2001, taxpaying day, we were $94 billion in the red. We \nhad collected all that income tax on April 15 and on April 30, 2001, \naccording to the Secretary of the Treasury, we had a surplus. And \nremember, they had been babbling all during the Christmas holidays and \nJanuary and February of $5.6 trillion in surplus money, that we are \npaying off too much debt. There was all kinds of surplus talk.\n  Let's go to May 1, 2001. We were $23 billion in the black. On June 1, \nwe were $4 billion in the black. But on June 7, the President signed \nthe $1.5 trillion tax cut, voodoo 2--we had voodoo 1, so he gave us \nvoodoo 2. And what happened? What happened after June 7? By June 28, we \nwere $52 billion in the red, and on September 10, one day before the \ntragic September 11, we were $99 billion in the red. We only had 20 \nmore days of that fiscal year. If you go into their lingo, their little \nsong and dance routine, they are trying to say they inherited a \nrecession--they did not cause it, but they inherited a recession. They \ntell you we had corporate corruption, and we had 9/11, and on and on, \nand everybody is beginning to believe it. They have said it again and \nagain.\n  The truth is, as I've illustrated with these numbers, George Bush \ncaused this economic downturn, and it is going to stay in a downturn \nwith his newest tax cutting scheme, voodoo 3. Whoever heard of cutting \ntaxes on the dividends, the marriage penalty, and all of these other \nthings they have been coming up with and saying it is going to \nstimulate the economy? They know there is enough stimulus. They are \nunder subterfuge, hiding, camouflaging tax reform under the auspices of \na stimulus. The truth is, on September 30 last year, we ended up $428 \nbillion in the red. President Bush, by his own budget, without the \ncosts in Iraq, has already projected a $554 billion deficit this year, \nand his budget proposal for next year is $569 billion in the red. That \nis $1.5 trillion that we have not paid for, that we are infusing as a \nstimulus to the economy. We know we have to get ourselves on track as \nquickly as we possibly can.\n  I ask unanimous consent that section 13301 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  We said it is the law now we are not supposed to use Social Security, \nand they continue to do so. What we really have, in essence, is Enron \naccounting.\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\nWhy do I call it Enron accounting? Well, turn to page 1 of the budget. \nWe will find on page 1 the Bush Administration saying they firmly \nbelieves in controlling the deficit and reducing it as the economy \nstrengthens and our national security interests are met. They go on to \nsay that compared to the overall Federal budget and the $10.5 trillion \nnational economy, the budget gap is small by historical standards.\n  What did Kenny boy Lay do? The same thing. On page 1, he made his \nstockholders feel good, by saying the company and the corporation are \ndoing fine.\n  What is the Bush Administration doing? Trying to make all the \ntaxpayers feel good by saying this deficit is small on page one.\n  But if we turn to page 332 in the Historical Tables, we will see the \noverall deficit is $554 billion--not what they had, $159 billion on \npage 1. It is actually $554 billion. So rather than a deficit of 2.7 \npercent of the GDP, it is 5 percent. In fact, it is 5.2 percent to be \naccurate.\n  If they are trying to talk in historical terms, let's talk--we are \ncomplaining about everybody in Europe, and we are saying in Europe the \ntrouble with those folks is they are not being responsible. I say to \nthe Senator from Vermont, on page 117 of the same budget tables, we \nfind out that the debt is 64.8 percent of the GDP.\n  Under the Maastricht Treaty, one cannot be a member of the European \nCommunity unless their annual deficit is less than 3 percent. Ours is \nup to 5 percent. They can be subject to fines if their debt exceeds 60 \npercent of the GDP. But by the Bush Administration's own facts and \nfigures ours is 64.8 percent. We could not even become members of the \nEuropean Community, but we are running around criticizing them about \nnot doing this and not doing that.\n  Let me say about the French--I fought under the French, and they were \nbrave in World War II. Do not give me this stuff. They had a heyday \nwith the PR thing on the weekend shows about the French, that we do not \ncare, we will go in any way. But the main thing is to realize that we \nhave worked ourselves into a situation, as Senator Dorgan says, where \nit does not make sense to produce in the United States of America.\n  As politicians, Republican and Democrat, we say: Before you open up a \nmanufacturing company you have to have a minimum wage, clean air, clean \nwater, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, safe working place, safe \nmachinery, plant closing notice, parental leave. Or you can go to China \nand open your plant their for wages of 58 cents an hour, and there is \nnone of that.\n  I asked a high-tech friend of mine on the west coast, when he was \nexpanding, to give us a chance and come back to South Carolina. He said \nhe does not produce anywhere in the United States. He said he produces \nin China for 10 percent of what it would cost in California.\n  That is the whole situation. The Secretary of Commerce has the duty \nof listing 500 critical items to our national security. Senator, we \nhave a $5 billion deficit in the balance of trade in those critical \nitems. We will not be able to go to war the next time because we are \nnot producing. We will have to call other nations up and ask them to \nplease send the goods to us so we can gear up and get ready to go to \nwar.\n  If my friends want to stimulate the economy, let's give $30 billion \nback to the States. We passed Leave No Child Behind, but we left the \nmoney behind. The States are really strained paying educational \nbudgets. We passed the Disabilities Act, but we have never funded it. \nNow we have homeland security, the first responders. I fought like the \ndickens to get the seaport security bill funded for a whole year. I got \nthe authorization, but I could not get the money.\n  The States need it back at the ports, they need it back at the public \nschools. They need the money. While we think we will stimulate the \neconomy to create jobs, they are doing everything to downsize, fire, \nlet the teachers go, and creating unemployment as fast as we are trying \nto create employment.\n  The best stimulus, money that will have to be spent one way or the \nother, is $30 billion back to the Governors. That is not partisan \nbecause the majority of the Governors are Republican. I am trying to \nhelp reelect those Republican Governors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized under the previous order.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the comments of Senator Hollings, and I \nunderstand clearly, and I am glad he speaks with no accent, which I \nappreciate.\n  He has always been very rigorous on this issue. I appreciate that. We \nneed to watch spending around here and need to watch it in all areas. \nOf course, the amount of money we are spending on this war--it is \nestimated from $40 to $95 billion--compared to the economic loss and \nthe internal expenditures we have had to put out as a result of the \nattack of September 11, is very small. So we have to do something and I \ndon't think the Senator suggests otherwise there.\n  We are here talking about one of the finest nominees to come before \nthe Senate, Miguel Estrada, for the Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit. Miguel Estrada is a stunningly qualified person. He came here \nat age 17 from Honduras, top of his class at Columbia, magna cum laude, \nPhi Beta Kappa, on to Harvard Law, editor of the Harvard Law Review, \nclerk for a Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the sister court to the DC \ncourt he would be sitting on. He served in the Solicitor General's \nOffice of the Justice Department where he wrote appellate briefs and \nargued cases before the United States Supreme Court. He has been at one \nof America's greatest law firms since.\n  He received the highest possible ratings of his supervisors in the \nDepartment of Justice almost his entire time. In the Department of \nJustice he was being supervised by President Clinton's supervisors. \nThey gave him the highest rating they could give. They even noted how \nhe was disciplined and followed all the policies and procedures of the \nDepartment of Justice.\n\n  The American Bar Association checked him out. They interviewed \nlawyers on the other side of his cases; they interviewed judges before \nwhom he practiced; they talked to friends. They came up with a rating, \nunanimously ``well qualified,'' the highest possible rating the \nAmerican Bar Association gives. They did not give it by a split vote \nbut unanimously. That is very rare. They do not do that very often. He \nis exceptionally well qualified.\n  I heard his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I \nthought he was responsive and intelligent and courteous and kept his \ncomposure on the tough questioning. Having argued 15 cases before the \nSupreme Court of the United States places him in a very select group of \nlawyers. I am sure there are not more than 20 practicing lawyers in \nAmerica today who have argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. You are not selected for that unless people believe you \nare very good at your business. The average guy cannot walk in and \nargue a case before the Supreme Court under normal circumstances. We \nhave an exceptionally qualified nominee.\n  What is this brouhaha all about? What is causing us to be subjected \nto the first filibuster in the history of the United States involving a \nnominee for a circuit court of appeals judge, or a district court judge \nfor that matter, in the history of this country? We are not able to \nidentify a single active filibuster, as we have seen today, on a \nnominee for circuit court of appeals or for the district court. It is \nstunning this is so in light of the fact we have an individual who \nlived the American dream, who has been a success in every category of \nlife, whose integrity has never been questioned, and whose \nprofessionalism and skill is doubted by no one.\n  I ask, what is it all about, Alfie? What is this about? The real deal \nhere is the question of the role of judges: To what extent are they \nempowered to be activists? Should they be able to utilize and employ \ntheir own best judgment about matters and read that into the statutes \nand the Constitution they interpret, or should they be bound by the \nplain meaning of those statutes? This is a fundamental question.\n  There is in the law schools of America, in many of the outspoken \nprofessors and proponents of law in America, a belief that judges have \na duty to act\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\nand to make decisions and even so act politically. In fact, they say it \nis a myth and a falsehood to suggest and even to believe that judges \nare above politics. They say it is all politics. Why do they say that? \nThis is part of a dangerous trend in America. Is politics in \neverything?\n  The Critical Legal Studies Group that has been afoot in law schools \nover a number of years believes you cannot tell anything about law; \nthat you can take words and statutes and they can mean anything you \nwant them to mean, and they believe those laws were just written by \nthose in power to oppress those not in power. They do not believe there \nare rules of the game all of us must live by that are critical to our \neconomic development. They believe it is all politics, it is all power, \nand there is no truth and there is no order fundamentally. Some call it \ndeconstructionism, and others call it the trends in America as opposed \nto modernism, the idea that there is no truth; one person's opinion is \njust as good as another; We can say what we want; I'm OK, you're \nOK. That kind of idea is really at the heart of some of the problems we \nare having.\n\n  I often tell the story of Hodding Carter, who used to work for \nPresident Carter. He was on Meet The Press, where he used to be a \nregular member. He made a comment the other day where he said we \nliberals have to admit it, we are asking the courts to do for us that \nwhich we can no longer win at the ballot box. That is basically what \nPresident Bush has been unhappy with. That has been the concern he has \nexpressed with the legal system. He simply wants judges who will \nfollow, first, the Constitution, and then the statutes and lawful acts \nthat are enacted pursuant to the Constitution. If the lawful acts that \nare adopted violate the Constitution, the Constitution trumps and the \ncourt should say so. The Constitution controls much of what goes on in \nthis country, and it ought to be the No. 1 thing. So we follow that.\n  It is academic when we talk about those words, but there are various \ncases that come along that point out the matter to us very clearly, \nnone more significant than the ruling in California over the Pledge of \nAllegiance, striking down the pledge as being unconstitutional because \nit had the words in it ``under God.'' They said that was an \nestablishment of a religion that is prohibited by the Constitution; \nthat these two words established a religion.\n  That is beyond my comprehension. It appears to be clearly contrary to \nthe view of the U.S. Supreme Court, although the U.S. Supreme Court, I \nwill admit, tends to be inconsistent on this issue.\n  I remember when that happened it caused quite a stir, particularly on \nboth sides of the aisle here. But I noticed my friends across the aisle \nwere particularly concerned about it and were vocal. So after the panel \nin California struck down the Pledge of Allegiance, we met that day. \nPeople came down on the floor and spoke out. The majority leader at \nthat time, Senator Tom Daschle, said:\n\n       But this decision is nuts. This decision is just nuts.\n\n  He talked about it a little bit there. He gave up the floor, and my \ngood friend Senator Reid from Nevada, the assistant Democratic leader, \nspoke and this is what he said:\n\n       I have the good fortune that two of my sons have been law \n     clerks for the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit.\n\n  That is where these panel members were, they were a part of the ninth \ncircuit.\n\n       In fact, one of my sons was his administrative assistant. \n     He was a judge from Nevada, served on the very prestigious \n     Ninth Circuit. I have had calls from my sons today. They are \n     embarrassed about what has taken place in that Ninth Circuit. \n     They said: Dad, don't worry about it because the court will \n     meet en banc [the whole court will] and reverse it. These are \n     two of the most liberal members on the Court. They come up at \n     random. It was by chance Goodwin and Reinhardt were thrown \n     together [on this panel] . . .\n\n  But it wasn't Goodwin and Reinhardt on the panel. Mr. Reid was in \nerror about that. But Mr. Reid said:\n\n       I have great faith the court will reverse itself when they \n     sit en banc.\n\n  Well, I had hoped so, too. But I spoke on that day. I made clear I \nwas not at all sure the full Ninth Circuit Court would reverse that \nopinion because I have been studying the Ninth Circuit. I have observed \nits irrational and activist behavior for some time. I have noted its \nproblems. I was not at all certain it would be reversed. In fact, I \nsaid as much. I said:\n\n       I hope on full rehearing en banc the court will reverse the \n     opinion. I am not absolutely sure it will because there are \n     others on the court I have no doubt will join in this \n     opinion.\n\n  I made other references to that. So the Ninth Circuit was--it was a \ntest here. Everybody says don't worry about this random opinion.\n  I have been reminded that Goodwin and Reinhardt were on that panel, \nalong with another judge. It was a three-judge panel.\n  So I wondered, will they reverse it? The way it works is if a panel \nof a larger court, the 24 judges on the Ninth Circuit, if a three-judge \ncourt rules and that opinion is significant and may implicate the rest \nof the law, and the full court, 24 judges, might disagree, they have an \nen banc hearing, they review the panel's decision, and they render an \nopinion, either affirming it or not affirming it.\n  What happened here just Friday was that the Ninth Circuit decided not \nto rehear the ruling made by three-judge panel--in effect, affirming \nthe opinion striking down the constitutionality of the Pledge of \nAllegiance of the United States, not a totally surprising thing to me.\n  It is surprising that we are this far along. It is surprising we have \ngone this far in distorting the original intent of our Constitution \nconcerning the separation of church and State and what that actually \nmeans.\n  People say it says we must have a wall of separation between the \nchurch and State. The Constitution never said that. Thomas Jefferson \nsaid that late in his life, long after he had left public office. He \nwrote the Baptist Association and used that phrase--there should be a \nwall of separation between church and State. No one knew precisely what \nhe meant. It was never ratified by the people. He was not even at the \nConstitutional Convention, Jefferson wasn't, when the Constitution was \nwritten.\n  What we must do to determine what the Founding Fathers thought is \nlook at that document, look at the Constitution itself. They debated \nthe issue. They were concerned about it. Virginia had an established \nchurch. It was the Episcopal Church, the Anglican Church, the Church of \nEngland. The Americans didn't like that. They said, We are going to put \nin our Constitution; no one religion is going to be given a \npredominance over the other. So they wrote the first amendment and they \nsaid Congress--that's us, the U.S. Congress--shall make no law \nrespecting an establishment of a religion nor prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.\n  They forget all about the free exercise clause. They simply say \neverything that even mentions God in public life is an establishment of \na religion. That is a misreading of the Constitution.\n  Why they have it in their heads that these things should be so \nclosely scrutinized and should be so scrutinized by the courts and \nstruck down by the courts is beyond me. We have been on a trend for a \nlittle over 50 years. It was not a function or a problem for the first \n150 years of this country's existence, but in recent years it has \ndeveloped in that way.\n  As a result of the history of the Supreme Court rulings over the last \n50 years, there is a real ambiguity concerning the meaning of the \nseparation of church and State.\n  I am going to show how I think activism plays a role in these \ndecisions. People make out it does not make any difference here what \nkind of judges we have on courts, unless they happen to be judges who \nshow restraint, who believe in following the law. They get attacked by \nour friends over here. But judges who advocate utilizing law and \njudicial opinions as a method to carry on a political agenda, they are \nquite all right. Then, when they strike down the Pledge of Allegiance, \nthey run down here and say how awful it is. ``We are just shocked.'' \nAnd it is the judges and the philosophy of law that supports them that \nhas led us to this point.\n  Let me just read what Judge Paez said one time in a written article. \nJudge Paez has been referred to as a judge who was not fairly treated \nhere. He was confirmed. Thirty-nine Senators voted against him. He does \nsit on\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals today. And from what I can tell from \nthis opinion, he joined in the opinion affirming the striking down of \nthe Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n  So this is what he wrote about his philosophy as a judge. He said it \nincludes: ``an appreciation of the courts to act when they must, when \nthe issue has been generated as a result of the failure of the \npolitical process to resolve a certain political question. Because in \nsuch instance,'' he says, ``there is no choice but for the courts to \nresolve the question that perhaps ideally and preferably should be \nresolved through the legislative process.''\n  Do you see what Judge Paez said there? And I opposed his nomination \nfor several reasons. But this was a core reason. What he said was, if \nthe legislature does not act on something we enlightened ones think \nthey should act on, then the courts are empowered to act.\n  You show me where that is in the Constitution. Let's put it really \nsimply: When a legislature does not act on a matter, that represents a \ndecision of a legislature. It decided not to act. That is a decision of \nthat legislative branch just as certainly as if they had voted to make \na change.\n  Legislatures are not required to act. If they do not do something \nthat judges think ought to be done, where does it become the idea that \njudges can impose that by reinterpreting the meaning of the statutes \nand words of the Constitution to impose their agenda? That is a big \ndeal for me.\n  Now, Judge Reinhardt wrote a part of this recent opinion on the \nPledge of Allegiance. Let me tell you what he said. I just picked this \nup. It jumped right out at me because I am sensitive to this issue. I \nhave to run for election. I have to go back to Alabama and defend what \nI did and what I voted on, just as the Presiding Officer did in his \nState. We have to defend what we do. We are accountable.\n  But judges are given lifetime appointments. Their position is for as \nlong as they live, with good behavior. They would have to virtually be \nconvicted of a felony before they could be removed from office. They \ncan hold their position for as long as they want to hold it. And \nsometimes they hold it for longer than their health and ability.\n  But I want to make clear one thing: That most of our Federal judges \ndo an excellent job, and most of them do show restraint. But there has \nbeen a continual battle over this philosophy, that you can make \nstatutes say whatever you want them to say, and ``good'' judges should \ndeliberately use their power to effect the public good as some group of \npeople, whoever they are, think they should.\n  So there was some political uproar over the striking down of the \nPledge of Allegiance, and Judge Reinhardt, on the Ninth Circuit, said \nwe ought not to pay attention to that. But then he said:\n\n       This is not to say that Federal judges should be completely \n     sequestered from the attitudes of the Nation we serve. Even \n     though our service is accomplished not through channeling \n     popular sentiment but through strict adherence to \n     constitutional principles, the Constitution contemplates \n     occasions when we must be responsive to long-term societal \n     trends when determining, for example, that which is cruel and \n     unusual.\n\n  So the court says they have been empowered now to determine ``long-\nterm societal trends,'' and that they can use those societal trends now \nto go back and take words such as ``cruel'' and ``unusual,'' and give \nthem a new meaning.\n\n  Let's talk about that very one. That is the first one he mentioned. I \nthink it is a good one for us to talk about because cruel and unusual \npunishment is prohibited by our Constitution. You cannot impose cruel \nand unusual punishment.\n  A number of years ago, we had two members of the Supreme Court--they \nare no longer there; both are deceased now--Justice Brennan and Justice \nMarshall, who concluded that due to evolving social trends, cruel and \nunusual punishment meant we should not have the death penalty. And they \ndissented on every single case that came before them imposing death \nbecause they believed it violated the constitutional provision \nconcerning cruel and unusual punishment--a breathtaking position to \ntake. I call it the high water mark of judicial activism.\n  Where did they get this idea there had been evolved standards? It was \nnot from polling data, because the American people overwhelmingly \nfavored the death penalty. It was not from the legislative actions of \nlegislatures around the country, because very few had eliminated any \ndeath penalty statutes over the years. In fact, it was a law in a \nmajority of the States in the country. It was a law in the United \nStates of America. So I do not know where they came up with this idea.\n  They did not like it. Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall decided in \ntheir heart that America ought no longer to have a death penalty, so \nthey set about combing the Constitution, and they came up with the idea \nthat it was cruel and unusual.\n  The Constitution has to be fairly interpreted. It said: cruel and \nunusual. Even if you considered it cruel, was it unusual? Every State \nand every Colony in America and the British Empire had the death \npenalty at the time the Constitution was written.\n  Within the very corners of the Constitution itself are multiple \nreferences--six or more, as I recall--to the death penalty. It talks \nabout capital crimes. It talks about that you cannot deprive one of \nlife, liberty, or property. How do you deprive them of life except by \nthe death penalty without due process of law?\n  So this was thunderous. So we have this judge voting to strike down \nthe Pledge of Allegiance, saying that he is empowered to utilize \n``long-term societal trends.''\n  I guess that is the way the EU votes. Maybe we ought to take a vote \nin the UN. Is that what we want to do? Let's take the EU, and we will \nlet the Europeans decide what our societal trends are.\n  I will tell you one thing: The murder rate in Great Britain is going \nthrough the roof. And since the death penalty has come back into \nfashion in America, the murder rate has been plummeting. Thousands of \npeople, on a percentage basis, today are alive, not murdered, because \nof the crackdown on violent crime in this country. I do not think \nanyone can dispute that. He talks about also, ``this broader long-term \nsocial conscience'' should guide us in deciding how to interpret \nstatutes. Well, of course, that is bogus. Who empowered this lifetime-\nappointed person to do that?\n  See, that is an antidemocratic act. Judges, by being given lifetime \nappointments, are unaccountable. They serve a great function in that \nthey can enforce the law, even though it might be, in the short term, \nunpopular. But we depend on them very deeply. We depend on them to show \nrestraint, to not impose their views, but to honestly and fairly \ninterpret the law.\n  We have some real problems here with the Supreme Court, too. The \nSupreme Court is very confused about the opinions on separation of \nchurch and state. But they never went this far.\n  In fact, according to Judge O'Scannlain, who wrote a dissenting \nopinion from the refusal of the court to even consider the matter en \nbanc, Justice O'Scannlain details at least four references in previous \nSupreme Court opinions in the line of cases on which they relied to \nstrike down the school Pledge of Allegiance recitation as affirmatively \nblessing or okaying the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  He quotes a number of those cases. Justice O'Connor and others have \nmade that quite clear. So the question is, Does this phrase, ``under \nGod,'' in the Pledge of Allegiance establish a religion or is it a \nreligious act?\n  Justice O'Scannlain says: Common sense would seem to dictate \notherwise, as the public and political reaction should show and make \nclear. If reciting the pledge is truly a religious act in violation of \nthe establishment clause, then so is the recitation of the Constitution \nitself or the Declaration of Independence.\n  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created \nequal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable \nrights.\n  That is not something we earned here on Earth, but part of the \nphilosophy of the founding of our country is in the heart of the most \nfamous words in the Declaration of Independence. ``Without our aid He \ndid us make.'' That is how we got here.\n  That is what a majority of the American people believe. Some 93 \npercent believe in God. They are not trying to impose their will on \neverybody. But\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\nthey do not believe, and I do not believe, the Constitution prohibits \nany reference in the public sphere to a higher being.\n  He goes on and says: Are we going to eliminate the Constitution, \nwhich makes references to God, the Declaration of Independence, the \nGettysburg Address, which uses the phrase ``under God''? Are we going \nto prohibit that? The national motto, ``In God We Trust''? How about \nthose words right up there, ``In God We Trust,'' in letters 6 inches \nhigh? Are they going to come down here with a chisel? I guess we will \nbring our friends from the Ninth Circuit over here with a chisel and \nlet's see them chop away at that.\n  That doesn't make sense, does it? But that is what we have in this \nopinion. How about the national anthem? Justice O'Scannlain continues:\n\n       Such an assertion would make hypocrites out of our founders \n     and would have the effect of driving any and all references \n     to our religious heritage out of our schools and eventually \n     out of our public life.\n\n  I don't think that is an exaggeration at all.\n  How are we going to stop this?\n  In this Senate, we have the odd event that we have a paid Chaplain, \nas we have in the military. Our Chaplain comes in before we start the \nday, and we have a prayer. I am surprised they haven't sent the 82nd \nAirborne over here from across the street to stop that. They begin \nevery session of the Supreme Court of the United States with the words: \n``God save these United States and this honorable court.'' Every court \nI have been in uses those words. ``God save these United States and \nsave this honorable court'' is what the clerk says when he calls the \ncourt to order all over America today. But children in the Ninth \nCircuit, the largest circuit in America, including some 9 million \nschoolkids, are prohibited now from saying the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  This opinion was written, although I am not sure legally how much it \nmeant, but after this Congress voted on the matter a few months ago. If \nJustice Reinhardt believes his evolving social consciousness has gotten \nto the point that America no longer wants to say ``under God,'' he \nought to listen to his elected representatives because right after it \nhappened, we voted by 99 votes last June on the floor of this Senate to \nreaffirm the Pledge of Allegiance and the words ``under God.'' Every \nSenator in here voting that day voted for it. Maybe one didn't or one \nwas absent. It is impossible for me to believe that they think this is \na result of any societal evolution that causes this.\n  Justice O'Scannlain goes on and talks about the Engel v. Vitale case \nwhich eliminated prayer in schools, the first such case. They said they \ncould not say a prayer written by the State. They said that was \ninconsistent with the establishment clause. The State wrote a prayer, \nand the kids were supposed to say it. They could refuse to, but they \nsaid it, and they said that was too much. That was the establishment of \na religion effect. That could be something we could debate, but \ncertainly there is some basis for that reasoning.\n\n  Then he goes on to note, in a footnote, the court said this in \nVitale:\n\n       There is of course nothing in the decision reached here \n     that is inconsistent with the fact that school children and \n     others are officially encouraged to express love for our \n     country by reciting historical documents such as the \n     Declaration of Independence which contain references to the \n     Deity or by singing officially espoused anthems which include \n     the composer's professions of faith in a Supreme Being, or \n     with the fact that there are many manifestations in our \n     public life of belief in God. Such patriotic or ceremonial \n     occasions bear no true resemblance to the unquestioned \n     religious exercise that the State of New York had sponsored \n     [by mandating a State prayer.]\n\n  Then the next case in this line of cases came, Abbington School \nDistrict v. Schempp. They required in Pennsylvania that at least 10 \nverses from the Holy Bible shall be read without comment at the opening \nof every public school each day. I guess they would probably put them \nin jail today for even expressing that. So they read the bible verses \nevery day in the school. This was followed by a recitation of the \nLord's Prayer, and finally the class would recite the Pledge of \nAllegiance. The court struck down the Bible reading and the practice of \nreciting the school prayer as a State-proscribed religious ceremony but \nsaid nothing at all about the Pledge of Allegiance. Why didn't they \nstrike that down?\n  Here we have the Ninth Circuit going off on a tangent, clearly by \nimplication contrary to the views even of the U.S. Supreme Court, which \nhave gone too far in their hostility to religious expression. Even \nJustice Brennan, who I noted earlier was the leader of the activist \ngroup at the high water mark of activism, said this in that case:\n\n       For Justice Brennan, ``religious exercises in the public \n     schools present a unique problem'' but ``not every \n     involvement of religion in public life violates the \n     Establishment Clause.'' He warned that ``[a]ny attempt to \n     impose rigid limits upon the mention of God . . . in the \n     classroom would be fraught with dangers.'' Specifically, he \n     wrote that ``[t]he reference to divinity in the revised \n     pledge of allegiance . . . may merely recognize the \n     historical fact that our Nation was believed to have been \n     founded `under God.' Thus reciting the pledge may be no more \n     of a religious exercise than the reading aloud of Lincoln's \n     Gettysburg Address, which contains illusions to this \n     historical fact.''\n\n  Historically, it is a fact that we believe in this country, or most \nAmericans believe, this country was founded under God.\n  Then we had one of the more bizarre cases that came out of Alabama. \nApparently out of pique, the Supreme Court became angered that the \nState of Alabama passed a law that prescribed a moment of silence or \nmeditation before each day as school commenced. Can you imagine that? \nHow horrible this is. It took the attention of the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Wallace v. Jaffree, 1985. It dealt with the constitutionality of an \nAlabama statute authorizing a 1-minute period of silence in public \nschools for ``meditation or voluntary prayer.''\n  The Supreme Court said that was unjustified and struck that down. \nWhat a ridiculous opinion that was. When I was a lawyer practicing \nbefore courts, I never said those kinds of words about courts. I took \nmy lumps if I didn't agree with opinions, and I accepted the rulings of \nthe court. I think we ought to be respectful. Here I am in a coequal \nbranch, and I am an elected politician now and, I am telling you, there \nis no basis for that opinion.\n  So the Supreme Court is all confused about this. Some of the problems \nin the Ninth Circuit are due to their confusion. It is time for them to \nstraighten up and figure this thing out and give us decent principles \nthat will guide us. It is clear under Supreme Court law today that \nconducting a formal religious observance conflicts with the subtle \nrules pertaining to prayer and the religious exercise of students. \nPrayer was considered an overt religious exercise and that ``prayer \nexercises in public schools carry a particular risk of indirect \ncoercion.''\n  But the Court, in a third case, Lee v. Weisman, discussed this very \nissue again. It took pains in the Lee case, which is the last of the \ncases I am citing here. The Court took pains to stress the confines of \nits holding; that is, how the holding was limited, concluding that ``we \ndo not hold that every State action implicating religion is invalid if \none or a few citizens find it offensive,'' and that ``a relentless and \nall-pervasive attempt to exclude religion from every aspect of public \nlife could itself become inconsistent with the Constitution.''\n  Now, that is strong and important language. ``A relentless and all-\npervasive attempt to exclude religion from every aspect of public life \ncould itself become inconsistent with the Constitution.'' I certainly \nagree with that. Now, I will point out that the Ninth Circuit, oddly, \nfailed to accept even rehearing by the full Court. Why did they do \nthat? The Senator has expressed some ideas about why. They were not \nvery complimentary and did not suggest it was because of high ideals \nthat they refused to even have the full Court review this panel. But I \npoint out that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, a coequal circuit \nwith the Ninth Circuit, already considered the pledge case, and it has \nfound it did not establish a religion.\n  So, normally, when a circuit is wrestling with whether or not a case \nis important and whether or not there is a dispute in the law, they \nwould much more normally ask for and allow a rehearing to occur en \nbanc.\n  The Seventh Circuit, when they considered it, framed the question \nprecisely this way: ``Does `under God' make the Pledge a prayer whose \nrecitation violates the establishment clause\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\nof the first amendment?'' They answered that question in the negative. \nThe Supreme Court, according to Justice O'Scannlain, has insisted that \ninterpretations of the establishment clause must comport ``with what \nhistory reveals was the contemporaneous understanding of its \nguarantees.'' ``The line we must draw between the permissible and the \nimpermissible is one which accords with history and faithfully reflects \nthe understanding of the Founding Fathers.''\n  So we are going to interpret the first amendment to prohibit the \nestablishment of a religion and also prohibit Congress from passing any \nlaw that would restrict the free exercise of religion. We have to ask \nourselves what did it mean when they wrote it? As Judge Fernandez, who \ndissented on the original opinion, so eloquently points out in his \ndissent: Only the purist exercise in sophistry could save multiple \nreferences to our religious heritage in our national life from Newdow \nII's--that is the case in California--axe. Of course, the Constitution \nexplicitly mentions God--this is Justice O'Scannlain's opinion quoting \nJudge Fernandez--as does the Declaration of Independence, the document \nwhich marked us as a separate people, declared us independent. The \nGettysburg Address, inconveniently for the majority, contains the same \nprecise phrase--``under God''--found to constitute an Establishment \nClause violation in the pledge.\n\n  After Newdow II, are we to suppose that, were a school to permit--not \nrequire--the recitation of the Constitution, the Declaration of \nIndependence, or the Gettysburg Address in public schools, that, too, \nwould violate the Constitution? Were the ``Founders of the United \nStates . . . unable to understand their own handiwork?'' Were the \nFounders themselves unable to understand? When they put in the \nConstitution that we would not establish a religion, did they have any \nidea we were going to be striking down any references in their own \nDeclaration of Independence to God, or in their own Constitution of \nwhich this was just a part? Of course, they didn't.\n  What that says is, of course, that was not what they intended. They \nnever intended, when they passed the first amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States of America, that we would eliminate \nall references to a higher being in America.\n  Well, as Justice O'Scannlain notes, somewhat ingeniously indeed, that \nthe recitation of the Declaration of Independence would seem to be a \nbetter candidate for the chopping block than the pledge, since the \npledge does not require anyone to acknowledge the personal relationship \nwith God to which the declaration speaks. So, too, with the National \nAnthem or our national motto, ``In God We Trust.''\n  What about our national celebration of Thanksgiving Day? It goes back \nto President George Washington's time when Congress stated that there \nwas ``to be observed by acknowledgement with grateful hearts the many \nand signal favours of Almighty God.'' Congress made Thanksgiving a \npermanent holiday in 1941, and Christmas has been a national holiday \nsince 1894. Are Newdow's constitutional rights violated when his \ndaughter is told not to attend school on Thanksgiving? On Christmas \nDay? Must school outings to Federal courts be prohibited, lest the \nchildren be unduly influenced by the dreaded intonation ``God save \nthese United States and this honorable Court.''? Are the schoolchildren \nnot to go to the Supreme Court to hear arguments because it invokes God \nbefore Court starts every day?\n  Justice O'Scannlain says:\n\n       A theory of the Establishment Clause that would have the \n     effect of driving out of our public life the multiple \n     references to the Divine that run through our laws, our \n     rituals, and our ceremonies is no theory at all.\n\n  Of course, the Supreme Court, as I mentioned earlier, in several \ndifferent cases, has directly, and by implication, affirmed the Pledge \nof Allegiance.\n  A full hearing of this case, which I am sure the Supreme Court will \nhear, will make clear this pledge will stand. I hope also they will \ntake it upon themselves to deal with the confusion they have created in \nthis inconsistent body of law.\n  Even Justice Brennan, that most stalwart supporter of separation of \nchurch and State, acknowledges that some official recognition of God is \nappropriate ``if the Government is not to adopt a stilted indifference \nto the religious life of the people.''\n  The decision reached in this case, I submit, does precisely that: \nJustice O'Scannlain says it adopts a stilted indifference to our past \nand present realities as a predominantly religious people.\n  Justice O'Scannlain goes a little further. He raises another point. \nReally, when it is all said and done, this opinion does not stand for \nneutrality in religion; this decision stands for and, in fact, favors \natheism over religion. The absolute prohibition of any mention of God \nin our schools creates a bias against religion. The majority simply \ncannot credibly advance the notion that it is neutral with respect to \nbelief versus nonbelief. It affirmatively favors nonbelief over belief. \nOne wonders, then, does atheism become the default religion protected \nby the establishment clause?\n  We have people who object to putting in one clause in textbooks. I am \nnot one who thinks church people ought to write the creation story or \nthe evolution story in our textbooks. I think it would be appropriate, \nhowever, that our textbooks say that many believe the creating of life \non this planet was conducted by a higher being. I do not see any \nproblem with that. But some oppose even such a statement as that.\n  We have a lot of weird actions going on out there today by our \ncourts. We have, as I mentioned--hopefully, we do not have any left--\nthose who believe the Constitution itself, which prescribed how the \ndeath penalty should be conducted, prohibited death penalties. We have \na problem in America in our legal system. It is the greatest legal \nsystem in the world. It is a system that has protected us in \nextraordinary ways, but we have to have judges who show restraint and \nwho follow the law.\n  I notice two judges about whom people expressed concern, both \nnominated by President Clinton and confirmed, both of whom I opposed, \nalthough I voted for 95 percent of President Clinton's nominees--they \nhave on separate panels, for example, authored opinions to overturn \nCalifornia's three-strikes-and-you're-out law. That has been on the \nbooks for years. As soon as they get on the Federal bench, they say the \nU.S. Constitution says your three-strikes-and-you're-out law passed by \nthe people of California that has helped precipitate a rapid decline in \ncrime in California and save thousands and thousands of lives is \nunconstitutional.\n  I think these are activist opinions. I think they will be reversed. \nIn Andrade v. the Attorney General of California, Judge Paez ruled a \nlifetime sentence for a seven-time repeat offender was cruel and \nunusual. Seven times, Mr. President, and that number includes only his \nFederal offenses. Andrade also had more than a few convictions in State \ncourt. While he was on probation for a 1982 conviction, he burglarized \nthree separate residences. Still, a lifetime sentence under the three-\nstrikes-and-you're-out rule was too much for Judge Paez. He found the \nstatute that provided for it unconstitutional.\n  In Brown v. the Attorney General of the State of California, Judge \nBerzon held that a 25-year term of imprisonment for two defendants \nconvicted of petty thefts, Ernest Bray and Richard Brown, constituted \ncruel and unusual punishment. The reality is each defendant deserved \ntheir 25-year term of imprisonment. Each had a laundry list of offenses \non their record. Defendants Bray and Brown are the type of career \ncriminals that California's three-strikes law attempted to keep off the \nstreets. Bray had four separate robbery convictions. Robbery is the \ntaking of property through force and violence. One of those robberies \nwas a situation in which shots were fired at the victim, and one where \nthe victim was hit and kicked, not even considered by the jury. The \njury did not get to consider his other offenses--obstructing and \nresisting a public officer, and trespass in 1979, possession of a \ndangerous weapon in 1985, being under the influence of a controlled \nsubstance in 1991, and petty theft with a prior conviction while out on \nbail for the three-strikes offense.\n  Brown's prior convictions included two counts of second-degree \nburglary, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and a robbery \nconviction--two counts of assault with a deadly weapon\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\nand a robbery conviction. Additionally, he had eight other convictions \non his record. Judge Berzon said it was cruel and unusual to put these \noffenders away for this period of time.\n  I am glad to see my distinguished colleague from Vermont in the \nChamber. I supported a judge from Vermont. He had a good name, William \nSessions. He has been on the bench only a few years and he has declared \nthat the way the Federal death penalty is conducted to be \nunconstitutional. I can tell you how it is conducted.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would hope that the distinguished \nSenator, my good friend from Alabama, would state Judge Sessions' \nruling accurately. Judge Sessions has stated he feels the death penalty \nis constitutional. He has a matter that has been very thoroughly ruled \non in a particular case and the way it was handled in that particular \ncase and did it in a way so that the courts of appeals can rule on it, \nnot the least of which has been done by a number of other judges. In \nfact, among those judges who would rule on it, several were appointed \nby President Reagan and by former President Bush and the current \nPresident Bush.\n  I am sure if the Senator suggests there might be something political \nin this, it is being set up in such a way that still the ultimate \ndecision would be decided by a majority of judges appointed by \nRepublican Presidents.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think we should be correct. As I understand his \nruling, it was not that the act was unconstitutional, Senator Leahy is \ncorrect, and I do not think I said that, but the way it was carried out \nraised constitutional implications.\n  I will note, having been a Federal prosecutor myself for 15 years, I \nknow Janet Reno personally set up a committee to approve any death \npenalty case in Federal court, and that committee was charged with the \nresponsibility of making sure it was fairly and objectively \nadministered.\n  She made the final decision on it. I know she opposed the death \npenalty herself personally. So I do not believe the Federal justice \nsystem of handling the death penalty is unfair.\n  Going further than that, in July of last year, Judge Jed Rakoff of \nthe Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled more broadly that the \nFederal Death Penalty Act was unconstitutional, saying the death \npenalty is:\n\n       Tantamount to a foreseeable state-sponsored murder of \n     innocent human beings.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield briefly for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In that case, when that went on appeal to the same court \nthat will be hearing the Sessions case, they overruled the judge the \nSenator referred to; is that not correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They absolutely did. That was my next point I was going \nto make.\n  Mr. LEAHY. My point being, there are checks and balances in here.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, the checks and balances did not work in the Ninth \nCircuit, as Senator Reid guaranteed virtually it would when he made \nremarks suggesting that panel was going to override the three-judge \npanel.\n  The problem is, and the reason it is important, is these are rulings \nthat reflect a person's personal views. A judge should not overcome the \nlaw. If he wants to go out and write letters and argue that the death \npenalty is unfair and should be repealed, I guess if he can do that \nconsistent with his ethical standards, that is all right. He certainly \ncan make reasoned remarks on it. I do not think he should use the power \nof his bench to strike it down.\n  There are many more examples of recent rulings with which most \nAmericans would not agree. Take for example a recent ruling concerning \nthe Ohio State motto, ``With God all things are possible.'' The Sixth \nCircuit recently told Ohio its motto was unconstitutional. What about \nours, ``In God We Trust''?\n  It would take a Philadelphia lawyer to distinguish why ``In God We \nTrust'' is OK and the Ohio motto ``With God all things are possible,'' \nis not. The Sixth Circuit told Ohio its motto was unconstitutional \nbecause it established a religion, and that is really weird.\n  There are many cases around the country where you cannot have \nChristmas decorations put up. We have death penalty laws being struck \ndown. We have three-strikes-and-you're-out laws being struck down. If \nthey violate the Constitution, that is all right; they should be \nstricken. If someone passes a death penalty law in a fashion that is \nviolative of the U.S. Constitution, a Federal court--or a State court, \nfor that matter--should strike it down on the spot. If a three-strikes-\nand-you're-out law is unconstitutional, it ought to be stricken. But so \nfar as I have been able to ascertain, States are empowered to set \npenalties for crimes in their States. They can enhance penalties for \nmultiple offenses, and judges can give enhanced penalties for multiple \noffenses.\n  In my view, there is no law, no basis, for us declaring that these \nacts are unconstitutional.\n  The point of all of that is to say: This is what activism is. This is \nwhat President Bush has said in his campaign he does not want. He is \nnot asking the judges he nominates to carry out his agenda politically. \nHe is prepared to fight it out in this Congress and with the American \npeople. He does not want those judges conducting and carrying out their \npolitical agendas through the interpretation, misinterpretation, or the \nreinterpretation of the meanings of words and statutes in our \nConstitution. It is a very big deal.\n\n  I hope the Supreme Court will take seriously its responsibility to \nguide us out of this thicket it has gotten us in with regard to its \nconfused and inconsistent rulings on the separation of church and \nstate, on the observance of an issue of any kind of reference to God in \npublic life.\n  I did have a church group that came and visited me. They said they \nwere in the Supreme Court. They were very sincere, wonderful young \npeople. They took their faith seriously and they took a moment over to \nthe side and all huddled around and had a prayer for these United \nStates of America and the legal system of America. The guard in the \nSupreme Court came along and shooed them out and said they could not be \npraying in the Supreme Court.\n  So this is the kind of example of overreaching that we hear about in \nour schools, in our public affairs, on our courthouse squares, and even \nin the opinions of Federal judges. We can do better.\n  We need to appoint judges who are committed to following the law. \nMiguel Estrada is that kind of person. That is the only thing he stands \nfor. That is the only thing in his record he is known for; that he \nbelieves we ought not to abuse the system; that judges ought to show \nrestraint. That is what he will do if confirmed. That is why the \nAmerican Bar Association unanimously gave him the highest rating they \ngive, which is received by only a very few nominees. That is why \nPresident Bush has asked the American people to allow him to do what he \nran for office to do. He said this is what we are going to do. This is \nhow I look at the courts and that is what we are going to try to do.\n  I do not see why anybody should be afraid of a judge who follows the \nlaw. What we should be afraid of is judges who believe they have a \nright to reinterpret the law and impose their own views on all the rest \nof us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sorry. I thought when I came we were having a debate \non the Ninth Circuit, which I understand has now put the Pledge of \nAllegiance case on the fast track to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has \na majority of conservative Republicans. I am sure the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama will be very happy with whatever way they rule on \nthat.\n  In the meantime, I say to those in my State of Vermont who ask, there \nhas been no challenge to the law in Vermont. We are not within the \nNinth Circuit, and I expect children in Vermont will continue to say \nthe pledge as we have been saying it since sometime in the 1950s, I \nbelieve, when the words ``under God'' were added to it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have spent a lot of time talking about \nthe Pledge of Allegiance, which is important to the American people, \nand about the Estrada nomination, something that could be settled very \nquickly if the White House wanted to settle the matter. They have made \nit very clear that they do not. In fact, they have even gone so far as \nto publicly reject calls from a distinguished Republican, a Senator in \nthis body, to do so. That has been in keeping with the attitude we have \nseen more and more on such judicial matters by the White House. They \ntake the attitude that the Senate is irrelevant, that we should simply \ndo whatever they say--and sometimes do.\n\n  The Senate majority replaced their majority leader at the request of \nthe White House, something unprecedented. And now they seem willing to \nalso take the attitude that if they confirm someone, just do it without \neven asking questions about the person.\n  The fact is, we would probably have this debate over now if they \nbrought forward the writings of Mr. Estrada, which he said under oath \nhe was perfectly willing to bring forward. If it weren't for that, we \nwould have had the hearings and be finished by now.\n  As I go around the country, my own State or other parts of the \ncountry, I have not had an awful lot of people come to me and say: \nThank God the Senate is debating one judge.\n  Since President Bush took office we have confirmed 105 or 106 or 107 \nof his judges anyway. We are going to spend weeks debating that.\n  What I hear from people is: Why is there not any discussion about a \npossible war against Iraq? The British Parliament has had a major \ndebate on it. The Turkish Parliament had a major debate on it. The \nCanadian Parliament had a major debate on it. Country after country is \ndebating this issue.\n  What is the Senate, the most deliberative body in the world, the body \nthat considers itself the leading parliamentary body in the world, what \nhave we done?\n  The impression of the American people is, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, is that the Senate does not want to discuss a war with Iraq. \nI guarantee that if any one of 100 Senators go home--go into any \nrestaurant, any diner, any gas station, any grocery store in their own \nState, they will find that most people are asking each other if we are \ngoing to war or we are not going to war. They are not discussing \nwhether instead of 105 judges having been confirmed so far for \nPresident Bush, it will be 106 judges. That is not what they are \nconcerned about.\n  On February 26, we listened to the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Byrd, who pointed out with characteristic clarity \nand eloquence the President's failure to request a single dime in his \nfiscal year 2004 budget, which he sent to Congress recently, to finance \na war with Iraq. It is almost as if the White House believes we can \nfight a war and somehow sprinkle fairy dust and the money will just \nmiraculously appear to pay for it.\n  As I listened to the Senator's remarks, I could not help but be \nstruck again about the cavalier and dismissive way the administration \nhas dealt not only with our allies and friends on the issue of \ndisarming Iraq but also with the Congress and the American people. \nEssentially their attitude has been: We do not need you. We do not have \nto tell you, but you better support us.\n  We have seen administration officials globe trotting, in some cases \noffering billions of dollars and even trade concessions to the \ndisadvantage of American workers, to other governments, in support of a \nwar against Iraq. They will not ask Congress for a dime to pay for the \nwar, but they are running around the world offering billions of dollars \nto other countries so they will support us.\n  When I see the billions of dollars being promised to Turkey and \neverywhere else, I ask: What about the first responders at home on the \nfront line, protecting our security? They have been promised money. The \nPresident gave a good speech in New York City about how the first \nresponders will be prepared to respond to terrorism, and that U.S. \nGovernment will be there to support them. But it is the old ``the check \nis in the mail.''\n  I look at my own State of Vermont. Like the State of the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, it borders Canada. We have unique \nproblems because there we have an international border. We need to do a \nlot more to protect our borders and to respond, but we do not have the \nmoney to do it.\n  I say to the distinguished Presiding Officer, if there is a terrorist \nattack, God forbid, against a nuclear power plant on the border between \nVermont and New Hampshire, the first calls, the first 9-1-1 calls will \nnot go to the Office of Homeland Security. They will go to the local \nsheriffs and the local fire departments and the local hospitals. But we \nare not giving them the money that was promised.\n  The President acknowledged when he signed the huge omnibus \nappropriations bill--a bill, incidentally, that was scrubbed carefully \nall its way through by the White House, that it did not include \nsufficient funds for local and State governments to protect their \ncitizens against terrorism. That is something Senator Byrd and I and \nothers had been saying for months. There is not enough money in there. \nI guess the White House thought no one would read it.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld was asked what is the cost of a war against Iraq? \nHis response was that it is ``unknowable.''\n  Senator Byrd mentioned this last week, and then Deputy Secretary \nWolfowitz told Congress the same thing.\n  No one can predict with certainty how long a war will last or \nprecisely what it will cost, not to mention the potentially immense \ncost of caring for an estimated 2 million refugees and of rebuilding \nIraq.\n  But to say we do not have any idea, that is maybe convenient, but it \nis totally unacceptable.\n  The American people should not be asked to send their sons and \ndaughters into battle without an even rudimentary understanding of what \nthe potential costs are, both in dollars and American lives. None of us \nexpect the Pentagon to calculate these costs with precision, but there \nis no doubt that a war, and its aftermath, would cost tens if not \nhundreds of billions of dollars, as the President's former economic \nadviser predicted.\n  If we are going to commit American taxpayers to a war costing \nhundreds of billions of dollars, let us say so. If we are going to \npromise American taxpayers that there will be first responders to \nprotect them in their local communities, let us also be honest and say \nthat we provided the money.\n  In fact, the cost of a war, at least one in which Saddam Hussein's \narmy is quickly defeated as the administration optimistically predicts, \nhas been estimated by the administration. So what was to prevent the \nPresident from at least requesting the best-case scenario, somewhere \nbetween $60 billion and $95 billion at last count, in his fiscal year \n2004 budget?\n  I think there is only one explanation. The President does not want to \nask the American people whether--in the midst of a recession with no \nend in sight, with millions of jobs already lost, more jobs lost during \nthis President's term than that of any other President in my lifetime, \nand more Americans becoming unemployed every week--he did not want to \nask the American people whether we can afford to spend tens or hundreds \nof billions of dollars on a war that fully half the American people do \nnot support.\n  We did this during Vietnam. Nobody wanted to say what it cost because \nthey knew what the reaction would be.\n  I want to see Saddam Hussein disarmed as much as anyone. His despotic \nreign and his obsession with acquiring weapons of mass destruction \nwhile his people suffer has been disastrous for his country and for \nIraq's neighbors.\n  But, if we look back over the past several months, this \nadministration's handling of the Iraq issue has been notable for its \nsecrecy, its doublespeak, and its arrogance. One day they are \ndismissing the United Nations as irrelevant. The next day they are \nmaking either threats or billion-dollar deals with allies or members of \nthe Security Council to win their support for a resolution authorizing \nthe use of force.\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\n  Depending upon who the messenger is, or whether they are speaking \npublicly or behind closed doors, the President first said the goal was \nregime change, then disarmament, and now both, but that one cannot \noccur without the other.\n  The President has told the American people he has not yet made a \ndecision to attack Iraq, but his advisers are telling the rest of the \nworld that the decision has been made, and the Security Council of the \nUnited Nations doesn't matter because we are going ahead, no matter \nwhat. This is the administration's attitude, even while some of our \nclosest allies work to explore alternative options that could avoid \nwar.\n\n  The administration's rhetoric and actions have damaged key alliances \nand weakened our ability to work with allies and friends, not only to \ndisarm Iraq but to solve many other global problems. They have \nrecklessly squandered the reservoir of good will our Nation had around \nthe world in the aftermath of September 11. Never in generations has \nthe world been as united behind the United States as it was after \nSeptember 11. In only one year, we have squandered that support.\n  How are we going to pay for this war? Apparently not by requesting \nthe funds in the budget. They have not done that. Again, as Senator \nByrd pointed out, the amount of money requested in the budget, to plan \nand carry out a war, and for its aftermath, is zero.\n  It is reminiscent of Afghanistan, the country the President said he \nis committed to for as long as it take to keep it from again becoming a \nhaven for terrorists. The amount of money requested by the \nadministration last year was zero. It is like promising the money for \nfirst responders in Texas or Vermont or New Hampshire or anywhere else, \nand then leaving it out of the budget.\n  So how will they do? By paying for it with red ink, cranking up the \nprinting presses and adding to the deficit. This President inherited \nthe largest surplus of any President in history. He is now building up \nthe largest deficit of any President in history: Another hundred \nbillion, what is the difference? That is the way they talk.\n  Yet these are the same people who were giving great speeches just a \nfew years ago about why we need a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget. They ought to be darned glad they didn't get what they \nwished for.\n  So, a balanced budget doesn't make any difference, the deficit \ndoesn't make any difference, and don't look behind the curtain because \nwe are not going to tell you how much it is going to. Let us hope the \nPresident's advisers are right and the war is over in a matter of \nweeks. Sometimes wars do end quickly.\n  I remember my son, a young marine, was called up in Desert Storm. \nLike his fellow marines, this young lance corporal answered, ``Aye, \naye,'' and set off with his fellow marines. The war ended very quickly. \nHe was not in harm's way, unlike others who were.\n  I am proud of him for volunteering to go. I am proud of all America's \nmen and women who will answer the Commander in Chief's call to go. But \nI believe we ought at least know what we are asking them to do and why.\n  Let us hope the war is over in a matter of weeks. Let us hope the \nIraqi Army does crumble like a house of cards. Let us hope Saddam \nHussein does not blow up his oil wells and refineries. Let us hope he \ndoes not use his chemical or biological weapons. Let us hope our troops \ndo not become bogged down in hand-to-hand urban combat, and that there \nwill be few Iraqi civilians killed. Let us hope that predictions of \nmassive unrest throughout the Muslim world in protest at the U.S. \ninvasion of Iraq, and increases in the number of terrorist attacks \nagainst Americans, will be proven groundless. Let us hope the ethnic \nand religious factions within Iraq, some of which hate each other, will \nput aside their differences and join together to build the \nrepresentative, democratic government the President has promised. And \nlet us hope the President's grand vision, about which we have been \ngiven no details, to make the entire Middle East democratic, will be \noff to a successful start. Let us hope so.\n  But let us also understand it is possible that any one of these dire \npredictions could come true and any one of them could be disastrous for \nour soldiers, for innocent civilians, for the U.S. economy, for our \nnational interests abroad, for the Middle East, for the world, and for \nthe fight against terrorism.\n  Wars are unpredictable. The real costs of a war against Iraq may not \nbe known until long after this President's term is over.\n  Who knew, back in 1991, that thousands of gulf war veterans would \nsuffer from unexplained, debilitating medical problems years after the \nwar ended and that many would never be able to work again? Who can say \nthis war will not be the spark that ignites more terrorism against the \nUnited States--perhaps not this year or even next year, but in 3 years \nor 4 years? By that time, it will be too late.\n  We have to think about these things even if the President would \nrather not talk about them. We have a duty to ask what are the \nadministration's real motivations for this war. Is it to get rid of \nweapons of mass destruction from Iraq? If so, why not give the U.N. \ninspectors the time they need and a plan for enforcing disarmament? Is \nit to promote democracy in Iraq? If so, then why not begin with Kuwait, \nwhich we liberated a decade ago but which even today remains a \nmonarchy, where women still are not allowed to vote?\n  We have a duty to ask these questions, and to warn the American \npeople of the risks, even if the President will not. And we must do \neverything we can to be sure that if war comes, it is supported by the \nbroadest possible coalition.\n  So I commend the senior Senator from West Virginia for his remarks \nlast week, and for the other statements he has made on this issue. He \nhas asked the questions that need to be asked. I hope the \nadministration, finally, will give the answers before the country goes \nto war, and not after.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                         Texas Independence Day\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, March 2 is Texas Independence Day. \nEvery year I have been in the Senate, I have carried on the tradition, \nstarted by Senator John Tower, of reading on or about March 2--Texas \nIndependence Day--William Barret Travis's letter from the Alamo.\n  I just want to give a little background because, of course, Texas is \nthe only State that came into our Nation as a nation. Texas was a \nrepublic for 10 years, having fought very hard for its independence \nfrom Mexico.\n  In fact, William Barret Travis's letter was dated February 24, 1836. \nHis letter was an appeal for support because he only had 184 men in the \nAlamo, in the garrison, and, of course, he was vastly outnumbered by \nthe Mexican Army. So he was asking for help. He was pleading for help.\n  All of this was happening around the time that the duly elected \nmembers of the Declaration of Independence Congress were coming to \nWashington-on-the-Brazos to sign the Texas Declaration of Independence \nfrom Mexico.\n  It was a trying time between February and April of 1836 for these \nTexans who were trying to gain their independence and who eventually \nbecame a part of America.\n  It was at the Alamo, in San Antonio, TX--Tejas at the time--that 184 \nTexas rebels, led by William Barret Travis, made their stand against \nSanta Anna's vastly superior Mexican Army.\n  These Texas patriots did not even have uniforms. They barely had \narms. In fact, they only had about $1,000 to fund this entire army. So \nthey did not waste any money on uniforms. They needed arms, and that is \nwhere they spent their money.\n  On the second day of the siege, February 24, 1836, Travis called for \nreinforcements with this heroic message:\n\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna--I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man--the enemy has demanded a surrender \n     at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken--I have answered the demands with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the \n     wall--I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism \n     and of everything dear to the American character, to come to \n     our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving \n     reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\n     to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call \n     is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as \n     possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due \n     to his own honor and that of his country--Victory or Death.\n                                            William Barret Travis,\n                                              Lt. Col., Commander.\n\n  This went out on February 24, 1836. Those 184 brave men held the \nAlamo, with no reinforcements, until March the 6th of 1836. They held \nall that time against exactly what William Barret Travis thought would \nhappen. Thousands of Mexicans in the army were gathering steam to \nattack the Alamo. He never got reinforcements.\n  The Alamo fell on March 6. Just four days earlier, the men who were \nelected to the convention signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. \nMy great-great-grandfather was one of those, elected from Nacogdoches \nCounty. He was alcalde of Nacogdoches County at the time. He went, \nalong with Thomas Rusk, the first man to hold the seat that I now hold \nin the Senate, to Washington-on-the-Brazos, and they both signed the \nTexas Declaration of Independence.\n  It was during that time that women and children in the Nacogdoches \narea were being besieged by Indians, and they were concerned that the \nMexican Army might also be coming there. So they fled in what is called \nthe Runaway Scrape toward Louisiana. All four of my great-great-\ngrandfather's children died in the Runaway Scrape. All four of his \nliving children died. And yet those brave settlers went back to \nNacogdoches and raised nine more children. So they were the kind of \nstock that settled our State and our country.\n  It was April 21 that Santa Anna finally was defeated at the battle of \nSan Jacinto, led by Gen. Sam Houston, who was the commander there. So \nthe time period between February and April 21 was key in the Texas \nindependence and the beginning of the new republic. Texas was a \nrepublic, an independent nation, for 10 years before they joined the \nUnited States as a State in the United States.\n  So I always try to remember the brave people. Obviously, in my family \nwe have a lot of stories and a lot of lore about that time because my \nmother grew up in Nacogdoches, and it is the oldest town in Texas, and \nit is one that is rich in our Texas history and is very much a part of \nmy family and so many of the generations who came before us to settle \nour great State.\n  So I am going to continue the tradition as long as I am in the Senate \nbecause I think it is worthy of note that we had our own fight for \nindependence and that we have such a unique character in our State.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for her remarks. I think, indeed, they were very interesting. I \nhad no idea about her family lineage and her interest in the particular \nday. I salute her for her comments on the floor.\n\n\n          Fraud and Manipulation In the Western Energy Market\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes, if I may, to make some \ninformal comments on something that has happened today. Today was the \ndeadline for California to submit to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission the evidence of fraud and manipulation in the western energy \nmarket after a 100-day discovery period.\n  In fact, about 1,000 pages of evidence were submitted to the \nCommission. The problem is that evidence is not released to the public. \nThis is a real problem.\n  I serve on the Energy Committee, and have served there since the \ncrisis in 2000 and 2001 in California. The Energy Committee provides \noversight to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Federal \nPower Act mandates that the FERC must ensure that rates for power are \njust and reasonable throughout the United States.\n  It is very difficult to know whether the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission is in fact ensuring that rates are just and reasonable if \none can never view the evidence.\n  I happen to believe that the FERC has greatly improved. Patrick Wood, \nBill Massey, Nora Brownell have been very strong in making change. That \nchange is welcomed. It was on May 6 of last year that the major change \nbegan. It was then that the FERC ran on its Web site internal memos \ndetailing some of the schemes Enron used in defrauding the marketplace. \nGet Shorty, Ricochet, Death Star, all became known to the general \npublic directly following the posting of these memos. Since that time, \nseveral people have been indicted and pled guilty to fraud.\n  Additionally, more recently, one company, Reliant, was before the \nCommission. The Commission put on their Web site the transcript of tape \nrecordings between Reliant managers. Those transcripts indicated \ninstances where Reliant's plant manager and operations manager talked \nabout holding power offline in California to drive prices up.\n  The operations manager--and this is not a direct quote, it is a \nparaphrase--said, in so many words: We are going to be manipulating the \nmarket tomorrow. So we are going to close down one plant at least for a \nday and perhaps more.\n  And the plant manager said: Oh, yes.\n  Well, that was sort of a dead bang admission of market manipulation. \nFERC, much to their credit, at the very least, fined Reliant $13.8 \nmillion. But they could have sent a much stronger message to the entire \nenergy sector by withdrawing Reliant's ability to sell power at market-\nbased rates. That would have sent a clear and definitive message, yet \ninstead FERC gave Reliant a slap on the wrist.\n  In California, we have a real problem. One year, the entire cost of \nenergy for the entire State was $7 billion. The next year, it was $28 \nbillion; in other words, a 400-percent increase in 1 year's time of the \ncost of energy. The following year, it was $27 billion.\n  I remember when John Bryson, the CEO of Southern California Edison, \ntold me that when they were forced to divest themselves of their \nplants, the energy generator that came in and bought one of their \nplants, to which they were one day selling energy at $30 a megawatt-\nhour, once it went to the other generator, the other generator charged \n$300 a megawatt-hour. When I heard that, I knew it was a real danger \nsignal that something had really gone wrong. Well, we are a long way \ndown the pike since then.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter I wrote this \nmorning to the chairman of FERC, Pat Wood, in which I followed up on an \nearlier letter of February 6, to which I have not had a response, \nasking the FERC to lift the protective order that currently prevents \nthe public from learning about evidence of fraud and manipulation in \nthe western energy marketplace. I point out that now that the 100-day \ndiscovery period has ended, ``I write to reiterate this request and ask \nthe commission to make all evidence public.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Pat Wood,\n     Chairman, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to follow up on my letter \n     of February 6, 2003 to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (FERC) to immediately lift the ``Protective \n     Order'' that currently prevents the public from learning \n     about evidence of fraud and manipulation in the Western \n     Energy Market. Now that this 100-day discovery period has \n     ended, I am writing to reiterate my request and to ask the \n     Commission to make all evidence public--even information FERC \n     has obtained itself.\n       I would also appreciate the opportunity to review the \n     filing submitted today by California parties detailing new \n     evidence of fraud and manipulation in the Western Energy \n     Market. As a member of the Senate Energy Committee and the \n     senior Senator from California. I believe I have a duty and \n     responsibility to have a full working knowledge of the \n     evidence submitted to FERC.\n       I also believe that the evidence collected by FERC should \n     not remain confidential. Since most of the information is \n     over two years old, it no longer has any proprietary value. \n     The widespread nature of abuse of the Western Energy Markets \n     and its resulting economic damage on families and businesses \n     require the Commission to allow the public to immediately \n     review all evidence obtained by FERC.\n       As I stated in my letter last month, I also believe FERC \n     must carefully review all the evidence presented by the \n     California parties and hold hearings if necessary. How can \n     the Commission attempt to remedy the harm done to families \n     and businesses during the energy crisis if FERC cannot \n     determine the extent of abuse in the Western market and its \n     effect on energy prices and supplies?\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request and your \n     continued attention to energy problems on the West Coast.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I also indicate that as the senior Senator from \nCalifornia and as a member of the Energy Committee, I have a specific \nobligation to render oversight to see that FERC is doing its job. How \ncan anyone possibly render due diligence and oversight if they don't \nknow what is being presented nor have access to what is being presented \nto the Commission on which they make their judgments?\n  I have spoken four times now about Miguel Estrada and the general \nstate of the nominations process. I regret where these weeks have taken \nus, frankly. I hope we can come together to overcome what is \nincreasingly separating the two sides of this great body, marring \njudgments and actions relating to the Judiciary Committee's hearing \nprocess and that process through which we advise and consent on \nnominees by the President to Federal judgeships.\n  In order to understand this filibuster over Miguel Estrada, we also \nhave to understand what has led us to this point.\n  I would like to speak specifically to the nominations debate because \nthis is a key area where the administration has, with few exceptions, \nacted in many ways as if the Senate simply doesn't matter. If this \ndebate were only about whether or not we should vote on Miguel Estrada, \nthat would be enough. Make no mistake about it.\n  There are serious questions about this nominee that we can't answer \nwithout more information, information that this nominee and the \nadministration have essentially refused to provide.\n  My colleagues and I have outlined these concerns over and over again \nover the past few weeks. I have pointed out that the District of \nColumbia Circuit is a very critical circuit. Every Member of this body \nknows that and accepts it. It is a circuit that presides over many of \nthe areas of appeal that are of extraordinary concern because they \ninvolve laws we have passed in areas such as worker rights, OSHA, \nSuperfund, wetlands, all environmental concerns, and so on and so \nforth. It has assumed a particular role, if you will, because of the \nfact that two of President Clinton's nominees to this circuit never had \na committee vote--one did not even have a hearing--this is a different \nkind of filibuster. So there are a number of vacancies on this circuit. \nAnd the circuit as it stands is equally divided, Republicans and \nDemocrats equally divided. Therefore, who breaks this equal division is \nreally important because it will swing the court one way or another.\n  Into this mix comes a very young man, 41 years old. When his \nnomination came over, it came over with substantial concerns. The \nHispanic delegation of the House had sat down and met with Mr. Estrada \nfor an hour and a half. They sent out alerts that they did not believe \nthis was a nominee who really represented the concerns of Hispanic \ncitizens. That in itself is not dispositive. I am the first one to \nadmit that.\n  This is a young man. He spent a lot of time on his education. It is \nnot necessarily a requirement that someone serve on a number of civic \ngroups. But it was a point.\n  Immediately, the Hispanic-American community indicated that there was \na great and serious split over this nominee. That in itself is not, \nagain, dispositive.\n  Then we note that he had never been a professor. He had never been a \njudge. He has no writings and no speeches. So when one turned to look \nfor the due diligence, there was very little to see. We have none of \nhis work product or other memos that would give us an idea of what kind \nof thinker he is or what kind of judge he would be. And he refused to \nanswer in the public hearing a number of simple, basic questions that \ngo to the heart of whether he could be a truly impartial judge and set \naside his advocacy. I mentioned on the floor of the Senate that my \noffice had spoken with Professor Paul Bender, who had been his direct \nsupervisor in the Solicitor General's Office. Mr. Bender told my staff, \n``Well, I could not give him certain assignments because I could not be \nassured that he was impartial.''\n\n  This, again, in itself is not dispositive, but it is a danger signal.\n  I talked to individuals who had been interviewed by him in a \nscreening capacity when he was a clerk for Justice Kennedy, and each I \ntalked to indicated that in fact there was a kind of litmus test and \nthat they were told they were too liberal.\n  Again, that is not dispositive. But what all this points out is that \nwe needed--some of us--to find out whether this was a man who could put \naside his advocacy, his strong feelings about certain issues, and \nfollow the law with impartial and wise judgments.\n  I came to the conclusion--and some have faulted me for it--after \nlistening to Jeffrey Sutton, that here was a man who had strong views \nand beliefs, but who was willing to be very fulsome in his answers to \nthe committee, very forthright in his views, and sent a very clear \nsignal--at least to me--that he would, in fact, separate his personal \nviews and the law that he would be charged and constitutionally pledged \nto uphold. So I voted for him.\n  There has been substantial dismay expressed by many of my \nconstituents in California, and I heard them loud and clear when they \npicketed virtually every one of my offices. Nonetheless, I made that \njudgment after listening in a public hearing to questions and answers \nand, at least for myself, came to a conclusion. Only history will tell \nwhether I am right or wrong.\n  Then, several weeks ago, in a markup in committee, I think another \naspect of this situation that perhaps was caused by the strain and the \nraw nerve endings in the Senate came upon the scene.\n  The Judiciary Committee rules contain a clause providing ``on the \nrequest of any member, a nomination or a bill on the agenda of a \ncommittee will be held over until the next meeting of the committee, or \nfor one week, whichever occurs later.'' That appears in the rules of \nthe committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those rules be printed in the Record, \nand I particularly call attention to the rule I have just quoted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Rules of the Committee on the Judiciary\n\n\n                      i. meetings of the committee\n\n       1. Meetings may be called by the Chairman as he may deem \n     necessary on 3 days' notice or in the alternative with the \n     consent of the Ranking Minority Member or pursuant to the \n     provision of Sec. 133(a) of the Legislative Reorganization \n     Act of 1946, as amended.\n       2. Each witness who is to appear before the Committee or \n     any Subcommittee shall file with the Committee, at least 48 \n     hours in advance of the hearing, a written statement of his \n     testimony in as many copies as the Chairman of the Committee \n     or Subcommittee prescribes.\n       3. On the request of any member, a nomination or bill on \n     the agenda of the Committee will be held over until the next \n     meeting of the Committee or for one week, whichever occurs \n     later.\n\n\n                              ii. quorums\n\n       1. Nine members shall constitute a quorum of the Committee \n     when reporting a bill or nomination; provided that proxies \n     shall not be counted in making a quorum.\n       2. For the purpose of taking sworn testimony, a quorum of \n     the Committee and each Subcommittee thereof, now or hereafter \n     appointed, shall consist of one Senator.\n\n\n                              iii. proxies\n\n       When a record vote is taken in the Committee or any bill, \n     resolution, amendment, or any other question, a quorum being \n     present, a member who is unable to attend the meeting may \n     submit his vote by proxy, in writing or by telephone, or \n     through personal instructions. A proxy must be specific with \n     respect to the matters it addresses.\n\n\n                    iv. bringing a matter to a vote\n\n       The Chairman shall entertain a non-debatable motion to \n     bring a matter before the Committee to a vote. If there is \n     objection to bring the matter to a vote without further \n     debate, a rollcall vote of the Committee shall be taken, and \n     debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the matter \n     to a vote without further debate passes with ten votes in the \n     affirmative, one of which must be cast by the Minority.\n\n\n                            v. subcommittees\n\n       1. Any member of the Committee may sit with any \n     Subcommittee during its hearings or any other meeting, but \n     shall not have the authority to vote on any matter before the \n     Subcommittee unless he is a member of such Subcommittee.\n       2. Subcommittees shall be considered de novo whenever there \n     is a change in the Subcommittee chairmanship, and seniority \n     on the particular Subcommittee shall not necessarily apply.\n       3. Except for matters retained at the full Committee, \n     matters shall be referred to the\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\n     appropriate Subcommittee or Subcommittees by the Chairman, \n     except as agreed by a majority vote of the Committee or by \n     the agreement of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority \n     Member.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this rule is designed to protect \nMembers who need more time to examine an issue, to discuss it with \ntheir colleagues, or to prepare amendments. A very relevant factor.\n  My own office was alerted to the presence of Mr. Roberts and of Mrs. \nCook on their hearing agenda the day before the actual hearing. In \nother words, we learned at 4:46 p.m., Tuesday, January 28, that the \nnext day they would be up for hearing along with Mr. Sutton. I ask \nunanimous consent that that e-mail be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Tentative Nominations Witness List\n\n\n   tentative agenda--Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on Judicial \n   Nominations, Wednesday, January 29, 2003 at 9:30 a.m., Dirksen 226\n\n                                Panel I\n\n       The Honorable Dianne Feinstein, United States Senator (D-\n     CA).\n       The Honorable Mike DeWine, United States Senator (R-OH).\n       The Honorable John Cornyn, United States Senator (R-TX).\n       The Honorable John Warner, United States Senator (R-VA).\n       The Honorable Kay Bailey Hutchison, United States Senator \n     (R-TX).\n       The Honorable George Voinovich, United States Senator (R-\n     OH).\n\n                                Panel II\n\n       Deborah Cook to be U.S. Court of Appeals Judge for the \n     Sixth Circuit.\n       John Roberts to be U.S. Court of Appeals Judge for the D.C. \n     Circuit.\n       Jeffrey Sutton to be U.S. Court of Appeals Judge for the \n     Sixth Circuit.\n\n                               Panel III\n\n       John Adams to be U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern \n     District of Ohio.\n       Robert Junell to be U.S. District Court Judge for the \n     Western District of Texas.\n       S. James Otero to be U.S. District Court Judge for the \n     Central District of California.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Now, for those of us on this side, that notice--or \nlack of it--presents a very real problem. Now we knew that Mr. Sutton, \nMrs. Cook, and Mr. Roberts had been pending for some time. But the way \nthings actually work is that the real due diligence is done in \npreparation for the hearing--it is done when the notice comes out. So \nwe truly need time. And I believe the time to study and do our \nindividual due diligence on each nominee would ease a lot of the raw \nnerve endings and scar tissue, which is now very evident on this \ncommittee.\n  Because it is the chairman who schedules matters for a vote, it is \ninevitably members of the minority party who most often need this extra \ntime. As a result, this holdover rule is a rule that is viewed as a \nprotection of minority rights in the Judiciary Committee.\n  After all, a chairman does not need to hold over a bill. If he \ndoesn't want the committee to consider an issue, he can simply refuse \nto add the issue to the agenda, or he can pull it off the agenda, if \nnecessary. Many Clinton nominees suffered this fate, and Members have \nmade that clear, I think, time after time in the past couple of weeks.\n  In any event, this rule has always been interpreted to mean that if a \nSenator asked for a matter to be held over, the earliest it would come \nup again was in 1 week. That week comprises 7 days from the meeting at \nwhich the rule is invoked.\n  Now, we have an exchange from 24 years ago between Senators Thurmond \nand Kennedy about this rule. I want to read from the transcript of that \nJudiciary Committee meeting that occurred on January 24, 1979. Let me \nquote from Senator Thurmond:\n\n       There is one other matter. We have a custom, I guess since \n     the committee was founded, that any Senator can carry over \n     any matter for 1 week, any nomination for 1 week. I assume \n     there is no objection to continuing that.\n\n       Chairman Kennedy: I think that is a reasonable request. I \n     think that if it is on a Tuesday to a Tuesday--why don't we \n     just have it on a Tuesday to a Tuesday, so it is 7 days?\n\n  Seven days, Mr. President. Now, in my 10 years on the Judiciary \nCommittee, this rule has always been interpreted to mean 7 days. Any \nmatter held over must be held over for 7 days, or until the next \nmarkup, whichever occurs later. Obviously, there have been many \noccasions where a chairman of a committee would have preferred to \nschedule another markup immediately to move a nominee or a bill \nforward. After all, a chairman does not schedule a matter for \nconsideration unless he or she is ready to move forward. But regardless \nof the will of the chairman to move more quickly, there has always been \na recognition that rules are rules, and this one has always been \nfollowed--until this year.\n  At the Judiciary Committee markup on Miguel Estrada several weeks \nago, the chairman of the committee attempted to interpret the 1-week \nrule as allowing an issue to be held over for just 6 days rather than \n7. Essentially, he decided to interpret 1 week as being 6 days.\n  Now, before I go into this further, let me say that Senator Hatch is \none of my dearest friends in the Senate. He is a fair chairman. I have \nwatched him for a long time. We have worked together on many important \nissues for the past 10 years. I hold him in the very highest regard. \nEven on the issue of judicial nominations, I know he did his very best \nin a very difficult position over the years, when President Clinton was \nPresident, to balance the strong will of many of his own caucus against \nhis desire to be fair to President Clinton's judicial nominees, and I \nbelieve that very strongly.\n  If anything, this is an indication of how raw nerve endings really \nare. That is all at this point in time.\n  I certainly understand how any chairman might be frustrated by some \nof us and by perhaps all of us who might attempt to thwart his \ntimetable. But this frustration, again, should not be allowed to \nmanifest itself in circumvention of a clear, defined, and decades-old \ncommittee rule. If we allow 1 week to become 6 days, it becomes an hour \ntomorrow, maybe cloture only requires 20 rather than 60 votes or 40 \npercent constitute a majority. This is a bit of an exaggeration.\n  As a matter of fact, it is a major exaggeration, but the Senate and \nits committees have rules for a reason, and we really cannot function \nif we do not follow them.\n  When this 6-day week concept was verbalized, our ranking member, \nSenator Leahy, made it clear that 6 days is not a week. The minority \nwould allow the rule to be waived and a markup to occur in 6 days as a \nmatter of cooperation. And so we waived the rule, partially to avoid a \nconfrontation over this interpretation of the longstanding 7-day rule. \nBut although we avoided a crisis that week, the 6-day concept was sort \nof a foreshadowing of what now seems to be increasingly a plan to \nignore committee rules and move forward over the objections of the \nminority, and people feel very strongly about that.\n  Last week, we saw this plan come to fruition as two nominees were \nmoved out of the Judiciary Committee over the strong objections of \nmembers who wished to continue debate, and despite the clear invocation \nof a decades-old rule, protecting the right of the minority to continue \nto debate until at least one of their own agrees it is time to vote.\n  Senator Daschle spoke on this issue last week, and I want to expand \nbriefly on his comments. The judiciary rule in question contains the \nfollowing language:\n\n       The chairman shall entertain a nondebatable motion to bring \n     a matter before the committee to a vote. If there is \n     objection to bringing the matter to a vote without further \n     debate, a rollcall vote of the committee shall be taken and \n     debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the matter \n     to a vote without further debate passes, with 10 votes in the \n     affirmative, one of which must be cast by the minority.\n\n  What does this rule mean? Over the last few decades, it has clearly \nmeant that unless at least one member of the minority agrees to cut off \ndebate and move straight to a vote, no vote can occur. This is what \nhappened and what came up last Thursday.\n  This is one of the only protections the minority has in our \ncommittee. Without it, there could conceivably never be a debate at \nall. A chairman could convene a markup, demand a vote, and the entire \nprocess would take 2 minutes. That is one of the reasons we feel so \nstrongly about this particular rule. We believe this is not how the \nJudiciary Committee should function, and it is contrary to the rules of \nthe committee.\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\n  As I understand it, this rule was first instituted in 1979, again, \nand it has been followed ever since by all of our chairmen.\n  I believe only two committees have something like it--Finance and \nJudiciary. The reason for it, as I understand it, goes back to Senator \nKennedy's days as chair, when it was determined they didn't want to be \nlike other committees, where with Appropriations you will often have a \ncommittee in the majority just go off on its own, mark up something, \nand everybody is forced to accept it.\n  Let me give you an instance.\n  During the markup of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Civil Rights Division, there was some fear on our side that \nRepublicans who had the votes to defeat the nomination would move \ndirectly to a vote and prevent any debate on the issue at the markup. \nDemocrats, on the other hand, wanted the chance to explain their \nposition and maybe even change some minds on the other side.\n  During that markup, there was significant discussion about what rule \nIV, the rule about cutting off debate, really means. At one point, it \nis interesting to note, Chairman Hatch himself commented that:\n\n       At the appropriate time, I will move to proceed to a vote \n     on the Lee nomination. I assume there will be no objection. \n     It seems to me that he deserves a vote. People deserve to \n     know where we stand on this issue. Then we will, pursuant to \n     rule IV, vote on whether to bring the Lee nomination to a \n     vote. In order to vote on the nomination, we need at least \n     one Democrat to vote to do so.\n\n  This is precisely what we are discussing, Mr. President. In order to \nvote on the nomination, we need at least one Democrat to do so.\n  Last week, we did not have such a vote. No Democrat was prepared to \ncut off debate. I know this because it was discussed ahead of time. \nEven though Senator Kennedy, who has substantial seniority and was \nchairman at the time the rule was put forward in 1979, objected and \ninformed the chairman that no Democrat was ready to stop debating, the \nchairman moved ahead anyway.\n  I had an opportunity to speak to the chairman after this hearing, as \na matter of fact, in the garage of the Hart Office Building. I think he \nhas a very good understanding of the sensitivities and the nerve \nendings that are scratched raw right at this present time. It is my \nhope the chairman will take steps so we can restore to the committee \nthe consideration that has always been extended.\n  Let me say something about Chairman Hatch. I understand how things \ncan get to one in this committee, and I understand on both sides how--\nand the Chair is smiling--how we can be extraordinarily difficult to \npreside over. I would never make an adverse personal comment about this \nchairman because I respect him, I like him, he is a friend, we work \ntogether. I just want to see the two sides come together, and I want to \nsee this stop. I want to give the assurance, at least from this \nSenator, that what I want is ample time to do my due diligence on a \ngiven nominee.\n  Very often letters do not come in until almost the date of hearing. \nAs the hearing date grows close, it seems people begin to know that \nsomething is happening. But if you get the official notice for a \nhearing the day before--and in this case at 4:46 p.m. the day before--\nfor three appellate court nominees, it is extraordinarily difficult.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I will.\n  (Mr. SMITH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from California. I strongly compliment her for \nwhat she has been saying. Is it not a fact, Mr. President, I ask my \nfriend from California, that simply because a Senator wishes more time \nto debate a particular nominee that does not mean that Senator is going \nto vote against the nominee; is that not correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Well, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I mean, that might be.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator would yield further for another question, \nwas it not made clear during the markup that she was speaking about, \nthe executive meeting she was speaking about, that it was stated at \nthat meeting there was very clearly an objection to going forward by at \nleast a couple of Senators, and because of that objection rule IV would \nfall into place, which says debate shall be terminated if the motion to \nbring the matter to a vote without further debate passes with 10 votes \nin the affirmative, one of which must be cast by the minority? So rule \nIV would apply such an objection being made, unless there were 10 votes \nto cut off the debate, with one of those votes coming from the \nminority; is that not correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I say through the Chair to the distinguished ranking \nmember, yes, that is correct. I have the rule before me, and that is \nwhat it says. The Senator is correct that someone objected, yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask my friend from California, and I say this because \nshe has laid out this debate so well and the history of it so well, in \nthis case was it not a fact there were not 10 votes, with one of those \n10 votes being the minority, to cut off debate?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair to the ranking member, yes, that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask again, through the Chair, to my \nfriend from California, is it not a fact that the chairman then, \nnotwithstanding the fact that there has not been a proper vote to cut \noff debate, went ahead and held the vote just the same?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair to the ranking member, that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do not take any pleasure in this. When I became a \nMember of this body, I ran as an independent voice, and I want to be \nthat way. I want to work with both sides, and I have tried to do that. \nI think we are at a point, though, where some action has to be taken to \nrestore the consideration that has usually been offered to members of \nthis committee, that when they have a problem, a little more time is \nprovided.\n  I believe very strongly--I have never used my blue slip. I have said \nI would never use my blue slip prior to a hearing; that I believe \neverybody is entitled to a hearing, and then we should vote the \nindividual up or down, and that is my view. I do not push my view on \nanybody else, but that is how I decided I was going to handle my spot \non this committee. But if the minority gets rolled, we go into a \ndefensive posture and everybody is compelled then to unify and hold \ntogether. I think my colleagues see a lot of this in this filibuster.\n  I am hopeful in the future there can be a precise time when an \nofficial notice is sent out prior to the hearing being scheduled, so \nthat every member of this committee has an opportunity to do their due \ndiligence.\n  It is interesting to note that the votes in the committee--and I have \nthem. On Mrs. Cook, there were 12 yeas, two nays and five present. The \npresent, or pass, votes submitted by the ranking member, myself, \nSenators Feingold, Durbin and Schumer, were really, I think, on this \npoint, that we did not have an ample opportunity to do our due \ndiligence and to ask the questions we needed to ask.\n  On Mr. Roberts, there were 13 yeas, two nays and two present, Senator \nLeahy and Senator Feingold, which probably came from the same venue. In \nother words, they did not feel they had sufficient information to vote.\n  So I am hopeful that in the future we would be able to settle some of \nthese issues in the committee and just bend over backwards. I remember \nthe day when if a Member had a problem with a judge who had been \nrecommended to the President by a specific Senator, that Member picked \nup the phone and called that Senator and said: I just want you to know, \nI have these concerns, and there was this kind of convivial \nrelationship. That is all but gone now.\n  So the process is extraordinarily formal now, and the formality is \ncarried out, for the most part, in the public hearing. So having notice \nto that public hearing becomes really all important.\n  I have pretty much summed up my position and my hope on this. I see \nthe distinguished Senator from Alabama on his feet so I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wanted the Senator to finish, so I \nthank the Chair. Graceful in her remarks, I think nerves are frayed, \nand\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\nperhaps the senior Senator from California can play a role in bringing \nsome things back.\n  The Senator talked about collegiality, and some of us were very \ndisappointed that Strom Thurmond's chief judiciary counsel was \nvirtually blocked last year. We finally got it through at the very last \nminute. So a lot of things have happened. There clearly was a change in \nthe ground rules after Members on the other side asserted that Senator \nHatch did not move nominees fast enough for President Clinton and that, \nof course, we should not filibuster and those sort of things. Then \nafter the election, the ground rules changed and the obstruction of \nnominees President Bush has sent forward has reached a much higher \nlevel. I think no one can doubt that.\n  So we are frustrated also. I do believe we should have more \ncollegiality in the committee, and I believe we can do better.\n  One thing I would ask the Senator, without yielding the floor, I \nwould suggest that on the Cook and Roberts matters, the Senator did \nindicate they had been pending virtually 2 years, well over a year and \na half. No hearings had been held on them, but there had been 2 weeks \nbefore this markup, or the hearing--2 weeks before they had been \nnoticed, so we put it off another 2 weeks. Perhaps the exact time of \nthe hearing or the exact nature of what the hearing was going to be may \nnot have been given to the Senator, but I believe after the first \nrequest the Senator made for a delay, 2 weeks did transpire. I think \nthat would have given people time to be prepared.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I respond to that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield for a question or a comment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair, to answer the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, I asked my counsels when did they first know, and \nthey said, well, informally there was discussion, but the notice--and I \nsaid, well, get me a copy of the notice then. I want to see the notice. \nAnd it was 4:58 the day before.\n  That is the problem. I do not know exactly how all the counsels work, \nbut I can tell the Senator that on our side time is important. Giving a \nlittle bit of time, I think, could go a very long way to solving the \nproblem we are in, officially. so there are no excuses then. The \nofficial notice goes out. Who is on the calendar occurs a substantial \nperiod before the hearing so we have time to do what we need to do, \nparticularly when I think there were seven judges on this particular \ncalendar, three of them appellate judges, meaning it is a very big and \nheavy calendar on which to do your work.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nCalifornia. Hopefully, we can do something better.\n  This side does not intend to be victimized by a racheting up, \nsubstantially, of the process of confirmation that did not occur when \nPresident Clinton was President. This is what has caused the problem.\n  I note these nominees. An absolutely superb nominee, Justice Cook, \nserved on the Supreme Court of Ohio. As Senator Hatch has noted so \noften, Roberts is considered one of the top two appellate lawyers in \nAmerica, an absolute superb candidate, with 39 arguments before the \nSupreme Court.\n  They were denied for over a year, almost 2 years, even a hearing when \nthe Democrats controlled the committee. That is galling. Miguel Estrada \nwas given a hearing a year and a half afterwards, the only one actually \ngiven a hearing. But he was not moved forward out of committee.\n  This is an odd thing to have a concern about frayed nerves when the \nground rules were changed. After President Bush was elected, three \nprofessors went to the Democratic senatorial conference: Lawrence \nTribe, Cas Sunstein, and Marsha Greenburger. They were quoted in the \nNew York Times as saying: We want to change the ground rules. \nObviously, one of them is that they did not conduct hearings. Some \nsuperb nominees never even had hearings.\n  Also not mentioned at the time because the Democrats had the \nmajority, was the filibuster. This is the first time, insofar as I \nknow, in the history of this country we have had a filibuster for a \ndistrict judge or circuit judge. It is not as if Mr. Estrada had any \nserious problems. There is no ethical problem with this wonderful \nnominee. He was rated unanimously well qualified by the American Bar \nAssociation. He was at the top of his class.\n  Regarding his experience, he clerked for a Second Circuit judge. The \nposition he would hold, if confirmed, is a sister circuit, the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals. DC does handle some national issues and \nissues with which the Justice Department deals. He served in the \nJustice Department's Solicitor General's Office. In that position he \nprepared briefs and made arguments before the courts--often, I am sure, \nbefore the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. So he has an intimate \nconnection with that.\n  Under Rudy Guiliani, he worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office of New \nYork, considered one of the most prestigious offices--at least those in \nthe Southern District of New York think it is the finest. It is \ncompetitive. He handled appellate work for them. To the extent to which \nthis nominee has experience with appellate work, it is extraordinary.\n  I believe there is no justifiable basis for blocking his nomination. \nI know a Senator earlier expressed concern that we were somehow \nblocking an ability to take up other matters before the Senate. I would \nlove to move forward. The way we move forward is to give Estrada a \nvote. We are not asking that people vote for him. We are just asking he \nbe given a vote.\n  We have an unprecedented filibuster. Senator Hatch concluded that we \nwere facing a filibuster in committee. Now we have a filibuster of \nEstrada on the floor. The ground rules have changed. We are going to \nput the burden of proof on the nominee. It was one of the views that \nSenator Schumer has put forward. We consider whatever the politics are, \nwhich was never done before, racheting up the pressure on the nominee \nand then we cannot get a vote in committee. Then we cannot get the vote \nbecause every Democrat has to sign off.\n\n  Senator Hatch examined the rules, met with the Parliamentarian. I \nhave not studied the rules. He met with the Parliamentarian and he \nconcluded he had the authority to make the ruling that he made. I don't \nthink he wanted to do that. I think he would like to have proceeded as \nhe had before with collegiality and allowing everyone to have their say \nas long as they wanted. But when you are faced with a systematic \nalteration of the ground rules, a systematic plan to obstruct a \nmovement of nominees of extraordinary ability for years, who ought to \nbe confirmed, and the courts need them, we are at a point where nerves \nare frayed.\n  If the rules are going to be used on one side, rules are going to be \nused on the other side. The President of the United States is not going \nto believe he can give up his right to nominate judges and expect them \nto have a confirmation. It was indicated President Bush maybe was not \nsolicitous enough. But in California I have heard complaints because he \nhas agreed to go along with a commission in California of some sort \nthat gives unprecedented input from Senators from California and others \non the nominees. I don't know how that works, but it is pretty unusual. \nHe also reappointed two Democratic nominees, Barrington Parker and \nGregory, who had been pending and were not confirmed.\n  I am not sure President Clinton ever nominated any Republican judges \nwhen he took over.\n  I believe we are in an unfortunate period, that there is a lot of \nfrustration. It is pretty deep on our side. I don't think the Senator \nwould doubt one moment that the tactics utilized by the Democratic \nminority are different than the tactics utilized when the Republicans \nwere in that position.\n  Where do we go from here? I don't know. But it is a big deal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield for a question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I wanted to make one point, so I will defer.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let me mention a couple of items.\n  It was suggested one of the Department of Justice members, Paul \nBender, raised some question about Miguel Estrada's nomination, but \nBender and the other supervisors in the Clinton Department of Justice--\nremember, he went into the Solicitor General's Office in 1992; surely \nwithin a year or so he\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\nshould have been under the supervision of the Democrats at that time. \nIt probably takes some time to make the change over. Almost his entire \ncareer in the Justice Department was under the leadership of Janet Reno \nand a Democratic Solicitor General. The Democrats gave him the highest \npossible performance rating.\n  Mr. Bender, when he was evaluating him, gave him the highest \nevaluations. I think it odd now that he would come forward and suggest \nthere was a problem. In fact, one of the evaluations given to him \nspecifically noted his loyalty to the policies of the Department of \nJustice.\n  It was also said there was some deal about law clerks and screening \nlaw clerks for Supreme Court Justice Kennedy. Let me point out I think \nit is a great honor that Justice Kennedy was so impressed with Miguel \nEstrada that he asked him to do screening of possible law clerks for \nhim. Justice Kennedy is considered a middle of the road swing Justice \nwho votes with various sides, on various sides, and is not perceived as \nany kind of right-wing ideologue. He liked Estrada so much that he \nasked him to help him screen his law clerks. I think that is a matter \nthat is a positive thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a standing order for a vote on \nanother nominee at 5:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/03/senate-section/article/S3020-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3020-S3021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF MARIAN BLANK HORN, OF MARYLAND, TO BE A JUDGE OF THE \n                 UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 5:30 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will now proceed to the consideration \nof Executive Calendar No. 43, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Marian Blank Horn, of \nMaryland, to be a Judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to speak in support \nof Marian Blank Horn, who has been nominated for a second term on the \nU.S. Federal Court of Claims. Judge Horn is a distinguished United \nStates Court of Federal Claims Judge whose legal career has been \nnothing short of stellar.\n  Judge Horn graduated from Fordham University Law School in 1969, and \nbegan her career as an assistant district attorney in Bronx County, NY, \nbefore joining Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin and Kahn, where she worked \nin the litigation division.\n  From 1973 to 1975, Judge Horn was a project manager for a Study of \nAlternatives to Conventional Criminal Adjudication which was financed \nby the U.S. Department of Justice's Law Assistance Enforcement \nAdministration. She also served as an adjunct professor at American \nUniversity's Washington College of Law, where she taught the \nIntroductory Legal Methods course.\n  In 1975, Judge Horn joined the Office of General Counsel for the \nDepartment of Energy/Federal Energy Administration. From 1979 to 1981, \nJudge Horn served as the deputy assistant general counsel for Financial \nIncentives, Office of General Counsel, where she supervised all legal \nwork related to financial incentives at the United States Department of \nEnergy. In addition, she served as legal advisor to the assistant \nsecretaries for Fossil Energy and Resource Applications, as well as the \nOffice of Energy Research.\n  From 1981 to 1986, she worked in the United States Department of \nInterior, where she assisted the Associate Solicitor and helped \nadminister the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. In \n1985, Judge Horn was promoted to principal deputy solicitor, where she \nsupervised all the Regional and Field Offices of the Solicitor's Office \nin the Department and acted as the chief lawyer to the Secretary and \nUnder Secretary of Department of Interior. So you see that Judge Horn \nalready had a very impressive resume in 1986, when she was first \nconfirmed.\n  Since that time, she has built an excellent reputation as a judge, \nand I am confident that Judge Horn will continue being a fine member of \nthe Federal Bench.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we consider the nomination of Judge \nMarion Blank Horn to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Although this is \nnot a so-called ``Article III'' court with lifetime appointments, it is \nan important court with 15-year terms for its members. Judge Horn has \nbeen serving on the court for almost 15 years and I do not oppose her \nre-appointment. What I do take issue with, however, is the \nAdministration's unilateral actions, in spite of the bipartisan \ncooperation and appointments of other Presidents to this and other \ncourts.\n  The process for nominating judges to the Court of Federal Claims has \ntraditionally included accommodation and compromise. For more than 2 \nyears Senate Republicans blocked President Clinton's appointment of \nLarry Baskir to the court until a compromise could be reached. They \nrefused to give him a hearing and refused to allow any of the other \nvacancies to be filled unless the administration promised to keep \nconservative Judge Loren Smith as the Chief Judge. Republicans also \ninsisted on the reappointment of another Republican appointee, Judge \nChristine Miller. Finally, Senator Hatch agreed to allow five Clinton \nnominees to have hearings and votes if the administration also named \nhis staffer Edward Damich to the court and promised to retain Judge \nSmith as Chief until his retirement into lifetime senior status at the \nend of his term appointment. Upon Chief Judge Smith's ``retirement,'' \nPresident Clinton named Judge Baskir the Chief Judge. Shortly after his \ninauguration, President George W. Bush summarily removed Judge Baskir \nas chief judge and installed Judge Damich as the Chief Judge.\n  Last fall when the Democrats were in the majority, we took the \nexceptional action of quickly moving the nomination of Larry Block to \nthe Court of Federal Claims at the request of the ranking Republican, \nSenator Hatch. At that time, I noted that we would expect fairness and \nconsideration in return, including true bipartisan consultation with \nrespect to Federal Court of Claims nominations. Despite our \naccommodation on Mr. Block's nomination, the White House refused to act \non the nomination of Judge Sarah Wilson who, up until a few months ago, \nwas already serving with distinction on the Court of Federal Claims. \nJudge Wilson is a well-respected and talented lawyer who graduated from \nColumbia Law School, clerked for a Federal judge, was a fellow with the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts, and served in the Department of \nJustice and in a prior White House. Yet, the administration and the \nSenate Republicans refused to accommodate our request to consider her \nnomination for a continued position on the court.\n  It troubles me that despite a long history of compromise and \naccommodation regarding appointments to this court, there has been no \nconsultation with the Democratic leadership regarding the remaining \nnominations to the Court of Federal Claims. Instead, the White House \nproceeded as it does with most things--unilaterally. The same is true \nwith respect to the Parole Commission, the Federal Election Commission \nand many other bipartisan boards and commissions.\n  I can count on one hand the number of States that have any sort of \nbipartisan selection commission for their district court judges. The \nimportance of such organizations is paramount. They ensure that \nnominees for judicial office are selected based upon professional merit \nand experience. The recommendations of such commissions have the \nsupport of members from their community on both sides of aisle. \nAccordingly, these bipartisan commissions preserve the independence and \nintegrity of the judicial branch of government and ensure the fair and \nequal administration and enforcement of justice.\n  Unfortunately, this President has thwarted the development of \nbipartisan boards and commissions for judicial appointments. The White \nHouse Counsel has indicated publicly that he does not favor bipartisan \ncommittees because they ``usurp the president's constitutional \nauthority to choose judges.'' This unilateral and uncompromising view \ndisregards the constitutional role of the Senate. It also fails to \nacknowledge that these commissions simply make recommendations to the \nPresident. They do not make nominations in lieu of the President. The \nadministration's disdain for bipartisan commissions ignores past \nprecedent and tradition.\n  It is one thing for a President to appoint members of his Cabinet to \ncarry out his political agenda but it should be different with respect \nto judicial appointments. When a President makes\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\nnominations for positions to a co-equal branch of government, he should \nnot be able to tip the scales of justice by packing the courts with \nideologues who are selected to implement his political agenda. \nRecently, Walter Dellinger noted that the President's ``slate of \nnominees, considered as a whole, . . . [is] a list tilted to the right \nand from which any other views have been carefully culled.'' I agree \nthat we need to broaden the slate. This could be best accomplished with \nthe creation of new judicial selection commissions who could make \nrecommendations to home State Senators and to the President.\n  I urge the White House and Chairman Hatch to work with us to assemble \nthe type of bipartisan panel that Senator Hatch helped assemble in 1997 \nand 1998 to fill the remaining vacancies on the Court of Federal Claims \nin a way that respects the tradition of compromise and accommodation \nthat has marked appointments to this court. I also look forward to \nworking with Senate Republicans to preserve our constitutional role in \nadvising the President on judicial nominations to all courts through \nthe use of bipartisan selection commissions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Marian Blank Horn, of Maryland, to be a Judge of the United States \nCourt of Federal Claims? On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n     CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard some of the remarks made on \nthe floor today. I thought I would clarify them, clarify the reality of \nwhat really happened. I have had a little bit of criticism by my \ncolleagues from the other side of the floor because we actually had the \ncommittee vote last week when it should have voted. So I took the \nliberty of writing a detailed letter to the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota, the distinguished minority leader, who is a dear friend. \nI know he has been concerned that maybe there was some breach of the \nrules. So I would like to read this letter into the Record so that \neverybody will understand that there was no breach of the rules last \nThursday. Anybody who says there was really doesn't understand the \nrules, does not understand the obligations of the chairman.\n\n       I am writing in response to your comments on the Senate \n     floor concerning the Judiciary Committee's executive business \n     meeting this past Thursday. I know you are a person of the \n     highest principles who would never intentionally misrepresent \n     the actions of a Committee Chairman, particularly when the \n     action involves an interpretation of that committee's \n     particular rules. I think you may have been provided with \n     some incorrect information, and I would like you to know the \n     truth.\n       As you know, the Judiciary Committee met at 9:30 a.m. last \n     Thursday to consider several nominations and some \n     legislation. Although the Democrats were cooperative about \n     voting out a few widely-supported District Court nominations \n     and some other nominations, they made it clear that they \n     would attempt to filibuster at least two of the three \n     nominees for the Circuit Courts of Appeal, Deborah Cook John \n     Roberts and Jay Bybee.\n       It is important to note that the nominations of Mr. Roberts \n     and Justice Cook had been filibustered in Committee during \n     our last meeting two weeks ago, and had been on the agenda \n     but held over the week before that. I could have forced a \n     vote two weeks ago, but I declined to do so out of deference \n     to my Democratic colleagues, who had assured me that we would \n     vote on the nominations at the next meeting, meaning last \n     Thursday.\n       From 9:30 a.m. to approximately 12:30 p.m. yesterday, \n     Committee Members engaged in a thorough debate on the three \n     Circuit Court nominations. I allowed every member to talk as \n     long as they wanted. Everyone was allowed to say his or her \n     piece [even though we could have limited debate].\n       When the speeches ran out at 12:30 or so, I announced it \n     was time for a vote. Senator Kennedy objected. I overruled \n     the objection, and then all of the Democratic Members walked \n     out of the hearing room in order to deny the Committee a \n     quorum. A few minutes later, Senator, Specter returned to the \n     Committee room, making a total of nine Republicans present, \n     and then a couple of the Democrats returned and demanded to \n     continue the filibuster even though every democrat who wanted \n     to speak had already done so. As support for their \n     filibuster, they relied upon Rule 4 of the Judiciary \n     Committee rules. That rule allows any Member to move to have \n     an item on the Agenda voted upon. In this case, the \n     nomination on the Agenda was brought to a vote.\n       As background, you know well that Senate Committee Chairmen \n     have a number of inherent powers that are not expressly \n     stated in Committee rules. For example, the Judiciary \n     Committee Chairman has the power to call and set the agendas \n     for hearings and mark-ups even though those powers are not \n     explicitly granted by Committee Rules. The Chairman also has \n     the inherent power to bring a matter to a vote. The Chairman \n     also has the power to interpret the rules of the Committee, \n     as Senator Leahy has done in the past. The Parliamentarians \n     assured me of this on Wednesday.\n       Rule 4 of the Judiciary Committee Rules is not the \n     authority by which the Chairman calls for a vote. On the \n     contrary, the clear text of Rule 4 gives a majority of the \n     Committee (which must include Members of both parties) a \n     mechanism to force a vote, presumably when the Chairman does \n     not want or call one. In other words, it ensures that the \n     majority will is not thwarted by an obstreperous Chairman who \n     refuses to allow a vote on an item on the Agenda.\n       Rule 4 works like this: When a Member wants to end debate \n     and bring a matter to a vote, he or she is entitle dot make a \n     motion to hold a vote and the Chairman must entertain it. If \n     anyone objects, then the Committee must vote on the motion \n     (the motion is not debatable). The motion carried only if a \n     majority of the Committee, including at least one Member of \n     the minority party, votes in favor. If the motion carries, \n     the Committee proceeds to a vote on the underlying matter.\n       The Democrats who raised Rule 4 at the mark-up [last \n     Thursday] turned Rule 4 on its head. They tried to use it to \n     deny a vote, not to force one. Their argument ignores the \n     purpose of Rule 4, the inherent power of the Chairman to call \n     for a vote, the fact that the debate had already ended, and \n     the common sense idea that legislative bodies must have the \n     power to make decisions--even difficult ones. I do not \n     believe that Committee filibusters should be allowed, and I \n     think it is a good and healthy thing for the Committee to \n     have a rule that forces a vote.\n       I understand your misperception given the fact that you may \n     not--and indeed have no\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\n     reason to--be fully familiar with the Judiciary Committee's \n     rules, as you do not serve on the Committee. But knowing you \n     as a fair man, I thought my explanation would help clear any \n     misconceptions.\n       It is unfortunate that I was forced to exercise the \n     Chairman's inherent power to force the Committee to act [last \n     Thursday]. I had given every fair consideration to my \n     Democratic colleagues for debating the nominations. The \n     nominees before the Committee were very well qualified, enjoy \n     home-state support (bipartisan, in the case of Bybee), and \n     were ultimately approved by substantial bipartisan majorities \n     of the Committee.\n       I know it makes for popular speechmaking to accuse \n     politicians of abusing process and procedure. And as a former \n     Majority Leader of the body, you appreciate the difficult \n     decisions one must make in order to do the business of the \n     people and exercise our constitutional obligations, \n     particularly in the face of obstruction by a few. But you and \n     I have worked well together over the years, and I know that \n     you would never make those accusations about me unless you \n     had somehow received inaccurate information.\n       Unfortunately, that is what seems to have occurred in this \n     case. I appreciate you and your consideration of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. That letter makes it very clear that not only were the \nrules not abused, there was an abuse by the other side in trying to not \nlive up to the rule we have in the committee that any item on the \nagenda can be put over for a week, and that in the next week there is a \nvote on that item, unless the chairman and the ranking member agree. In \nthis case, we not only put over Roberts and Cook for a week, we put \nthem over for 2 weeks, because my colleagues asked for it. I agreed to \ndo that in deference to them.\n  Then, when it came time to vote for them, I walked into the committee \nroom and I was told by the ranking member that they weren't going to \nvote on Roberts and Cook that day. I said: Oh, no, we are going to vote \non them because that is what we agreed to. We are going to vote on them \nbecause that is what the rules agree to. So I waited for all Senators \nto make their comments.\n  We took 3 hours to hear rather long statements. I think we were very \npatient with those statements because at least one of them hardly \ntalked about the nominees but talked about a whole raft of other issues \ninvolving the committee, which is a right of a Senator. Other Senators \ngave long statements on the nominees themselves, which was their right \nto do. But when the statements wound down and there were no further \nstatements to be given, I said: We are going to vote. And that is when \npeople got mad and demanded that we not vote.\n  At that point, I had to make a decision as committee chairman--which \nis a legitimate decision--that we are going to vote, that filibusters \nare not proper in committee, and that we had people on both sides who \nwere willing to vote for these nominees. We had people from the \nminority and from the majority. All three of them passed out with \nsubstantial votes. So there is hardly room here to criticize what was \ndone. Any committee chairman worth his or her salt has to ultimately \nbring the matters before the committee to a vote. That is what I did. \nIn the case of judicial nominations, I don't believe there should be \nfilibusters under any circumstances against Presidential judicial \nnominees. I think they should be voted up or down--not only in \ncommittee but on the floor of the Senate as well.\n  These are important positions. We should not treat them as though \nthey are just regular legislative items that can be kicked around at \nwill. These are important positions that literally must be given their \nchance for a vote. Not only were the rules followed, but we were very \ngracious and considerate in allowing my colleagues on the other side to \nmake whatever statements they wanted to. I cannot say we have to do \nthat every time. If people are going to come in and make hour-long \nstatements in the future, and do it solely for the purpose of \nobstruction, then I think there comes a time when a chairman has to \nexercise his or her prerogative and call for a vote.\n  If the Democrats don't like the nominees, they should vote them down. \nI hope the only negative votes will be those that were well considered, \ndecent, honorable, by those who literally had good reason behind a \nnegative vote. But even if they didn't have these good reasons, then \nthey have a right to vote them down. Others have a right to vote them \nup. If a nominee passes, then the nominee should pass out of committee \nand come to the floor. Hopefully, we will have a debate for a \nreasonable length of time and we will vote on nominees, as we should, \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Let no one be deceived; the rules were followed. I chatted with the \nParliamentarians beforehand to make sure I was on a good track here and \nthat I was following the best standards of the Senate, even though I \ncertainly had to put my foot down as the chairman. I acted in \naccordance thereto.\n  With that, I understand the Senator from New York would like to make \na statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 414\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to legislative session and begin the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 21, S. 414, a bill to provide an economic stimulus package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it seems very interesting to me that this \nrequest would be made when our friends on the other side, last year, \ndid not even pass a budget, for the first time since the Budget Act was \nenacted, and did not pass the appropriations bills, by and large.\n  Mr. REID. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HATCH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my good \nfriend from Utah. I do not agree with them, but he is always someone \nwho is ready to express his heartfelt convictions about any matter. I \nbelieve, having now traveled and talked with and heard from so many of \nmy constituents, that it is time for us to face the real issues that \nare on the minds of the American people.\n  Obviously, we know Americans today are quite concerned and worried \nabout the continuing defiance of the United Nations by Saddam Hussein \nand the amassing of 200,000 of our men and women in uniform in the gulf \nin the event the President must order military action to fulfill the \nrequirements not only of Resolution 1441 but of all the resolutions \nthat Saddam Hussein has defied for over a decade.\n  I know many of the people I represent are deeply concerned that in \nthe last week we have not been able to get any information from the \nadministration about their projected costs of the military action \nshould it occur in Iraq, and the follow-on costs that would be required \nfor the pacification and rebuilding of Iraq, the efforts to try to \ncreate a set of conditions that could provide a better opportunity for \na brighter future for the people of Iraq.\n  Many of my constituents have said: Senator, how much is it going to \ncost? How long is it going to take? How many of our people will be put \nat risk? We do not know the answers. I think that is something on which \nwe should be focused.\n  Certainly, I hear quite a bit of concern about how well prepared we \nare to defend ourselves at home. Have we put the amount of resources \nstrategically deployed on defense that we have done on offense? As many \nof my colleagues know, I have been coming to the Chamber now for, I \nguess, 16 months expressing my deep concerns that the answer to those \nquestions is no; that we have not done for defense what we have done \nfor offense.\n\n  I am proud of the extraordinary capacity that our military has, by \nfar the most ready, the most powerful in the history of the world. That \nis a great comfort and point of pride for every American.\n  I was up at one of those facilities just today, the Watervliet \nArsenal in Albany. It dates back to the War of 1812. It has been \nproducing guns and tubes, mortars and tank equipment for decades. I am \nvery proud it is in a State I represent that has such a tradition of \npatriotism where the Revolutionary War was largely fought and won.\n  I am very grateful we have this level of commitment to our military, \nbut I\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\ndo not hear the same from our mayors, our police chiefs, and our fire \nchiefs, and I do not think we can honestly say we have done everything \nwe need to do to provide for hometown security, to make sure we get the \npeople on the streets we require.\n  I met today with three mayors from cities I represent: Mayor Jerry \nJennings from Albany, Tony Masiello from Buffalo, and Matt Driscoll \nfrom Syracuse. They came to talk about their unmet needs. When the \nalert goes up and the phone calls start coming in and they are expected \nto respond, they are not given the tools and resources that high level \nof responsibility demands.\n  I know we are in difficult economic times, but I do not think that \ncan stand in the way of the Federal Government fulfilling its \nresponsibility to the mayors, police chiefs, fire chiefs, emergency \nresponders, hospital administrators, and others who make up our front \nline defense at home. In fact, I think it is imperative that we give \nthe same attention to hometown security that we have been giving to \nnational security because the two are absolutely inextricably linked.\n  There is no front over there. We do not put people on boats, on troop \nships, and send them off somewhere far away. We do not wave goodbye to \nthem at airports as they travel halfway around the world to defend \nfreedom and America's vital interests. When we see a police officer \nstanding on the street, when we go by a firehouse, those are the \nfrontline soldiers. Those are the people who have to respond to \nwhatever happens.\n  It has been troubling to me that this administration repeatedly has \ntalked about the need for security but time and again has not been \nwilling to give support with the dollars that are desperately required.\n  I have spoken with people throughout my State. I want to take a \nmoment to share the comments and concerns of just one of the cities and \ncounties I represent. It happens to be the county in which I live, West \nChester County in another community, the city of New Rochelle, with a \nvery dedicated group of leaders, Mayor Idoni and others who are totally \ncommitted to building New Rochelle and protecting New Rochelle. They \nhave gone to briefings and training sessions to find out what they need \nto do.\n  Unfortunately, when I asked if their city had incurred any additional \ncosts due to the recent code orange, this was their response:\n\n       Unfortunately the city of New Rochelle is nowhere able to \n     prepare for or respond to homeland security alert level \n     orange than we are for alert green. Incurring personnel \n     expenses, i.e., overtime, is not fiscally possible. \n     Additionally, all that we would have accomplished would \nhave been to put more people on the street with limited training and \nvirtually no equipment.\n\n  These words come from our frontline defenders. These are our \ngenerals, our colonels, and our captains. They are the people who are \ngoing to direct whatever response we need in the event of some kind of \nterrorist attack.\n  Seventeen months have passed since that horrible day in September, \nand all the while the Federal Government has been asking our mayors to \ndo more with less. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, cities \nhave invested $2.6 billion of their own resources to protect our \nNation.\n  In November 2001, after visiting with the people in New York City, \nwho know more about what is needed than literally anybody in our \ncountry, and going to Buffalo to meet with the mayor, police, fire \nofficials there, I immediately called for $3.5 billion of direct \nfunding for our first responders. I proposed the homeland security \nblock grant in 2000 and 2002, and it was the first piece of legislation \nI filed again this year in 2003.\n  Last week, the administration finally conceded what many of us, along \nwith mayors, police commissioners, fire chiefs, emergency response \nteams, and others have been saying for the last 2 years: We need more \nresources at the local level to secure our homeland.\n  In January, I released a report that showed how 70 percent of our \nlocal cities and counties had not received any Federal homeland \nsecurity funding. I can go through chapter and verse talking about what \neach community has had to do.\n  I recall a comment by the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget who said in response to my criticism and others: There is not \nenough money in the galaxy to protect everyone and everybody.\n  That may be objectively true, but I think we have to do more to try, \nand I sure think we have to recognize places of increased \nvulnerability, targets of opportunity.\n  As we take great comfort in the capture of Khalid Sheik Mohammed in \nPakistan, we cannot help but notice amongst the documents apparently \nrecovered and the information that was used as a basis for this \napprehension were concerns about additional attacks, I must say once \nagain, focused primarily on New York City and Washington.\n\n  I do not think for a minute these are the only targets in the United \nStates. I do believe they are still the two most prominent areas of \nconcern for us and, therefore, need more attention than most places do.\n  Who would have guessed we would have found a terrorist cell in \nLackawanna, NY, a few miles outside of downtown Buffalo? Who would have \nguessed that people accused of helping to finance terrorism would be \narrested in Syracuse, NY? So we need a national plan for local \nresponse, and that is why on Friday I called for the establishment of a \ndomestic defense fund within the Office of Domestic Preparedness in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Whether it is in New York City, where between February 7 through the \n20 the NYPD estimates it spent $1.1 million for personnel costs, or in \nLos Angeles where an additional $650,000 had to be used to put on \npersonnel to search cars at the airport, or Wilmington, DE, which spent \n$25,000 a day for police overtime, we know these costs are building up. \nIn this time of an ocean of red ink for our State and local budgets, \nthere are no resources that can be dipped into to make up for these \nlosses our cities and counties are experiencing.\n  This domestic defense fund would provide direct funding for our local \ncommunities, for personnel costs, equipment, and other first responder \nneeds. It would also include the covering of other emergency \npreparedness costs, whether it is high overtime costs as a result of \ncode orange or extra security if there is a high profile trial like \nZacarias Moussaoui, or to help local law enforcement cover the costs \nthey incur if they arrest a sleeper cell such as they did in \nLackawanna. We need to be ready to provide these additional funds.\n  When the Presidents Day blizzard occurred up and down the east coast, \ncities and States knew that FEMA's disaster recovery fund was in place \nto help defray these costs. LIHEAP, the Low Income Heating Energy \nAssistance Program, is set up in the same spirit. When it gets colder \nand our citizens are at risk of exposure to dangerous temperatures, the \nFederal Government provides for home heating costs. Right now we have a \nnational alert system and a local response system, but as the threat \nlevel approaches orange, our local governments have to dig deep to find \nthe funds to respond. Therefore, we need to do better.\n  Just as we have done for our men and women in uniform, we have to be \nwilling to provide the funds our men and women on the front lines at \nhome need and deserve.\n  I understand the administration plans to come forward with a wartime \nsupplemental appropriations bill. In the Senate, my colleagues and I \nwill be pushing also for an emergency supplemental to address our unmet \ndomestic security needs. That should include direct funding for local \ncommunities, and it should include the domestic defense fund.\n  I do not see any way to avoid the necessity of providing the funds \nthat are needed for our homeland-hometown security, and I hope this \nbody, and our colleagues across the Capitol, as well as the \nadministration, will cross party lines and in a bipartisan manner make \nsure we do everything possible to prepare. We can always hope for the \nbest, but we have to prepare for the worst, and that means we have to \npay attention to what we are being told by local first responders. They \nare the experts. They know what they need. We have to stand ready to \nassist them, and I hope as we move forward over the next month we will \ndo that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have enjoyed my colleague's remarks, and \nalthough we have our differences on some of them, I appreciate her \ndiligence and effort. I have a lot of respect for her.\n  I will say that continually asking to go off the Estrada matter for \nother matters really concerns me, because I think it is a failure to \nrecognize that this is one of the most important nominees and one of \nthe most important positions in the country. There is one way to get \noff of this nomination, and that is to vote up or down, instead of \nfilibustering. Do what has always been done in the past in these \nmatters and bring this issue to a vote. Then we can go to these \nimportant economic matters and other matters as well.\n  I have been concerned, because I remember when the minority leader \nand the minority whip came on the floor last week and basically said: \nWhy are we not on economic issues?\n  I did get very upset because I thought that is nice for them to say \nthat, but they were not even willing to do a budget last year because \nit takes a lot of guts to do a budget. We always did. Last year was the \nfirst time in the history of the Budget Act that the majority party \nrefused to do a budget. We know why. Because they made a lot of cheap \nshots against us when we had to make those tough decisions on the \nbudget. Then all of a sudden they found they were in a position where \nshots could be taken against them, cheap or otherwise, and they were \nnot able to get together on their side because they had so many \nfactions on their side that did not agree.\n  So it is easy to criticize, but you better have a better standing to \ncriticize than what I think they have.\n  Also, the reason we had to have this omnibus appropriations bill \nafter the first of the year is because our colleagues on the other side \ncould not pass the appropriations bills. We did it in a matter of weeks \nafter we came into power this year. I think that is something the \nRepublicans deserve a great deal of credit for. Our colleagues on the \nother side deserve some criticism for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/03/senate-section/article/S3024-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 5, \n2002 in Tacoma, WA. Three gay men were attacked and another woman shot \nin a nightclub parking lot. When the three men walked to the nightclub \nparking lot, they were confronted by two or three other men in a truck \nwho asked ``Are you gay? Are you gay?'' The men in the truck said that \nit was a ``straight parking lot'' and demanded that the gay men leave. \nThe men in the truck then approached the victims and began beating \nthem. A woman and her husband came to the aid of the victims, and the \nassailants shot the woman once in the chest. The bullet traveled \nthrough her chest and lodged in her cheek. She was treated at a local \nhospital and was later released.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens--to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/03/senate-section/article/S3024-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL PEACE CORPS DAY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to one of our \nmost essential and enduring national endeavors: the Peace Corps.\n  Last Friday, February 28, was National Peace Corps day. While the \nSenate was not in session on Friday, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the Peace Corps--an institution that is \ncertainly deserving of our praise and support.\n  As my colleagues are aware, it is always with tremendous fondness and \npride that I speak of the Peace Corps. It gives me occasion to recall \nmy own years as a volunteer in the Dominican Republic. Indeed, I have \noften spoken of how these 2 years changed my life. Living and working \noutside of the United States and seeing the way other nations operated \nfor the first time, I grew to appreciate our Nation more and more, and \ndeveloped a strong sense of what it means to be an American. I was \nproud to share my experience as an American citizen with the people I \nwas there to help. Those 2 years were invaluable to me, and truly \nbrought home to me the value of public service.\n  It was 42 years ago when President Kennedy laid out his vision for \nthe future of American volunteer service. Speaking of a corps of \ncommitted and idealistic young volunteers who would travel all over the \nworld ``promoting world peace and friendship,'' he saw public service \nas an ideal to transcend political rhetoric. Peace Corps volunteers \nwere not to reflect particular Republican or Democratic ideology. \nRather, their service would be a manifestation of the core American \nvalues we all share.\n  Since 1961, more than 168,000 Americans have responded to President \nKennedy's call, and the Peace Corps now sends more than 7,000 \nvolunteers to 76 different countries every year. This means that there \nare 7,000 important American liaisons scattered around the world \nhelping people and promoting American values. In fact, the need for \nsuch ambassadors--people who truly show the world the best of America--\nhas never been greater. Especially in these difficult and tumultuous \ntimes, I believe that an increased Peace Corps presence in regions with \nsignificant anti-American sentiment could help to foster greater mutual \nunderstanding and tolerance between Americans and the communities they \nserve.\n  After all, these volunteers are really the heart and soul of the \nPeace Corps. They are the ones on the front lines, working hard, making \none-on-one connections with the citizens of the countries in which they \nwork. For 42 years, they have brought a wealth of practical experience \nto communities in Africa, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, Eastern \nEurope, and the Pacific. And, I believe it is important to recognize \nthat the enduring success of the Peace Corps is rooted in each \nvolunteer's commitment to leave behind skills that allow people to take \ncharge of their own futures.\n  The Peace Corps is a truly remarkable institution in America, a \nsymbol of the very best of our ideals of service, sacrifice, and self-\nreliance. I believe that we must provide sufficient resources for the \nPeace Corps so that it can increase the number of volunteers in the \nfield and continue its noble mission. National Peace Corps Day honors \nits volunteers, past and present, and reaffirms our country's \ncommitment to helping our friends and neighbors throughout the world. \nMr. President, in recognition of National Peace Corps day and in light \nof the special service this institution performs for our nation and the \nglobal community. I reaffirm my strong support of and commitment to \nthis invaluable institution. I hope my colleagues and fellow Americans \nwill do the same.\n  I thank the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/03/senate-section/article/S3024-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3024-S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF BARBARA COY\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government for taking \nextraordinary actions to protect and restore Kentucky rivers, lakes, \nstreams, and wetlands along with initiating innovative local pollution \nprevention programs. For their efforts, Environmental Protection Agency \nAdministrator Christie Whitman recently presented the Lexington-Fayette \nUrban County Government with the Clean Water Partner Award for the 21st \nCentury at EPA headquarters in Washington, DC.\n  In keeping with President George W. Bush's celebration of the Year of \nClean Water, the EPA's Office of Water has recognized the best \ncontributions by local agencies to protect watersheds and uphold the \nrequirements of the Clean Water Act. The success of the Lexington-\nFayette Urban County Government should not go unnoticed.\n  Their accomplishment in developing the Reforest the Bluegrass program \nenables local citizen volunteers to make improvements to the \nenvironment. The program educates volunteers on the importance of \nriparian buffers in relation to storm water pollution, urban forests, \nand wildlife diversity.\n  Mr. President, the men and women of the Lexington-Fayette Urban \nCounty Government have earned our admiration and respect for their hard \nwork and determination. I am proud the Commonwealth of Kentucky is \nserved so well by such dedicated public servants. Their example should \nbe followed by others in order to further improve our water quality and \nenvironment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/03/senate-section/article/S3025-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3025-S3026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO HOOSIER ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

I \nwould like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the winners of \nthe 2002-2003 Eighth Grade Youth Essay Contest, which I sponsored in \nassociation with the Indiana Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau Insurance \nCompanies. These students have displayed strong writing abilities and \nare outstanding young Hoosier scholars. I will submit their names for \nthe Congressional Record because they demonstrate the capabilities of \ntoday's students and are fine representatives of our Nation.\n  This year, Hoosier students wrote on the theme, ``Growing Nutrition \nRight Here In Indiana.'' I would like to submit for the Record the \nwinning essays of Caitlin Dunn and Ryan Nigh. As State winners of the \nYouth Essay Contest, these two outstanding students are being \nrecognized on Friday, February 28, 2003, during a visit to the United \nStates Capitol.\n  The essays are as follows:\n\n                Growing Nutrition Right Here In Indiana\n\n                     (By Caitlin Dunn--Jay County)\n\n     Don't leave the table.\n       Stay in your seat.\n     An event of magic\n       Is yours to meet.\n     With the wave of my wand\n       And a magical spell,\n     The nutrition grown in Indiana\n       Will help you stay well!\n\n       Our magical journey begins with an ordinary deck of cards. \n     ``Pick a card--any card--just don't tell me what it is.

It \n     is very important to eat healthy foods to have a healthy body \n     and mind. Eating right gives the body more nutrients. It \n     makes the body function better and gives it more energy and \n     coordination. There is less chance for illness and life-\n     threatening diseases, especially heart disease, diabetes, \n     cancer, and osteoporosis. The brain functions better too. \n     Better nutrition, especially breakfast, gives a person better \n     brainpower, concentration, and reasoning.\n       There are a variety of nutritional products produced in our \n     state: milk products, bread and pasta, fruits and vegetables, \n     and meat. Indiana is fifth in the U.S. in corn production. \n     Much of it is used to feed livestock, which people then eat. \n     Corn is also used for cornmeal, taco shells, chips, and \n     cereal. Indiana is second in popcorn, a favorite snack of \n     many Americans. Bread and pasta come from wheat, milk \n     products from dairy farms, lots of protein from beef cattle, \n     hogs, and poultry grown here in Indiana. Poultry includes \n     ducks (first), chickens (sixth), and turkeys (seventh). \n     Indiana even has some fish farms.\n       A major product Hoosier farmers grow is soybeans. Besides \n     supplementing animal feeds, soybeans are used in so many \n     foods now that it's hard to find one without soybeans in it. \n     Soybeans are very healthy.\n       Indiana is not usually known for fruits and vegetables. \n     However, Indiana ranks in the top ten in growing tomatoes, \n     green beans, and cucumbers for processing. And Indiana sweet \n     corn is great too. Hoosiers also raise lots of cantaloupes, \n     watermelons, apples, blueberries, peaches, and walnuts.\n       All of these good foods are grown in Indiana. If we eat the \n     foods recommended on the food pyramid, we will grow and have \n     healthy bodies. Like Grandma says, ``You are what you eat!''\n\n  I ask that the names of the Hoosier Essay Contest winners be printed \nin the Record.\n  The names follow.\n\n                  2002-03 Lugar Essay District Winners\n\n       District 1: Joshua Surfus (Starke Co.), and Kaylyn Herrold \n     (Fulton Co.).\n       District 2: Luke Pratt (Allen Co.), and Jillian Jackson \n     (DeKalb Co.).\n       District 3: Taylor Farrer (Cass Co.), and Angela Hubers \n     (Jasper Co.).\n       District 4: James Comerford (Miami Co.), and Caitlin Dunn \n     (Jay Co.).\n       District 5: Justin Yoho (Vermillion Co.), and Jessica Fry \n     (Putnam Co.).\n       District 6: Matt Howard (Marion Co.), and Samantha Morton \n     (Hamilton Co.).\n       District 7: Christopher Duncan (Vigo Co.), and Kayla Cash \n     (Vigo Co.).\n       District 8: Ryan Nigh (Shelby Co.), and Roma Bose (Johnson \n     Co.).\n       District 9: Logan Verkamp (Dubois Co.), and Anna \n     Blankenberger (Posey Co.).\n       District 10: Landon Roberts (Washington Co.), and Jessica \n     Ragains (Washington Co.).\n\n                      2002-03 County Essay Winners\n\n       Benton: Wesley Geib, Tri-County Jr. High School.\n       Cass: Taylor Farrer and Kristen Holcomb, Pioneer Jr. High \n     School.\n       Clark: Miles Murphy and Kelly Ann Avery, Parkview Middle \n     School.\n       DeKalb: Wade Buchs and Jillian Jackson, DeKalb Middle \n     School.\n       Dubois: Logan Verkamp and Krystal Knust, Forest Park Jr. \n     High School.\n       Fayette: Eric Knotts and Tarrah Emily McCreary, \n     Connersville Middle School.\n       Franklin: Bradley Bischoff and Chelle Bentz, St. Michael \n     School.\n       Fulton: Kaylyn Herrold, Caston Jr. High School.\n       Greene: Bryant Meng and Patricia Dawn Shepard, Linton-\n     Stockton Jr. High School.\n       Hamilton: Evan Beckner and Samantha Morton, Carmel Jr. High \n     School.\n       Hendricks: Nick McNulty, Danville Community Middle School, \n     Ryanne Fenimore, St. Malachy Parish School.\n       Henry: Daniel Snyder and Sarah McCullough, Tri Jr. High \n     School.\n       Jasper: Randy Lehman, Rensselaer Central Middle School, and \n     Angela Hubers, Demotte Christian School.\n       Jay: Ben Wellman and Caitlin Dunn, East Jay Middle School.\n       LaGrange: Carolyn Miller, Westview Jr. High School.\n       Lake: Kristopher Wonzy and Danielle Ferree, Our Lady of \n     Grace School.\n       LaPorte: Josh Troxel, Wanatah Public School, and Mary Ellen \n     Przybylinski, Saint Stanislaus School.\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\n       Madison: Kaitlin Bohlander, Elwood Middle School.\n       Marion: Matt Howard, Preston Middle School, and Katrina \n     Wathen, St. Roch School.\n       Newton: Denise Hickman, North Newton Jr. High School.\n       Orange: Andrew Jones, Orleans Jr. High School.\n       Pike: Tyler Simpson and Whitney Helton, Pike Central Middle \n     School.\n       Posey: Jeremy Wagner and Anna Blankenberger, North Posey \n     Jr. High School.\n       Putnam: Logan Portish, Cloverdale Middle School, and \n     Jessica Fry, North Putnam Middle School.\n       Ripley: Dan Rauscher and Brianna Mayfield, Batesville \n     Middle School.\n       St. Joseph: Michael McMahon and Emily Cook, St. Matthew \n     Cathedral School.\n       Shelby: Ryan Nigh, Morristown Jr. High School, and Brooke \n     Gilbert, Triton Middle School.\n       Starke: Joshua Surfus, Knox Middle School, and Natalia \n     Ratican, Oregon-Davis Jr. High School.\n       Switzerland: Travis Rose and Sara Craig, Switzerland County \n     Middle School.\n       Tippecanoe: Eliza Scanlon, Wainwright Middle School.\n       Tipton: Craig Hartman and Danielle Widner, Tri-Central Jr. \n     High School.\n       Vermillion: Justin Yoho and Tracy Woolwine, North \n     Vermillion Jr. High School.\n       Vigo: Christopher Duncan and Kayla Cash, Honey Creek Middle \n     School.\n       Warrick: Logan Springstun and Brooke Carter, Boonville Jr. \n     High School.\n       Washington: Landon Roberts and Jessica Ragains, West \n     Washington Jr. High School.\n       Wayne: Branden Mathews and Marissa Uphaus, Centerville Jr. \n     High School.\n       Wells: Nathan Donaghy and Kristen Meyer, Bethlehem Lutheran \n     School.\n       White: Cole Bell and Sarah Demerly, Tri-County Jr. High \n     School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/03/senate-section/article/S3026-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN RECOGNITION OF DR. WILLIAM B. DeLAUDER'S RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Dr. \nWilliam B. DeLauder upon his retirement from Delaware State University. \nHe has served as president of the university for more than 16 years. \nHis leadership over that span of time has lifted this small, \nhistorically black land grant college of the 21st century and won him \nthe respect of faculty and students alike, along with the gratitude of \nour entire State. He has been, and remains, a trusted friend and \nadvisor to me both in my previous role as Governor of Delaware and now \nas our State's junior United States Senator.\n  One of Dr. DeLauder's most noteworthy achievements has been the \ntransition of Delaware State College to Delaware State University. I \nhad the privilege of formalizing this transition by signing into law \nthe official name change that signified this accomplishment when I was \nGovernor in 1993 to more accurately reflect the depth and quality of \nthe University's academic offerings. The changes have been profound.\n  Under President DeLauder the university has undergone a remarkable \ntransformation in academics, student life, fund raising, and in \nappearance, Alumni returning to visit their alma mater today after an \nabsence of many years are amazed at the appearance of its campus. A \nbeautiful pedestrian campus has replaced the old network of streets \nthat for years divided the old campus into an unattractive series of \nsquares and rectangles. An array of new buildings have been constructed \nincluding a modern library, a cutting-edge science center, a home for \nthe School of Management, and a new administrative building. On-campus \nhousing capacity for students has roughly doubled, too. With all of \nthat completed, Dr. DeLauder has begun one final major project--the \nbuilding of a modern, new stadium and a health and fitness complex.\n  Those may be the most visible signs of change, but they tell only \npart of the story. During Dr. DeLauder's 16 year tenure, the university \nalso expanded its academic programs by adding new graduate programs in \nbiology, chemistry, and physics, as well as new undergraduate programs \nin airway science, computer science and mass communications. The \nuniversity also increased its number of faculty with doctorates from 44 \nto 72 percent. Admission standards have been raised, as well. In \naddition, DSU became the first higher education institution in Delaware \nto receive national accreditation for its teacher education program \nduring his presidency.\n  During his tenure, President DeLauder also founded a board of \nvisitors that consists of State government leaders and corporate \nexecutives. The board's purpose is to provide support and assistance to \nthe fund raising and development goals of the university. In 1994, he \nled Delaware State University on its first major fund raising effort. \nThe campaign raised more than $10 million for the enhancement of \nacademic programs, faculty development, and student financial aid.\n  Dr. DeLauder's accomplishments have been recognized through numerous \nhonors and awards. For example, in March 1994, he received the Thurgood \nMarshall Award for outstanding contributions to the higher education of \nAfrican-Americans. In 1995, he received the prestigious leadership \naward in Delaware presented by the National Conference of Christians \nand Jews. In November 2001, he was inducted into the Delaware State \nUniversity Sports Hall of Fame for his support of the school's student-\nathletes and teams. That same month, he received the prestigious \nBuchanan award by the Central Delaware Chamber of Commerce. In June of \nlast year, President DeLauder was appointed chairman of the United Way \nof Delaware's Board of Directors.\n  Dr. DeLauder earned his bachelor of science degree from Morgan State \nUniversity and a doctorate in physical chemistry from Wayne State \nUniversity. He conducted post-doctoral research in physical \nbiochemistry at the Centre of Biophysical Molecularie du C.N.R.S., \nOrleans-LaSource, France. Bill is married to a delightful woman, the \nformer Vermell Faulk. She has served as an invaluable partner and \nUniversity First Lady during this time of remarkable change at Delaware \nState. The DeLauders are blessed with two children, William Jr. and \nEllen, and three grandchildren.\n  Dr. DeLauder is a humble and selfless man who takes pride in his work \nbut is always quick to share the credit for Delaware State College's \nsuccesses with others. Through his tireless efforts, he has made a \nprofound difference in the lives of thousands of students and enhanced \nthe quality of life for an entire state. Upon his retirement, he will \nleave behind a legacy of commitment to public service for both his \nchildren and grandchildren and for the generations that will follow. I \nthank him for the warm friendship that we share, and I congratulate him \non a truly remarkable and distinguished career. I wish him, his wife \nVermell and their family only the very best in all that lies ahead for \neach of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/03/senate-section/article/S3026-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   2003 TRADE POLICY AGENDA AND THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE TRADE \n                       AGREEMENTS PROGRAM--PM 19\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 163 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended \n(19 U.S.C. 2213), I transmit herewith the 2003 Trade Policy Agenda and \n2002 Annual Report on the Trade Agreements Program as prepared by my \nAdministration.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to authorize the President to posthumously award a \ngold medal on behalf of Congress to Joseph A. DeLaine in recognition of \nhis contributions to the Nation; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \npresent Rev. Joseph A. De Laine the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor \nfor his heroic sacrifices to desegregate our public schools. His \ncrusade to break down barriers in education forever scarred his own \nlife, but led to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954.\n  Eight years before Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of the bus, \nReverend De Laine, a minister and principal, organized African-American \nparents to petition the Summerton, SC, school board for a bus and \ngasoline so their children would not have to walk 10 miles to attend a \nsegregated school. A year later, in Briggs v. Elliot, the parents sued \nto end segregation. It was a case that as a young lawyer I watched \nThurgood Marshall argue before the Supreme Court as one of the five \ncases collectively known as Brown v. Board of Education. For this \nSenator, their arguments helped to shape my view on racial matters.\n  For his efforts, Reverend De Laine was subjected to a reign of \ndomestic terrorism. He lost his job. He watched his church and home \nburn. He was charged with assault and battery with intent to kill after \nshots were fired at his home and he fired back to mark the car. He had \nto leave South Carolina forever; relocate to New York, where he started \nan AME Church, and he eventually retired in North Carolina. Not until \nthe year 2000, 26 years after his death and 45 years after the incident \nin his home was Reverend De Laine cleared of all charges.\n  Last year, I spoke to the 100 descendants of Briggs v. Elliott, and I \nask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in the Record, which \nshow the bravery of Reverend De Laine during a troubled time in our \nNation's past, and which point to the immeasurable benefits he has \ngiven our Nation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Briggs v. Elliott Descendants Re-Union Banquet, Summerton, South \n                         Carolina, May 11, 2002\n\n       I want to give you an insight into exactly what happened to \n     your parents 50 years ago in Summerton, SC, that led to the \n     desegregation of our Nation's schools by the Supreme Court of \n     the United States.\n       I speak with some trepidation, because right now I can see \n     Harry Briggs' son walking down that dirt road all the way \n     here to Scotts Branch School, and that school bus passing, \n     all for the white children. Yet all your families were asking \n     for was a bus. But they were told: ``you don't pay any taxes, \n     so how can you ask for a bus?'' What they didn't say is you \n     didn't have a job, whereby you could make a living and be \n     able to pay the taxes. They didn't say that.\n       I think of the threats, the burnings, the shooting up of \n     Reverend John De Laine's home. I think about how they turned \n     him into a fugitive. He had to leave his home in South \n     Carolina, never to return. Harry Briggs had to leave his home \n     and go to Florida to earn a living. It's not for me to tell \n     the descendants of the Briggs v. Elliott case how they have \n     suffered.\n       I didn't try this case, don't misunderstand me. My \n     beginnings with Briggs v. Elliott started in 1948 when I was \n     elected to the House of Representatives in Columbia.\n       The previous year James Hinton, the head of the NAACP in \n     the State gave a speech in Columbia. He talked about the need \n     to get separate but equal facilities. He got Rev. De Laine \n     from Summerton in the audience all fired up. Rev. De Laine, \n     who was the principal here, put together a petition signed by \n     20 parents, of 46 children, the Summerton 66.\n       I'll never forget the day after I was sworn into the \n     Legislature the superintendent of schools in Charleston \n     County took me across the Cooper River Bridge, down the \n     Mathis Ferry Road, to the Freedom School, the black school. \n     He said I want to show you what we really do, he used the \n     word at that time, ``for a Negro education.''\n       This was a cold November Day, and we went into a big one-\n     room building. That's all they had, one room, with a pot \n     belly stove in the middle. They had a class in this corner, a \n     class in that back corner, a class up front in this corner, \n     and a class here. Of course, they didn't have any desks, and \n     very few books, and one teacher teaching the four classes.\n       When I went to Columbia I was with a bunch of rebels. I \n     introduced an anti-lynching bill. I had never heard of \n     lynchings down in Charleston, but then they had one. As we \n     debated the bill, a fellow who was the grand dragon of the \n     Klan got up with all these Klansmen in the Gallery, and he \n     mumbled and raised cane. Speaker Blott got some order. But \n     several House members walked out. They said they wouldn't be \n     seated in the Legislature with a fellow like that. We passed \n     the anti-lynching bill.\n       I'm trying to give you this background, so you'll \n     understand the significance of what your parents did. We had \n     just had the case, whereby blacks could participate in the \n     Democratic primary. And we had just given women the right to \n     vote.\n       And in 1949 and 1950, I struggled because there was no \n     money in the state for separate but equal schools, or \n     anything else. I said we ought to put in a 3 percent sales \n     tax to pay for things. Governor Thurmond opposed it, and the \n     senators particularly opposed it. But I made the motion for a \n     one-cent tax on cigarettes; a one-cent tax on gasoline; and a \n     one-cent tax on beer. Beer, cigarettes, and gasoline.\n       We formed a House Committee with six of us to work on it. \n     We worked all summer. It's a long story, but let me cut it \n     and say by December we had it all written. I knew the \n     incoming governor, Governor Byrnes. I felt it would be good \n     to ask him to see if he could help me with this measure.\n       The second week in January, before he was sworn in, he \n     called me and said: ``You've got to come to Columbia, I'm \n     going to include this in my Inaugural address.'' Over time, I \n     made 79 talks on the proposal, until we finally passed the \n     sales tax, which provided some money for separate but equal \n     schools.\n       When the Briggs v. Elliott case came up, before Judge \n     Waring in Charleston, he questioned separate but equal. Then \n     in December 1952, the case went to the Supreme Court. \n     Governor Byrnes had served on the State Supreme Court, and he \n     wanted to make sure we won the case. In my mind, he was \n     absolutely sure that under Chief Justice Vinson the State \n     would win it.\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\n       But to make sure, he set aside Mr. Bob McC. Figg, who had \n     done all the work, and selected John W. Davis, as the \n     attorney for South Carolina against Thurgood Marshall, who \n     was representing Briggs and the NAACP. Mr. Davis had been the \n     Solicitor General of the United States. He had been the \n     Democratic nominee for president in 1924. He was considered \n     the greatest constitutional mind in the country.\n       The second thing the Governor did was to call me up and \n     say: ``I'm appointing you to go to Washington, because you \n     know intimately this law here that built the schools. You \n     have to go to Washington in case any questions of fact come \n     up.''\n       So we took a train to Washington. We came in at 6 o'clock \n     that morning at Union Station, and we sat down for breakfast. \n     I'll never forget it, because Thurgood Marshall walked in. He \n     and Bob McC. Figg had become real close friends. So he sat \n     down and was eating breakfast with us, and we began swapping \n     stories.\n       Mr. Marshall said ``Bob, you know that black family that \n     moved into that white neighborhood in Cicero, IL. They have \n     so much trouble. There are riots, and everything else going \n     on.'' And he said: ``Don't tell anybody, but I got hold of \n     Governor Adlai Stevenson.'' Stevenson was the governor of \n     Illinois at the time. And he said: ``I sent that family back \n     to Mississippi for safe keeping.'' And Thurgood added, ``for \n     God's sake, don't tell anybody that or it will ruin me.'' I \n     said: ``for God's sake, don't tell anybody I'm eating \n     breakfast with you, or I will never get elected again.''\n       I tell you that story so you can get a feel for 1952, for \n     what it was like 50 years ago.\n       We had wanted Briggs to be the lead case before the Supreme \n     Court. It was one of five cases that they would hear \n     collectively. But soon after our breakfast, we found out that \n     Roy Wilkens from the NAACP had gotten together with the \n     Solicitor General and moved the Kansas case in front of the \n     South Carolina case. Some reports said the reason was because \n     they wanted a northern case. That was not it. There was \n     another case from the State of Delaware, which was just as \n     north as the State of Kansas.\n       Kansas was selected because up until the sixth grade, yes, \n     it was segregated. But thereafter it was a local option, and \n     the schools were mostly integrated.\n       Before the court John W. Davis obviously made a very \n     impassioned, constitutional argument. But Thurgood Marshall \n     made the real argument, there wasn't any question about it. \n     He had been with this case. He had the feel, and everything \n     else of that kind.\n       I can still hear and see Justice Frankfurter on the Court \n     leaning over and saying, ``Mr. Marshall, Mr. Marshall, you've \n     won your case, you've won your case. What happens next''? And \n     Thurgood Marshall said, well, if he prevails, then the state \n     imposed policy of separation by race would be removed. The \n     little children can go to the school of their choice. They \n     play together before they go to school. They come back and \n     play together after school. Now they can be together at \n     school. The State imposed policy of separation by race in \n     South Carolina would be gone.\n       Another lawyer arguing the case was George E. C. Hayes, and \n     when I heard him that was my epiphany. Mr. Hayes got everyone \n     because he used a jury argument before the Supreme Court. He \n     said: as black soldiers we went to the war to fight on the \n     front lines in Europe, and when we come home we have to sit \n     on the back of the bus.\n       I had been with the 9th Anti-Artillery Aircraft unit in \n     Tunisia in Africa for a month. And then I was in Italy and \n     Germany and crossed over to what is now Kosovo. So I served. \n     I knew exactly what he was talking about. And I said this is \n     wrong.\n       The next year Chief Justice Vinson died. It was reported at \n     that time that Justice Frankfurter said for the first time \n     that he believed there was a God in Heaven when Vinson passed \n     away. They appointed Mr. Earl Warren as Chief Justice, who \n     dragged everybody back to the Court to re-argue the case in \n     December of 1953. He didn't want to hear about separate but \n     equal. He wanted the case re-argued on the constitutionality \n     of segregation itself.\n       Then on May 17, 1953 the decision came down, it was \n     unanimous, segregation was over in this country. So the \n     lawyers immediately got together to discuss how to implement \n     the decision. Since the decision said to integrate schools \n     with all deliberate speed, there was arguments back and forth \n     on how we could comply with this order with all deliberate \n     speed and not start chaos all over the land.\n       Some school authority down in Charleston came up with the \n     idea that with all deliberate speed meant we would integrate \n     the first grade the first year; we would integrate the first \n     and second grades the second year; the third year would be \n     the first, second, and third grades. Over a 12-year period, \n     we would then have the 12 grades integrated. When the head of \n     the NAACP in New York heard that he said: ``Noooo Way. We are \n     not going to be given our constitutional rights on the \n     installment plan.'' And that ended that. But nothing was done \n     for about 10 years, until Martin Luther King came along.\n       When I became Governor, I started working on other areas \n     that needed to be integrated, beginning with law enforcement. \n     I'll never forget all the white sheriffs who were against all \n     the blacks. We only had 34 black sheriffs. We have about 500 \n     today.\n       And we literally broke up and locked up the Ku Klux Klan. I \n     remember on the day I was sworn in as Governor, waiting for \n     me was a green and gold embossed envelope, with a lifetime \n     membership into the Ku Klux Klan. I never heard of such a \n     thing. I asked the head of law enforcement, do we have the Ku \n     Klux Klan in South Carolina? He said, ``Ohhh yes. We have \n     1,727 members.'' I asked, you have an actual count? And he \n     said: ``Ohhh yes, we keep a count of them.'' He said he could \n     get rid of them, but no Governor had helped him in the past. \n     I said, I'll help you. What do we do? He said: ``I need a \n     little money.''\n       So we infiltrated the Klan, and the members began to know, \n     or their bosses at businesses knew because they would say to \n     these people: ``You know on Friday night, your man, so and \n     so, has been going to these rallies.'' The next thing you \n     know, they quit going to the rallies. So by the time we \n     integrated Clemson with Harvey Gantt, it went very, very \n     peacefully. And there were less than 300 Klansmen.\n       Then, of course, as Senator I took my hunger trips. This is \n     the effect those arguments before the court had on me. I took \n     those trips with the NAACP to 16 different counties. As a \n     result, we embellished the food stamp program, we instituted \n     the women infants and children's feeding program, and the \n     school lunch program. The attendance in schools went way up \n     when we started that.\n       As your Senator I had the privilege of employing Ralph \n     Everett. He was the first black staff director of any \n     committee in the United States Senate.\n       We have both Andy Chishom and Israel Brooks as the first \n     black Marshalls of South Carolina. Matthew Perry, the first \n     black district judge of a Federal court ever appointed, I \n     appointed. The first black woman judge to the Federal \n     district court, Margaret Seymour, I appointed her. So we have \n     made a lot of progress along that line.\n       But to give you a feel for how things have changed, I \n     remember speaking at the C.A. Johnson High School in \n     Columbia, the largest black high school in the entire state, \n     the day after Martin Luther King was assassinated.\n       At the event, there was a mid-shipman, a senior at the \n     Naval Academy, who stood up and made one of the finest talks \n     I ever heard. I turned to the principal, because it was his \n     son, and I asked: who appointed your son to the Naval \n     Academy? He didn't answer. We walked down the row, and I can \n     see me now, asking him again. He still didn't answer. When I \n     got to my car, I said evidently you don't understand my \n     accent from Charleston. Who appointed your son to the U.S. \n     Naval Academy? He said, ``Senator, I didn't want to have to \n     answer that question. We couldn't get a member of the South \n     Carolina delegation to appoint him. Hubert Humphrey appointed \n     him.''\n       What goes around, comes around. Today, I have more minority \n     appointments to West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force \n     Academies than anybody. Recently I had Chuck Bolden, who is a \n     major general in the marine corps and a former astronaut, \n     ready to return to NASA as the number two person there. But \n     the Pentagon raised the question about taking such a talent \n     during a time of war and moving him to the civilian space \n     program. So we said the heck with it, he's too needed in the \n     military.\n       That is the effect Briggs v. Elliott had on this public \n     servant. There isn't any question that without the courage of \n     your parents, our society would be a lot worse off today.\n       I was there a few years back when the Congress of the \n     United States gave the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa \n     Parks. She deserved it, and we wouldn't take anything from \n     her for not moving her seat. But in the 1950s the worst they \n     could have done to her was to pull her off the bus. These \n     descendants lost their homes. They lost their livelihoods. \n     They almost lost their lives. As far as continuing their life \n     in the State of South Carolina, they could not do it.\n       Without their courage, without their stamina, without their \n     example in starting the Briggs v. Elliott case, we never \n     would have had a civil rights act. We never would have had a \n     voting rights act. We never would have had all the progress \n     we've made over the many, many years.\n       So I wanted particularly to come back and to publicly thank \n     each of you descendants. And I want to announce that I am \n     putting forward a bill that would honor posthumously Rev. De \n     Laine with a Congressional Gold Medal.\n       I need 66 co-sponsors in the Senate. We have to have \n     similar support on the House side. But Cong. Clyburn, he can \n     get way more votes than I can. I don't think he'll have any \n     trouble. We'll try to work it out so that in '04, the 50th \n     anniversary of when the decision came down, we'll be able to \n     make that presentation.\n       I just want to end by saying because of the courage of your \n     parents, we made far more progress in the United States of \n     America. Our country is a far stronger country. We are more \n     than ever the land of the free and the home of the brave \n     because of Briggs v. Elliott. And I thank you all very, very \n     much.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 499. A bill to authorize the American Battle Monuments Commission \nto establish in the State of Louisiana a memorial to honor the Buffalo \nSoldiers; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, 137 years ago, before the term homeland\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\nsecurity was even coined, a group of men devoted themselves to securing \nthe frontiers of this Nation. They protected Americans in their homes; \nthey deterred hostile invaders, and they secured the blessings of \nliberty for a young country. Even more remarkable, they secured these \nblessings for others, while they could not fully enjoy them themselves.\n  I am referring to the Buffalo Soldiers. These brave men instituted a \ntradition of professional military service for African Americans that \nspans the greater part of American history. African American military \nservice is as old as our Nation. There were black soldiers during the \nRevolution, a unit of free black men played a pivotal role in the \nBattle of New Orleans, and the exploits of African Americans during the \nCivil War have been captured in novels and on film. However, it was not \nuntil the Army Reorganization Act of 1866 that soldiering and service \nto country became a realistic option for African Americans seeking to \nimprove their quality of life. In so doing, they raised the bar of \nfreedom, and revealed the injustice of preventing the defenders of \ndemocracy from fully participating in it.\n  The city of New Orleans, and the State of Louisiana have a rich \nhistory. They have given more than their fair share of sons to the \nservice of our Nation. Much of this history is commemorated throughout \nthe State. Yet, these great sons of New Orleans remain unacknowledged \nin their home. For in Louisiana's great military tradition, surely two \nof its greatest military contributions were the 9th Cavalry Regiment \nand the 25th Infantry Regiment.\n  These two forces, recruited and organized in New Orleans, represent \nhalf of all the units of Buffalo Soldiers. The 9th Cavalry alone \nconstituted 10 percent of all the American cavalry. Their list of \nadversaries reads like a who's who of the Old West--Geronimo, Sitting \nBull, Pancho Villa. In movies, when settlers encounter Apaches, the \ncavalry always comes to the rescue. Yet how many times were the cavalry \nthat rode over the horizon African American? Of course, the reality is \nthat the Buffalo Soldiers comprised some of our Nation's most capable \nand loyal troops. Despite suffering the worst deprivations known to any \nAmerican soldiers of the period, they had the lowest desertion rates in \nthe Army. The 9th Cavalry was awarded 10 Congressional Medals of Honor, \nincluding a native Louisianan, SGT. Emanuel Stance--a farmer from \nCarrol Parish.\n  For these reasons, I am offering legislation that would authorize the \ncreation of a suitable memorial in New Orleans for these gallant \nsoldiers. There is an excellent statue to the Buffalo Soldiers at Fort \nLeavenworth, KS. It commemorates the 10th Cavalry Regiment stationed \nthere. However, I believe that these men deserve to be recognized in \ntheir home city.\n  Furthermore, it should be in a location where thousands of visitors \nwill have the opportunity to come to appreciate the legacy of the \nBuffalo Soldiers. I believe that the city of New Orleans is the perfect \nlocation.\n  Mr. President, we have made a number of changes to this legislation \nafter consultations with the American Battle Monuments Commission. I \nbelieve these changes should address any concerns that they have \nexpressed. Furthermore, we have an able and dedicated organization of \nindividuals in the State who desperately want to see this project to \ncompletion. Last year, I had the pleasure of being in New Orleans with \nanother of this Nation's great military heroes, Senator Daniel Inouye. \nWe addressed a group of distinguished veterans from all around the \nState. Among them was George Jones, President of the Greater New \nOrleans Chapter of the Buffalo Soldiers Association. They have been \nworking with Eddie Dixon, the artist for the beautiful Fort Leavenworth \nstatue, to develop an appropriate memorial in the city of New Orleans \nfor over a decade. This bill will fulfill that noble ambition.\n  Mr. President, this Nation has sadly found the need to say thank you \nto its service men and women after the fact on more than one occasion. \nUnfortunately, this is another. We are fortunate to have living \nmemories of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments today. The regiments \nwere not disbanded until the conclusion of World War II, where they \nserved with distinction. We should take this opportunity to honor these \nveterans, and in so doing, honor the principles of liberty, freedom and \ndemocracy for which they fought and sacrificed. They have given so much \nto their Nation, we owe them this public expression of gratitude.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these remarks appear in \nthe Record, contiguous to the introduced bill and that the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 499\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Buffalo Soldier \n     Commemoration Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments and the 24th and \n     25th Infantry regiments, comprised of African-American \n     soldiers referred to as ``Buffalo Soldiers'', performed \n     outstanding service to the United States during--\n       (A) the Indian Wars;\n       (B) the Spanish-American War;\n       (C) the Philippine Insurrection; and\n       (D) the raids against Poncho Villa;\n       (2) in recognition of the contributions of the Buffalo \n     Soldiers to the defense of the United States, soldiers in the \n     9th and 10th Cavalry regiments were awarded 20 individual \n     Congressional Medals of Honor;\n       (3) the Buffalo Soldiers established a rich tradition of \n     professional African-American soldiers in the United States \n     Army by granting a commission--\n       (A) in the 10th Cavalry regiment, to the first African-\n     American professional officer; and\n       (B) in the 9th Cavalry regiment, to the first African-\n     American graduates of West Point;\n       (4) while the Buffalo Soldiers served the United States \n     with bravery and fortitude in the harshest environments and \n     under the most difficult conditions, the service of the \n     Buffalo Soldiers has not been sufficiently memorialized;\n       (5) the Buffalo Soldiers remain emblems of the work of free \n     men in defense of the United States and should be recognized \n     for their contributions; and\n       (6) because 2 of the 4 African-American regiments were \n     organized in the State of Louisiana and were initially \n     comprised of recruits from the city of New Orleans, the State \n     of Louisiana is an appropriate place to establish a memorial \n     to recognize the contributions of the Buffalo Soldiers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide a grant program for gifted and talented \nstudents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation \nintended to help states address the educational needs of gifted and \ntalented students. There are approximately 3 million children in the \nUnited States who are considered gifted and talented. It is important \nto note that gifted and talented children are not simply the kids who \ndo well in school and get good grades. In fact, not all gifted students \nget good grades and not all students who get straight A's are \nnecessarily gifted learners. What makes a child gifted and talented is \nhow he or she learns. Gifted and talented children actually look at the \nworld differently and often have a different way of interacting \nsocially. As a result, gifted and talented students have different \neducational needs than other students.\n  I am reminded of an example from my home state of Iowa. I have \nlearned of a third grade student from Iowa City named Jose. Jose was \nhaving trouble in school. He didn't always complete his assignments and \nhe had trouble paying attention in class. He was also a bit of a loner \nand didn't interact much with his classmates. As a result, his teacher \nsaw him as a problem student and struggled to get him to behave like \nthe other children. Still, it was clear to Jose's parents that he had a \nhunger to learn. He loved to go to the library and was very \ninquisitive. Over the summer, Jose's parents had his IQ tested and he \nwas found to have a high level of intelligence. As a result, when he \nstarted school again in the fall, his parents asked that he be \nidentified as gifted and receive services. Jose now leaves his regular \nclassroom a couple of times a week for what Iowa City schools call the \n``extended learning program.'' As a result, he is finally receiving the \nstimulation he was lacking at school. Jose now enjoys school more, has \nmade new friends, and is doing great with his regular school work.\n  Gifted and talented children have enormous potential. Today's gifted \nand talented child may grow up to become a leader in the field of \nscience or a world-renowned performer. However, this will not happen \nautomatically. Gifted and talented children need to be challenged and \ntheir unique skills must be nurtured. Currently, many gifted and \ntalented children do not receive the educational programs and services \nthey need to live up to their potential. In fact, many gifted and \ntalented children lose interest in school; they learn how to expend \nminimum effort for top grades, have low motivation, and develop poor \nwork habits. Some may abandon their education altogether and drop out \nof school. This is a tragedy not only for the students, but also for \nour society.\n  We hear a lot about how the United States has a shortage of \nindividuals with the skills in math and science that are necessary for \nour Nation to continue to be competitive in today's global economy. Our \nsecurity agencies are scrambling to find linguists who know or can \nquickly learn foreign languages. In fact, one of the findings included \nin my bill states, ``To meet the future economic and national security \nneeds of the United States, it is important that more students achieve \nto higher levels, and that highly capable students receive an education \nthat prepares them to perform the most highly innovative and creative \nwork that is necessary to secure our Nation's position in the world.''\n\n  In times of national crisis or uncertainty, the United States has \nalways turned to its best and brightest to solve whatever problems face \nus. The launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union brought to national \nattention for the first time the need to develop the special gifts and \ntalents of young Americans. Once again, we find ourselves in a time of \nuncertainty, facing new threats and challenges that we are struggling \nto understand. In order to ensure that our country is prepared to face \nwhatever unforeseen problems will come our way in the future, we must \ninvest now in this vital national resource, gifted students.\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\n  My legislation is not intended to make the education of gifted and \ntalented students primarily a Federal responsibility. Education is, and \nshould be, chiefly a State and local responsibility. Nevertheless, the \nFederal Government does have a role to play. The availability and \nquality of gifted and talented educational services currently varies \nwidely from State to State. This situation has an especially adverse \neffect on disadvantaged gifted students whose parents cannot afford to \npay for private programs or summer camps. Untimately, gifted and \ntalented students in every public school should have access to \nspecialized educational services that are designed to address their \nlearning needs. Still, my bill would simply provide the seed money to \nhelp States begin to expand the availability of gifted education \nservices.\n  My gifted and talented initiative would distribute grants, based on a \nState's student population, to each State education agency. States will \nthen provide grants to local school districts on a competitive basis to \nbe used to identify and provide educational services to gifted and \ntalented students from all economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds, \nincluding students with limited English proficiency and students with \ndisabilities. Rather than providing a steady Federal funding stream \ndirectly to the local level, on which schools might become dependent, \nthe competitive subgrants will allow States to target school districts \nthat need to jump-start their gifted and talented program. At the same \ntime, the local competitive grant process will encourage State \neducation agencies to more closely examine the needs of gifted children \nin their respective States.\n  At least 90 percent of the funds provided to a State must be \nsubgranted to school districts and the funds must supplement, not \nsupplant, funds currently being spent. Additionally, States must make \ntheir own commitment to gifted and talented students by matching 10 \npercent of the Federal funds, either in cash or in kind. All of this is \nintended to help gifted and talents programs and services take root in \neach State and in local school districts so that they can grow and \ndevelop to fully address the unique educational needs of this special \ngroup of students.\n  I have intentionally included a broad range of authorized uses for \nthe grants in my bill in order to allow States and local school \ndistricts the flexibility to address their specific needs. School \ndistricts can use these funds to provide professional development for \npersonnel involved in the education of gifted and talented students, \nincluding gifted education teachers, general education teachers, and \nother school personnel like administrators and school counselors. The \nfunds can also be used to provide direct educational services and \nmaterials. Or, school districts could use the funds to support items \nlike innovative strategies for teaching gifted students, making \nmaterials available through regional centers, or providing high-level \ncourse work through distance learning technology.\n\n  The Federal involvement in gifted and talented education is not new. \nThe Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act has provided \nvaluable information on strategies to meet the needs of gifted students \nsince 1988 through the funding of demonstration grants and the National \nResearch Center on the Gifted and Talented. In the No Child Left Behind \nAct of 2001, Congress expanded the Javits Act to authorize competitive \ngrants to States to expand the capacity of States to meet the needs of \ngifted students. These new grants represent some potential to improve \nthe ability of select States to address the needs of gifted and \ntalented children, and I am pleased with the progress we have been able \nto make thus far. My legislation would build on the existing Javits Act \nto create a comprehensive approach to expanding the ability of States \nand school districts nationwide to meet the needs of gifted and \ntalented students.\n  Congress has rightly placed a renewed emphasis on making sure all \nchildren are successful learners. In our efforts to leave no child \nbehind, we must not forget gifted and talented students. I would remind \nmy colleagues of the example I cited earlier. Jose is a success story \nbecause his parents saw his potential and pointed it out to school \nofficials, and because he attended a school where quality gifted \neducation services are available. There are many more students like \nJose across the country who have either not been identified as gifted \nor who attend a school where gifted education services are not \nprovided. I would urge my colleagues to join me in seeing that these \nexceptional young people across our great Nation have the support and \nservices they need to be successful. I ask for your support for the \nGifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 501\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM; AUTHORIZED \n                   ACTIVITIES.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) Gifted and talented students give evidence of high \n     performance capability in specific academic fields, or in \n     areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership \n     capacity, and require services or activities not ordinarily \n     provided by a school in order to fully develop such \n     capabilities. Gifted and talented students are from all \n     cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic \n     groups. Some such students have disabilities and for some, \n     English is not their first language. Many students from such \n     diverse backgrounds have been historically underrepresented \n     in gifted education programs.\n       ``(2) Elementary school students who are gifted and \n     talented have already mastered 35 to 50 percent of the \n     material covered in a school year in several subject areas \n     before the school year begins.\n       ``(3) Elementary school and secondary school teachers have \n     students in their classrooms with a wide variety of traits, \n     characteristics, and needs. Most teachers receive some \n     training to meet the needs of these students, such as \n     students with limited English proficiency, students with \n     disabilities, and students from diverse cultural and racial \n     backgrounds. However, most teachers do not receive training \n     on meeting the needs of students who are gifted and talented.\n       ``(4) While the families or communities of some gifted \n     students can provide private programs with appropriately \n     trained staff to supplement public educational offerings, \n     most high-ability students, especially those from inner \n     cities, rural communities, or low-income families, must rely \n     on the services and personnel provided by public schools. \n     Therefore, gifted education programs, provided by qualified \n     professionals in the public schools, are needed to provide \n     equal educational opportunities.\n       ``(5) Parents and families are essential partners to \n     schools in developing appropriate educational services for \n     gifted and talented students. They need access to \n     information, research, and support regarding the \n     characteristics of gifted children and their educational, and \n     social and emotional needs, as well as information on \n     available strategies and resources for education in State and \n     local communities.\n       ``(6) There currently is no Federal requirement to identify \n     or serve the Nation's approximately 3,000,000 gifted and \n     talented students.\n       ``(7) While some States and local educational agencies \n     allocate resources to educate gifted and talented students, \n     others do not. Additionally, State laws, and State and local \n     funding, identification, and accountability mechanisms vary \n     widely, resulting in a vast disparity of services for this \n     special-needs population.\n       ``(8) To meet the future economic and national security \n     needs of the United States, it is important that more \n     students achieve to higher levels, and that highly capable \n     students receive an education that prepares them to perform \n     the most highly innovative and creative work that is \n     necessary to secure our Nation's position in the world.\n       ``(9) The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in \n     the United States on the Third International Mathematics and \n     Science Study (TIMSS) was among the lowest in the world.

A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to designate \nperchlorate as a contaminant and to establish a maximum contaminant \nlevel for perchlorate; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprotect drinking water from contamination by the toxic chemical \nperchlorate. My bill will require the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) to establish a standard for perchlorate contamination in \ndrinking water supplies by July 1, 2004. Under EPA's current schedule, \n2006 is the earliest date a standard would be finalized.\n  Perchlorate is a clear and present danger to California's public \nhealth. We cannot wait 4 more years to address this threat. EPA needs \nto get moving and protect our drinking water sooner rather than later.\n  Drinking water sources for at least 7 million Californians and \nmillions of other Americans are contaminated with perchlorate. \nPerchlorate is the main ingredient in rocket fuel, which accounts for \n90 percent of its use. Perchlorate is also used for ammunition, \nfireworks, highway safety flares, air bags, and fertilizers. It \ndissolves readily in many liquids, including water, and moves easily \nand quickly through cracks and water.\n  Perchlorate was first discovered in drinking water in 1957, although \nit was rarely listed as a contaminant of concern as late as the mid-\n1900s. Since 1997, when California's Department of Health Services \ndeveloped a new, more sensitive analytical testing method that can \ndetect perchlorate down to 4 parts per billion, perchlorate has been \nfound in soil, groundwater, and surface water throughout the U.S.\n  Perchlorate poses a variety of serious health risks relating to \nthyroid function, especially in newborns, children, and pregnant women. \nExposure to perchlorate interferes with the thyroid gland's ability to \nproduce the hormones needed for normal prenatal development. This can \ncause both physical and mental retardation. Perchlorate is also linked \nto thyroid cancer.\n  Californians face special threats from perchlorate contamination \nbecause so many rockets and missiles were built and tested in the state \nduring World War II and the cold war. Groundwater can become \ncontaminated wherever the chemical is manufactured, used, disposed of, \nor stored.\n  Alarming levels of perchlorate have been discovered in Lake Mead and \nthe Colorado River, the drinking water source for millions of Southern \nCalifornians. Communities in the Inland Empire, San Gabriel Valley, \nSanta Clara Valley, and the Sacramento area are also grappling with \nperchlorate contamination. In addition, more than 20 million Americans \nin at least 19 states drink water contaminated with perchlorate.\n  My bill will ensure that EPA acts swiftly to address this threat to \nour health and welfare. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \npass this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S.J. Res. 7. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to the reference to God in \nthe Pledge of Allegiance and on United States currency; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was surprised and disappointed by the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision not to reconsider its ruling \nin the case of Newdow versus U.S. Congress. To remind my colleagues, in \nthe Newdow case, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit held that the \nreference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance was unconstitutional. The \nBush administration requested that the Ninth Circuit reconsider its \nruling in the case. At the end of last week, the Ninth Circuit meeting \nen banc refused to reconsider its ruling. The case will likely go to \nthe Supreme Court.\n  When the court first made its decision in Newdow last year, I \nintroduced a proposed constitutional amendment that simply said that \nreferences to God in the Pledge of Allegiance and on our currency did \nnot affect an establishment of religion under the first amendment. In \nlight of the en banc Ninth Circuit's refusal to reconsider its ruling, \nI am reintroducing my proposed amendment today.\n  Mr. President, references to God are found in every one of our \nfounding documents from the Declaration of Independence to the \nConstitution, as well as in the Pledge of Allegiance. The phrase ``In \nGod We Trust'' appears on all of our currency and on many public \nbuildings. Every day, we begin Senate sessions with a prayer and the \npledge. I firmly believe that the Framers of the Constitution and the \nfirst amendment did not want to ban all references to God from public \ndiscourse when they wrote the establishment clause. What they wanted to \nprevent was the establishment of an official national religion and to \nkeep the Government from getting intimately involved in the \norganization of one religion over another.\n  These references to God are ceremonial. Certainly, they do have \nmeaning, but individuals are free to put whatever meaning on the word \nthey choose. Indeed, I fully respect and support the rights of people \nnot to participate in the pledge or in ceremonial prayer and my \namendment will not coerce anyone to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in \npublic or in school.\n  Mr. President, I had hoped that the Ninth Circuit would reconsider \nits earlier holding.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \nfollowing morning business, the Senate will return to the Estrada \nnomination. Since taking up this nomination almost a month ago, the \nSenate has thoroughly and vigorously debated Mr. Estrada's \nqualifications to serve on the DC Circuit Court. Although a solid \nmajority of Senators supports this nomination, several of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle refuse to let this well-qualified man \nreceive an up-or-down vote on confirmation. Those who oppose Mr. \nEstrada certainly have a right to have their opinions heard, but I \nthink it is more than fair to say that every Senator has had ample \nopportunity to speak on the nomination. I encourage any Member who \nstill wishes to speak on the nomination to do so during tomorrow's \nsession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/03/senate-section/article/S3036-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
