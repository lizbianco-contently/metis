Mr. President, today we are convening for this unusual \nSaturday session with the hope of finishing our work and adjourning the \n108th Congress. We anticipate the omnibus conference report will arrive \nfrom the House of Representatives today. In all likelihood that would \nbe early to midafternoon. I hope we will be able to have a short period \nof debate and then proceed to a vote on adoption of that conference \nreport.\n  Once the report arrives officially from the House of \nRepresentatives--again, I think it is going to be early to \nmidafternoon, possibly around 2 o'clock--we would like to go to that \nbill at that point in time. As you can see before me, we have the \ncopies, both here and each of the cloakrooms have several copies at \nthis point in time. I know people have been interested and have been \nlooking through the copies of that report. But we will be prepared to \ngo to it this afternoon.\n  One of the issues we will be checking with also, over the course of \nthe rest of the morning and early afternoon, is to ask Members how much \ntime they do want to spend on debate and how much debate time will be \nnecessary in order that we can advise our colleagues with regard to \ntheir schedules.\n  In addition, over the night--which was a long night for many people, \nboth staff as well as Members, in bringing to a close the 108th \nCongress--there was a lot of work on the intelligence reform bill, the \n9/11 intelligence reform bill. Huge progress has been made over the \nlast 24 hours under the leadership, from the Senate side, of Senator \nCollins, joined by Senator Lieberman and, indeed, they have done \nyeoman's work in bringing us to this point. So if that conference \nreport becomes available, we may also be considering intelligence \nreform over the course of the day.\n  A third issue that we have spent a lot of time with yesterday and \nthrough last night and over the course of the morning is the \nnominations. People do not realize that in our calendar right now there \nare over 200 nominations pending that we either need to wrap up today \nor it will be in the next Congress. It is not 10 or 20 or 50 or 100; it \nis almost 200 nominations that have been held up for various reasons. \nBut they made it to the calendar and I am very hopeful that over the \ncourse of the next several hours we can reach an agreement to address \nall 200 or so of those pending nominations. Many people are working on \nthat. I just encourage our Members to continue to work on that.\n  These individuals have accepted the call to public service in many \ndifferent capacities. Yet because of inactivity on the floor of the \nSenate, they are going to be just a name in that book where if we can \nact on that, they will be allowed to proceed. They have gone through \nthe entire process. I know it is incumbent upon us to act. We just have \nto find a way to confirm these noncontroversial executive nominations \nbefore we finish our work.\n\n\n                           Middle East Peace\n\n  I want to comment on two things. First is a resolution we passed \nyesterday, last night, in support of democracy in the Middle East. On \nNovember 12, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister \nof England articulated their joint resolve to press for a peaceful \nresolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Specifically, they \nsupport the creation of a Palestinian State that is peaceful, that is \ndemocratic, that is free, and that is based and grounded on the rule of \nlaw, that will include free press and free speech and an open political \nprocess and religious tolerance.\n\n  Last night, here in the Senate, we voted unanimously to ratify this \nvision. It is our hope that both parties to the roadmap will follow it \nto a peaceful resolution. With courage and determination on both sides, \nwe believe, in fact we know, that peace can be achieved.\n\n[[Page S11666]]\n\n                          Politics of Decency\n\n  One final issue I want to spend a few minutes talking about is the \npeople's expectation of how this body should function as we come \ntogether after what we know have been tough, competitive elections. Two \ndays ago I had the opportunity to travel with Senator Daschle and a \nnumber of Senators and House Members to the opening of the Clinton \nLibrary, and it was remarkable, while I was there, the number of people \nfrom other countries--there was a huge delegation from other \ncountries--who came forward and spoke about the remarkable flexibility, \npliability, resilience of America in coming together after tough \nelections, aggressive elections. Within a week or 2 weeks, we come \ntogether. That is what the American people expect and that is \ncharacteristic of America.\n  To accomplish the people's work, the Senate and Senators, the Members \nof this body, must work together and do work together. They must work \ntoward consensus. They must conduct their affairs with respect for each \nother and with civility. They must practice those politics of decency.\n  In my office, just down the hall, one of my predecessor Republican \nleaders, Everett Dirksen, has a portrait on the wall there. It reminds \nme that he was often an ardent antagonist of Democratic \nadministrations. He broke with some in his party to lead the Nation's \nRepublicans in support of the laws that ended legal racial \ndiscrimination in this country. He acted because he knew he was doing \nthe right thing and the reasonable thing and the moral thing. He acted \nbecause the Nation needed, the Nation deserved, racial equality, and in \nacting he had to work with members of the other party. Indeed, he did, \nand he could. He had strong personal relationships with President \nLyndon Johnson and the Democratic leader, Mike Mansfield. He worked \nalongside them to pass the historic 1964 Civil Rights Act and the \ngroundbreaking 1965 Voting Rights Act. But without his will to \ncooperate, in all likelihood, neither would have become law.\n\n  And Dirksen cared about keeping a civil atmosphere in Washington, DC. \nIn 1969, he even rode in that Presidential inauguration with President-\nelect Nixon and President Johnson in an effort to smooth the troubled \nrelationship between those two statesmen.\n  In the last 4 years, with civility and the will to work together, we \nset tough new standards in fields such as education, with No Child Left \nBehind. We created the Department of Homeland Security, again coming \ntogether and working on the issue with great civility. I have been \nproud to work with numerous colleagues on issues important to me--with \nSenator Kerry aggressively, over a period of about a year, on issues \nsurrounding AIDS and malaria and tuberculosis. I was deeply proud to \nwork with my distinguished colleague from Louisiana, John Breaux, as we \nfashioned over the last several years, culminating last year, a \nMedicare modernization package that extended, for the first time in the \nhistory of Medicare, prescription drug coverage to seniors; and with \nSenator Ron Wyden on flexibility and accountability in education, and \nSenator Kennedy on issues surrounding public health and bioterrorism.\n  Throughout our history, indeed, America has been governed best when \nthe women and men of the Senate--and I should also add the House of \nRepresentatives--and the Executive have treated each other with respect \nand with civility and with decency. A lot of it comes down to personal \nrelationships, which a lot of people don't see but really is the heart \nof this body. Rule XIX says--I don't need to remind my colleagues of \nthe clear message of rule XIX of this body:\n  No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of \nwords impute to another Senator or to Senators any conduct or motive \nunworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\n  The American people have sent us a clear message as well. They want \nto move America forward, but they want to make sure we do it in a way \nthat shows respect for one another. They reelected a Republican \nPresident, chose significant Republican majorities in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate, but regardless of whether we are \nRepublicans or whether we are Democrats, we all take the same pledge, \nwhich our new Senators will be doing in early January, to defend the \nsame Constitution. It is our duty to represent all Americans. The \nAmerican people expect us to work together, the American people want us \nto work together, and they deserve to have us work together.\n  I know that all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share the \nsame ultimate goal of a safer America, a more prosperous America, and a \nhealthier America, and that none of us want to be thought of as blanket \nobstructionists to accomplishing this goal. We want to move with \ncivility, with cooperation, working toward consensus. But all too \noften, as we all know--we have seen it in this body and outside the \nbody and in committees--people tend to lean to partisan bickering. We \nneed to move away from that because we have all seen that it does get \nin the way of our genuine, our shared desire to move America forward.\n  Many believe things have worsened over time here in comparison to the \nway it may have been 15 years ago or 30 years ago. It is true that \nSenators of different parties rarely get together, or clearly don't get \ntogether as much as they did in more distant times. We come together \nfor floor votes and we come together for occasional Senate dinners and \nwe come together for weekly prayer breakfasts, many of us, but clearly \nwe haven't generated those opportunities nearly as much as they were in \nthe past.\n  Every year, more and more people are commenting on the partisan \ndivide and the bickering and the sniping back and forth. As my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Daschle, has said, it is not enough to \nsay that society has become divided and throw up your hands. We have a \nhigher responsibility, he says, and I quote his words, ``to try to \nbridge the divide, not simply mirror or exploit it.'' I simply could \nnot agree with that more.\n  At the Clinton Library opening 2 days ago we had the opportunity to \nspend a couple of hours together. It was a tremendous ceremony, the \nopening of that library. But as we sat there, we very specifically \ntalked about how best this institution can be served by moving toward \ngreater civility, more opportunities for us to come together. Civility \nin this body has eroded over time, and it will take time and a renewed \ncommitment, maybe a new commitment for many, but a renewed commitment \nto regain it. But we have got to begin.\n  I think we have a great opportunity to begin in the coming weeks. We \nhave had other Members of this Chamber who have already begun much of \nthis task. I want to highlight the recent bipartisan orientation \nsessions that the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, along with my \ncolleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, along with Senator Mark \nPryor and Senator George Voinovich, put together. When they first \nbrought this idea to us, both Senator Daschle and I said: Yes, \nabsolutely, let's do it. Indeed, over 4 days this past week, starting \nSunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the nine newly elected Senators \nfrom both parties were together for the better part of each and every \none of those days addressing how they can best serve their constituents \nand, indeed, the American people. They were joined by their spouses. \nThey had lively discussions. They had meals together. They had dinner \nand conversation well into the night each of these evenings. I think it \nis a tremendous foundation for what we all need to make a renewed \ncommitment to do in the coming weeks and months in this body.\n  Tip O'Neill, who would sit and swap stories with President Reagan \nafter hard days fighting on everything from appropriations to welfare \nreform, liked saying, in a quotation we all hear again and again, ``We \nshould all be friends after 6 p.m.''\n  At the same time, we all know that in this body, we have two parties \nand we have two very different views of how to get to that common goal. \nSo we don't expect Senators to compromise their principles in any way. \nWe don't expect Republicans to stop being Republicans or Democrats to \nstop being Democrats, and it takes effective spokesmen on both sides of \nthe aisle to articulate those principles. The principles we stand for \nboth as parties and as caucuses do reflect some very different visions. \nIn some cases, they can\n\n[[Page S11667]]\n\nbe serious and in some ways quite fundamental, but when it comes to the \ndetails of policy, we can and should move together and have discussions \nwith civility to move toward consensus.\n  We face an imperative to reduce the deficit by keeping spending in \ncheck, but without raising taxes and stifling job growth.\n\n  We must transform our health care system into one that puts people \nand their doctors first and puts the doctor-patient relationship in \ncharge.\n  We do need to confirm judges who justly and independently interpret \nthe law.\n  We can't move America forward unless we do these things, and we can't \ndo these things unless we do work together. Doing this and improving \nthe environment and the tenor of this body is going to require a lot of \nhard work. We will need more good ideas devised by Senators Alexander, \nCarper, Pryor, and Voinovich.\n  We should give strong consideration to the proposals my colleague \nSenator Daschle made several months ago such as all-Senate policy \nforums to discuss the issues of the day, and bipartisan leadership \nmeetings which bring leadership together. These are all great \nsuggestions, fruitful suggestions, and great starting points and \nproductive ideas.\n  Senator Reid and I have already begun to discuss ideas on how to \nachieve this, again working together to make my ideas and his ideas a \nreality.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle should know that as we approach \nthese issues, accomplish this, and their ideas we ask them to bring \nforward.\n  In closing, the traditions, rules, and customs of the Senate rest on \na foundation of civility. That is why we have rules that are in print, \na body of rules. Then we have this whole element of tradition and \nprecedent which is so important to this body.\n  We have essential work ahead of us as we all begin to plan and look \nat the next Congress. We are stewards of rich Senate traditions and \nstewards of constitutional principles that simply must not be undone. \nWe are leaders elected by the American people for one simple purpose; \nthat is, to move America forward. Doing it is going to require a lot of \nwork. It will require a lot of consensus building, and above all it \nwill require civility.\n  I look forward to working with our leadership and working jointly \nwith the Democratic leadership to make that our goal and to implement \nand incorporate whatever we need to do in this body so we indeed can \nachieve that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11667-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, I take a moment to talk about 4 \ncolleagues whom I have had an opportunity to serve with in the Senate.\n  First of all, I want to talk about my colleague from the State of \nColorado, who is not going to be with us as we go into the waning days \nof the 108th Congress.\n  I had an opportunity to get to know Ben Campbell in the Colorado \nGeneral Assembly. In 1982, he was elected to the State house and I was \nelected to the State senate. It was not long before the buzz in the \nCapitol was all about this great Native American whom we had serving in \nthe State house who brought to the Capitol some common sense from \nwestern Colorado, an individual who in his own right had already gained \nsome national notoriety.\n  Senator Campbell came from a family that was somewhat dysfunctional. \nIt was a poor family. He joined the Air Force. While he was serving in \nthe Air Force, he had an opportunity to get his GED. He served in \nKorea. While serving in the Air Force, he also spent some time in Japan \nwhere he received some judo training. He became a member of the first \nOlympic judo team representing the United States. He had the \ndistinction of carrying the flag representing the whole United States \nentourage that was there participating in the Olympics.\n  This individual brought a considerable amount of national notoriety \nto the Colorado General Assembly. But he became even more respected \nbecause of his firm conviction, his hard work, and his commitment to \nsmall business, and to water issues of the western slope in the State \nhouse district he represented. In fact, having finished his first term, \nhe was recognized as one of the 10 best legislators in the Colorado \nGeneral Assembly. He had an opportunity to serve for about three terms \nand took on an incumbent congressman. He won that particular race and \nended up in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1986; then got elected \nto the U.S. Senate in 1992, and reelected in 1998.\n  During this period of time, I had an opportunity to be able to \nestablish a personal relationship with Senator Campbell in the State \nlegislature. I respect a lot of the values he brought to the \nlegislature. I had an opportunity to work with him for a short period \nof time in the U.S. House of Representatives. He certainly was a team \nplayer and somebody whom I felt I could work with. I looked forward to \nthe opportunity when I could serve with him in the Senate. While \nserving here in the Senate, we became known as a team representing the \ninterests of Colorado, which has been pretty effective. A lot of the \nissues that are important to the State of Colorado we were able to \naccomplish. A lot of it was because he was willing to take on the \nresponsibilities of the Appropriations Committee. Representatives from \nColorado ordinarily didn't seek out these committees, but he made a big \ndifference.\n  I consider it a great pleasure to be able to serve with him. I \nconsider him family. Not only are we close friends, but my niece \nmarried his son. I have the greatest respect for the Campbell family. \nThey are great Americans and I am pleased to be considered part of his \nfamily.\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I also want to take a moment to talk \nabout another colleague, Don Nickles, who has had a long and \ndistinguished career as we move into the waning days of the 108th \nCongress.\n  He brought to this Congress a perspective from the private sector. I \nam a small businessman. I grew up in the private sector. In my view, \ntoo few of us have had to meet the challenges and meet a payroll. I \nthink it affects how you view rules and regulations and taxes.\n  Senator Nickles from Oklahoma became a strong advocate of small \nbusiness issues and worked hard to hold down the tax burden and \nregulatory burden.\n  I had an opportunity to serve with him when he was chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and I very much appreciated his leadership on that \ncommittee.\n  I also appreciated the opportunity to be able to work with him in \nholding down and actually eliminating the death tax which has such \ndevastating effects on small business.\n\n[[Page S11668]]\n\n  During his many years here in the Congress, he has been an individual \nwho maintained integrity in the process.\n\n\n                            Peter Fitzgerald\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I want to express my appreciation for \nthe hard work of Peter Fitzgerald. I am disappointed he is only serving \none term in the Senate. It is a voluntary decision that he made to step \ndown after one term.\n  His family has business interests in Colorado. I have enjoyed working \nwith him, particularly when we served on the Agriculture Committee, and \nI began to respect his values as well as his work ethic.\n\n\n                              Zell Miller\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to recognize \nZell Miller, who replaced Paul Coverdell. He is someone I have grown to \nadmire during my service here in the Senate. He is a principled \nindividual and truly represents his great State of Georgia.\n\n  With each day of this session, I continue to admire his strength and \ntenacity and ability to stand up for what he believes is right.\n  I view these four individuals as four individuals who have \ndistinguished themselves in my mind and four individuals whom I have \nappreciated having the opportunity to serve with in the Senate and whom \nI hold in great esteem. I wish them the very best as they pursue life's \njourney, having served in a distinguished way in the Senate. I wish \nthem the very best and Godspeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to say goodbye to several of \nmy colleagues, dear friends and colleagues with whom I have had the \npleasure to work in the Senate.\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  I start with Senator Don Nickles. We say goodbye to Don Nickles of \nOklahoma who leaves after spending 24 years in the Senate, but not \nspending much else. As chairman of the Budget Committee, his philosophy \nof smaller government and fiscal prudence often reminded this Chamber \nof our duty to be good stewards of the taxpayer dollars. Don did not \nback down but always held his ground, demonstrating his perseverance \nand conviction.\n  He was first chosen by his colleagues for a leadership position in \n1988 as the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \nHe was next elected to the first of three terms as chairman of the \nRepublican Policy Committee, and in 1996, 1998, and 2000, he was \nelected unanimously to be assistant Republican leader.\n  He was the principal sponsor of the 2003 economic growth package \nwhich cut the tax on dividends, reduced the capital gains rate, raised \nthe child tax credit to $1,000 per child, and reduced the marriage \npenalty. My friend also led efforts to reform the Internal Revenue \nService. He helped enact the Nation's first balanced budget in three \ndecades and passed laws to make Members of Congress accountable to the \nsame laws as everyone else.\n  On a personal note, he worked with me on the marriage penalty. I \ncould not have passed my bill to reduce the marriage penalty on married \ncouples in our country without Don Nickles' strong backing and \nleadership.\n  I will never forget the first time I met Don. It was at the \nRepublican National Convention in Dallas, TX. Don was a young man and \nhe had just been elected to the Senate, and everyone was referring to \nhim as Senator. I assumed, because he was so young, that he must be a \nState senator. As I left, I said to him, you must have a long and great \ncareer ahead of you. I am sure you will run for higher office some day, \nthinking he was a State senator. But, in fact, he was a U.S. Senator \nalready and was the youngest Member at the time.\n  He is the gold standard for principled conservatives who stand tall \nfor their beliefs and work hard for their constituents.\n  As a Texan I may say there are times I am not fond of certain \nOklahoma college football teams, I have always been proud of Oklahoma's \nDon Nickles and honored to call him a neighbor.\n\n\n                        Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\n  Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell is one of the best friends I have in \nthe Senate. I am particularly going to miss him. He commands more \nattention than a Harley Davidson with straight pipes.\n\n  He brought a wealth of experience and perspective to the Senate that \nenriched all of our deliberations. Let me list, in no particular order, \nsome of these experiences. He was a fruit picker, a deputy sheriff, the \ncaptain of the U.S. judo team in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. He is a horse \ntrainer, a rancher, a fabulous jewelry artist, and chief of the \nNorthern Cheyenne tribe.\n  He also has served the people of Colorado as their Senator, both as a \nDemocrat and a Republican. He is a renaissance man in every sense of \nthe word. He can ride a Harley Davidson like a genuine biker because he \nis the real thing. On his motorcycle or on the Senate floor in his pony \ntail and sunglasses or in his business suit, he has unabashedly \ndefended the values and interests of Americans of all incomes and \nbackgrounds. This stems from his pride in our great country.\n  I remember when he decided it was time for the Capitol Police to buy \nAmerican and trade in their Japanese-made motorcycles for Harleys. He \nsaid in his typical upfront style that the Japanese bikes made the \npolice look like ``pizza delivery boys'' and they are not fast enough \nto catch crooks. Needless to say, the Capitol Hill motorcycle police \nare now equipped with Harleys.\n  One of Ben's most prominent contributions is now visible on our mall, \nthe National Museum of the American Indian. He initiated the \nlegislation to found this museum within the Smithsonian, and the \nbeautiful building housing priceless collections of American Indian \nartifacts and art work is a tremendous legacy of Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell: my friend, my colleague, and biker buddy.\n\n\n                            Peter Fitzgerald\n\n  It is often an uphill battle for a freshman Senator to make an \nimpact, but Senator Peter Fitzgerald, a former commercial banking \nattorney, has chaired or led investigations of corporate accounting \nfraud, mutual fund industry abuses, chronic underfunding of employee \npensions and waste, fraud and mismanagement in Federal agencies.\n  In 2004, he proposed comprehensive, bipartisan mutual fund reform \nlegislation to protect the household, college, and retirement savings \nof 95 million Americans. This bill, endorsed by consumer groups and \nreform-minded industry leaders, points the way for future legislation \non this subject.\n  The Senator also focused on consumer safety issues. In 2000 he led a \nsuccessful drive to modernize outdated Federal testing and safety \nstandards for child car seats. In 2002, he drafted and President Bush \nsigned into law a followup measure known as Anton's Law, to upgrade \nFederal testing and standards for child booster seats and to require \nautomakers to improve car safety features.\n  I wish him well in his future endeavors.\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  I wish Senator Tom Daschle well as he moves on to new challenges. As \nhis party's leader in the Senate he was smart and determined. Tom is an \nexemplar of the American story. He grew up as the eldest of four \nbrothers and became the first in his family to graduate from college, \nwith a political science degree from South Dakota State University.\n  He then served 3 years as an intelligence officer for the U.S. Air \nForce Strategic Air Command.\n\n  He secured a job as an aide to South Dakota Senator James Abourezk. \nFrom there, he rose to the highest job in the Senate, Senate majority \nleader.\n  Tom Daschle married Linda Hall and they are the parents of three \nchildren. He is proof that hard-working Americans can make a \ndifference.\n\n\n                             Fritz Hollings\n\n  From the day I first arrived in the Senate, until today, Senator \nHollings has been a force in the Senate. His institutional memory, his \ncommand of the issues, and his speaking style are recognized from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  He has been a tireless advocate of his State and his political \nbeliefs, earning him a role as one of the Senate's elder statesmen.\n  Senator Hollings fought in World War II, won his first election at \nage 26, served as the youngest Governor of his\n\n[[Page S11669]]\n\nState, and was elected to seven terms in the Senate. Incredibly, Fritz \nHollings was in public service since 1948 and somehow managed to be his \nState's junior Senator until 2 years ago. It must be something in the \nwater in South Carolina.\n  During his career, Senator Hollings has had an impact on a wide range \nof legislation, including measures to protect the environment, balance \nthe budget, and update telecommunications law.\n  I am very appreciative of his initiation of a nationwide effort to \ncombat breast and cervical cancer by utilizing his seat on the \nAppropriations Committee to secure funding for a pilot screening \nprogram. This will be one of the many lasting legacies of Fritz \nHollings.\n\n\n                               Bob Graham\n\n  Senator Bob Graham, a former two-term Governor of the sunshine State, \nhas compiled a record of achievement in the Senate which included \nportions of the PATRIOT Act. When it comes to environmental, tax, \nenergy, and education issues, he has been a strong voice in Congress.\n  One of the greatest legacies of Senator Graham is the Florida \nEverglades. The rich flora and fauna of the Everglades were threatened \nby development, but then-Governor Graham pushed through legislation to \nprotect it. Future generations of Americans who visit the Everglades \nshould remember his contribution to saving this national heritage.\n\n\n                              John Breaux\n\n  Madam President, Senator John Breaux is a voice of moderation and \nbipartisanship. He helped pass landmark welfare reform under a previous \nadministration, and has consistently been able to work with Members of \nthe other side of the aisle whether his party has been in the majority \nor minority.\n  His commonsense approach to energy legislation and many other issues \nwill certainly be missed. He helped defeat the Btu tax which was so \ninjurious to the energy industry in both my State of Texas and his \nState of Louisiana.\n  Senator Breaux was the youngest Member of the House of \nRepresentatives when he was elected, at age 28, in 1972. He served in \nthe House for 14 years before being elected to fill the legendary \nSenator Russell Long seat in 1986. You would think Washington would \nchange someone after all that time, but John is still a Cajun through \nand through and sees the world with a sense of humor that keeps \neverything in perspective.\n  I will miss John Breaux. He was often an ally on transportation, \nenergy, and telecommunications issues. Even when we were on opposite \nsides in a debate, he brought wisdom, experience, and a willingness to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion to the Senate.\n  And no, John, Louisiana cannot annex Texas.\n\n\n                              John Edwards\n\n  Madam President, we must also say farewell to a freshman Senator who \nis now a household name in the United States. No one who has met John \nEdwards can fail to like him and respect him.\n  Senator Edwards rose from humble beginnings to come close to being \nelected Vice President of the United States. The first member of his \nfamily to gain a college education, he went on to earn a law degree \nfrom the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He built a hugely \nsuccessful law practice before he entered public service.\n  Senator Edwards was a chief sponsor of the bipartisan Patient \nProtection Act, strong and far-reaching patient protection legislation \nthat passed the Senate in 2001. He has a long career ahead of him and \nwill do well on whatever path he takes.\n  Finally, I want to let Senator Edwards know that he and his wife \nElizabeth are in my prayers every day.\n\n\n                              Zell Miller\n\n  Madam President, it is hard to say how much I appreciate Zell Miller, \na proud Democrat and a great American. Senator Miller's early life was \nnot easy. He grew up in the hills of Georgia where people may not have \nhad much but they worked hard and had strong families and solid values. \nHe pulled a stint in the U.S. Marines, which he said put him on the \nright path in life. His colorful career in Georgia politics included \ntwo terms as Governor. When U.S. Senator Paul Coverdell, my great \nfriend, died unexpectedly, Zell Miller was appointed until a special \nelection could be held, which he won handily.\n  After he arrived in Washington, Senator Miller was one of the few who \nnot only talked the talk of bipartisanship but walked the walk. During \nthe war on terror, he advised bipartisan action on the Homeland \nSecurity bill. He called for bipartisan support for traditional \nAmerican values, a lower tax burden, and a strong American defense.\n\n  I think the verdict on Senator Miller's stand for old-time Democratic \nvalues has been vindicated, first in the 2002 elections and lastly in \nthe 2004 elections. Someone who is being friendly tells you things you \nwant to hear, but a true friend is one who tells you things he thinks \nyou should hear. Zell Miller is that kind of friend to both Democrats \nand Republicans. He will be missed in this August body, as one of those \nwho told it like it is, straight from the heart.\n  Madam President, I will miss all of my colleagues. As we take the \nopportunity to go forward in a new Congress, we will make new friends, \nbut we will never forget the old ones.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I begin today on a happy note to say, \nafter a lot of hard work in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, we have brought forth an excellent product. Thanks to the \nleadership of Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy, we have produced a \nsolid, bipartisan conference report which protects the educational \nrights of children with special needs while at the same time making the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act more workable for parents, \nteachers, school administrators, and school districts.\n  While IDEA, as the bill is known, has helped to open the doors to \nmany children with special needs since it was enacted in 1975, there is \nno question about problems existing.\n  Over the last half dozen years, I have traveled around the State of \nMissouri and met, in over 50 different communities, with teachers, \nschool principals, school board members, and parents to find out what \nthe challenges are in education. No surprise that you would come to \nhear that it is not just that they want more Federal money, they want \nsense in the Federal regulations. They told me horror stories about the \nregulatory hurdles they had to overcome to administer some of the \nFederal programs, especially IDEA. The IDEA was more focused on complex \nrules than on producing the results that children with disabilities and \ntheir families deserve.\n  I have heard story after story about frustrated special education \nteachers just throwing up their hands and saying: I can't take it \nanymore. I came to serve special needs children, not a bureaucracy, and \nnot to be involved in litigation all the time. I have hared about \ncrushing paperwork burdens, children misidentified for special \neducation, that the Federal Government is not paying its fair share of \nthe cost.\n\n  The conference report we adopted yesterday is a very important step \nto address these concerns, to strengthen and improve IDEA for both \nchildren and the educational system. We believe it will strengthen the \naccountability and results for children with disabilities, reduce IDEA \npaperwork burdens, provide greater flexibility for school districts, \nreduce the number of children wrongly placed in special education \nclasses, reduce litigation, and restore trust between parents and \nschool districts.\n  I am particularly pleased to tell you that many of the ideas \ncontained in this legislation were developed in Missouri. When I heard \nthe complaints of Missouri educators, I met and talked with the \nMissouri School Board Association, which put together a multimonth \nplanning conference with representatives of the teachers, of the \nspecial needs community, and others to come up with specific ideas and \nreforms. The Missouri School Board Association's Special Education \nAdvocacy Council and the Missouri Council of Administrators of Special \nEducation came forward with proposals that I took to the committee, and \nthe committee was able to include most, if not\n\n[[Page S11670]]\n\nall, of those in the final legislation. So once again, the best ideas \nwe get here come from home. I thank all of the committed education \nprofessionals and friends of special education who worked on it.\n  I am particularly pleased with the significant reforms which will \nfocus special education on educating children with special needs, not \nsimply complying with a system composed of intricate and complex \nregulatory and mountainous paperwork burdens.\n  Special education teachers, as I indicated, are leaving the \nprofession out of frustration because of the unnecessary burden, and \nthat is causing a chronic shortage. More time on paperwork means less \ntime spent with students or preparing lessons for students. It is as \nsimple as that. The numerous reforms in the bill will go a long way to \nfree our time of special educators.\n  Again, my thanks to Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy, and on my on \nstaff, Kara Vlasaty and Julie Jolly for helping us come up with an \nexcellent product.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11670-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO KOMNINOS ``GUS'' KARELLAS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the other matter I need to speak to today is \na very sad note. There is a funeral going on in my hometown of Mexico, \nMO, today, as we speak, for a very good friend of mine, Komninos \n``Gus'' Karellas. There is a celebration of his life in a community \nwhich has mourned him in the last several days.\n  You heard on the floor from my colleague, Senator Talent, words about \nGus, a tremendous American success story. He was an immigrant from \nGreece. He came here with nothing 40 years ago. He started out working \nfor others. He started out in California, came to Iowa, then Columbia, \nMO, and then moved with his wife to Mexico, MO, in 1970, to work in a \nsteakhouse. A year later, they bought that steakhouse.\n  For the last 33 years, Gus Karellas's G Steakhouse has been the \nplace to go for good steaks. I know it because I have been one of the \nfrequent visitors there.\n  I came to know Gus as the community of Mexico, MO, came to know Gus. \nWhat a warm, genuine human being Gus Karellas was. He was a leader in \nhis community. He helped charities like Boys Town. But he also did a \nwonderful thing in the community because he reached out to young people \nwith difficulties, gave them opportunities as busboys and other jobs in \nhis restaurant.\n  Unfortunately, the allegation in the police report was that it was \none of those, or maybe several of those, who murdered him several \nnights ago to take the receipts from his business. We do not know what \nwas in their troubled minds, but I can tell you that the community has \nlost a man of great dedication, great service.\n  Gus was a wonderful father. One of his sons, Nick Karellas, serves as \na legislative assistant in my office. Another son, Andy, serves as a \nlegislative assistant to Senator Talent. Jim Talent and I see every day \nthe work ethic, the commitment, the dedication that Gus instilled in \nhis children. He is a man who has left a very large mark on his \ncommunity, and he has left a legacy that all of us can admire and \nrecognize.\n  In the Omnibus appropriations bill that we will be passing today, \nthere is a grant for a trail at Lakeview Park in Missouri. I suggest \nthat the city fathers of my hometown consider naming that in honor of \nGus Karellas to recognize not only his accomplishments but his \ncontributions to the community and to his family.\n  I can only say that our thoughts and prayers are with the Karellas \nfamily. We join with the community in saluting his life, the great role \nmodel he was, the good he did for the community, and we will miss him \nsorely. They will also be in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN.

We will miss his booming \nvoice. We will miss Senator Edwards, Senator Graham of Florida, and \nSenator Daschle. We will also miss John Breaux, a man we know will \nenjoy life with his good common sense and sense of humor. He is a good \nfriend.\n  I want to speak about four others, though, including Peter \nFitzgerald, whom I will miss. He will always be known for two ideas and \nprinciples of life--honesty and integrity. He has certainly fought hard \nfor what he believed was right, and you can always trust his word.\n  Ben Nighthorse Campbell is a unique, proud leader of heritage. He is \na man of principle. I look at Ben Nighthorse Campbell as one who runs \non his own gear ratio. He is a character with character, whom I will \ncertainly miss.\n  Don Nickles--gosh, what a smart, principled leader. He will be \nmissed. He is a taxpayer's hero. Last night, my wife and I enjoyed the \nAllen Jackson concert in DC. And that makes me think of country music. \nDon Nickles is one of the reasons God made Oklahoma.

We got to know each other very \nwell in the Southern Governors Association. Before I came to the \nSenate, one of the people who motivated me to go to the Senate was Paul \nCoverdell. Zell took his seat and his office. When I came in, Zell gave \nup that office, and now I am in Zell Miller's and Paul Coverdell's \nformer office. I will think of Zell a lot in the future. Two years ago, \nwhen Zell announced his retirement, or that he was not going to run \nagain, some were saying Zell Miller is a lame duck. Well, on this \nfloor, at our convention in New York City, and throughout this fall, \nZell Miller was anything but a lame duck. Zell Miller leaves office as \na ``mighty duck.'' We are going to certainly miss Zell. We know he will \nstay active.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11670-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11670-S11671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TELECOMMUNICATIONS REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I want to discuss two important ideas and \nissues that are essential, I think, for America's future and our \nopportunities. First, I thank my colleagues in the House and the Senate \nfor support of S. 150, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act.\n  Second, I want to discuss the significant advances in broadband \nInternet technologies over the past 8 years, particularly since the \npassage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.\n  I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and \nthe Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, for their continued leadership on \nthe Internet tax moratorium. I have enjoyed working both with Chairman \nMcCain and Senator Wyden over the years on numerous technology-related \nprojects, such as nanotechnology, WiFi, unsolicited commercial e-mail, \nor SPAM and SPYWARE. They are great teammates on these \ntelecommunications and technology issues, and I thank them.\n  Yesterday afternoon, the House of Representatives passed S. 150, the \nInternet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, which cleared this important \nlegislation for the President's signature later this year. As \ncolleagues have heard me say on many occasions, the moratorium on \nInternet taxation has been one of my top legislative priorities since \ncoming to the Senate. I have held this position since 1997, in my days \nas Governor of Virginia, when I was one of only four Governors to share \nthe view in support of the visionary leadership of Congressman Chris \nCox and Senator Wyden on this issue of Internet taxation.\n  I have consistently advocated policies and ideas that promote freedom \nand opportunity for all Americans. This legislation, S. 150, authored \nwith Senator Wyden, protects every American from harmful, regressive \ntaxes on\n\n[[Page S11671]]\n\nInternet access, as well as from duplicative and predatory taxes on \nInternet transactions.\n  Today, the winners are the American people. I am very pleased to see \nthat this measure was a victory for those of us who stand for freedom, \nopportunity, and prosperity, rather than more taxation and burdensome \nregulations of the Internet. This legislation is a real victory for \nAmerican consumers, small businesses, rural Americans and, most \nimportant, low-income families. It is the result of a hard-fought \nsuccess that extends the tax moratorium for another 4 years, from the \ntime the last one expired until October 31, 2007.\n  Additionally, this legislation updates the previous moratorium to \nprotect all types of Internet access platforms, including dial-up, \nsatellite, cable modem service, DSL, wireless technology, and even next \ngeneration broadband networks, such as broadband over power lines.\n  Basic economics indicate that for every dollar of taxation added to \nthe cost of Internet access, we can expect to see lost utilization of \nopportunities for the Internet for thousands of American families, \nespecially those in rural areas and those of lower income.\n  With clear tax protection at the Federal level, S. 150 ensures that a \ncomplex, costly, and outdated telephone-like tax regime, which averages \nabout 15 percent to 18 percent nationally, will not be imposed on \nInternet consumers. The guiding principle of the Internet tax \nmoratorium has always been that the Internet should remain as \naccessible as possible to all people in all parts of the country \nforever. The Internet is one of our country's greatest innovations for \nindividual empowerment, economic growth, and jobs.\n  So extending the tax moratorium and protecting all types of broadband \ntechnology platforms puts this country one step closer to closing the \neconomic digital divide. The fact of the matter is--there are more \nAmericans empowered by the Internet today, primarily because the \nFederal policy of the United States has consciously allowed Internet \ninnovators, entrepreneurs, and consumers to remain free from \nburdensome, onerous taxation and unnecessary regulation.\n  I am honored that the majority of my colleagues in the Senate and the \nHouse have agreed to preserve this policy for another 4 years with the \npassage of S. 150. I thank all for their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11671-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11671-S11674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BROADBAND AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I would now like to discuss the exciting \nchanges that have taken place over the last 8 years in the \ntelecommunications industry, in particular with regard to broadband \nInternet technologies.\n  As many of us know, the 1996 Telecommunications Act was the first \nmajor overhaul of the communications policy in over 60 years. Since the \npassage of that law, remarkable changes have occurred in the \ntechnologies used to deliver telecommunications services. Some of these \nchanges may be products of the 1996 act. However, many are due to the \ntremendous explosion of new and advanced broadband technologies.\n  Specifically, the Internet or digital technologies are replacing the \nslower legacy communications networks with multiple high-speed \nbroadband platforms. For example, DSL, cable modems, 3G wireless, WiFi, \nultrawide band, satellites, broadband over power lines, are all \nadvanced communications networks delivering the same services and many \nmore services, not just data, not just voice, but also video.\n  Broadband is widely considered the future of communications because \nit enhances the consumers' experience on the Internet and will have a \ntremendous impact on our country's economy.\n  By 2006, economists at the Brookings Institution estimate that \nwidespread high-speed broadband Internet access would increase our \nnational gross domestic product by $500 billion annually.\n  The Internet and the broadband revolution are opening up a whole new \nworld of opportunity that did not exist prior to the Telecommunications \nAct of 1996. By almost any measure, consumers are better off and have \nmore choices now than ever before. These advancements have actually \noutpaced the laws and especially outpaced the economic regulations \ngoverning the communications industry because new Internet-enabled \nservices do not easily fit into the stovepipe regulatory model of the \n1996 act.\n\n  Unfortunately, the regulatory treatment of a given broadband provider \ndepends on the particular platform that provider uses to offer their \nservice. DSL providers are regulated entirely different from wireless \nbroadband providers or cable modem service providers. All of these \nplatforms deliver the same service--broadband Internet access. Yet all \nare regulated completely different from the other.\n  This type of regulatory regime picks technology winners and losers, \ncreating, in my view, a competitive advantage for certain technology \nplatforms over others. A number of my colleagues have called to revisit \nand potentially rewrite the telecommunications law, and I commend them \nfor their leadership on these issues.\n  I believe any rewrite of the telecommunications law must take into \naccount the transformative and positive impact broadband technologies \nhave on the future of communications.\n  In considering what the next Telecommunications Act should look like, \nI am guided by a few foundational principles.\n  First, we should favor innovation and freedom over regulation. I call \nmyself a commonsense Jeffersonian conservative. I trust free people, \nfree enterprise, and free markets to allow them to innovate and create \nopportunities for all Americans to advance, compete, and succeed. \nNowhere is this more true than with the Internet.\n  Restraining from regulating the economics of Internet applications \nhas served consumers well with the advances in the Internet \ntechnologies, such as voice-over-IP or voice-over-Internet protocols. \nEntrepreneurs are a Web site away from offering phone services better \nthan those offered by traditional telephone providers.\n  Virtually every consumer with broadband Internet access can now \nchoose among potentially hundreds of telephone service providers. \nInternet applications are bringing new competition to old markets which \nmeans more innovation, lower prices, and higher quality of service for \nconsumers who also can easily move to any other vendor if they get \ndissatisfied with any of those providers.\n  As elected leaders, we should ensure that our policies embrace and \nencourage this type of innovation and continued advancement.\n  Second principle: Support a competitive level playing field over \nfragmentation and ditches. As a former Governor of Virginia, I am an \nardent supporter and believer in the principles of federalism. Our \nFounders, though, wisely realized, when constructing our Constitution, \nthe importance of a coherent national policy regarding matters \naffecting interstate commerce.\n  Certainly, one of the great attributes of the Internet is that it is \nnot limited by the boundaries of States or local governments. It is \nactually not even limited by the boundaries of countries. By its \nstructure and unique architecture, it is clearly, though, interstate \ncommerce and, indeed, international commerce.\n  I am reluctant to support policies that encourage the fragmentation \nof telecommunications regulation to State and local authorities, \nespecially as communications transition to a digital format.\n  Third, and last, let's make sure we keep it clear and keep it \ncertain. One of my biggest concerns with the 1996 Telecommunications \nAct is that it has brought forward a tremendous amount of litigation \nand legal uncertainty. This ongoing litigation and regulatory \nuncertainty has slowed the deployment and potentially stifled the \nadvancement of future high-speed broadband networks. Any revision to \nthe 1996 Telecommunications Act should contain clear, simple, coherent \nlegislative principles that provide legal certainty and regulatory \nclarity for business models and also for the capital investment \ndecisionmakers.\n  It has been the policy of the United States to promote the continued \ndevelopment and deployment of the Internet. The broadband revolution is \nbringing tomorrow's communications and commerce tools to more and more\n\n[[Page S11672]]\n\nAmericans every day. These new opportunities for consumers are also \nproviding new opportunities for our Nation's economy in terms of job \ncreation, productivity gains, and innovation.\n  It is my great hope that as the Senate considers these important \nissues and potential telecommunications reform next year, we do so \nmindful that consumers are enjoying more choices, better value, and \nmore personalized products in the Internet age than ever before, \nprimarily due to the advances of broadband technologies.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand strong for freedom, for clarity of \npurpose, and we will see more investment and more jobs. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues for these exciting advancements in the \nfuture. We must keep adapting, keep innovating, and keep improving for \nthe competitive benefit of the American people.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I salute the Senator from Virginia for \nhis leadership on telecommunications policy. Over the last 2 years, I \ndo not know any Senator in the Chamber, other than the Senator from \nVirginia, who has been more active, who has been better informed, and \nwho has been more vigorous on the principles in which he believes. He \nwas the leading Senator in advancing a compromise. It was his \nlegislation, S. 150, which a number of us cosponsored, which the House \nhas accepted, which has taken the next step in how we deal with the so-\ncalled Internet tax moratorium.\n  I was glad to have a chance to hear his remarks today as he talked \nabout that and as he looks to the future, and I would like to add my \nown thoughts because during this past 2 years we have had pretty \nvigorous debate as we have made our way toward a compromise. It has \nbeen a debate in the best traditions of the Senate. We have had it on \nthe floor. On one occasion the Senator from Virginia and I took our \npoints of view to a forum off campus, so to speak, went over to the \nHeritage Foundation and had a debate. In that debate, we actually \nlearned some things from each other, which shows that when Senators \ndebate and speak, we find some points of common agreement. I think that \ndebate itself helped lead toward the compromise we have made.\n  I believe the compromise, S. 150, of which Senator Allen is the \nprinciple sponsor, is important. No. 1, it is temporary, not permanent. \nThis is a fast-moving technology and field. As Senator Allen pointed \nout in his remarks, the 1996 Telecommunications Act in some ways is \nobsolete today because high-speed Internet access, or broadband as we \ncall it, was barely even known in 1996. It is no insult to the Members \nof the Senate to say I doubt if many Senators ever heard of it in 1996, \nbecause most Americans had not heard of high-speed Internet access. \nVery few people were using it.\n  So the legislation did not contemplate this rapidly growing new \ntechnology we have. That is one reason why I felt in the debate that it \nwas good to have a temporary, rather than a permanent, moratorium on \nwhat States may do about applying their taxes to Internet access so \nthat the Commerce Committee of the Congress could consider a long-range \npermanent policy.\n  S. 150, which has passed this year, this compromise, as the Senator \nfrom Virginia said, allows States to continue collecting taxes on the \nInternet and to continue to do so for 2 to 4 years, depending on the \ntype of access.\n  One other important thing it does is it makes clear that State and \nlocal governments can continue to collect taxes on telephone services \neven if telephone calls are made over the Internet.\n  Now, that is a very important development. Most observers believe \nthat certainly most businesses--and maybe most all of us--will soon be \nmaking our telephone calls over the Internet. That is a wonderful \nopportunity and a great advance. I believe there is general consensus \namong all of us who debated this issue over the last 2 years that in \norder to make sure that happens, the Government needs as much as \npossible to get out of the way. That means a different kind of \nregulation than we now have for what we call traditional telephone \nservices, the plain old telephone.\n  Where I was concerned about the legislation that was going through \nthe Congress was not about whether we should lighten up on regulation--\nI believe we should--the question was whether from Washington, DC, we \nshould tell State and local governments that they may not apply the \nsame sales taxes and other use taxes to telephone calls made over the \nInternet that they apply to other telephone services. We did not change \nthat with the temporary legislation we passed this year, but it is \nbound to be a big subject of discussion in the new Congress.\n\n  Now here is why it is so important: I believe gradually we are making \nit more difficult for State and local governments to do the things we \nwant them to do. The Senator from Virginia and I are both former \nGovernors. We know many of the things Americans want most from their \ngovernment, they want from their State and local government. They do \nnot want decisions made up here. So one of my goals is to make sure we \ndo no harm to State and local governments while at the same time we are \ntrying to make sure we do no harm to this exciting new technology, \nbroadband, high-speed Internet access.\n  My fear was we might unwittingly in this legislation stop Texas, \nTennessee, or Florida, for example, States that have no State income \ntax, from using their sales tax on telecommunications services. Last \nyear, Texas collected $1 billion on sales tax on telecommunications \nservices. Florida collected about $1 billion. Tennessee, according to \nthe Department of Revenue, collected $361 million on sales taxes on \ntelecommunications services.\n  Now, not all of that is threatened by telephone calls over the \nInternet that might not be subject to the same taxation, but gradually, \nand it may come very rapidly--actually, we hope it comes rapidly--and \nif people move to this new technology, make their telephone calls over \nthe Internet, and suddenly the Texas State budget has a $1 billion hole \nin it or a $750 million hole or a $500 million hole, what do they do \nabout it? Well, they raise tuitions at the University of Texas or \nUniversity of Tennessee, they reduce services, or they raise other \ntaxes.\n  So my primary reason for becoming involved in the Internet tax \ndebate, so-called, was to try to make sure we did not do here what I \nnever did like when I was a Governor, which was to look up to \nWashington and see Members of Congress coming up with a good idea, \npassing it, taking credit for it, and sending the bill to me when I was \nGovernor. I did not like that.\n  My whole point was if we are going to stop States from collecting a \nsource of revenue they are now collecting, then we should pay the bill \nfrom Washington. In other words, that is an unfunded Federal mandate, \nin my opinion. We did not get to that problem because we reached a \ncompromise for now, but that is the debate coming up in the future.\n  Will we take some action in the name of making it easier for high-\nspeed Internet access that does real, serious harm to State and local \ngovernments by depriving them of billions of dollars of revenue, which \nin turn could cause the sales tax in Blunt County, TN, to go up, or the \nproperty tax to go up or, heaven forbid, Florida, Texas, or Tennessee \nto have to put in a new State income tax because Washington has told us \nwe cannot have a sales tax on telecommunications services and we still \nlike to have universities, parks, roads, and the other services States \nare supposed to provide.\n  So now how do we go from where we are today, which Senator Allen has \nhelped to craft a compromise we have all supported, and which is a very \nexcellent piece of legislative work by him and by others, and what is \nthe next step? He has offered a few suggestions about \ntelecommunications in general. Let me reiterate a single suggestion I \nhave about this specific issue about whether State and local \ngovernments will be permitted to tax telephone calls made over the \nInternet.\n\n  I would like once more to encourage the Governors, the mayors, and \nthe county executives to meet with the telecommunications industry and \nsuggest to us in the Congress a way to do\n\n[[Page S11673]]\n\nthis. This is a highly technical subject. It has many moving parts. \nThis is not the best place to come up with a complex reaction to a \ncomplex problem. We would like to see some options, or at least I \nwould.\n  The option I would like to see would have basically two parts. One \nwould be lighten up the regulation on high-speed Internet access. There \nis a broad consensus about that. But do it in a way that does no harm \nto State and local governments, that does not have Senator Feinstein \nfrom California standing up in the back with letters from 130 cities \nand counties saying this could take away 5 to 15 percent of their local \ntax base. I do not think we need to go through that again. I think we \nneed to find a way to do no harm to high-speed Internet access. Let it \nflourish. Let it grow. Let it move. And do no harm to State and local \ngovernments. Those are the principles.\n  I understand there may be some discussions already beginning to go on \nand I want to encourage those, and I pledge I will work with Senator \nAllen and others in this Chamber and State and local governments and \nthe telecommunications industry to try to get a commonsense exclusion \nso the technology can grow and so States can continue to have an \nadequate tax base to support universities, schools, and the other \nthings we expect from State and local governments.\n  The guidelines that I suggest for this discussion that I hope is \nbeing held outside the Halls of the Senate are, No. 1, separate the \nissue of taxation and regulation. Let's go ahead and figure out a way \nto lighten up regulation of high-speed Internet access. I think there \nis a broad consensus for that. Separate the issue of what do we do \nabout the fact that States and local governments are depending on these \nrevenues. What do we do about that? Second, I agree with the Senator \nfrom Virginia that our goal should be simplicity, simplicity both in \nregulation and in any rules about taxation.\n  Finally, I believe that a goal should be, in addition to simplicity--\ncertainty. If you are in business, you want some certainty. If you are \na State treasurer, you want some certainty. You have budgets to make \nup. So we need some certainty. We do not need a situation where \nthousands and thousands of local jurisdictions tax new \ntelecommunications technology in such a confusing way that it creates \nuncertainty, litigation, and lots of paperwork and slows down the \neconomy. We fail if we have that. In searching for simplicity, there is \nno need for us to create an unfunded Federal mandate that tells State \nand local governments they have to give up part of their tax base \nwithout reimbursing them for it.\n  While we can debate it at another day, I do not believe that high-\nspeed Internet access needs a Federal subsidy or State subsidy. It is \nthe fastest growing new technology we have seen. It is growing faster \nthan the cell phone did at this stage of its development.\n  We are talking about an exciting new technology. We are talking about \nreal dollars. We are talking about a bipartisan disagreement and a \nbipartisan consensus that we have been able to come to this year about \nwhat to do, at least temporarily. For those who say the Senate is not \ncapable of working in a bipartisan way, I think they are wrong because \nwe have had bipartisan agreement and we have disagreement, and we have \nhad some bipartisan agreement.\n  I see the Senator from New Hampshire is also in the Chamber, and the \nSenator from Delaware. I have some other remarks I would like to make, \nbut I imagine they both would like to say something about this same \nsubject.\n  My further remarks have to do with other legislation. What I would \nlike to do at this stage is to yield the floor in just a minute and \nlisten to what they have to say, in the hopes that we may be advancing \ntoward some consensus. Now that we have a consensus about what to do \nfor the next 2 to 4 years, maybe we can take some steps about advancing \ntoward a consensus about the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire \nis recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking Senator \nAlexander, as well as Senators Wyden and Allen, who have worked on the \nconsensus legislation that was touched on in earlier remarks, a final \npiece of the legislation necessary to ensure that we do not tax \nInternet access.\n  The reason we do this, the reason we think this legislation is so \nimportant is, first and foremost, because these are national and global \nbroadband networks. They are interstate and global in nature. I believe \nthe responsibility for both determining the tax status and the \nregulatory status of these networks falls on the Federal Government. I \ndo believe taxation is merely an extension of regulatory power, in that \nit has the ability to shape the playing field, to weight the \ncompetition among ideas or technology in one direction or another. As \nwas said many years ago, when you tax something, you get less of it. If \nthat is not a form of regulation, I don't know what is.\n  The issue of broadband voice, of Internet protocol voice services was \nalso mentioned. I do want to be clear, at least in expressing an \nopinion if not declaring it absolute fact: The Internet tax legislation \nthat we passed was silent on this issue. It doesn't allow or disallow, \nper se, the taxation on Internet protocol, IP voice service, or \nbroadband voice service. But what it does is protect Internet access, \naccess to that broadband pipe from taxation.\n  We will discuss and debate in greater detail in the coming year the \nnature of these broadband voice services--broadband access, spectrum \nregulations--as we develop telecom legislation in 2005, beginning with \nhearings and work in the Commerce Committee. I think in many ways the \nFCC has already set the direction for this process in a recent ruling \nthat they made, which was to say that broadband voice services using \nthe Internet protocol are interstate in nature and that they should be \nregulated on a national level for many of the reasons that Senator \nAlexander has outlined. We want clarity; we want consistency; we don't \nwant it weighted toward one technology or another.\n  There are lots of ways to get access to these national and global \nbroadband networks. You can get them through wireless systems, DSL, \ncable. You can get them even through satellite. And there are probably \nmore technologies that will come to give customers and consumers \naccess. We want to be careful that we do not distort the marketplace of \nideas, either through subsidies for one form of technology relative to \nanother--which was mentioned by Senator Alexander--or regulatory \nregimes on one form of broadband network relative to another.\n  It will be a challenging debate. I think Senator Alexander has been \nvery helpful in this debate in bringing the perspective of a Governor. \nI think we do need to be very sensitive to the rights and the powers of \nthe States. But where we have something that is interstate, national, \nor global in nature, then I think it does make sense to try to find a \nlight regulatory touch, as Senator Alexander has described, but one \nthat is clearly defined and that will keep the competitive playing \nfield as open and vigorous as possible. If we have a strong economy, \nthen I think the governments at the local level, the State level, and \nthe Federal level will do fine so far as revenue collection is \nconcerned.\n  I look forward to participating in this debate with other members on \nthe Commerce Committee and all of the Members in the Senate in order to \nmake sure that we have a regulatory system that is designed for, so to \nspeak, the 21st century, these new technologies, and not just take a \nregulatory system that was designed for a copper circuit switch phone \nsystem, invented by Alexander Graham Bell--don't take that regulatory \nsystem and try to force it on emerging technologies for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while my colleagues, Senator Alexander and \nSenator Allen, are still in the Chamber, I want to express to each of \nthem my own gratitude for their hard work to try to forge a compromise \non an issue upon which some folks said we were not going to find common \nground. But ultimately we did. They are to be commended for that.\n  I see we have been joined by Senator Burns from Montana. I would say \nto him, thank you as well.\n\n[[Page S11674]]\n\n  Several people who are not here have been very much involved in this \nissue, including Senator Wyden of Oregon and a handful of other former \nGovernors who serve now in the Senate--among them, Senator Voinovich of \nOhio and Senator Bob Graham. A couple of former mayors who serve here \nas well worked on this issue, and this includes the former mayor from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, and a former mayor from a little town \ncalled Gillette, WY, a fellow named Enzi, who have all been involved in \nthis, along with Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota.\n  We shared goals and we shared a number of the same objectives. None \nof us were interested in taxing access to the Internet. None of us \nwanted to inhibit its growth. But at the same time, none of us were \ninterested in undercutting the ability of State and local governments \nto raise revenues to fund their own programs.\n  As a former Governor, as a former chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation, as are Senators Alexander and Voinovich, I never liked it \nvery much when the Federal Government would tell my State or any other \nState what to do but not to provide the revenue, the wherewithal to do \nthat thing that was being ordered.\n  I never liked it when the Federal Government undercut my State or any \nState's ability to raise revenues to pay for programs that we deemed \nnecessary and not provide the revenues to offset that loss.\n  I think in the end we have come out with a compromise that is not \neverything that those of us who are former Governors and mayors who \nworked with Senator Alexander and myself wanted, and certainly all that \nwas sought by Senators Allen and Wyden. Having said that, I believe we \nhave ended up in a very good place. Senator McCain is not here today, \nat least in the Chamber at this moment, and I thank him for bringing us \nto common ground on this issue.\n  We have passed a compromise that I think sends a good message, that \nmay have applicability to other issues. And there are a whole lot of \nissues that we have considered this year, certainly that we will be \nconsidering next year, where we generally share the same goals, but for \nsome reason we do not--and maybe it is the lack of trust, the lack of \ninterpersonal relationships to be able to work through our differences \nto get fairly close to, at the end, the goals that we share, to \nlegislation that reflects the goals that we share. In this case we did \nit. And for all who have had a hand in fashioning what I think is a \nmost acceptable compromise and a good ending, I just want to say well \ndone.\n  The Commerce Committee will now move to new leadership beginning in \nJanuary. I presume the leader, the chairman, will be Senator Stevens, \nand the ranking Democrat will be Senator Inouye. They have as close a \npersonal bond as I think any two Senators across the aisle who serve in \nthe Senate. I think that bodes well as they and their committee look \ndown the road to what further changes we need to make, again, to deny \nthe ability to have access to the Internet, make sure we don't inhibit \nthe growth of the Internet and all it can do for our economy, and \nfinally making sure we are fair to State and local governments. It is \nnot an easy thing to do, but in this instance I think we have done \nquite well for State and local governments, and industry hasn't fared \ntoo badly either.\n  With that having been said, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should advise that we are in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, last Saturday, just 7 days ago, I was in \nCape Town, South Africa, for a conference sponsored by the Chicago \nCouncil on Foreign Relations. With me were my colleagues, Senator Susan \nCollins, Congresswoman Barbara Lee from the State of California, and we \nhad an opportunity to visit an AIDS clinic, a clinic that is funded by \nthe Global Fund. It is an area known as West Cape, and it is an \nextremely poor area. Many people are infected.\n  South Africa may be the most devastated country on that continent \nwhen it comes to the disease of AIDS. To think that 25 percent of the \nmen and women in the South African military are infected with AIDS, to \nthink that most of the major employers in companies find that at least \none-fourth of their workforce is infected, is an indication of the \nreach of this terrible disease.\n  We went to this clinic because something historic was happening \nthere. Because of the Global Fund and because of contributions from \ncountries such as the United States, for the first time we are \nproviding AIDS pills, ARV therapies to people who are infected. What \nthat means is that for some of the poorest people on Earth, they will \nreceive a few pills which, if they take them dutifully each day, they \ncan live. And if they do not receive the pills, or don't take them, \nthey will surely die. Think about that moment when they first heard of \nthe possibility that they might be on the list to be saved with these \ndrugs.\n  So we went to this clinic where they are measuring the rate of the \ninfection of these poor people, and if they are far enough along with \ntheir infection, where their life is threatened, they qualify. They \nwaited on benches in a crowded room silently for hours, literally for \nhours for a chance to be examined in the hopes that they would receive \nthese pills.\n  Outside this clinic was a little dirt playground, just the most basic \nthing, filled with children. The kids were playing with everything they \ncould find, stones and sticks and old rubber tires, just trying to \nwhile away the time together while they waited for their parents who \nwere listening and waiting to be counseled to find out if they would be \nallowed to live or die. The children had no idea what was going on. \nThey are just little kids. Some of them may be HIV-positive, too. But \nwe walked by this playground, and the kids looked up at this delegation \nin their suits and ties walking through, and they looked at us and they \nwaved, and we waved back, and I thought: I am going to go over and say \nhi to the kids.\n  I no sooner took two steps toward these children when they left the \nplayground, 30 or 40 of them, and gathered around me hugging me. And \nthen, as they were hugging me, these little toddlers, these kids, \nspontaneously started singing the African national anthem. You could \nnot script that. It sounds like a scene from a movie. It is real life. \nIt happened a week ago. And in this clinic in West Cape, a miracle is \noccurring. The United States, because of its caring and compassion, has \nreached out through the Global Fund to give these children the chance \nthat they will grow up with a parent. And for many children in Africa \nthere is no chance--12 million AIDS orphans on that continent, more \ninfections on the continent of Africa than any other place on Earth.\n  We know how bad it is. We know it is getting worse. Take any minute \nthat I speak in the Chamber, and in that 1-minute period of time, \nacross the world 6 people will die from AIDS, and 10 more will become \ninfected. So no matter what we are doing, as good as it is, we are \napproaching this with steady steps going after this disease and \nepidemic while it races away from us infecting more people than we can \npossibly save with the resources we are putting into it. Stephen Lewis \nis a special envoy for the United Nations for HIV/AIDS in Africa, and \nhe said, ``Never in human history have so many died for so little \nreason.'' Then he went on to say, speaking to me and to all of us, \n``You have a chance to alter the course of that history. Can there be \nany task more noble?'' This is the moral challenge of our generation.\n\n  Mr. President, 60 years from now, 100 years from now, people will \nlook back and judge us by what we have done with the global AIDS \nepidemic. Questions have been asked for almost six decades about what \nthe world did in response to the Holocaust. We will be asked by future \ngenerations: What did you do about this epidemic reaching Holocaust \nproportions and beyond? In 2002, the countries that came together to \nform the Global Fund said we are going to fight AIDS and malaria and \ntuberculosis, and all the countries committed some $3 billion to almost\n\n[[Page S11675]]\n\n300 programs to go after those diseases in nearly 130 different \ncountries. Since the beginning, the United States has been involved and \nwe have said for every dollar that we contribute, we want $2 from the \nrest of the world.\n  In some years we have fallen short. In some years the rest of the \nworld has fallen short. But we need to continue to make a contribution.\n  Now, what troubles me is this: Last year, as a nation, we contributed \n$547 million to the Global Fund. This year we will contribute less. The \ndisease is not under control. The disease is growing faster than our \ncontributions toward ending it. This year if we are lucky we will \ncontribute $438 million--far short of last year's contribution. And the \nGlobal Fund tells us that they need $551 million from the United \nStates. They will find matching funds 2 to 1 from around the world, and \nthey have plenty of projects just like the one I described to you.\n  In that West Cape clinic right now 550 victims of HIV/AIDS are \nreceiving the therapy that keeps them alive every day--550.\n  The universe of those who are eligible is 4,000, to give you an idea. \nAs we contribute to the Global Fund, we are scratching the surface of \nwhat this disease is doing to the world around us. As we reduce our \ncontributions to this Global Fund, it limits our ability to save \npeople.\n  I have spoken, of course, about HIV/AIDS. The challenge of malaria is \njust as alarming. The Global Fund has been financing the treatment of \nover 30 million people for over 5 years, a huge increase from the \n10,000 people currently treated with new drugs. They need money to do \nit. People die from malaria as they do from so many other things.\n  In addition, we have to understand that the fight against \ntuberculosis is one we can win but one we must assume our \nresponsibility for.\n  We need to make certain when the supplemental appropriations bills \ncome before Congress, as they are likely to in the next several months, \nthat we revisit our contribution to the Global Fund, not just for those \nkids in Africa but for ourselves. That life lost in Africa may seem so \ndistant and removed from our own lives but in some ways we are \nconnected. We are all God's children. We all believe this Creator put \nus on Earth for a purpose, and that purpose is to care for the less \nfortunate of our brethren.\n  At the International AIDS Conference in Bangkok last July, Nelson \nMandela, who is probably one of the greatest living people, declared:\n\n       History will surely judge us harshly if we do not respond \n     with all the energy and resources that we can bring to bear \n     in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\n  Nelson Mandela is right. History will stand in judgment of the bill \nwe pass today, the supplemental bill that will come, and the resolve of \nthis Congress and this administration to make sure that we continue to \nlead the world in this historic humanitarian effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I say a few words about the legislation \npassed last night that we call IDEA, to help children with \ndisabilities.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which we have \nenacted is critical for the approximately 6.5 million children with \nspecial needs across the country, 125,000 of which I've in my home \nstate of Tennessee.\n  The bill makes a number of substantial reforms. I would like to \nhighlight two that I think are particularly important:\n  No. 1, the bill clarifies the definition of a highly qualified \nteacher, and\n  No. 2, the bill also creates a seamless early childhood program for \nchildren from birth until school age.\n  Research has shown that students taught by effective teachers greatly \noutperform those taught by ineffective teachers. That's why it is a \npriority for me to ensure that students have a highly qualified teacher \nin their classroom, especially special education students.\n  I am grateful language was included to clarify for schools what the \ndefinition of a highly qualified teacher means. This is particularly \nimportant for the 6,037 Certified Special Education teachers employed \nby Tennessee's public schools, especially for middle and high school \nteachers.\n  After the passage of No Child Left Behind, many middle and high \nschool special ed teachers were concerned that they would have to \nbecome highly qualified in every subject--reading, math, history, \nscience. The language in the Conference Report allows states to develop \na Highly Objective Uniform State System of Evaluation, HOUSSE, for \nspecial ed teachers teaching multiple core subjects. Teachers can also \nbe deemed highly qualified if they meet the educational requirements \nfor each subject under NCLB test or degree. This important flexibility \ngives states more options to determine what makes a special education \nhighly qualified so that we can keep veteran teachers in these \nclassrooms and enable new teachers to become highly qualified and \ndedicate their careers to these special children.\n  I am a strong supporter of early intervention to help children with \nspecial needs before they reach school age, so that when they enter \nschool they can succeed. I'm pleased by the changes to the Part C early \nintervention program included in the conference report. This program \nhas enabled millions of infants and toddlers with disabilities to enter \nschool with the skills they need to learn, grow and prosper. The bill \nbefore us today makes two needed changes to Part C.\n  First, it allows States to give parents the option of either (a) \nkeeping a child in the Part C program until reaching school age, or (b) \nhaving their child transferred to the pre-school program at age three. \nThis provides a comprehensive and fluid system of services for special \nneeds children from birth to school age.\n  Second, it provides incentive grants to States that choose to give \nparents that option. Under the conference report, 15% of appropriated \nfunds in excess of $460 million for Part C will be dedicated to these \nincentive grants.\n  In Tennessee, about 5,730 children participate in the Part C program. \nOne of these children is Kaylie, a little girl who was born with Down \nSyndrome. The hospital referred her family to the Kiwanis Center for \nChild Development for services as part of the Part C early childhood \nprogram. At the Kiwanis Center, Kaylie receives physical, occupational, \nand speech therapy--there is even a therapeutic pool. She is provided \nwith child care where she interacts with other children her age. All \nthese services are provided through various federal and state programs, \nbut the Part C program was the critical link that coordinated these \nprograms so she can receive them all at one site. Kaylie was only 8 \nmonths old when I told this story at our Senate HELP Committee mark-up \nof this bill; today she's about two years old. Under the current Part C \nsystem, when Kaylie turns 3 she will no longer be able to continue to \nreceive this seamless system of services at Kiwanis. She will have to \nattend the half-day pre-school program at the local elementary school. \nThat date is fast approaching. But the changes included in this \nConference Report, that we are about to ratify, will allow the state of \nTennessee to give Kaylie's family the option to stay in the Part C \nprogram and continue receiving services at the Kiwanis Center until she \ngoes to Kindergarten. Any fees that Kaylie's family currently pays they \nwill continue to pay. If Kaylie's family would like her to attend the \nlocal public school for pre-school they still will have the opportunity \nto send her. We ought to give her parents that choice, and I'm grateful \nwe're acting in time to make that possible.\n  This is one more example of the Senate working in a bipartisan way.\n  This is a complex bill. It affected 6.5 million children with special \nneeds across this country, and 125,000 of them were in Tennessee.\n  Again, I want to focus on two aspects of it, especially how it \naffects teachers and children and families all across the country.\n  First, it clarifies the definition of a highly qualified teacher. \nThat is important because of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Second, it allows children with special needs who are receiving \nservices in\n\n[[Page S11676]]\n\nthe community to continue to do that after age 3 all the way up to the \ntime they enter school. Today, those children may be provided one \nservice here and one service here and one service here. When they get \nto age 3, they suddenly have to go into a certain preschool program. \nThis gives more parents more choices, more flexibility, and it is a \ngreat advantage.\n  One very important aspect of the bill--it is the first thing I \nmentioned--is the definition of highly qualified teacher. This may not \nsound very important to people who aren't teachers with special needs \nchildren, but this has been a source of a lot of anxiety for teachers.\n  In elementary schools, in early grades, teachers teach a lot of \nsubjects. If you are certified to be an elementary school special needs \nteacher, then you can be a highly qualified teacher. But when you get \nto the middle school and high school level, you will be teaching \nspecial needs children in math, science, English, history, and \ngeography. The original legislation said a special needs teacher in \nShawnee, KS, or Fort Dodge, KS would have to be qualified in special \nneeds in English, in math, in science, history, and geography. That is \nquite a burden for a special needs teacher in high school in some \ndistricts. This legislation creates some flexibility. It creates a way \nfor States to look at this in a practical way, and says in middle \nschools and high schools across this country when teachers are teaching \nspecial needs children, we are going to come up with a commonsense way \nto make sure they are highly qualified because these children deserve \nthat, too, but to take into account the reality. We are talking about \nmaybe 100,000 teachers in the middle and high schools, maybe 15,000 or \n20,000 schools.\n  We have to be careful when we write a sentence about elementary and \nsecondary education in America. We are not the national school board, \nor at least we shouldn't be. We need to make sure it is practical and \nrealistic and gives as much flexibility as possible to communities and \nStates to come up with what actually works with an individual child in \nan individual classroom. This is one disappointment I have with the \nbill.\n  Senator Sessions from Alabama and I tried to change the effective \ndate of the definition of a highly qualified teacher for middle and \nhigh school. We said it ought to be a year from now. But the majority \nfelt this new requirement should go into effect in August of next year, \nwhich is 6 or 7 months from now. I think that is a mistake.\n  What has to happen is the President has to sign this bill in \nDecember. Then the U.S. Department of Education has to interpret its \nregulations--that is January or February. Then the States have to come \nup with their new, flexible ways of determining what ``highly qualified \nteacher'' is. Then the teachers have to read it. They have to perhaps \ndo some professional development. They have to become certified. And \nall of this has to be done by July or August.\n  This is the kind of thing that does not build support for the No \nChild Left Behind Act. I think it very important that we remember while \nwe may have a very good idea, we are not a national school board of the \nsmall school districts. This is a massive country with many different \nparts to it. We are dealing in this case with probably 100,000 \nteachers.\n  Overall, this is a very important bill and I am delighted to be a \npart of it. I commend especially Senators Gregg and Kennedy for their \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11676-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11676-S11677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE AMERICAN HISTORY AND CIVICS EDUCATION ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to discuss H.R. 5360, the \nAmerican History and Civics Act of 2004.\n  I support H.R. 5360, the American History and Civics Education Act of \n2004. The bill represents an important step forward in the teaching of \nthese critical subjects. The Senate acted last year on an earlier \nversion of this bill that I sponsored along with the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid. I introduced that bill in my Maiden Speech before the \nSenate, and we later voted 90-0 in support of its passage. The House \nhas now passed its version of the bill, under the leadership of \nCongressman Roger Wicker from Mississippi. Senate passage of the bill \ntoday will be the culmination of nearly two years of work on this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  National exams show that three-quarters of the nation's 4th, 8th and \n12th graders are not proficient in civics knowledge and one-third does \nnot even have basic knowledge, making them ``civic illiterates.''\n  Children are not learning about American history and civics because \nthey are not being taught it. American history has been watered down, \nand civics is too often dropped from the curriculum entirely.\n  It is time to put the teaching of American history and civics back in \nits rightful place in our schools so our children can grow up learning \nwhat it means to be an American. This act does precisely that. It \nestablishes Presidential Academies for Teachers of American History and \nCivics and Congressional Academies for Students of American History and \nCivics. Their purpose would be to inspire better teaching and more \nlearning of our history and way of government. The Secretary of \nEducation is authorized to provide grants to universities, libraries, \nmuseums, or other non-profits that demonstrate expertise in the core \nsubjects of history and civics and government. For example, the Mount \nVernon Ladies' Association, which operates and maintains the home of \nour first President, might apply to host an academy at their historical \nsite, focusing on the history of the founding of our nation and the \nprinciples upon which it was founded.\n  Additionally, the bill allows the Secretary of Education to provide \ngrants to the National History Day program, a year-long national \nprogram that trains teachers and sponsors a national competition among \njunior high and high school students, who produce dramatic \nperformances, imaginative exhibits, multimedia documentaries and \nresearch papers based on research related to an annual theme.\n  I want to extend my gratitude to the Senators who have supported the \nbill here in the Senate: Senators Frist, Reid, Gregg, Kennedy, Stevens, \nand Byrd, among many others. And I want to thank our colleagues in the \nHouse who worked so hard on the bill, including Congressmen Boehner, \nMiller, Castle, Woolsey, Blackburn, and especially Congressman Wicker \nwho was the lead sponsor.\n  A strong, bipartisan team of players stood up for the future of our \nchildren and this nation by working on this legislation. With Senate \npassage, today is a great victory for everyone working to improve the \nteaching of American history and civics so our children can grow up \nlearning what it means to be an American.\n  This bill will be coming, hopefully, before the Senate later today. \nIt passed the Senate unanimously last year. Now it has passed the House \nand is coming back in an amended and improved version. I believe it has \nfull support. The lead sponsor is the new Democratic leader of the \nSenate, Harry Reid. It is also sponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator \nByrd, who testified for the bill. Most of the Republican Senators have \ncosponsored it.\n  This is a bill very simply to put teaching of American history and \ncivics back into its rightful place--in schools where our children can \ngrow up learning what it means to become an American.\n  It takes a modest step to establish Presidential Academies for \nTeachers of American History and Civics in the summer and the \nCongressional Academies for Students of American History and Civics. \nThey are modeled after the very successful Governor's Schools that are \nin many States across the country where students and sometimes teachers \ngo for 2 weeks or 4 weeks to learn particular subjects.\n  The reason for it is that high school seniors in the United States \nmake the lowest scores of any subject on U.S. history. The lowest \nscores of any subject, according to the National Assessment for \nEducational Progress of America, for high school seniors are on U.S. \nhistory. That is absolutely disgraceful.\n  Here we are a nation at war, our principles are being attacked, and \nwe are not teaching our children those principles. Here we are a nation \nthat celebrates itself for being one for many with more new Americans \ncoming than\n\n[[Page S11677]]\n\never in our history, and we are not teaching what it means to be an \nAmerican.\n  You don't get to be an American by the color of your skin or where \nyou come from. You get to be an American by understanding what we \nbelieve in. The common school itself was created 150 years ago, \naccording to the late president of the American Federation of Teachers, \nAlbert Shanker. He said the public school was created to help immigrant \nchildren learn the three Rs, and what it means to be an American, with \na hope they would go home and teach their parents. The civic purpose of \nthe public school is being fundamentally ignored in many parts of our \ncountry and this is one small step in that direction.\n  I am delighted that a bipartisan group of Senators and House \nMembers--Mr. Boehner, Mr. Miller, Representative Blackburn from \nTennessee, and the principal sponsor, Roger Wicker of Mississippi--\nplayed a role. I thank them for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11677-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMERICAN BALD EAGLE COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I mention one other piece of \nlegislation that may have a chance of passing. At least I can report \nthere are now 68 U.S. Senators who have agreed to sponsor S. 2889 which \nwill celebrate the recovery and restoration of the American bald eagle \nby making $5- and $10- and 50-cent commemorative coins.\n  Very often these so called coin bills are especially parochial. That \nis why we are required to have 67 Senators agree before we do one; \nusually by practice, nearly 300 House Members. Well, 300 House Members \nhave agreed and nearly 70 Senators. That is because in 1782 the \nFounding Fathers established the bald eagle as the national emblem of \nthe United States. Since then, the bald eagle has come to represent the \nspirit of American freedom, democracy, and strength.\n  It is my hope before we finish our business today we will honor and \nprotect the symbol of America and cosponsor and enact the American Bald \nEagle Commemorative Coin Act.\n  One reason Senators have signed on is that the eagle has been roaming \nthe Halls with its handler, going into different offices. A number of \nSenators have called me from their office with the eagle perched in \nfront of them. The eagle is a very successful lobbyist for himself.\n  If we cannot get the commemorative coin enacted today before we \nadjourn, I am sure we will be able to do so early next year.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Ohio for \ngiving me an opportunity to conclude my remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had the great pleasure of sitting in \nthe Presiding Officer's chair yesterday when one of our colleagues said \ngoodbye, the distinguished minority leader. It was a very stirring and \nmoving speech about what this institution is all about.\n  I sat in the Senate when the senior Senator from Oklahoma said \ngoodbye after 20-something years in this institution. I was in the \nchair when the candidate for the Vice President of the United States \nsaid goodbye after serving one term in this institution.\n  It is pretty humbling, to understand how incredible it is to be part \nof this body and all the things that one can do.\n  I am standing right now to say thank you to a Member who is still \nserving, who I hope will serve for a long time, the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond. Sometimes we wait until folks leave until we \nexpress our deep appreciation for all they do and all they have \naccomplished. For me, I feel moved to do this for a little act of \nkindness, of help he gave some constituents of mine.\n  In the Omnibus bill we will vote on, hopefully, sometime this \nafternoon, there is $388 billion laid out to be spent in that bill. The \nvery last item of the 133 pages of the section that appropriates funds \nfor the Veterans Administration and HUD, had to do with two individuals \nfrom Minnesota, Brian and Eric Simon, to receive $200,000, to be split \nbetween them. That constitutes 1/20,000th of 1 percent of the \nallocations in that bill, but to those young men it is so important. \nLet me tell a little story about why it is important and who these \nyoung men are.\n  In 1983, Douglas Simon, the father of Brian and Eric Simon, served in \nthe Army National Guard at Fort Benning, GA. He was injured. He \nrequired emergency medical surgery. Mr. Simon's surgery was performed \nat Fort Benning, GA. As part of the surgery, a blood transfusion of \nnine units was required. The blood he received was not screened and \ncontained the AIDS/HIV virus.\n\n  In 1984, Mr. Simon married Nancy and they had three children \ntogether, Brian, Eric, and Candace. Before the virus took their lives, \nand ultimately the lives of Candace, the daughter, and the mom Nancy, \nthe Simons were a smalltown American family: hopeful, conventional, \nmeat and potatoes, church every Sunday, Roman Catholic family with a \nVirgin Mary statute in the front yard. Old Glory hung on the flagpole \nevery clement day.\n  I am reading from and reflecting on an article written in 1994 about \nthe Simons.\n  Doug and Nancy had met in high school. They got married after they \ngraduated. He joined the Minnesota Army National Guard out of high \nschool. He had an accident and underwent surgery. Nancy was older than \na year by Doug and grew up close by, a place called New Prague, MN, 1 \nof 11 children. She was quiet, timid.\n  When she and Doug first got married, they dreamed of having lots of \nkids. The oldest son is Brian. He was 10 in 1994 and he is 19 now. I \ngot to know him. He was born before Doug and Nancy were infected. Eric \nescaped the virus, although he was born after Nancy had been infected.\n  They were just regular kids, lived a regular life, with a mom and a \ndad. They had a young sister, Candy. Candy was diagnosed with AIDS when \nshe was 18 months old, in 1989. The doctors had treated her for a \nnumber of conditions. She had persistent diarrhea. She failed to \nthrive. She had countless CAT scans and blood tests. She learned how to \npush the plunger of a syringe as the myriad of medications increased. \nShe went through a lot. She was, as her brothers tell me, a mischievous \nlittle girl, hamming it up, wearing Elton John-like oversized \nsunglasses, or a poster-child angel, always a mommy's girl.\n  Three months before preschool started, she complained about stomach \npains. You know why it hurts? Because I have a bad tummy.\n  For her doctors, it was a little more puzzling than that, and x rays \nrevealed spots on her colon the size of chicken pox. She suffered \ngreatly. She suffered greatly. I almost tear up as I reflect on what \nthis young girl went through. She died on June 25, wrapped in her mom's \narms. She was a couple days shy of her sixth birthday. The mother also \ncontracted AIDS and went through great pain and great suffering. Mom \nultimately died of AIDS.\n  I got to know the family. My predecessor, Senator Wellstone, worked \nin trying to do something for them.\n  The VA provides health care to some 2,800 veterans who have \ncontracted AIDS in the manner that Mr. Simon contracted AIDS. They \nprovide disability compensation to veterans with AIDS and death and \neducation benefits to the families of veterans who have succumbed to \nAIDS. In this respect, the VA treats AIDS like other service-connected \nhealth conditions.\n  But in an important way, AIDS is different. It is not like other \nconnected services; it can be transmitted to the spouses and unborn \nchildren of servicemen. That is what happened here with Doug Simon. By \nlaw, the VA cannot provide any sort of benefits for illnesses \ncontracted by these family members.\n  Last year, I introduced S. 1509, the Eric and Brian Simon Act. I \nthought it was a starting point to give a fair deal to veterans and \ntheir families with AIDS to provide a one-time $100,000 benefit to \nveterans who receive AIDS as a result of a blood transfusion from the \nservice-related injury. For spouses who contracted AIDS from contact \nwith the infected veteran, and offspring of the veteran or spouse \ninfected with AIDS at birth, in the event that the veteran or family \nmember has already\n\n[[Page S11678]]\n\nsuccumbed, compensation would be given to survivors.\n  That is what has happened here. Douglas Simon is still alive. He is \nwheelchair-bound, and he suffers from AIDS and AIDS-related conditions, \nbut mom and Candy are gone.\n  We could not get the bill through. We worked hard. I went to my \nfriend and colleague. We actually had a hearing on this, thanks to the \ngoodness and magnificence of Senator Specter. It was an opportunity for \nMr. Simon and the boys to come forward and explain what happened. We \nwere not able to move the bill forward, but I met with my friend, \nSenator Bond, champion of the VA/HUD appropriations committees and laid \nout this story, this great tragedy of two young men whose lives have \nbeen just so excruciatingly painful but not as painful as what their \nlittle sister suffered, not as painful as what their mom suffered. Why \nI am so moved by this issue is perhaps because I have a sister who died \nfrom AIDS. I know what this is about, and I know the great pain.\n\n  So my colleague, Senator Bond, said: We have to try to figure out a \nway to help. So in the very last portion of the $388 billion bill, \nthere is a provision to provide this $100,000 benefit for these two \nindividuals.\n  In terms of the scope of this bill, this is a little nothing. But in \nterms of two kids from Minnesota, who have been through so much, whose \ndad served this country and suffered such great pain, this is \nsomething.\n  We work on a lot of things in this body. We deal at times with \nmillions and billions of dollars. I have sat with my colleague, Senator \nTalent, to my right, and at different points we talk about millions or \ntens of millions of dollars, and it gets almost abstract. It gets \nalmost so impersonal at times. But the ability to help one family, to \ntouch that one life, to make a difference in that life, to put a smile \non their face, to say we are doing our best to correct an injustice, \nsomething that went wrong, to be able to deliver on that is very \nmeaningful. It is very special.\n  As I look at what has come out of that Omnibus bill, and with this \nprovision, it certainly has made we very proud to serve in this body. \nIt has made me appreciative of the kindness and the consideration of my \nsenior colleagues, such as Senator Bond, and I must say his staff \nmember, Jon Kamarck, who worked on this legislation.\n  We often wait until folks say their goodbye, and we hear very moving \nand very stunning reflections on lives of service and what it means to \nbe a part of this magnificent institution, the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world, the U.S. Senate. I am humbled to be here, I am \nthankful to be here, and I am deeply appreciative of the actions and \nthe conscience and the heart and the ability of my colleagues, and in \nthis particular case of the chairman of the Appropriations VA-HUD \nsubcommittee, the senior Senator from Missouri.\n  I just wanted to take this time to say thanks, to say it on the \nRecord, to say it very loud and clear, to speak for two young Minnesota \nmen who will be getting a little something back. You cannot take away \nand compensate for all the pain and all the suffering, but you can show \nthat we care, and in this body we do care. I am honored to be part of \nthis body.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen).

Mr. President, on Wednesday of this week, by unanimous \nconsent, the Senate adopted S. Con. Res. 146, which made slight \nmodifications to S. 150, the Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act.\n  I am pleased that the House passed S. 150 with the Senate changes, \nthereby clearing the legislation for President Bush's signature. It is \nlong overdue.\n  This action ensures that Internet access will remain free from \ntaxation, a policy that has existed since 1998, when, as Governor of \nOhio and president of the National Governors Association, I helped \nnegotiate the first moratorium.\n  I rise to commend my colleagues in the House and the Senate for \nresolving this issue in a bipartisan manner. Just over a year ago, the \nSenate became engaged in a spirited debate over the future of the \nInternet tax moratorium.\n  The sponsors of S. 150 argued that an expanded and permanent Internet \ntax moratorium was necessary to facilitate the growth of broadband \nInternet technologies.\n  On the surface, this sounded like a very reasonable position. In \nfact, after studying this issue, I realized that not all Internet \ntechnologies were being treated equally. For instance, some States \ntreated digital subscriber line, DSL, service, which uses phone lines \nto provide high-speed Internet access, as a ``telecommunications \nservice'' and therefore taxed it. Other States treated DSL Internet \naccess as an ``information service'' exempt from taxation. The \ninconsistent treatment of DSL service created a competitive \ndisadvantage for some Internet service providers, and I was willing to \nhelp level the playing field. However, several of my colleagues and I, \nincluding Senators Alexander, Carper, Feinstein, and Bob Graham of \nFlorida, had more serious concerns with S. 150.\n  Specifically, the CBO stated that the new and expanded definition of \n``Internet access'' in S. 150 was an unfunded mandate. Therefore, it \nwas believed that S. 150 would cause significant revenue losses for our \nState and local governments at a time when they were facing their worst \neconomic crisis in a generation.\n  In fact, the State of Ohio projected revenue losses of up to $350 \nmillion per year if the Commerce Committee's version of S. 150 passed \nthe Senate. As a former mayor and Governor, I knew my State could not \nafford to lose $350 million per year.\n  Fortunately, the debate on S. 150 was taken off the floor, where \nMembers and staff could try to close the chasm that separated the two \nsides. From November 2003 to April 2004, Members and staff worked \nfeverishly to find common ground. Both sides listened and worked in \ngood faith. Although it took a few months, I was pleased with the end \nresult.\n  The final bill, which passed the Senate on April 29, 2004, by a vote \nof 93 to 3, created a level playing field for Internet service \nproviders sought by the bill's sponsors, while at the same time \nprotected State and local governments from any immediate financial \nharm.\n  I was pleased that the original grandfather clause was extended for \nthe length of the moratorium because it provided protections to States, \nincluding Ohio, from losing further revenue.\n\n  Finally, the negotiated 4-year term of this legislation provides \nCongress with the necessary time to examine and understand how the new \nand expanded definition of ``Internet access'' affects both the growth \nof broadband Internet service and the revenue base of State and local \ngovernments. There has to be some balance.\n  Senator Stevens assures me that the Commerce Committee will closely \nreexamine these issues next Congress. In fact, we just talked about it \n10 minutes ago, about the fact he wants to move forward very \nexpeditiously to tackle this very complicated subject.\n  I commend the Presiding Officer, Senator Allen, and Senator Wyden for \ntheir leadership and commitment to this issue. Certainly, no two \nMembers of the Senate have spent more time on it. I also thank Senator \nMcCain for his patience and perseverance and willingness to offer a \nreasonable compromise upon which both sides could agree.\n  Additionally, I offer my thanks to Senators Alexander and Carper. \nTheir vision and steadfast determination to protect State and local \ngovernments is commendable, and I was proud to work so closely with my \ncolleagues and former Governors on this issue.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not thank the staff of the \nPresiding Officer and the staff of other Senators for their hard work \nand dedication. They really rolled up their sleeves and went to work. \nThey spent hours, countless hours, negotiating subtle yet important \nnuances in the legislative language in order to reach a compromise. \nSome of those nuances I had a very difficult time understanding, but \nthey understood them, thank God. The debate and end result of the \nInternet tax moratorium proves we can work through difficult and highly \ntechnical issues in a bipartisan manner.\n\n[[Page S11679]]\n\n  As the 108th Congress comes to a close, it is my sincere hope that \nthe same type of bipartisan spirit can be extended into the 109th \nCongress. It is vital that Members of this body work together to find \ncommon ground on issues that are important to our citizens, our States, \nour country, and, in some instances, the world.\n  I, for one, am looking forward to the challenges we face and am \nconfident we can solve the difficult issues for our day and leave a \nlasting legacy for our children, grandchildren, and future generations.\n       Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of \n     a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I got up here about an hour ago to pay \nhomage, to pay tribute to the senior Senator from Missouri, the \nchairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Committee, for his help in \nfinding a way to compensate two young men from Minnesota who have \nsuffered great personal tragedy. I must confess to a rookie mistake in \nnot recognizing at the same time a person without whose help, approval, \nand guidance this never would have happened, and that, of course, is \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens from \nAlaska. I know he was personally involved in this. In fact, he \ncommented to me this is one of the worst, most terrible circumstances, \nand we need to address it. He has pledged on a longer term basis, even \nnext year, to look at other situations like this so that we do the \nright thing.\n  I want to say on the record to my friend, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, how appreciative I am, how thankful I am, how \ngrateful I am for all he does, for his guidance in putting together a \nhuge package that deals with big things but doesn't forget little \nthings. Sometimes the little things are big things. In this case, this \nsomewhat little thing--little in the scope of a $388 billion bill, but \nbig for two young men who have suffered so much--would not have \nhappened without the help and the direction of the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. I wanted to make that clear on the record my \ndeep appreciation for his big heart, for his guidance and mentorship, \nhis concern, and ultimately his ability to get things done.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the \ncontinuing saga of Boston's big dig, an issue I have been involved in \nnow for many years. As usual, the news is not good.\n  As most of my colleagues know, the Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel \nProject in Boston, more commonly known as the big dig, apparently has \nsprung a leak or, more accurately, hundreds of leaks.\n  The two independent engineers brought in by the Massachusetts \nTurnpike Authority are still assessing the extent of the problem. But \nso far, over 400 leaks have been identified that they say could take a \ndecade--and millions of dollars--to fix. And on Wednesday, the Boston \nGlobe reported that documents obtained by the newspaper indicate there \nare ``thousands of ceiling and wall fissures, water damage to steel \nsupports and fireproofing systems, and overloaded drainage equipment''.\n  It comes as no surprise that all of the parties involved in this \nlatest scandal are holding each other, but not themselves, accountable. \nModern Continental Construction Company, which performed the work where \nthe 8-inch ``blow out'' leak occurred in the northbound section of the \nI-93 tunnel in September, believes the project's engineer, and joint \nventure of Bechtel Corporation and Parsons Brinckerhoff, is responsible \nbecause of faulty design work. The Turnpike Authority insists that even \nthough a senior agency official was notified of the leak problem in \n2001, the contractors and the project engineer are the responsible \nparties. The Governor believes that Turnpike Authority bears \nresponsibility and has asked for Chairman Amorello's resignation. With \nall the finger-pointing, I am concerned that the taxpayers could end up \nfooting at least part of the bill for repairs.\n  I do not intend to allow this to happen. The newly-discovered leaks \nare just another in a long list of costly failures in the continuing \nsaga of the bid dig.\n  The Central Artery Tunnel Project was conceived in 1981 and received \ninitial approval in 1985. Construction began in 1991 with a target \ncompletion date of December 1998. I repeat, the target completion date \nof the Central Artery Tunnel Project, known as the big dig, was \nDecember 1998. As I calculate, it is now 6 years later. Over the \nintervening years, the completion date slipped nearly 7 years. The \ncurrent forecast is for the project to be completed between May and \nNovember of 2005.\n  As delays for the project mounted over the years, the costs of the \nproject spiraled out of control. According to this chart, it was \nestimated in 1985 that the big dig would cost $2.6 billion. When the \nproject is finally completed next year, the total cost is projected to \nbe $14.6 billion, roughly 5.5 times the original estimate. That does \nnot count the newly discovered leaks and the repairs which, in the view \nof some, would take 10 years to fix.\n  We now know that billions of the cost overruns are attributable to \nmistakes and deliberate misstatements by the project managers. We have \nhad over 20 reports from the Department of Transportation Inspector \nGeneral which has tracked this very carefully. There have been \ndeliberate misstatements by the project managers, made not only to the \npeople of Massachusetts but also to the Congress of the United States. \nSeveral years of low-ball cost estimates finally caught up with the big \ndig in the year 2000.\n  In January of that year, the Turnpike Authority submitted its annual \nfinancial plan, estimating the cost of the big dig at $10.8 billion.\n  The following month, on the same day the Federal Railroad \nAdministration accepted the plan as valid, the Turnpike Authority \nannounced the project would cost $12.2 billion, or an estimated \nadditional $1.4 billion.\n  Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff blamed the increase on unforeseen cost \nincreases and shortening the construction schedule by 2 years. But a \nseries of articles by the Boston Globe concluded that the majority of \nthe $1.4 billion cost overrun was due to design errors by Bechtel/\nParsons Brinckerhoff. In one instance, the engineering firms failed to \ninclude the FleetCenter, the sports center home to the Boston Bruins \nand Boston Celtics, in the designs for the project. Months of \nconstruction took place before the design flaw was detected. This \nmistake alone cost taxpayers $991,000.\n  The Department of Transportation Inspector General and all members of \nthe Commerce Committee are aware of the incredible work the Department \nof Transportation Inspector General has done, which issued 20 reports \non the big dig, and was highly skeptical of the project managers' cost \nprojections, and concluded in May 2000 that the project's managers were \n``well aware that costs were increasing significantly'' and \n``deliberately withheld'' information about cost increases in the 1998 \nand 1999 financial plans.\n  That statement by the Department of Transportation Inspector General \nbears repeating. It concludes that the project's managers were well \naware that costs were increasing significantly and deliberately \nwithheld information--that includes the Congress of the United States--\nabout cost increases in the 1998 and 1999 financial plans.\n  Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission determined the \nTurnpike Authority and its former\n\n[[Page S11680]]\n\nchairman, James Kerasiotes, had violated the securities laws by failing \nto disclose to investors during the 1999 bond offerings that they knew \nof the more than $1 billion in cost overruns related to the project. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission order noted:\n\n       Reasonable investors would have considered project cost \n     increases in excess of $1 billion to be an important factor \n     in the investment decisionmaking process . . . In addition to \n     being a substantial amount in absolute terms, the cost \n     increases equal to approximately 3% of the total revenues of \n     the Commonwealth estimated for fiscal year 2000 and 2001 . . \n     . and 9% of the total Commonwealth debt load as of January 1, \n     1991, and exceeded the amount of the Commonwealth's rainy day \n     fund.\n\n  After the revelations in 2000 about the rising cost of the project, I \nsought and achieved an overall Federal cap for the big dig of $8.549 \nbillion in fiscal year 2001 transportation appropriations legislation. \nThe cap was also incorporated in a project partnership agreement \nentered into June 22, 2000, by the Federal Railroad Administration and \nthe Commonwealth to improve management and oversight of the big dig.\n  As a result of the cap, the Federal taxpayers should be protected \nfrom additional project costs. Without the cap, the Federal share of \nthe big dig could have been as much as $12 to $13 billion.\n  Efforts are underway to recover project costs associated with change \norders, led by retired probate judge Edward M. Ginsburg at the Turnpike \nAuthority. The cost recovery team, as of March 2004, identified 634 \npotential cost recovery items valued at over $744 million, but today \nthe team has only recovered $3.5 million from one design consultant and \nnone has been refunded from Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, although the \nTurnpike Authority and the Commonwealth have filed suit against the \njoint venture, seeking $146 million in damages. Eventually, perhaps, \nthe taxpayers will recoup some modest portion of the costly mistakes.\n  Since Federal oversight of the big dig by the Department of \nTransportation Inspector General and the Federal Railroad \nAdministration was strengthened in 2000, the big dig has submitted \nrealistic financial plans and construction has preceded relatively on \nschedule. Even as portions of the project were being completed, \ntaxpayer dollars were being improperly spent. In 2002, the Turnpike \nAuthority spent $373,000 to host walking tours of the bridge and the I-\n93 tunnel. Later that year, the Turnpike Authority threw a $1 million \nparty to celebrate the opening of the Leonard P. Zaim Bunker Hill \nBridge. Nearly half the expenses, $450,000, were paid for with public \nfunds.\n  In December 2003, Chairman Amorello's plans to celebrate the opening \nof the southbound I-93 tunnel with a concert by the Boston Pops for \n2,000 invited guests caused an uproar. While the $250,000 cost of the \nconcert could have been donated by Citizens Bank, Chairman Amorello \nreportedly planned to use up to $200,000 in public funds for security \nand site preparation. Ultimately, the event was cancelled, but only \nafter Citizens Bank, a major sponsor of the event, complained about \ndiverting highway beautification funds to help pay for the event.\n  It is also the matter of the big dig's headquarters building. In \n1992, they purchased their headquarters building for $29 million, $26 \nmillion of which was financed with Federal highway funds. The \nCommonwealth now plans to sell the building and expects to see $97 \nmillion net of transaction costs. The Federal Railroad Administration \nhas concluded that Massachusetts may treat the proceeds from the sale \nas State funds, even though the Federal Government funded 90 percent of \nthe purchase. And the Government Accountability Office has concluded \nthat the Federal share of the proceeds from the sale of the \nheadquarters building does not count against the statutory Federal cap.\n  I remain firmly committed to protecting Federal taxpayers from \nincurring any additional expenditure for the big dig, including costs \nassociated with the sale of property, fixing hundreds of leaks in the \ntunnels, or celebrating the completion of a project not well done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that articles from the Boston \nGlobe and the Boston Herald be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The Boston Herald, Nov. 14, 2004]\n\n               With Tunnel All Wet, Builder Drains State\n\n                            (By Casey Ross)\n\n       A confidential agreement that paid the Big Dig's lead \n     contractor for additional work on a defective section of the \n     Interstate 93 tunnel also included a hefty cash advance and \n     money for the leaky Fort Point Channel tunnel, according to \n     court documents and a former state official.\n       The agreement, a $59 million payout authorized by top \n     Massachusetts Turnpike Authority officials in 2002, paid \n     Modern Continental without demanding compensation for its \n     faulty work, the court papers say.\n       ``The Authority cannot protect (Modern Continental) from \n     itself or place the interests of the (contractor) before the \n     interests of . . . the commonwealth and its taxpayers,'' \n     former Turnpike board member Christy Mihos said in a 2002 \n     letter to Chairman Matthew Amorello.\n       The payout is significant because top Turnpike Authority \n     officials knew of Modern's faulty work--both in the Fort \n     Point Channel and the Interstate 93 tunnel--and did nothing \n     to hold the contractor accountable, former officials say.\n       The payout also could jeopardize the state's efforts to \n     recover costs for repairs to hundreds of leaks in the \n     tunnels--an assertion Turnpike Authority officials deny \n     because of contract language they say gives them broad \n     collection powers.\n       In court papers responding to a lawsuit filed by Mihos--the \n     suit alleges Amorello and a Turnpike lawyer refused to give \n     him access to records--Turnpike officials say the $59 million \n     agreement was necessary to allow financially troubled Modem \n     Continental to finish its work.\n       Lawyers for the Turnpike also say Mihos was twice given an \n     opportunity to review the agreement.\n       Money that was paid for the Fort Point Channel tunnel, \n     which sprung a massive leak in September 2001, capped the \n     amount spent on that contract at $417 million, a 39 percent \n     increase over its original price.\n       Before reaching that agreement, Pike officials launched a \n     complaint investigated by the Attorney General's office that \n     Modern Continental had filed false monetary claims for tunnel \n     work.\n       But Mihos said top Turnpike Authority officials, by \n     authorizing a payout in 2002 that paid for work not yet \n     performed, did little to hold the contractor accountable.\n       ``We do not work for (Modern Continental), they work for \n     us,'' Mihos wrote to Amorello. ``. . . We cannot and must not \n     place the (Big Dig) or its funds in jeopardy.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From The Boston Globe, Sept. 16, 2004]\n\n  Artery Tunnel Springs Leak, Traffic Snarled; Big Dig Closes Lanes, \n                  Seeks Cause, Aims For Full Reopening\n\n                     (By David Abel and Mac Daniel)\n\n       Water gushed into the Central Artery's northbound tunnel \n     for hours yesterday from a small breach in the eastern wall, \n     backing up afternoon rush-hour traffic for miles and leaving \n     Big Dig officials at a loss to explain where the water was \n     coming from and what had caused the leak.\n       In the first couple of hours after the leak was reported, \n     about 1:45 p.m., officials closed two lanes in the northbound \n     tunnel and all onramps from the Massachusetts Turnpike. \n     Traffic on the Southeast Expressway backed up to Quincy, and \n     there were long delays on the turnpike approaching the \n     interchange.\n       Big Dig officials said at a late afternoon press conference \n     that they hoped to reopen all the tunnel's northbound lanes \n     by this morning's commute. But they said they did not know \n     how long it would take to find the source of the leak and \n     repair the damage, and they could not guarantee that work \n     would be finished in time.\n       By late afternoon, officials could not provide an estimate \n     of how much water had flowed into the tunnel. For safety and \n     to soak up the water, highway workers piled sandbags along \n     the eastern wall and poured sand in the right lane.\n       Officials and engineers were so uncertain about the origin \n     of the water that some tasted it. The likely source, they \n     said, was groundwater, because that portion of the tunnel \n     sits 110 feet underground.\n       One theory for the leak was that sand or clay got into the \n     poured concrete in the tunnel's slurry wall during \n     construction, said Sean O'Neill, a spokesman for the \n     Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, which oversees the $14.6 \n     billion Big Dig project.\n       O'Neill said it is possible that groundwater ate away at \n     the sand and carved a small leak in the wall.\n       During construction of the Big Dig, engineers and workers \n     built the slurry walls by first digging a series of deep \n     trenches, which were filled with a clay substance. Concrete \n     was then pumped underneath, displacing the clay and forming \n     the tunnel's concrete walls.\n       Keith Sibley, director of construction for Bechtel/Parsons \n     Brinckerhoff, the consortium responsible for major portions \n     of the Big Dig, sought during the press conference to \n     reassure drivers and state officials that there were no \n     safety concerns.\n       ``Structurally, there's no problem with the tunnel at \n     all,'' he said.\n       But state officials said they would hold the consortium \n     responsible for all costs of sealing the leak and repairing \n     the wall.\n       ``Believe me, as a customer of the product we constructed, \n     I'm not happy right now,'' said Matthew J. Amorello, chairman \n     of the\n\n[[Page S11681]]\n\n     Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, which oversees the $14.6 \n     billion Big Dig project. ``It's unacceptable, and we're going \n     to deal with it.''\n       Bechtel/Parsons officials said last night that Modern \n     Continental, the contractor that built the tunnel's slurry \n     walls 10 years ago, would pay for the repairs.\n       ``Modern Continental has accepted responsibility and will \n     make all the repairs as quickly as possible,'' said Andrew \n     Paven, a Bechtel/Parsons spokesman.\n       But last night, a spokeswoman for Modern Continental said \n     that no such agreement had been reached. ``The cause of the \n     leak has not been determined, and no conversation about the \n     cost of the repairs has taken place,'' said the spokeswoman, \n     Lorraine Marino.\n       About 7 last night, Big Dig engineers met in a office at \n     the project's headquarters on Kneeland Street to figure out \n     how to plug the hole without making the problem worse. The \n     engineers said that removing tiles along the wall could \n     expand the leak.\n       Officials were notified about the leak when motorists began \n     reporting water seeping through Jersey barriers along the \n     northbound tunnel's eastern wall.\n       Shortly after those reports, with the water flow at its \n     heaviest, officials closed two lanes of the northbound \n     tunnel, which produced the miles-long backup.\n       To ease congestion, officials opened the Haul Road off \n     Interstate 93 north at 3:30 p.m., a road normally limited to \n     commercial traffic. At the same time, they closed the \n     entrance into the tunnel from Congress Street. And 15 minutes \n     later, officials closed all onramps from the turnpike leading \n     to northbound tunnel.\n       By early evening, the closing was reduced to one lane, and \n     traffic was flowing. So was the water, which continued to \n     form a small pool in the right lane of the tunnel about a \n     quarter mile south of Exit 23 to Government Center.\n       A stream of water trickled between sandbags and rippled in \n     a puddle about 5 inches deep and two cars long in the right \n     lane.\n       Officials said they found an 8-inch hole in the slurry \n     wall, one of the Big Dig's signature innovations, and sent a \n     special team of construction workers to inspect whether the \n     damage was more extensive.\n       Officials said there was no connection between yesterday's \n     leak and a water leak last winter, when ice formed on the \n     road surface in the northbound and southbound tunnels. The \n     ice was blamed on the presence old steel footings from the \n     elevated Central Artery, which allowed rainwater to seep into \n     the tunnel.\n       While construction of the Big Dig is nearing an end, the \n     process for determining who should pay for the cost overruns \n     in the project is ongoing.\n       In February 2003, Amorello appointed Edward M. Ginsburg, a \n     retired state judge, to lead a review of the project with an \n     eye to holding contractors responsible for mistakes. To date, \n     Ginsburg's team of lawyers and engineers has identified more \n     than 700 construction issues and has recovered $3.5 million \n     from a design firm.\n       The Ginsburg team has filed several lawsuits against other \n     design firms, including one seeking $150 million from \n     Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, the project's overall manager.\n       Last night, Ginsburg said he could not comment on the leak, \n     but promised an aggressive investigation on behalf of \n     taxpayers.\n       ``We will definitely get all the preliminary reports and \n     send our people in to look at this,'' he said. ``This \n     shouldn't happen, and somebody has got to make an \n     explanation, and I can assure you it is not going to get by \n     us. We will look at this, absolutely.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Nov. 17, 2004]\n\n     List of Tunnel Troubles Grows Longer, More Leaks, Damage Found\n\n                 (By Raphael Lewis and Sean P. Murphy)\n\n       The Big Dig's tunnel leak problem is far more costly and \n     extensive than Massachusetts Turnpike officials and private \n     contractors have acknowledged, involving thousands of ceiling \n     and wall fissures, water damage to steel supports and \n     fireproofing systems, and overloaded drainage equipment, \n     according to documents obtained by the Globe.\n       Turnpike officials and private-sector managers Bechtel/\n     Parsons Brinckerhoff have together signed off on at least $10 \n     million in cost overruns to repair the leaks and water damage \n     since early 2001, the records show, and the problem persists.\n       Turnpike officials did not acknowledge the leak problem \n     until it was revealed in the Globe last week.\n       All this occurred while engineers worked frantically to \n     come up with a permanent solution for waterproofing the \n     tunnels, an effort that continues today, according to project \n     documents.\n       The problem stems in part from an apparent projectwide \n     failure in the original design of the waterproofing system, a \n     critical feature of a tunnel that sits almost entirely \n     beneath the salty water table of downtown Boston. In a \n     confidential report commissioned by the Turnpike in 2001 by \n     the auditing firm Deloitte & Touche, project officials \n     acknowledged that ``the original design provided insufficient \n     protection against leaking'' at the top of tunnel walls.\n       With construction of the tunnels well underway and with \n     water seeping in through joints between the roof and tunnel \n     walls and between panels, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff \n     abandoned its initial waterproofing system, a membrane \n     applied to the roof and walls that had proved incapable of \n     stopping water. Contractors were ordered to apply a spray-on \n     application instead.\n       Doug Hanchett spokesman for the Massachusetts Turnpike \n     Authority, which oversees the Big Dig said that the agency \n     has made progress in controlling the leak problem and that \n     the authority is working to recoup costs from contractors.\n       ``This issue is something that will resolve itself through \n     the construction process, and we fully expect that the \n     contractors will perform the waterproofing work, as required \n     in their contracts,'' Hanchett said.\n       Earlier this month, a team of independent engineers hired \n     to investigate a massive leak that erupted in September said \n     the project was riddled with more than 400 leaks throughout \n     the tunnel system.\n       However, the documents obtained by the Globe show nearly \n     700 leaks in just one 1,000-foot section of the Interstate 93 \n     tunnels beneath South Station. The documents include \n     memorandums, diagrams, photographs, and correspondence \n     pertaining to the Central Artery tunnels.\n       According to documents detailing modification to tunnel \n     finishing contracts, which were obtained by the Globe, the \n     Turnpike Authority and Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff \n     established a Leak Task Force in early 2001 and is now \n     allocating $250,000 a month for the firm McCourt/Obiyashi to \n     send repair teams into virtually all sections of the I-93 \n     tunnels. McCourt/Obiyashi's initial contract, which began in \n     1999, had no such provisions for leak repair, but by mid-2001 \n     the firm was extensively engaged in that effort, the \n     documents show.\n       For example, in August 2003, tunnel officials, approved a \n     $205,000 plan to replace 300 wall panel connectors in the \n     downtown tunnels because ``excessive tunnel leakage with high \n     salt content has caused unacceptable corrosion.''\n       In another instance in March 2001, McCourt/Obiyashi was \n     told to extend tubes that contained liquid concrete grout for \n     leak repairs throughout the tunnels. That work cost $300,000.\n       George J. Tamaro, an independent engineer hired by the \n     Turnpike Authority to investigate the source of the massive \n     tunnel leak that erupted in September, said that the roof's \n     waterproofing membrane didn't work as intended and that \n     engineers have used concrete grout for several years to try \n     to plug the leaks. He said problems with leaks seemed to \n     occur when the weather becomes colder.\n       Tamaro and another engineer hired to investigate the \n     situation, Jack K. Lemley, said a permanent solution to \n     address the problem is needed, or workers will spend years, \n     perhaps even a decade, patching and repatching the leaks.\n       Anthony Lancellotti, a Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff design \n     executive, said that ``there are a lot of theories'' on the \n     cause of the leaks and that he is not allowed to discuss them \n     because of ongoing investigations by Bechtel/Parsons \n     Brinckerhoff, the Turnpike Authority, the state attorney \n     general's office, and the US Department of Transportation's \n     inspector general.\n       But Lancellotti insisted that there has been a dramatic \n     drop in the number of leaks due to ongoing repairs. He said \n     that using grout to close leaks is a hit-or-miss proposition. \n     Workers drilling into the concrete to inject the grout are \n     never sure the holes they have drilled intersect with the \n     path of the leak.\n       ``Drilling is exploratory,'' he said. ``You have to do it \n     several times. You chase leaks; that's the nature of the \n     business. But we have seen a dramatic improvement.''\n       Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, who said his office is \n     meeting regularly with engineers trying to get refunds for \n     shoddy work, predicted that the cost of fixing the roof leaks \n     will be much more than the $10 million already spent by the \n     Turnpike Authority, and he called on the contractors \n     involved, including Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, to cover \n     those costs.\n       In addition to the $10 million allocated so far, project \n     construction contractors who built the tunnels have on their \n     own spent at least $6 million plugging leaks, according to \n     construction industry officials who spoke on condition on \n     anonymity.\n       Some of the contractors are now pressing hard to be \n     compensated by the state for those expenses.\n       One firm, Modern Continental, has submitted a bill of \n     roughly $4 million for leak repair work, and is asserting \n     that the leakage problem is the result of a flawed design by \n     Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff.\n       But the Turnpike Authority and Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff \n     have insisted that the design was appropriate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Boston Herald, Sept. 17, 2004]\n\n           SpongeBob Tunnel Simply Leaving Taxpayers All Wet\n\n                            (By Howie Carr)\n\n       They're going to make a movie about the Big Dig.\n       They'll call it ``The Poseidon Adventure.''

Lemley, a consultant hired by the \n     Massachusetts Turnpike Authority to investigate the problem.\n       ``There is no public safety issue,'' Turnpike Authority \n     Chairman Matthew Amorello said Wednesday, adding that the \n     tunnels remain structurally sound, and the drainage system is \n     keeping water off the roadways.\n       Lemley told The Boston Globe that repairing September's \n     leak alone would require two months and lane closures. But \n     Amorello said that taxpayers and motorists who pay tolls will \n     not foot the bill for repairs.\n       Lemley's team also found documents showing that managers of \n     Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, the private consortium that \n     managed the project, were aware that the wall breached this \n     fall was faulty when it was built in the late 1990s, but did \n     not order it replaced and did not notify state officials.\n       Retired judge Edward M. Ginsburg, leader of a state-\n     appointed team reviewing overcharges by Big Dig contractors, \n     said he has spoken to Attorney General Tom Reilly about \n     filing a lawsuit targeting Bechtel and Modern Continental, \n     the contractor that built the wall section that leaked in \n     September.\n       ``I can honestly say we were shocked,'' Ginsburg told the \n     Globe. ``I can assure you we're going to make sure there is a \n     thorough investigation.''\n       Turnpike Authority member Jordan Levy promised to make the \n     contractors pay for repairing the leaks. mat.\n       ``I'm outraged and dismayed at the quality of some of this \n     work,'' he said. ``We are not going to let anyone off the \n     mat.\n       ``If there was a cover-up involved in this, I would expect \n     the attorney general would bring this before a grand jury to \n     determine if there is criminal intent here,'' he said.\n       Levy said either the Bechtel project was incompetent or \n     there was ``malfeasance at the highest level.''\n       ``I don't think they're stupid,'' he said.\n       Levy said the scope of the problem was ``beyond \n     comprehension,'' given the years and billions of tax dollars \n     spent.\n       He added that more tax dollars would be spent to fix the \n     problem, ``over my dead body.''\n       In September, an eight-inch leak sprung in the northbound \n     lanes of the Interstate 93 tunnel and caused 10-mile backups \n     on the highway.\n       Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff issued a statement Tuesday \n     saying:\n       ``While the cause of the September water leak in the \n     northbound tunnel remains under investigation, it would be \n     inappropriate for us to comment on specific allegations. ... \n     In a tunnel of this construction type, seepage is inevitable, \n     but is mitigated by proper engineering and maintenance \n     programs, which have been planned for and are in place. The \n     tunnel is structurally sound.''\n       Modern Continental, the largest contractor on the project, \n     also issued a statement.\n       ``The results of the investigation will conclude that \n     Modern's workmanship was in accordance with contract plans \n     and specifications,'' it said.\n       Ginsburg said his team will demand that the contractors fix \n     the problem at no cost to taxpayers. He could not estimate \n     the cost.\n       The September leak was the latest in a series of \n     embarrassing episodes in the two-decade construction of the \n     Big\n       Dig, formally called the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel \n     project.\n       In January, ice formed in the tunnels, forcing officials to \n     close lanes and jamming up traffic. And in 2001, a leak \n     spouted from under one of six concrete tubes being put in \n     place to carry Interstate 90 through the Fort Point Channel.\n       The Big Dig replaced the elevated Central Artery of \n     Interstate 93 with underground tunnels through downtown\n       Boston. It also connected Interstate 90--the Massachusetts \n     Turnpike--to Logan International Airport, and added the Ted \n     Williams Tunnel beneath Boston Harbor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on November 17, there was an article in \nthe Boston Globe: ``List Of Tunnel Troubles Grows Longer, More Leaks, \nDamage Found.'' I will quote parts of the article:\n\n       The problem stems in part from an apparent projectwide \n     failure in the original design of the waterproofing system. . \n     . .\n       Earlier this month, a team of independent engineers hired \n     to investigate a massive leak that erupted in September said \n     the project was riddled with more than 400 leaks throughout \n     the tunnel system.\n       However, the documents obtained by the Globe show nearly \n     700 leaks in just one 1,000-foot section of the Interstate 93 \n     tunnels beneath South Station. . . .\n       In addition to the $10 million allocated so far, project \n     construction contractors who built the tunnels have on their \n     own spent at least $6 million plugging leaks, according to \n     construction industry officials who spoke on condition of \n     anonymity.\n       Some of the contractors are now pressing hard to be \n     compensated by the state for those expenses.\n       One firm, Modern Continental, has submitted a bill of \n     roughly $4 million for leak repair work, and is asserting \n     that the leakage problem is the result of a flawed design by \n     Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff. . . .\n       George J. Tamaro, an independent engineer hired by the \n     Turnpike Authority to investigate the source of the massive \n     tunnel leak that erupted in September, said that the roof's \n     waterproofing membrane didn't work as intended and the \n     engineers have used concrete grout for several years to try \n     to plug the leaks. . . .\n       Tamaro and another engineer hired to investigate the \n     situation, Jack K. Lemley, said a permanent solution to \n     address the problem is needed, or workers will spend years, \n     perhaps even a decade, patching and repatching the leaks.\n\n  An article in the Associated Press:\n\n       The team of consulting engineers also said it found \n     documents showing that managers of Bechtel/Parsons \n     Brinckerhoff, the private consortium that oversaw the \n     project, were aware that the wall was faulty when it was \n     built in the late 1990s but did not tell the Turnpike \n     Authority about it.\n\n  Another article in the Associated Press:\n\n       Locating and fixing the hundreds of leaks could take up to \n     10 years, said Jack K.

Mr. President, I commend my esteemed colleagues in the \nSenate for passing S. 3021, the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act \nof 2004, which I introduced today with the senior Senator from Vermont. \nThis important legislation is actually a package of several smaller \nintellectual property bills that the House and Senate have been working \nto enact over the past 2 years. This bill strengthens the intellectual \nproperty laws that are vital to the ongoing growth of our economy. In \naddition to important clarifications to U.S. intellectual property \nlaws, this bill also contains the Family Movie Act, introduced by \nRepresentative Lamar Smith, the Chairman of the House subcommittee with \njurisdiction over intellectual property legislation.\n  Title I of this Act, the Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act of \n2003, the ART Act, contains a slightly modified version of S. 1932, \nauthored by my colleagues Senators Cornyn and Feinstein, that passed \nthe Senate by unanimous consent earlier this Congress. This bill will \nclose two significant gaps in our copyright laws that are feeding some \nof the piracy now rampant on the Internet. First, it criminalizes \nattempts to camcord movies off of theater screens. These camcorded \ncopies of new movies now appear on filesharing networks almost \ncontemporaneously with the theatrical release\n\n[[Page S11693]]\n\nof a film. Several states have already taken steps to criminalize this \nactivity, but providing a uniform Federal law, instead of a patchwork \nof State criminal statutes, will assist law enforcement officials in \ncombating the theft and redistribution of valuable intellectual \nproperty embodied in newly-released motion pictures. Second, the bill \nwill create a pre-registration system that will permit criminal \npenalties and statutory damage awards. This will also provide a tool \nfor law enforcement officials combating the growing problem of music \nand movies being distributed on filesharing networks and circulating on \nthe Internet before they are even released. Obviously, the increasingly \nfrequent situation of copyrighted works being distributed illegally via \nthe Internet before they are even made available for sale to the public \nseverely undercuts the ability of copyright holders to receive fair and \nadequate compensation for their works.\n  Title II of this Act, the Family Movie Act of 2004, resolves some \nongoing disputes about e legality of so-called ``jump-and-skip'' \ntechnologies that companies like Clearplay in my home state of Utah \nhave developed to permit family-friendly viewing of films that may \ncontain objectionable content. The Family Movie Act creates a narrowly-\ndefined safe-harbor clarifying that distributors of such technologies \nwill not face liability for copyright or trademark infringement, \nprovided that they comply with the requirements of the Act. Throughout \nthe 108th Congress, I have been working to resolve this issue with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and several leaders in the House, including, \nmost importantly Chairman Smith and Chairman Sensenbrenner. The Family \nMovie Act will help to end aggressive litigation threatening the \nviability of small companies like Clearplay who are busy creating \ninnovative technologies for consumers that allow them to tailor their \nhome viewing experience to their own individual or family preferences.\n  I thank my friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, for his and his \nstaff's assistance in drafting this version of the legislation to \nresolve concerns that the House version might affect entirely unrelated \ndisputes about commercial-skipping technology. Apparently, some were \nconcerned that language in the House bill stating that this particular \nsafe-harbor provision was not intended to resolve disputes about the \nlegality of commercial-skipping technologies might be construed by \ncourts as evidence that Congress believes that such technologies \nviolate the Copyright Act. -\n\n  Courts do not, cannot, and should not construe the Copyright Act's \nsafe harbors in this way. For example, when Congress created safe-\nharbor provisions for certain types of internet service providers, it \ndid not imply that all others were violating the Copyright Act. \nNevertheless, I am pleased that we were able to find language that \nsatisfies all so that it is clear the Act's safe-harbor for family-\nfriendly viewing technologies encode absolutely no judgment whatsoever \nabout the proper resolution of entirely unrelated disputes about the \nlegality of commercial-skipping technologies. It would have been tragic \nif we had allowed a special-interest dispute about advertising to deny \nparents access to technologies that give them and their children the \nopportunity to watch movies without being exposed to profanity or \nimages of rape, sex or murder.\n  Title III of this Act, the National Film Preservation Act of 2004, \nwill reauthorize the National Film Preservation Board and the National \nFilm Preservation Foundation. These entities have worked successfully \nto recognize and preserve historically or culturally significant films, \noften by providing the grants and expertise that enable local \nhistorical societies to protect and preserve historically significant \nfilms for the local communities for which they are most important. This \nfine work will ensure that the history of the 20th century will be \npreserved and available to future generations. As a conservative \nSenator from a socially-conservative-state, I occasionally take a few \nswings at the movie industry for the quality and content of the motion \npictures they are currently creating, but I will note for the record \nthat I commend efforts to ensure that important artistic, cultural, and \nhistorically-significant films are preserved for future generations, \nand I commend the Senator from Vermont for his perseverance in \nreauthorizing federal funds to continue this important effort.\n  Title IV of this Act, the Preservation of Orphan Works Act, also \nensures the preservation of valuable historic records by correcting a \ntechnical error that unnecessarily narrows a limitation on the \ncopyright law applicable to librarians and archivists. This will \nstrengthen the ability of librarians and archivists to better meet the \nneeds of both researchers and ordinary individuals and will result in \ngreater accessibility of important works. I applaud my colleague in the \nHouse, Representative Howard Berman of California, for his efforts on \nthis bill and am pleased to see it included in this Senate package.\n  Title V of this Act, the Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004, amends our \ncriminal and civil anticounterfeiting laws to ensure that these laws \nkeep pace with the counterfeiters. Traffic in counterfeit copies of \ngoods protected by American copyrights, patents or trademarks has \nbecome a multi-billion dollar drain on our economy. The proceeds of \nthis illegal traffic are stolen from legitimate American companies and \nthen used to fund other criminal enterprises. Unlike several of the \nother bills in this package that provide tools for combating music and \nmovie piracy, the Anticounterfeiting Act is directed primarily toward \ncombating counterfeiting practices that enable software piracy around \nthe world.\n  To combat this counterfeiting, companies are using increasingly \nsophisticated authentication features to distinguish genuine, \nauthorized copies of their products and to protect their customers and \ndistributors. Now, the counterfeiters are fighting back by \ncounterfeiting authentication features or by stealing legally produced \nauthentication features and selling them to counterfeiters. The \nAnticounterfeiting Act of 2004 will impose criminal and civil penalties \nupon those who traffic in counterfeit or stolen authentication \nfeatures. This will ensure that law-enforcement agencies and private \nrights-holders can halt criminal traffic in counterfeit or stolen \nauthentication features before it even creates an illusion of \nauthenticity that allows counterfeit goods to penetrate legitimate \nmarkets and endanger both the growth of our economy and the personal \nsafety of our citizens.\n\n  Title VI of this Act, the Cooperative Research and Technology \nEnhancement Act of 2004, the CREATE Act, will create new opportunities \nto innovate when public institutions and private entrepreneurs combine \ntheir respective forms of expertise in collaborative, joint research \nefforts. This type of joint private-public research effort is well-\nsuited to, in the words of President Lincoln, add ``the fuel of \ninterest to the fire of genius in the production of new and useful \nthings.'' As a result, we have long realized the enormous value of \nthese joint research efforts, and we have long realized that their \npotential cannot be realized unless their participants can benefit from \nthe intellectual property rights generated by such research.\n  Unfortunately, the literal language of Section 102(g) of the Patent \nAct suggests that nonpublic information known to some members of a \nprivate-public research team can constitute ``prior art'' that may make \nthe final results of the team research obvious, and thus not \npatentable. Because non-public information does not usually constitute \n``prior art'' under the Patent Act, the potentially disparate treatment \nof such information creates a disincentive for entrepreneurs and public \ninstitutions to collaborate in joint research efforts.\n  I believe that we must encourage, not discourage, public institutions \nand private entrepreneurs to combine their respective talents in joint \nresearch efforts. Indeed, Congress committed itself to this principle \nwhen it passed the Bayh-Dole amendments to the Patent Act.

Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking about \nthe Senators who will not be here when the Senate starts over again \nthis January. The first I ever heard about Senator Fritz Hollings was \nwhile watching a TV program where Senator Hollings was running for \nPresident, and he said, during a Presidential debate, when the issue of \nthe day was whether there should be a nuclear freeze, which had been \npropounded by Alan Cranston, another candidate, when asked about the \nnuclear freeze, Senator Hollings said, ``Until a few days ago, I \nthought this was a new kind of dessert.'' That wit is typical of Fritz \nHollings.\n  Mr. President, Fritz Hollings is a man who is, as far as I am \nconcerned, the epitome of what it means to be a Senator. He is a person \nwho looks the role and is everything that I am not--tall, handsome, \nwith flowing white hair, and very articulate. This is a man who was one \nof the original southern politicians who thought it was appropriate to \nstart talking about the evils of segregation. Fritz Hollings is tall, \nhandsome, with a great voice, a great sense of humor; and he is \nsomebody for whom I have the greatest respect. I will miss him so much.\n  He, Peatsy, and I have traveled. He is someone who has been so good \nto the State of South Carolina. I have been to his home. He has given \nme a tour of Columbia, SC, where he is a legend in his own time. He \nshowed me the place where he was born.\n  I want to extend through the magic of this television to everyone \nwithin the sound of my voice the fact that Fritz Hollings is a great \nSenator and will go down in the history of the Senate as one of the \ngreat Senators.\n  I also want Fritz and Peatsy to know how much I care for them, and I \nappreciate very much their generosity and friendship to Landra and me \nover these many years.\n\n\n                              John Breaux\n\n  John Breaux and I came to the Senate together. We served in the House \ntogether. He comes from a State that, of course, is famous for \nunpredictable politics, and John has done every bit of his work to make \nsure that tradition is upheld.\n  When he was running for the Senate, as only John Breaux could do, his \nopponent raised a question, and his opponent, who was somebody who also \nhad served in the House of Representatives, said John Breaux can be \nbought. They would rush out to John Breaux and would say: Your opponent \nsaid you could be bought. How do you respond to that? John Breaux said: \nWell, I can be leased but I can't be bought. Who else, other than John \nBreaux, could get away with something like that?\n  He is a great person, a person of integrity, a person who came to the \nHouse of Representatives way back in 1972. He served in the Congress \nfor 32 years. There is no one who is better at making a deal than John \nBreaux. I say this in the most positive way. Legislation is the art of \ncompromise, consensus building, and John Breaux understood that to a T. \nWe need more people such as John Breaux with the ability to reach \nacross the aisle.\n  We will miss John Breaux, Mr. Problem Solver. I appreciate his and \nLois's friendship over these years. I will miss him very much.\n\n\n                               Bob Graham\n\n  Bob Graham and I came to the Senate together in 1986. He first ran \nfor Governor 26 years ago. Since that time, and even before, he has \nspent hundreds of days working with regular Floridians in their jobs.\n  The thing we all see in Bob Graham is the little notebooks he carries \nand everything he does he writes down. I am sure some day after we are \nlong gone, a historian will review those, and Bob Graham will be well \nknown in the history books because he wrote the history of everything \nhe has done for the last 25 or 30 years.\n  He was a great Governor for the Sunshine State. He has been a \ntremendous Senator. I served with him from the time we came here on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. He has certainly been \ntremendous on that committee. He is a detail man. He is a person, for \nexample, who worked on the Everglades. He was tireless, persistent, and \nso smart. He has become an expert on foreign affairs and foreign \nintelligence. He served as chairman of the Intelligence Committee. He \nhas written a book on the subject. His knowledge and contributions in \nthat area will be hard to replace.\n  I certainly will miss the Senator from Florida. It is just too bad he \ndecided not to run for reelection.\n\n\n                              John Edwards\n\n  I ask everyone to pull out this week's People magazine, if they have \none--if not, get a copy of it--because that tells the story of John and \nElizabeth Edwards. The story is directed toward Elizabeth because she \nhas now been stricken with breast cancer, but it tells in some detail \nabout this wonderful family.\n  He was the Vice Presidential candidate and is someone who has \ntremendous ability. I am a trial lawyer. He is a trial lawyer. He has \nmade such a distinct impression on the country with his oratorical \nskills. We know why he was a great trial lawyer.\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\n  People magazine is so filled with information and inspiration. The \nlast sentence in that People magazine article talks about Elizabeth \nEdwards. She knew she had breast cancer in the last week of the \ncampaign. She did not tell anybody, but she tells in this People \nmagazine article that was so well written that somewhere at a place she \nstopped, they were having a cancer survivor program, and one of them \nasked her: Are you a cancer survivor? She did not answer but, of \ncourse, thought to herself, as the article says: We'll see.\n  We will see. We certainly hope for the Edwards family, which has \nalready had a lot of personal problems due to the death of their 16-\nyear-old son, we really do hope--all of us, all Americans hope for \nElizabeth Edwards, this wonderful woman, to recover.\n  I will miss John Edwards in the Senate. He only served here 6 years, \nbut he certainly left his mark as a great Senator from the State of \nNorth Carolina. North Carolina is going to benefit, however, from the \ndefeat of the Kerry-Edwards ticket because he is returning to North \nCarolina.\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  Don Nickles and I have done some things together in the Senate that I \nwill always remember. There are laws on the statute books of this \ncountry. One of the things we did, and people said we could not do, \nresulted because we were concerned about regulations and how burdensome \nand overbearing they can become. So we introduced legislation that \nbasically said if the administration promulgates a regulation that we \ndo not think helps the country, then we can overturn that regulation. \nThat is the law.\n  We have overturned regulations that have been burdensome to this \ncountry. I have not always liked the result of the legislation that has \nbeen overturned, but it is my law along with Senator Nickles'. He is a \ngreat legislator.\n  We worked together on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative \nBranch. We really did some things that have changed what goes on. We \nhave changed things a great deal, such as how Members of the House and \nSenate do their franking. We changed that.\n  Senator Nickles and I were the first to talk about how bad the east \nfront of the Capitol looked, and we did a number of things. We got the \nautomobiles removed from the east front of the Capitol. This was what \nfirst got me interested in doing something about having a visitor \ncenter on the east front of the Capitol, which is now in the process of \nbeing completed.\n  I have so much respect for Senator Nickles. He and I have a different \npolitical philosophy, no question about that, but I think the work we \nhave done together sets an example of how Democrats and Republicans of \ntotally different political philosophy can work together for the \nbetterment of this country.\n\n  Don Nickles is a good man. He is a young man. He has a great future \nin the private sector. I personally will miss him a lot. I care a great \ndeal about Don Nickles and wish him the very best.\n\n\n                        Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\n  Everyone has heard me talk about Searchlight, NV, the place of my \nbirth and where I still live. The only Senator who has ever been to my \nhome in Searchlight is Ben Nighthorse Campbell. Ben Nighthorse Campbell \none day called my wife and said: I will be in Searchlight and want to \ncome visit you. I will be there in about 40 minutes.\n  I was out doing a little jog. I thought something was wrong when I \ncame back. She said: Nighthorse is on his way.\n  He had a vehicle that was so big--I live a little bit off the beaten \npath--it could not get into my yard. We went up and met him and brought \nhim back to my home. We had a wonderful visit.\n  Ben Nighthorse Campbell is, among other things, a great artist. He \nmakes jewelry. I wanted to get my wife something very special for \nChristmas a couple years ago, and I went to Ben Nighthorse Campbell to \nsee if he could do something unique. He said he was making his daughter \na belt, and he would make one just like it for my wife.\n  He did that. It is a beautiful piece of jewelry. There are two of \nthem in the world. My wife has hers, and if you go to the Museum of the \nAmerican Indian, which is right down the way and just opened, you will \nsee my wife's silver belt in the museum. Actually, it is not hers, it \nis his daughter's, but there is only one identical to my wife's. Ben \nNighthorse Campbell is a great guy, a tremendous athlete.\n  I have great admiration for his physical prowess. I have always \ndisagreed with his motorcycle riding but he believes he should continue \ndoing that. He is a man who has written a book. I have read his book. \nIt is a wonderful rags-to-riches story. He will be missed and that is \nan understatement.\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  There is no way I can, on the Senate floor in the few minutes I am \ngoing to take, convey to my colleagues and the people within the sound \nof my voice the feelings I have about Tom Daschle. He and I came to the \nSenate together 18 years ago. We served in the House of Representatives \nbefore that. The last 6 years we have worked together daily. There may \nbe a day or two that went by without our talking but they were rare. We \nspoke even during the time we were on break. We have virtually been \ntogether every day. The only time we really did not spend a lot of time \ncommunicating is when he was in South Dakota and I was in Searchlight. \nOur BlackBerrys would not work. My BlackBerry now works in Searchlight. \nHis still does not work in South Dakota.\n  Tom's legislative record is certainly there. It is apparent. He has \ndone wonderful things for the State of South Dakota and this country. I \ncould, but it is really unnecessary, explain what he has done for the \nfarmers, the environment, the military, including the veterans, but \nwhat I can try in a very inadequate way is to express to him, through \nthis manner, the things I have tried to say personally to him in the \nlast couple of weeks, and that is express my appreciation to him for \nthe opportunities he has given me.\n  Tom Daschle is a totally unselfish person. I can remember about 6 \nyears ago when I was selected by my peers to be assistant leader I went \nto Senator Daschle and said: What is this job going to be? He said: \nWhatever you make it.\n  I took him at his word, and this job is what I thought the assistant \nleader or the whip should be. I could never have done what I have done \nand had the good fortune of being in the places I have been and had the \nfreedom to do things on this Senate floor but for the support and \nauthorization of Senator Daschle.\n\n  I do not think I have ever raised my voice to Senator Daschle. We \nboth grew up with three brothers. We are the first to really go to \nschool of any depth in our families. I have learned a lot from Senator \nDaschle.\n  As I have told everyone, I am not Tom Daschle and I am going to be a \ndifferent kind of person in the new duties I have beginning at the \nfirst of the year.\n  I told Tom Daschle earlier this week that earlier this year I lost my \nbest friend. His name was Mike O'Callaghan. He was someone who taught \nme in high school. He taught me how to fight in the ring and in other \nplaces. When I went to law school, he helped me. He was a disabled \nKorean veteran but he gave me part of his pension money to help me \nthrough tough times in school. I was allowed to take the bar before I \ngraduated from law school. I was married and had two children, was \ndesperate for money. I came back to Reno and there was Michael \nO'Callaghan. He gave me a $50 bill. That was in the fall of 1963. He \ngave me a $50 bill. I had never seen one before but he gave that to me. \nHe knew I was desperate for money.\n  Then I held a few offices, and as a very young man I ran for \nLieutenant Governor. People kind of thought I was going to win that. He \nmoved back from California to Nevada to run for Governor because there \nwas no Democrat to run sitting for Lieutenant Governor. They knew \nO'Callaghan had no chance, but he did. He became the Governor of the \nState of Nevada.\n  I am trying to paint a picture for this man and how close he was to \nme. He was so good to me, able to give me advice and counsel. He told \nme what I needed to hear, not what I wanted to hear, and I did not make \na decision important in nature unless I discussed it with my friend \nMike O'Callaghan.\n  He went to church early one morning this summer and died. It was a \nvery\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\npainless death. He went to church every day. He was a devoutly \nreligious man, and somebody whom I have missed more than words can \ndescribe.\n  I told my friend Tom in his office a day or two ago that he was now \nmy Mike O'Callaghan, that I have somebody I will call just as I did my \nfriend Mike, that I will call him often. He said: That is fine. You \ncould not call me too many times.\n  So Tom Daschle and I have developed a relationship that can best be \ndescribed as two brothers. I have three brothers, one of whom is dead. \nSo Tom replaces my brother Dale. I will call Tom and I will talk to him \nwhen I feel it necessary, knowing he will continue to give the advice \nand counsel to me that he has for the last 6 years.\n  There are additional things I would like to say, but I will suffice \nto say that for the 22 years I have known Tom Daschle, which has been \nculminated in the 6 years of intense personal contact where we have \ndealt with the problems of the country and the world in great depth, \nthat there will never be an opportunity and an experience like that \nagain. I am grateful to Tom and to his wonderful wife Linda for their \nfriendship and Tom's service to our country.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to departing \nSenators for their service and devotion to the United States Senate. \nThey are not only my colleagues but my friends as well.\n  The reality of elections for the Senate is that every two years we \nexperience change--current members depart and new members are welcomed. \nAt every transition I am reminded by the reality that life is more than \njust politics. I am certain the departing Senators--are experiencing a \ntremendous feeling of sorrow, yet anticipation of things to come, as \nthey leave their friends, colleagues, and this great nurturing \ninstitution.\n  Though we may fight hard during campaigns, we return to the Senate \nafter the election to realize that we are not just losing Senators--we \nare losing friends. There is a bond--a collegiality and friendship--in \nthe Senate that crosses party lines. We face long hard battles on the \ncampaign trail and sometimes things can get ugly. But after all is said \nand done, after election day, we must all come back to Washington and \nwork together to do what is best for our country.\n  I will certainly miss my colleagues with whom I have worked for \nseveral years. I have had the honor to serve on the Finance Committee \nwith four of my distinguished retiring colleagues, including Senator \nJohn Breaux and Senator Don Nickles. Both of these men were \ninstrumental in leading the fight to reform Medicare.\n  Senator John Breaux and I have worked side by side on Social Security \nissues. He is a good friend and he has always been willing to \ncompromise. He is the master of a very noble craft that of bringing \npeople together from both sides of the aisle.\n  Senator Don Nickles has been a valuable comrade in protecting \nintellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies and reforming \nhealth care, specifically working hard to pass the Patients Bill of \nRights. He also sponsored commendable legislation to create the Office \nof International Religious Freedom at the Department of State, which I \ncosponsored. Senator Nickles as whip and chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has done more to advocate fiscal conservatism than any other \nSenator during my tenure. He has a true expertise in these issues, and \nI thank him for his guidance and leadership.\n  More importantly, Senator Nickles befriended me when I first came to \nthe Senate and encouraged me to get involved in the National Prayer \nBreakfast and the Senate Bible Study. If it were not for his \nfriendship, my time in the Senate would have been drastically \ndifferent.\n\n\n                        Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\n  Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell is a very kind and humble man and I \nhave had the honor to work with him to assure that nondemocratic forces \nare unsuccessful in undermining movements for democracy in the Ukraine. \nBut what I remember most about Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell is a \nstory he told me once about his decision to vote for the ban on \npartial-birth abortion. While in the hospital recovering from a \nmotorcycle accident, Senator Campbell was touched by the immense effort \nof doctors to save the lives of babies that weighed only a couple \npounds. He was convicted by the significance of doctors going to such \ngreat lengths to save babies only a couple minutes old. This picture \nmade him question partial-birth abortions: Why would we not do \neverything in our power to save babies who were still in their mother's \nwomb? I thank Senator Campbell for his honesty on this issue and for \nsharing that story with me. I will never forget it.\n\n\n                              Zell Miller\n\n  I had the privilege of getting to know Senator Zell Miller as we \ntraveled around the country together this past fall. Senator Miller and \nI have worked hard on education issues including the Paperwork \nReduction Act. He is a man that believes in the ideals of this nation \nand understands that we must sometimes take a stand if we want to be \nheard. I treasure the friendship that Senator Miller and I have formed \nduring our service together. I want him to know how much I admire him. \nHe is a man with the courage to stand up for his convictions. He did \nthe hardest thing for any man to do--he endorsed the opposing party's \nnominee in this year's election. I cannot thank him enough for his \nsupport. I will always have undying gratitude for him.\n  Our departing Senators have been lights of inspiration and men who \nwent above the call of duty to serve our country in their congressional \ncapacities. They each have their own unique political perspective that \nhas served the Senate well. Although my philosophies may differ from \nsome Senators, we do not disagree on the greatness of America. We can \nall agree that we live in the greatest nation in the world, and we all \nbelieve that without democracy, life, liberty, and justice cannot \nflourish.\n  My departing colleagues are great men and great Americans. They have \ncontributed immensely to our country--making their states and our \ncountry significantly better than when they first stepped foot on the \nSenate floor.\n  We are all going to miss their presence and wisdom here in the \nSenate. Their departures will surely leave a hole in expertise and \nleadership that will be hard to fill. I wish them health and happiness \nin their future endeavors--wherever the road may take them. May God \ncontinue to bless them and their families.\n  Come January, as we face another transition, I welcome in the new \nmembers and look forward to forging new relationships as we continue to \nwork towards making Americans safer, healthier, and more financially \nsecure.\n\n\n                        Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor my \ngood friend and colleague, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado. \nBen is my best friend in the Senate. I know every one of my Senate \ncolleagues would join me in expressing how much we care for Senator \nCampbell and how much we will miss him here in the Senate.\n  I have always considered Ben to be larger than life, someone you \nwould read about in a novel about the Senate than someone actually \nserving in the Senate. He is a high-school dropout who became a United \nStates Senator, a veteran of the Korean war, captain of the U.S. judo \nteam, and an extremely successful horse breeder and jeweler. He doesn't \nconform to any stereotypes. No other senators--let alone Republicans--\nwear a ponytail, ride a Harley-Davidson to work, or stubbornly refuse \nto wear any neckwear more formal than a western bolo tie.\n  But I am sure I am not surprising any of you by saying Ben is not \nyour typical politician. One of my favorite stories about Ben's \nindependent streak is from a town meeting he held back when he was a \nMember of the House.\n  A constituent asked Ben a question, and Ben did his best to answer \nit. The gentleman didn't like the response, so he tersely rephrased the \nquestion and Ben answered it again. The man got very upset, and said \n``You have not answered my question!'' Ben firmly told him, ``Look, you \nasked a question, I answered it. You asked me again, and I answered it. \nNow I can't help it if you don't like the answer you got, but these \nother folks are waiting to ask questions of their own, so you and I are \njust going to have to agree to disagree.''\n  Ben started to call on another person when the man jumped out of his \nchair\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\nand yelled to Ben, ``I don't believe you are taking all of the facts \nthat I've stated into account, and you are not going to simply dismiss \nme like that. I am a taxpayer, and I pay your salary, and I demand an \nanswer!''\n  Ben, through gritted teeth, said, ``You know, I hate it when people \nfeel that because you're an elected official, they somehow own you. Do \nyou realize that my salary costs every man, woman and child in this \ncountry about one-half of one cent each year?'' At that point, Ben \nreached into his pocket, pulled out a penny, flipped it to the man, and \nsaid, ``Here's your refund!'' He turned to the audience and yelled, \n``Next question!'' The audience cheered and the man left the meeting.\n  Now that is a good description of the Ben Nighthorse Campbell that I \nhave come to know and love.\n  Most of you know that I have sat next to Ben during policy lunches \never since he saw the light and switched parties so many years ago. I \nstill love to tell the story of when he decided to move over to the \nright side of the aisle.\n  Ben and I became good friends soon after he joined the Senate, and we \nrepeatedly discussed his growing disillusionment with the policies and \npolitics of those on other side of the aisle. I would point out that \npower, its accumulation and retention, seemed to be of greater \nimportance to some on his side than finding the right answer, that the \nworth of an issue should not always be measured simply by political \nadvantage. He would disagree, but over time his protests would grow \nfewer and less heartfelt.\n  I was surprised when Ben stopped me one day nearly 10 years ago and \nsaid, ``Orrin, you're right. I can't stand it anymore over here.'' He \nasked whether I could arrange for him to see Senator Dole, and I said, \n``I believe I can''--3 minutes later we were in Bob Dole's office.\n  Bob had the biggest smile on his face I had ever seen and gave Ben a \nwarm hug. He commented about the courage and principle it took to make \nsuch a decision, but he didn't need to make a hard sell. It was obvious \nBen had already made up his mind to become a Republican.\n  I can vividly remember when Ben attended his first Republican policy \nluncheon. Ben and I had discussed how disappointed he was with the \ndirection and tone of the Democrat policy meetings. He said they had \ndevolved from honest discussions of differences into angry, one-sided \nshouting matches dominated by some of the most senior and well-known \nmembers. If you didn't agree with their liberal positions, your view \nwasn't welcome.\n  I assured Ben that the Republicans were different. We showed great \nrespect for one another and there was always considerable deference \ngiven to differing points of view.\n  When Ben and I took our places at the back of the room--where we have \nsat together since that day--a quiet discussion soon broke out into \nbitter argument. One person jumped up, anger seething from his face, \nstared at another very senior member with a snarl on his face, and then \ncalled him a derogatory name. Everyone started shouting, and it took \nBob Dole several minutes to restore order.\n  Ben's eyes got larger and larger as he watched what was happening, \nthen without turning his head, he gave me a quick jab in the ribs. \n``Gee, Orrin,'' he muttered, ``it's sure good to see how well we \nRepublicans get along compared to those darn Democrats!''\n  Thankfully, Ben's decision to join the Republican Party wasn't solely \nbased on policy lunches.\n  I have plenty more stories to tell of my good friend from Colorado, \nbut I will close by saying that I will miss Ben dearly and wish him the \nvery best as he starts the next phase in his life. I know him too well \nto think that this is really a retirement from public service. This is \njust the end of one phase of service that will open up several other \nways for him to reach out and make a difference in the lives of those \naround him.\n\n\n                              Zell Miller\n\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for the chance to take a few moments to \nrecognize my good friend from across the aisle, Senator Zell Miller of \nGeorgia. Zell is one of my best friends in the United States Senate. I \nknow every one of my Senate colleagues would join me in expressing how \nmuch we care for Senator Miller and how much we will miss him.\n  It is no secret that Zell is his own man, someone who does what he \nbelieves is right, not what is politically expedient. His values were \nshaped while growing up in the South, raised by his strong mother and \nreinforced through his service in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  And for those who say you cannot be a successful politician without \nsacrificing some of your principles, I point to my good friend from \nGeorgia. When he finishes his Senate term this year, he will complete \nnearly six decades of publicly elected service, starting with his first \nelection as mayor of his hometown of Young Harris, Georgia, in the late \n1950s.\n  Zell was a popular two-term Governor of Georgia in fact, he was named \nthe most popular Governor in America by The Washington Post in 1998. \nHis popularity came from his successful programs that found national \nacclaim among them was passing the Nation's first ``two strikes and \nyou're out'' law against violent felons, starting the Nation's only \nvoluntary pre-kindergarten program for 4-year-olds, and creating the \nnationally acclaimed HOPE scholarship that has had such tremendous \nsuccess in Georgia.\n  My good friend swept into the Senate to complete the remaining 4 \nyears of the late Senator Paul Coverdell. Many political observers call \nZell the last of the Southern conservative Democrats to serve in the \nSenate. He has certainly established himself as a strong voice for the \nconservative, commonsense approach to issues, reaching across the aisle \nto support tax cuts, improve education, confirm judicial nominations, \nand strengthen national security.\n  Zell is widely known for his straight talk on the issues you know \nwhere he stands and what he stands for, and everything he says comes \nstraight from the heart. I can't tell you how many times a constituent \nfrom my home State of Utah will write to tell me how inspired they were \nby a speech that Zell had given on this Senate floor.\n  I am sorry to see Zell leave, but I am grateful for the service he \nhas given these last 4 years. He is beloved by Georgians, and I know he \nwould have easily been reelected, and he is beloved by millions in \nAmerica. And, last but not least, he is beloved by his colleagues here \nin the Senate.\n\n\n                          Peter G. Fitzgerald\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment of the Senate's time, as \nwe near completion of our duties for the 108th Congress, to honor the \nwork and contribution to Republican Party, the Senate, and the Nation \nof my friend, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Peter Fitzgerald. \nSenator Fitzgerald has chosen to take his youth and talents and serve \nin other areas outside of the Senate. Our loss will be, no doubt, the \ngain of others.\n  Senator Fitzgerald provided a good, youthful, and modern face to the \nRepublican Party. Our party will only stay strong if we maintain within \nit our own diversity of perspectives, and I am grateful for the \ncontribution of Senator Fitzgerald.\n  Elected to the Senate in 1998 at the very young age of 38, the \nSenator immediately added his vigor, intelligence, and experience in \nfinancial markets to address many of the complicated issues faced by \nyour Government and society as the Nation turned into the 21st century.\n  When corporate scandals erupted early in this century, threatening to \nundermine confidence in markets, the Senate was, indeed, fortunate to \nbe able to turn to Senator Fitzgerald for his thoughtful and informed \nguidance. As a former commercial banking attorney, he used his \nexpertise in his positions on the Commerce and Governmental Affairs \nCommittees, particularly his chairmanship of the subcommittee on \nFinancial Management, the Budget and International Security, to chair \nor support numerous hearings to illuminate the problems and necessary \nlegislation we needed to return probity to financial dealings and \nconfidence in our markets. The modern capitalist system is what \nprovides growth and wealth to all the societies of the world, and the \nAmerican markets are the most dynamic in the world. They are also the \nmost diversified, and the vast majority of our citizens depend on them \nfor employment, security and retirement. We owe a\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\ngreat deal of appreciation to Senator Fitzgerald for his work on \ncorporate fraud issues, and I would like to thank him, once again.\n  Senator Fitzgerald is a reformer, through and through. It is his \ndedication to our system of Government and economy that drove him to \nfind ways to improve it. He applied his drive to reform to consumer \nissues, Government affairs, financial management, and the complicated \nmesh of revenue collection that is the current tax system of this \ncountry. And he quite deservedly received numerous acclamations from \ngroups advocating for consumer and tax reform.\n  Through this all, he never lost his focus on his home State. He \ndidn't work for Illinois to get re-elected, he worked for Illinois \nbecause of his dedication to his State and his high standards of public \nservice. A column in the Chicago Tribune, a good paper not known for \nbeing ragingly Republican, commended him for ``elevating courage and \nhonesty to new heights.'' That sounds right to me.\n  I will miss the presence of Senator Fitzgerald, his thoughtful floor \nstatements before this body, and the impeccable manners of a gentleman \nthat are so naturally his. His State can be proud of the Republican \nthey sent to serve too briefly in this body. We will miss his \nintelligence and dedication, and I will miss a good Senator and friend. \nI expect that, with his relative youth, we will hear much more of Peter \nG. Fitzgerald.\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my sincere gratitude for \nhaving had the opportunity to serve with Senator Don Nickles, and to \nwish him the very best as he retires from the Senate.\n  A lot of descriptive words come to my mind when I think of Don \nNickles. Among the most prominent are courageous, knowledgeable, and \nengaging. All three of these, as well as many other of Don Nickles' \nqualities, will be sorely missed in the United States Senate.\n  I can think of no other Member of the Senate who has been a more rock \nsolid beacon for conservatism than Don Nickles. His is the kind of \ncourage that leads him to speak up alone against the whole world, if \nnecessary, for what he believes. No matter what the issue or whether it \nis brought up on the floor of the Senate, in one of his committees, or \nin some other forum, Don Nickles is willing to speak up in his earnest \nyet friendly manner to ask questions, raise concerns, and stand up for \nconservative principles. Senator Nickles has been one of the most \narticulate Senators I have seen in my 28 years of service in the \nSenate. His voice, in defense for what he and many of us believe to be \nright, will be noticeably absent in the months and years to come.\n  Senator Nickles is also one of the most knowledgeable Members of this \nbody. I have long been impressed with his grasp of minute details of \neconomic, tax, and budget issues. His major committee assignments, \nBudget, Finance, and Energy, all cover complex issues that can take a \nhuge amount of effort to master. Yet, Don clearly does his homework and \nseems totally at ease in discussing details of the budget or a \ncomprehensive tax bill. As chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nNickles has served with distinction. With all the challenges facing the \nbudget in the recent past, Don has presided over that committee in \nparticularly trying times. Yet, he has exhibited patience and \nperseverance in the midst of a number of very difficult problems. Every \ncitizen of this country owes him a debt of gratitude for his service on \nour behalf.\n  Don Nickles is also one of the most engaging individuals I have had \nthe privilege of knowing. His quick smile and friendliness to not only \nother Senators, but also to Senate staff and to everyone he meets marks \nhim as a genuinely fine individual. I know Don has a deep faith in God \nand strives to do his best to live according to his convictions.\n  As Senator Nickles moves on toward the next stage in his impressive \ncareer, I wish him the very best and hope that we have the opportunity \nto see him regularly and to have the benefit of his wisdom and \nknowledge for many years to come.\n\n\n                              Tom Daschle\n\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to say a few words \nabout our friend and colleague, the distinguished minority leader, \nSenator Tom Daschle.\n  Tom's commitment to public service, on behalf of the people of South \nDakota and America, is an example I hope more citizens will follow. He \nserved here as a Senate staff member before being elected to the House \nof Representatives in 1978. South Dakota is one of just seven States \nwith a single House member, which required Tom to run a statewide race. \nThat was familiar territory for him when he ran for and won his Senate \nseat in 1986. Tom is one of 49 Senators who previously served in the \nother body, experience which I believe enhances their service here and \nmakes the Senate more effective in serving all Americans.\n  Yesterday, our colleague Senator Durbin said that it is hard to \nimagine the Senate without Tom Daschle. Some might merit that \ncompliment because of the sheer length of their tenure. Tom merits it \nbecause of the presence he quickly established, both as a Member and as \na leader in this body. He was only 2 years into a second term when his \nfellow Democrats elected him their leader by just one vote. Only Lyndon \nJohnson became his party's leader more quickly.\n  Tom's 10 years as Democratic leader included periods as both majority \nand minority leader. Those positions, especially in a narrowly divided \nchamber, are each very challenging and each very different. Tom served \nin each post with class and determination, unifying his caucus and \nworking to achieve their agenda. Needless to say, we have not agreed on \nevery element of that agenda. But in this political world, it is really \na compliment to say that Tom effectively and skillfully used whatever \ntools were available to fight for what he believed and for what his \ncaucus wanted to achieve. Even when we were at loggerheads, when it \nseemed like the irresistible force was meeting the immovable object, \ncivility has always marked Tom Daschle's presence in this body, as a \nSenator and as a leader.\n  I was gratified to hear Senator Daschle's comments on this floor \nyesterday and a few things really stood out. First, I was struck by the \nfact that he his number in the chronological list of United States \nSenators is 1776. Tom offered the valuable reflection that he is, as we \nall are, part of the broad sweep of American history, from the American \nrevolution to the 108th Congress and into the future.\n  Second, Tom asked a very important question, whether our power comes \njust from military might or also from wisdom, compassion, tolerance, \nand willingness to cooperate. Everyone who serves in this body should \nmaintain that perspective.\n  Third, Tom spoke of what he called the politics of the common ground. \nIndividual Senators, as well as the two political parties, have certain \nbottom-line issues, certain fundamental principles or positions on \nwhich they just find little room to give. But on others, and I \nsometimes wonder whether this list is longer than we might think, we \nmust practice the politics of common ground. Reminding us of that was, \nby itself, an act of leadership by the minority leader.\n  And finally, he told us of a note he wrote on one of his famous \nunscheduled driving trips across his State. He wrote, ``Everything was \nworth doing.'' Each of us who has worked alongside Tom Daschle, whether \non the same or opposing sides, knows that this is his approach to, and \nattitude about, public service. That sets a good example for us all.\n\n\n                               Bob Graham\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with the close of the 108th Congress, the \nSenate will lose to retirement one of our most respected and admired \nMembers, Senator Bob Graham of Florida.\n  I remember how impressed we were in 1987 when Bob came to the Senate \nafter two terms as an enormously popular Governor of Florida. From the \nstart, he made his mark in this body as a serious and diligent \nlegislator--a classic workhorse Senator rather than show-horse Senator.\n  One of his greatest accomplishments was the passage, 4 years ago, of \ncomprehensive legislation to restore and protect the Florida \nEverglades. This was Bob Graham at his very best: forging a bipartisan \nconsensus, and crafting a unique partnership among\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\nFederal, State and local governments as well as private industries and \nlandowners. This will be a living monument to Senator Bob Graham: a \nrestored and revitalized Everglades.\n  I first got to know Bob Graham back in 1977, a decade before he came \nto this body. At the time, he was a state senator down in Florida, \nplanning to run for Governor the following year. He had heard about my \nwork days, an idea that I originated when I was running for Congress in \n1974. I had spent dozens of work days--as a cop on the beat, \nconstruction worker, farmer, nurse's aide, and many other professions. \nIt was a great way to get in touch with ordinary working Iowans and \ntheir concerns.\n  I remember Bob coming by my office over in the Cannon House Office \nBuilding. He was a very serious man, very analytical and thorough. He \nasked all the right questions. And a couple weeks later, he sent me his \nplan to conduct 100 work days during his campaign for Governor. I told \nhim, as tactfully as I could, that was way too many, that he would \nnever be able to do it. But Bob went ahead with his plan. He did, \nindeed, conduct 100 work days. He did, indeed, get elected Governor of \nFlorida. And I learned never to underestimate Bob Graham.\n  By the way, Bob's work days didn't stop there. As Governor and United \nStates Senator, he went on to complete nearly 400 work days, serving as \npolice officer, teacher, garbage man, busboy, hurricane relief worker, \nyou name it. Bob swears by the value of these days--as I do. In fact, \nin 1997, he spent one work day as a U.S. Customs inspector at the port \nin Tampa. This opened his eyes to the extreme vulnerability of our \nports to crime, drug trafficking, and terrorist strikes.\n  And the work days continue. Last month, Senator Graham spent a day as \na high school civics teacher in Miami. And just this past weekend, he \nspent a day as a bookseller in Coral Gables.\n  All of which is typical of Bob Graham. He may be retiring from the \nSenate, but he is not a retiring man. He continues to be a workhorse \nand a whirlwind of activity. His new book, Intelligence Matters, has \nstirred up controversy by shining a spotlight on the Saudi royal \nfamily's connections to terrorism.\n  The fact is Bob is leaving the Senate at the very top of his game, \nespecially in the field of intelligence and homeland security. After \nthe September 11 attacks, it was Senator Graham who proposed the \ncreation of a joint House-Senate inquiry into the intelligence failures \nleading up to the attacks. Senator Graham ended up serving as cochair \nof that historic effort, and he did just a brilliant job of keeping the \ninquiry bipartisan, focused on the facts, focused on solutions.\n  Meanwhile, events have vindicated Senator Graham's principled stand \nas one of only 23 Senators to vote in October 2002 against the \nresolution to authorize the use of force against Saddam. At the time, \nhe argued passionately that the war on terrorism should be our highest \npriority. He insisted that al Qaeda was the real threat to America, and \nthat an attack on Iraq would be a detour and distraction from the war \non terrorism. And, as usual, Bob Graham was exactly right. The Senate \nfailed to heed his warnings. I failed to heed his warnings. And, as a \nresult, Osama bin Laden remains at large, al-Qaida and the Taliban are \nreconstituting themselves, and our Armed Forces are bogged down in a \nquagmire in Iraq.\n  So, no question, with Bob Graham's retirement, the Senate is losing \none of its most talented and respected members. Over the years, Bob and \nAdele have become wonderful friends, and those friendships will \ncontinue. But I will miss the day-to-day association on the floor with \nBob.\n  As I said, you have to respect the fact that Bob Graham is leaving \nthe Senate at the very top of his game. I wish Bob and Adele all the \nbest.\n\n\n                              John Breaux\n\n  Mr. President, there are not many things on which all Senators agree. \nBut on one thing, there is universal, bipartisan agreement in this \nbody: We are going to miss Senator John Breaux when he retires at the \nend of the 108th Congress.\n  Make no mistake, John Breaux is a tremendously accomplished Senator, \nwith scores of legislative achievements and accomplishments. He is a \nSenator's Senator. But when I think of John Breaux, I think first and \nforemost of his character, his unique way with people, and his \nwonderful good nature.\n  You can disagree with John, but you can never dislike him. He has a \nknack for taking disagreements and disputes, and turning them into \ndeals to move people forward. This is a priceless talent--a special \nskill--and I have never met another politician who could match John \nBreaux's gifts in this regard.\n  For John, politics is not something you do with clinched teeth. \nPolitics is a joy. Politics is fun. They used to call Hubert Humphrey \nthe ``happy warrior.'' And that is very much the spirit that John \nBreaux has always brought to his work in the Senate. However, John \nwould rather not make war on other Senators; he would rather cut a \nconstructive deal that gets things done for ordinary people.\n  Of course, these personal qualities have allowed John Breaux to be an \namazingly effective Senator for his State of Louisiana. When John comes \nto you, when he tells you he needs help on a measure critical to his \nState, it is mighty hard to say no. Frankly, many times I have had a \npreconceived notion against the oil and gas industries, and I have \nopposed what they are trying to do on this or that bill. But John \nBreaux would come to see you, he talks it through, and next thing you \nknow, you find yourself supporting him. He is just so effective in that \nkind of one-on-one persuasion. And, time and again, Louisiana has been \nthe big winner.\n  Another hallmark of John Breaux in the Senate has been his \ncommonsense centrism. John is a man of strong principles, but he is not \nrigid and he certainly is not an ideologue. The questions John asks \nare, ``What is practical?'' ``What is going to work in the real \nworld?'' ``What can we bring people together on, in order to make a \npositive difference?''\n  Typical of Senator Breaux was his proposal a couple years ago to \naddress the problem of 54 million Americans without health insurance. \nHe called for universal health care. But he kept it practical. He \nproposed that all Americans have access to a basic, government-defined \ninsurance package similar to what members of Congress and our staffs \nget from the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. And he proposed tax \ncredits to make premiums more affordable for middle- and lower-income \ncitizens.\n  Perhaps it is symbolic that John Breaux is leaving the Senate at this \ntime. As we saw this week in the conference on the FSC bill, the spirit \nof compromise and the art of constructive accommodation seem to be \ndying in the Senate--and even more so in the House. Increasingly, the \nattitude around here is ``my way or the highway.'' And that is not the \nSenate that I have loved over the years. That is not healthy for our \ndemocracy.\n  The shame is that John Breaux is leaving at exactly the time when we \nneed his talents more than ever. In fact, we need a dozen John Breauxs \naround here to heal this body, to show people how to rise above \npartisanship in the best interests of the country.\n  So I will miss John's presence in the Senate. We will all miss him. \nBut John Breaux is the youngest 60-year-old person I have ever met. And \nyou can bet that he has many challenges and opportunities still ahead \nof him. John and Lois have been, and will continue to be, wonderful \nfriends. And I wish them all the best.\n\n\n                           Ernest F. Hollings\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in tribute to \nSenator Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings. I will miss my good friend from \nSouth Carolina who in 2003, at the age of 81, finally became his \nState's senior Senator--after 36 years as a junior Senator.\n  In addition to being remembered as a coauthor of the Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings legislation that cut tens of billions of dollars from the \nFederal budget deficit, Fritz Hollings has left an indelible mark on \nour Nation in the areas of health care, environmental protection, \nresource conservation, technology development, job creation, \ntransportation security, and law enforcement, to name a few.\n  Immediately after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on \nAmerica,\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\nSenator Hollings worked to protect the safety of our traveling public \nby authoring the Aviation Security Act which created the Transportation \nSecurity Administration. Similarly, recognizing that America's ports \nand borders were our Nation's weak security links, Senator Hollings \nchampioned legislation to increase security at America's ports.\n  As the father of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nSenator Hollings recognized the extent to which the ocean environment \nsustains us--from human uses in commerce and recreation to being the \noriginal cradle of life on our planet. He knew the importance of taking \nappropriate steps to be responsible stewards of this rich, yet fragile \nresource.\n  His oceans legacy includes authorship of the National Coastal Zone \nManagement Act of 1972, which established Federal policy for protecting \ncoastal areas, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which also became \nthe model for other countries, for the protection of dolphins, sea \notters and other mammals. In a continuing effort to do what is best for \nour ocean environment, Senator Hollings created the U.S. Commission on \nOcean Policy in 2000, to review the accomplishments of the last 30 \nyears, and recommend actions for the future. Upon the issuance of the \nreport, Senator Hollings laid the groundwork for legislation to adopt \nthe recommendations of the Ocean Commission. I am the proud cosponsor \nof two of those measures, S. 2647, the Fritz Hollings National Ocean \nPolicy and Leadership Act, and S. 2648, the Ocean Research Coordination \nand Advancement Act.\n  Beyond the oceans, Senator Hollings worked to make our communities \nand schools safer, through programs such as Community Oriented Policing \nServices--COPS--that put more than 100,000 police officers on the \nstreets in 13,000 communities across the country. The COPS program is \nalso the largest source of dedicated funding for interoperable \ncommunications for public safety officers.\n  Senator Hollings brought competition to the telecommunications arena \nwhich resulted in new services to consumers at affordable rates.\n  I will miss Senator Hollings' wisdom, vision, and wit, but, most of \nall, his friendship.\n  I wish Fritz and his wife Peatsy a fond Aloha.\n\n\n                              don nickles\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Don Nickles first came to the Senate in \n1980 as a young man of 31 with a vision. He now leaves us, 24 years \nlater, with a record we all can envy and a reputation we all should \nemulate. There are a lot of words that can be used to describe this \nman. Perhaps these five describe him best: ``As good as his word.''\n  In his eloquent eulogy to Ronald Reagan this summer, Don said that \nthose who came to Washington after the watershed election of 1980, \n``considered ourselves part of the soldiers in the field trying to get \nan agenda done to expand freedom.''\n  There is no more noble an agenda than the expansion of freedom, and \nhe has been a devoted soldier to that cause. He has been a strong \nadvocate for our Armed Forces, dedicated to the defense of our Nation \nand to the expansion of liberty around the world.\n  He has been equally devoted to the freedom that comes from \nresponsible, less intrusive and more accountable government. He is a \nchampion of effective economic-growth policies, and of tax reform that \nencourages investment and helps build strong families and communities. \nDon Nickles has always been of the side of the American people. His \ntenure as chairman of the Budget Committee will long be held up as a \nmodel of effective leadership, a cooperative spirit wedded to rock-\nsolid principles.\n  Don comes from a small State and from a background in small business. \nThat we have not always agreed on every issue is insignificant. What \ndoes matter is the values we share and the friendship that is the \nresult.\n  Don is much more than just an especially effective legislator and a \nvery good friend. When Oklahoma City was struck by a heinous act of \nterrorism in 1995, he was there for the people of his State, offering \ncomfort and support. The rebuilding, both material and spiritual, would \nnot have been so quickly and thoroughly accomplished without the \nstrength of Don Nickles.\n  He came here as a young man and, despite the passage of 24 years, \nleaves as a young man. And, I might add, as a pretty fast man. In the \nNew York Marathon last weekend, Oklahoma's senior senator finished in \nthe top half of a field of more than 36,000 runners. If there was a \ncaucus for Senators able to run more than 26 miles in less than 4\\1/2\\ \nhours, I believe it would be the smallest in the history of the \nrepublic.\n  Thank you, Senator Don Nickles, for your service to this institution \nand to this country. Whatever path the future sets before you, I know \nyou will be at the front of the pack.\n\n\n                            ernest hollings\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a legend of \na man who has spent his career dedicated to working for the great \npeople of South Carolina. There is nothing small about Senator \nHollings. From his height, to his storied career, to his large booming \nvoice and southern drawl you can always hear calling ``yea'' or ``nay'' \nduring rollcall votes, Senator Hollings is a giant. A reporter once \nsaid that if you sent to central casting for a Senator, you got Fritz \nHollings. I have had the pleasure of serving with Senator Hollings for \nall 30 of my years in the Senate and during that time he, and his wife \nPeatsy, have been dear friends.\n  Before setting foot in this Chamber, Senator Hollings had amassed a \ncareer that any man would be proud of. He attended the Citadel, the \nMilitary College of South Carolina, and upon his graduation in 1942 \naccepted a commission in the U.S. Army. He served our country honorably \nin the campaigns in North Africa and Europe during World War II, and \nreceived a Bronze Star for his valor. Senator Hollings began his \npolitical career when he was 26 as he was elected to the South Carolina \nHouse of Represenatives. During his second term he was voted Speaker \npro tempore and a short 4 years later he was elected lieutenant \ngovernor. In 1958 at age 36 was elected as Governor, the youngest \nGovernor of South Carolina in the 20th Century.\n  Senator Hollings was first elected to Senate in 1966 and has \nsubsequently been re-elected to six additional terms, making him the \nninth longest serving Member of this body. Throughout his entire career \nthe Senator has been a leader, fighting to protect our ports, our \nneighborhoods and American manufacturing jobs. He has been an outspoken \nadvocate for fiscal responsibility, civil rights and against hunger.\n  In 1974, he led the creation of the Women, Infants and Children--\nWIC--nutritional assistance program. In 1978, he sponsored legislation \nand helped secure funding for South Carolina's first National Park, \nCongaree Swamp. He has stood tall in protecting our oceans and coasts, \nhe authored the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Oceans Act of \n2000, which created the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy.\n  Since 1967 Senator Hollings has been a member of the Commerce \nCommittee and from his coauthorship of the 1996 Telecommunications Act \nthat deregulated the telecom industry to his work on the FTC ``Do Not \nCall List,'' he has consistently looked out for the best interest of \nconsumers. In 2000, Senator Hollings and I, along with Senators \nSarbanes and Wyden, were successful in beating back the wholesale \nfederal preemptions of State consumer protection laws during \nnegotiations of the E-Commerce bill which I sponsored.\n  Senator Hollings is the longest serving Democrat on the Budget \nCommittee, and is the only Democrat to have served on the committee \nevery year since its creation. In 1984 Senator Hollings collaborated \nwith Senators Phil Gramm and Warren Rudman to establish the Gramm-\nHollings-Rudman deficit reduction legislation that helped reduce the \ndeficit by $70 billion in its first year of enactment.\n\n  I have had the pleasure to serve with Senator Hollings on the \nAppropriations Committee, where he has served since 1971, and is \ncurrently 3rd highest ranking member. From this position he has helped \nimportant initiatives both in South Carolina and nationally, such as a \ncause I have always strongly supported, the battle against cancer. \nSenator Hollings helped create a nationwide program to screen women for \nbreast and cervical cancer and worked to establish a cancer center at \nthe Medical University of South Carolina that bears his name.\n\n[[Page S11704]]\n\n  Earlier this fall more than 600 friends came together to celebrate \nSenator Hollings's career in the Senate, an event that raised $2 \nmillion for the Hollings Cancer Center. We toasted his accomplishments \nand his incredible career of public service that has spanned more than \nfive decades in State and national politics. I joined this body in 1974 \nand I immediately learned that Senator Hollings is a man that always \nspeaks his mind. His straightforward manner, dynamic personality and \nunwavering integrity are qualities that make me proud to call him my \nfriend. I have valued his friendship and his camaraderie over these \npast 30 years, and I wish Fritz and his wife Peatsy the best of lives \nin their beloved South Carolina.\n\n\n                              john breaux\n\n  Mr. President, the State of Louisiana has a proud history of sending \nremarkable public figures to serve in the Senate. Louisiana has elected \nleaders that have been influential in guiding the direction of our \ncountry. Our colleague John Breaux is a man from this same mold. For \nmore than 30 years the senior Senator from Louisiana has represented \nhis State in Washington, with 18 years as a Member of this body, and 14 \nyears of service in the House of Representatives. In that time, he has \nalways been willing to reach across the aisle to bring our colleagues \ntogether and his leadership has produced a list of impressive \nlegislative accomplishments.\n  As chairman and then as ranking member of the Special Committee on \nAging, Senator Breaux has fought tirelessly for the rights of older \nAmericans, working to reform and protect both Social Security and \nMedicare. The senior Senator from Louisiana has also provided strong \nleadership within the Senate during his 8-year tenure as deputy chief \nwhip. His repeated election to this position speaks to the respect that \nour colleagues have for Senator Breaux's ability to routinely bring \ntogether Members with differing opinions to build a consensus.\n  One of Senator Breaux's lasting legacies will be the leading role he \nhas taken with regard to environmental conservation. In 1990, the \nSenator authored the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and \nRestoration Act, which provides for the restoration of the vital \ncoastal wetlands of Louisiana and has since become known as the Breaux \nAct. This legislation was passed during his first term in the Senate \nand has since been renewed. More recently, Senator Breaux has supported \nlegislation that would help protect coastal regions from the impact of \noffshore oil and gas exploration.\n  In our many years of service together, Senator Breaux and I have had \nthe opportunity to work closely on a wide range of issues. We both have \nbeen actively involved in telecommunications legislation, and \ncollaborated on legislation that authorized reform of the telephone \nindustry. I am particularly appreciative of Senator Breaux's unwavering \nsupport for legislation opposing the use of antipersonnel landmines, an \nissue of great significance to me personally and to the safety of \nmillions of people around the world.\n  I am proud of the body of legislation that Senator Breaux and I \nadvanced together throughout our shared time in the Senate. I commend \nSenator Breaux for his dedication to being a watchdog for American \nseniors, for his legacy of environmental protection in Louisiana, and \nfor his record of public service on behalf of his fellow Louisianans. \nThe Senate and the people of Louisiana are losing a dedicated public \nservant and exceptional leader. I congratulate the Senator on a \nremarkable congressional career and wish him continued success in his \nfuture endeavors.\n  On a personal level, John and Lois Breaux are good friends. Marcelle \nand I share the joy of telling grandchildren stories--and even of \nborrowing Mardi Gras costumes. I quickly realized in wearing one that \nyou needed the special Cajun flavor of Louisiana to carry it off. John \ncan do that one day at a Mardi Gras party and the next day handle on \nthe floor the most complex issue facing the Finance Committee. He is a \nSenator's Senator.\n\n\n                               Bob Graham\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the end of this Congress we will bid \nfarewell to distinguished members of this body who have served their \nStates and their country with honor. I rise today to pay tribute to the \nSenior Senator from Florida, a man who has been a leader in the Senate \non national intelligence issues, prescription drugs and the environment \nand has been a strong voice in this body on behalf of the interests of \nhis fellow Floridians.\n  For more than four decades Senator Graham has been a leader in \nFlorida politics, serving his State as a State representative and \nSenator, as Governor and as a United States Senator. For 18 years \nSenator Graham has compiled an impressive record of leadership while \nserving as chairman and ranking member of the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, chairman of the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and as a senior member of the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  Since 1974, Senator Graham has completed more than 400 ``Workdays,'' \nwith Floridians around his State. During these workdays the Senator \nspends working alongside his constituents, the personal interaction \nhelps him understand the challenges that Floridians face. These visits \nclearly have provided Senator Graham with an opportunity to recognize \nthe community values and hard work that are exhibited and shared by his \nconstituents. These jobs have gone everywhere from garbage loader to \nshort order cook. No Senator has done anything similar.\n  From his position on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Graham has \npicked up the torch for causes supported by another respected Floridian \nClaude Pepper, the former Senator and Congressman. He has supported \nproviding affordable prescription drugs to Americans and has advocated \nfor a common sense approach to Medicare that focuses on wellness and \npreventative health. Senator Graham has increased access to the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and has pushed Congress to live up \nto its commitment to support social services.\n  Both as Governor and Senator, Bob Graham has been dedicated to \nprotecting the environment. He has helped direct millions of dollars to \nprotect the Everglades, restore wetlands and promote responsible \ndevelopment. In the Senate, Bob Graham has voiced opposition to \ndrilling on the Outer Continental Shelf and for an end to the harmful \npractice of dredging in the Apalachicola River.\n  For those of us that have served with Senator Graham in the Senate we \nhave admired his hard work and dedication to his constituents. We join \nhim now in celebrating his eighteen successful years in this body, a \nperiod of time that is one part of a career of service to the State of \nFlorida. As Senator Graham moves out of the public eye, he leaves \nbehind a legacy of accomplishment that will be forever remembered by \nhis fellow Americans and Floridians. He also leaves a reputation of \nintegrity and insight. History will show that this country should have \nlistened to his warnings about the failed intelligence leading up to \nthe war in Iraq.\n\n\n                              John Edwards\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service of Senator John \nEdwards of North Carolina.\n  Because of his time on the campaign trail, Senator Edwards' biography \nis well known to most Americans. He is the son of a mill worker and was \nthe first in his family to attend college. Before coming to the Senate, \nJohn fought for victims' rights against insurance companies for more \nthan 20 years in North Carolina. He enjoyed great success in that \ncareer, but seeking to do more for the people of his State, he decided \nto run for the Senate in 1998. John ran against, and defeated, an \nincumbent Senator, Senator Faircloth. Immediately upon arriving in the \nSenate, Senator Edwards began to make an impact.\n  Only a few days after Senator Edwards was sworn in, I asked him to \nhelp depose witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Clinton. I \nwanted to make sure we had the best, and I thought he was. It was \nJohn's career experience that made him an ideal choice to assist in the \ndepositions, and he had recent experience working in the trenches. In \nthat pressure filled situation John won the respect of all of his \ncolleagues, both on this side of the aisle and the other.\n  From his seat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee,\n\n[[Page S11705]]\n\nSenator Edwards advocated for lowering the cost of prescription drugs \nfor all Americans by improving access to generic medications. In 2001, \nhe authored the Patients' Bill of Rights which would have guaranteed \nthat people in HMOs and other insurance plans get the health care they \npay for. Unfortunately, this was passed in the Senate but blocked by \nthe White House. In addition to serving on the HELP Committee, Senator \nEdwards served on the Intelligence, Small Business, and Judiciary \nCommittees.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Edwards worked \nclosely with me on a number of legislative efforts. He was a cosponsor \nof the Innocence Protection Act, the National Amber Alert Network, and \na strong voice on judicial nominations. Senator Edwards has stood up to \nefforts by this President to pack the courts with people whose records \ndo not demonstrate that they will be fair judges to all who come before \nthem, rich or poor, Democrats or Republicans, or any race or \nbackground.\n  In September of 2003, Senator Edwards announced that he was running \nfor President. John ran a great campaign, raising issues important to \nthe American people. He frequently referred to the division of America \ninto two halves, that of the haves and that of the have-nots. John \nfocused on the struggles of the middle class and many of the same \nissues that he was a leader on during his time in the Senate. \nThroughout the campaign, John was a positive voice for our party, and \nhe was an excellent choice as a running mate for John Kerry.\n  In an interview, John once said that he had an ideal image of what a \nU.S. Senator should be. He said that ``I think about a fiery advocate, \nsomeone who works passionately for his constituents.'' For the past 6 \nyears, John has been exactly that. Be it health or education reform, \nsupporting farmers or North Carolina's economic interests, John Edwards \nhas been an incredible leader and advocate for his State. I will miss \nJohn's friendship here in the Senate. I know that he has a wonderful \nwife and three beautiful children, and that whatever steps he takes \nnext that he will be just fine as long as he has their support.\n\n\n                        Ben Nighthorse Campbell\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the past 12 years, the Senator from \nColorado has served his State with distinction as a member of this \nbody. Throughout that time, I have been pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague in a number of legislative efforts. He has been a tireless \nadvocate on behalf of Native Americans, for the protection of police \nofficers, and for preserving public lands and natural resources. It is \nbecause of his leadership on these, and many other issues, that the \npresence of the senior Senator from Colorado will be missed in this \nChamber.\n  In 1989, Senator Campbell, then Congressman Campbell, sponsored \nlegislation to create a new museum that would ensure the recognition \nand celebration of Native American culture and history. I am thrilled \nthat earlier this summer we were able to join in the celebration with \nSenator Campbell as the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian \nopened in Washington, DC. I know that none of us will ever forget the \nsight of our colleague in full chief's regalia speaking on the Senate \nfloor on the day the new museum opened.\n  Before serving his State in Washington, Senator Campbell represented \nhis country as the captain of the U.S.-Olympic Judo team, competing in \nthe 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics. While I have never had to witness him \nuse these skills on a fellow member of the Senate, he once helped \nsubdue a suspect that had shoved Senator Thurmond until the Capitol \nPolice arrived.\n  One of Senator Campbell's most noted passions is his enthusiasm for \nmotor vehicles. Senator Campbell has a well documented love of Harley-\nDavidson motorcycles, and Washingtonians have occasionally caught a \nglimpse of the Senator riding around town on his motorcycle. As the \nCapitol Hill newspaper The Hill noted in April of 2003, the Senator \nadded to his vehicle collection last spring when he replaced his 20-\nyear-old Dodge Plymouth last spring with a brand new Mini Cooper. While \nmost Americans may know how the Senator gets around town when he is in \nWashington, far fewer probably know that Senator Campbell was behind \nthe wheel for most of the trip when the 2000 National Holiday Tree was \ntransported from Colorado to Washington, DC on a Mack truck.\n  Senator Campbell and I share a background in law enforcement, he as a \nformer Sacramento County sheriff's deputy in California, and I as a \nState's attorney in Vermont. This background helped bring us together \nto develop the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Acts of 1998 that has \nsince been reauthorized in both 2000 and 2004. Since its inception in \n1999, this highly successful Department of Justice program has provided \nlaw enforcement officers in 16,000 jurisdictions nationwide with nearly \n350,000 new bulletproof vests.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Campbell and I collaborated to produce the \nLaw Enforcement Officers Safety Act, which will allow qualified active-\nduty law enforcement officers to travel interstate with a firearm, \nprovided that officers are carrying their official badges and \nphotographic identification. I was proud to team up with Senator \nCampbell in writing and introducing the Senate version of the Law \nEnforcement Officers Safety Act that will enable law enforcement \nofficers nationwide to be prepared to answer a call to duty no matter \nwhere, when, or in what form it comes.\n  Senator Campbell has a long and distinguished legislative history as \na Member of the United States Congress. I am proud to have served with \nhim on the Agriculture and Appropriations Committees, and I am proud of \nour partnerships to protect police officers, fight against landmines, \nand to provide funding for the WIC and Head Start programs. I applaud \nthe Senator for his 12 years of service in the Senate and 6 years of \nservice in the House of Representatives, and I congratulate him on a \nremarkable career.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to pay \ntribute to my friend and my colleague, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell.\n  Long before I arrived in the Senate, Ben had proven to be a trusted \nfriend. In my early days as a Senator, our friendship was furthered as \nI sought wise counsel from veteran members like Ben. I found that his \nwisdom and insight on the rules and idiosyncrasies of Capitol Hill were \ninvaluable to my adjustment here. And I must say, I just thoroughly \nenjoy his company. It goes without saying that having to say farewell \nto Ben certainly pulls at my heartstrings.\n  I also sought Ben's aid when I introduced my first legislation to \nfinally offer the Lumbee Indian Tribe Federal recognition. This \nsignificant bill would not have moved forward without the strong \nassistance of the Senator from Colorado. I was moved by Ben's interest \nin the bill, and to this day, I am touched that he remains invested in \nsomething so close to my heart. I am eternally grateful for the role \nhe's played in moving Lumbee recognition one step closer to becoming a \nreality. Ben's commitment to the Native American community is \nunparalleled and is certainly to be commended.\n  Ben's legacy will linger in the halls of the Senate long after he has \nshut the door to his offices. He leaves behind a record of service that \none can only hope to emulate. Coloradoans have benefited from Ben's \ncharacter, conscientiousness and compassion for years, and I know they \nwill welcome him home with open arms.\n  My warmest best wishes to my dear and treasured friend, Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell. There is no doubt that he will be sorely missed, \nnot just by me, but by all of us who have been blessed to call him our \ncolleague and our friend.\n\n\n                              don nickles\n\n  Mr. President, it is an honor to pay tribute to a good friend and \ncolleague who has had such a stellar and effective career in the United \nStates Senate. I am so proud to have worked alongside a man of such \ncharacter and knowledge, and I am certain that I speak for all my \ncolleagues when I say his leadership in Congress will be sorely missed.\n  Don Nickles' career is the classic American success story. After \nworking his way through Oklahoma State University by starting a \njanitorial service, he was elected to the United States Senate in 1980 \nat the age of 31. While serving in Congress, his peers haveconsistently \nshown their confidence in his abilities, electing him to\n\n[[Page S11706]]\n\nseveral leadership posts including senatorial committee Chair, chairman \nof the Republican Policy Committee, assistant majority leader and \nBudget Committee chairman.\n  The day after Don announced he would not seek a fifth U.S. Senate \nterm, the Oklahoma City Daily Oklahoman stated that his retirement \n``will leave Oklahoma without its most powerful Washington advocate.'' \nHow true that is. Over his two-decades-long career, the good that Don \nhas done for his constituency is immeasurable.\n  As a Senator, Don has amassed a tremendous record as an advocate for \ntaxpayers. When our economy was in need of recovery because of a \nrecession compounded by the events of September 11, Don was a leader in \npushing the economic growth and tax relief package through Congress. \nThanks to his efforts, today our economy is on the upswing with jobs \nbeing added, homes being built and small businesses expanding. Don gets \ngreat credit for his role in making that happen.\n  I will always remember Don coming down to Eastern North Carolina to \ncampaign with me at a tobacco warehouse. Asked to speak on stage in \nfavor of the tobacco quota buyout, which of course he did not support, \nhe graciously spoke about how hard I would work to get this done for \nthe State. Don demonstrated his character that day, as he did on so \nmany other days during his many outstanding years as a servant of the \npublic.\n  Don has always used the power of his office for good. I admire the \nway that he has stood for what he believes, no matter the challenge. He \nhas brilliantly served the people of Oklahoma and all Americans with \ncourage and conviction, a stellar example for those who follow in his \nfootsteps. May God bless Senator Don Nickles and his family for many \nyears to come.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues today in \npaying tribute to a man who, in the President's words, ``has left his \nmark on virtually every major issue'' during his service in this body, \nthe senior Senator from Oklahoma, the Budget Committee chairman, our \ncolleague Don Nickles.\n  For more than two decades, Senator Nickles has served the people of \nOklahoma and America with strength of conviction, wisdom, and hard \nwork, every day. I have had the good fortune of serving with the \nSenator from Oklahoma for a decade, particularly closely on the Budget \nand Finance Committee, and for 6 years as his counsel while he was \nmajority whip. I have gotten to know well Senator Nickles' passion and \ninsight, his firm understanding of policy matched with ability to \nplainly articulate it, and his generous sense of humor and warm \npersonality that have made him a colleague no one will soon forget.\n  Oklahoma sent Don Nickles to the Senate in the year of the ``Reagan \nRevolution''--1980. In many ways--and I know the Senator has said so \nhimself--his start in public service was molded and defined by \nPresident Reagan's inspiring vision and love of freedom. Our new 69-\nyear-old President projected a contagious, even youthful optimism. So \ndid the new Senator from Oklahoma, but in Don Nickles' case, it was the \noptimism of youth. At 31, he was the youngest Republican elected to \nthis chamber in American history.\n  Senator Nickles' contributions shepherding the Reagan agenda through \nCongress were immediate and his rise was meteoric. After 6 years he had \nserved as NRSC chairman and was at the helm of the Republican policy \ncouncil.\n  I must say that as Chair of the Small Business Committee, I think it \nis an invaluable asset to the Senate to have a colleague such as \nSenator Nickles who has been there on the front lines of job creation \nas an entrepreneur--starting his own janitorial service to work his way \nthrough Oklahoma State. Before Senator Nickles came to Washington, he \nwas a small businessman from Ponca City, OK. He was already allergic to \nneedless red tape and gridlock. So when Senator Nickles sees a problem, \nhe sets out to solve it--guided by his deeply held principles and \ninformed by a firm grasp of the legislative process.\n  Like the leader he counts as his mentor, President Reagan, the \nSenator from Oklahoma brings to public life his firmly rooted beliefs, \na can-do Heartland optimism, and that rare ability to disagree without \nbeing disagreeable. Senator Nickles is a colleague I will miss, and I \nwish him, his wife Linda, and his family much happiness in the new \nendeavors that lie ahead.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in thanking and honoring Senator \nNickles for over two decades of distinguished service to the country he \nloves and the State he has made proud.\n\n\n                              john breaux\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend and incomparable \ncolleague in both the House and Senate for 26 years, Senator John \nBreaux. The senior Senator from Louisiana leaves this institution \nstronger for having lent his voice and his leadership to these \nChambers. Senator Breaux's commitment to bipartisan statesmanship has \nenriched the Senate, improved the lives of Louisiana families and \nresulted in landmark accomplishments for the American people.\n  Churchill said that ``A pessimist sees the difficulty in every \nopportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.'' By \nthat definition, none can doubt which camp Senator Breaux falls in. He \nis the Senate's most irrepressible optimist. He steps into the breach, \nnot merely in words, but in countless efforts over his tenure in both \nthe House and Senate to make the process work for the people it is \nintended to serve. Where some see hopeless gridlock, Senator Breaux \nalways sees a glimmer of hope and acts on it. Never settling for \ncomplacency, he uses his trademark tenacity and energy to move the \ndeliberative process forward. His is a record of achievement over \nacrimony.\n  I personally was privileged to work closely with Senator Breaux for \nmore than two decades. He and I have always shared a vision of politics \nand public life as positive and constructive endeavors. And we have a \nlong history together, dating back to our days serving in the House of \nRepresentatives, of reaching across the aisle to reach consensus and \nproduce results.\n  In fact, we worked together on such fundamental issues as the Federal \nbudget when Senator Breaux was a member of a moderate, southern \nDemocrat group called the Boll Weevils, and I a member of the northeast \nRepublican Gypsy Moths. Some still wonder why both our groups carried \nthe names of ravenous insects.\n  But it was fortuitous that Senator Breaux and I had this record of \ncooperation because it seemed only natural when we later teamed-up as \ncochairs of the Senate Centrist Coalition, which Senator Breaux founded \nalong with the late Senator John Chafee in 1995 during the Government \nshutdown.\n  So there is no question that I will miss him--we will all miss him--\nbecause we need more leaders such as Senator John Breaux in Congress. \nHe has proven that we can cultivate common ground even out of sometimes \nbarren partisan landscape. And his ability to forge compromises has \nmade possible many signature accomplishments of both Democrat and \nRepublican administrations. Senator Breaux views public service as an \nopportunity to get things done for the people he serves, to make a \ndifference in their lives--whether it was reforming welfare to help \nfamilies move from public assistance to self-sufficiency, strengthening \nand saving Medicare and Social Security, preserving wetlands like the \nLouisiana Bayou, or providing tax relief to stimulate to job creation.\n  What has made Senator Breaux so effective is not only his legislative \nacumen, but also his personal bonds with colleagues. The Senator has \nbrought people together with his self-effacing wit, his candid \napproach, and his eagerness to reach out to colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle. So it is not surprising that he departs the Senate with the \nrespect, trust and affection of Senators across the political spectrum.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to have served alongside Senator \nBreaux, and I wish him, his wife Lois, and their entire family all the \nbest in their future endeavors.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, nearly 26 years ago, I arrived in \nWashington as a newly elected Congressman with an urgent desire to help \nthe people of my State but not nearly as much knowledge as I wanted \nabout exactly how to do that.\n  Having good ideas and getting those ideas enacted into law, as my old \nfriend Paul Wellstone used to say, are often\n\n[[Page S11707]]\n\ntwo very different matters. I decided to call on some of my heroes men \nwho were serving in Congress then who had contributed greatly to the \nlife of our Nation and whom I admired. One of those men was Claude \nPepper. Another was Mo Udall. Both shared their time and wisdom \ngenerously with me and gave me advice that has guided me all these \nyears.\n  In 1988, Mo Udall wrote a wonderful book entitled ``Too Funny to be \nPresident.'' I recommend it to anyone, especially those who have the \nprivilege of serving in elected office in our great democracy. The \nability to see humor in one's own circumstances and to share a good-\nnatured laugh with others is essential if you are going to last long in \npublic office.\n  Mo Udall dedicated his book ``to the 3,000 members of Congress living \nand dead with whom I served for nearly three decades.'' As I prepare to \nend my own nearly three decades in Congress, I, too, am deeply grateful \nto all of the Members of Congress living and dead with whom I have had \nthe privilege of serving and from whom I have learned so much.\n  The list of such members is long. In addition to my early mentors, \nClaude Pepper and Mo Udall, it includes members who were gone long \nbefore I was born, but whose legacy is still felt today giants like \nWebster, Clay, and Calhoun.\n  It includes Senators such as Margaret Chase Smith, who had the \ncourage to take on the red-baiting and bullying Senator Joe McCarthy in \n1954 in her famous ``Appeal to Conscience'' speech not far from where I \nstand now.\n  The list includes two Senators who first inspired me to pursue a life \nin public service John and Robert Kennedy and it includes their brother \nand my friend, Senator Edward Kennedy, one of the finest, most capable \nSenators America has ever produced.\n  The list also includes earlier Senate leaders--men such as Lyndon \nJohnson, the ``master of the Senate;'' Mike Mansfield, one of my \npersonal heroes, who showed that progress and bipartisanship are not \nmutually exclusive; and Howard Baker, a master of the art of principled \ncompromise.\n  The list of those who have inspired me includes George Mitchell and \nBob Dole, the two leaders who taught me the most about this job.\n  It includes my fellow South Dakotan, George McGovern; Mark Hatfield, \nwho offered to resign from the Senate rather than cast a vote he could \nnot square with his own conscience; and Jim Jeffords, who showed the \nworld that one person can change history. It also includes Paul \nWellstone, the soul of the Senate; Robert Byrd, as eloquent and \ndetermined defender of our Constitution as has ever lived; and many \nothers.\n  Today, I would like to say a few words about eight additional \nSenators with whom I have served these last historic 6 years, all of \nwhom will be leaving when this Congress ends.\n  Senator Nickels, Senator Campbell, Senator Fitzgerald, and Senator \nMiller, it has been a privilege to work with each of you. You have each \nsacrificed much to serve our Nation and I am sure you will continue to \nserve America well in the years to come.\n  Six Democratic Senators are leaving at the end of this Congress. \nAmong them is our friend, the senior Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                              John Breaux\n\n  I was joking with another friend recently that the good thing about \nJohn Breaux retiring is that maybe now he will finally be able to \nloosen up a little.\n  John's ability to make us laugh even in tough times is a gift we have \nall treasured. Another gift of John's is his ability to find workable \ncompromises on even the most difficult issues. He really is a master of \nthe art of the compromise.\n  A couple of years ago, I read a newspaper article in which John \ntalked about what he might do if he ever left the Senate. He pointed \nout that Huey Long had actually served as Louisiana's Senator and \nGovernor at the same time. I thought when I heard that that maybe John \nwould never leave the Senate; he would just diversify. Regrettably, he \nis leaving now.\n  I know that serving as Ambassador to France has always been high on \nJohn's list of post-Senate dream jobs. I understand that a few years \nback, John asked President Clinton, ``Do you think I could handle \nFrance?'' to which President Clinton replied, ``The question is whether \nFrance could handle you.''\n  Whatever John Breaux decides to do next, I have no doubt that he will \ncontinue to find ways to serve the people of Louisiana and America. And \nI know he will have a heck of a good time in the process. John and Lois \nare special members of our Senate family, and we wish them all the best \nin the future.\n\n\n                              John Edwards\n\n  We also say goodbye to John Edwards.\n  I think it is probably no coincidence that John Edwards holds Sam \nErvin's old seat in the Senate. Like Sam Ervin, John has a brilliant \nlegal mind and a deep love of justice.\n  In 2001, the first bill Democrats brought to the floor after we \nretook the majority was the Patients' Bill of Rights. I couldn't \nbelieve my luck: My first bill as majority leader--the Patients Bill of \nRights and I was able to tap as floor leaders Ted Kennedy and John \nEdwards. It was like looking down the bench and seeing Babe Ruth and \nWillie Mays. You just knew the Patients' Bill of Rights was finally \ngoing to pass the Senate. And it did--in large part because of John \nEdwards' remarkable skill and deep personal commitment.\n  I think one of the great lines in American literature is the line \nnear the end of ``Death of a Salesman'' where Willie Loman's wife Linda \nsays her husband wasn't famous or powerful, but he was a good man to \nwhom respect must be paid. That same conviction is what has motivated \nJohn Edwards' whole life: The belief that there is dignity and worth in \nevery person, including people who work hard every day in mills, and \nfactories, and farms.\n  In his race for the Democratic Presidential nomination and with John \nKerry as our party's Vice Presidential nominee, John Edwards brought a \nsense of hope and optimism to millions and millions of Americans.\n  John and Elizabeth Edwards both won places in our hearts immediately, \nand our hearts and prayers are with them and their wonderful children \ntoday as Elizabeth continues her recovery from breast cancer. We look \nforward to spending many more happy years with them. We also look \nforward to the good work we know they will do for our Nation in the \nyears ahead.\n\n\n                               Bob Graham\n\n  The best way I found to stay in touch with the people who elected me \nwas to drive through every county in South Dakota every year and just \ntalk to whomever I ran into about whatever was on their mind. Bob \nGraham found an equally effective way of staying in touch with average \nFloridians. He calls them workdays. He would spend a day working in \nanother job.\n  This year, he worked his 400th workday. He spent that day the same \nway he spent his first workday 30 years ago: as a teacher. That is \nappropriate because, in fact, Bob's entire career has been a living \nlesson in public service.\n  A while back, I was looking over the list of Bob's workday jobs and I \nhave to tell you, I am amazed! Think about all the things he has done: \nNASA payload specialist, firefighter, bagel maker, bullet-proof vest \nmaker, pea picker, phosphate miner, Air Force Special Operations \ngunner, circus worker elf!\n  Clearly, it wasn't lack of other career options that has kept Bob in \nthe Senate for 18 years. What is kept him here is simple. It is his \nlove of Florida, and of this country. It is a sense of responsibility \nthat he inherited from his father and that has animated his whole life.\n  Bob Graham is a moderate with a capital M. And he is one of the \nnicest people you could ever meet. But when it comes to the people of \nFlorida, when it comes to doing right by America, strengthening \nAmerica's economy, creating good jobs, investing in children, and \nstanding up for America's veterans and military families, Bob Graham is \na fierce fighter. And when it comes to protecting our Nation from \nterrorism, he is a heavyweight fighter. America is safer today because \nof his courage and tenacity.\n  I suspect the only people who could possibly be sadder about Bob's \nretirement than the members of our caucus are the people who make those \nFlorida ties! We wish Bob and Adele the very best of luck in all their \nfuture endeavors.\n\n[[Page S11708]]\n\n                            Ernest Hollings\n\n  Another remarkable Senator who is retiring this year is Fritz \nHollings.\n  I used to joke with Fritz Hollings that he is the real reason C-SPAN \nfirst started its closed-caption broadcasts. Fritz's deep Charleston \naccent, like the man himself, is an American classic.\n  When you look inside Fritz Hollings' desk on the Senate floor, you \nsee the names of giants: John Calhoun, Huey Long, Russell Long, Wayne \nMorse--courageous men who never hesitated to speak their minds. Fritz \nhas earned the right to stand with those legends.\n  He was 36 years old when he was elected Governor of South Carolina. \nAs Governor, he wrote the book on governing in the New South. He raised \nteacher salaries, invested in education and training, and laid the \nfoundation for South Carolina's economic transformation from an \nagrarian State to a high-tech, high-wage State.\n  One of the amazing things about Fritz Hollings is how often he has \nbeen able to see the future before others--not just on matters of race, \nbut on issue after issue.\n  He was the first Deep South Governor to acknowledge the existence of \nwidespread hunger in his State. He was also the first southern Governor \nto understand that you can't create a modern economy simply by cutting \ntaxes, you have to invest in education and training.\n  He has been a relentless advocate of balanced budgets and fiscal \ndiscipline since long before they became political buzzwords. In 1984--\nyears before Ross Perot uttered the words Fritz Hollings made deficit \nreduction a central plank in his Presidential bid.\n  He has been fighting for fair trade, and against the export of \nAmerican jobs, his entire career. He has been calling for a long-term, \ncomprehensive energy plan since before the first OPEC oil crisis in \n1973. He wrote America's first fuel-efficiency standards--in 1975.\n  He was in the forefront of the movement to protect America's oceans \nin the early 1970s. He saw the future of telecommunications before a \nlot of Americans knew what ``surfing the Internet'' meant. He was \npushing for increased port and air security before September 11.\n  If some people have occasionally found Fritz a little difficult to \nunderstand, I suspect it was not so much because of his wonderful \nCharleston accent but because he was so often ahead of his time.\n  Now Fritz and Peatsy are moving home to live full time in their \nbeloved South Carolina, but they will always have a special place in \nthe Senate family. We wish them the very best.\n  I have to be honest, Mr. President, it was not my wish to depart with \nthese fine Senators. But it has been my honor and a joy to serve with \nthem, and one that I will remember all the days of my life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11708-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11708-S11709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Staff Sergeant Charles ``Chuck'' Kiser\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, over a week ago we celebrated Veterans \nDay. In countless parades, ceremonies, and prayer services, Americans \nhonored and remembered the service and sacrifices of all of those who \nhave answered the call of duty. In the days that have followed, I \ncontinue to be reminded of something President Ronald Reagan said more \nthan 20 years ago, something he said about the brave service men and \nwomen who did not return from the field of battle. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       Their lives remind us that freedom is not bought cheaply. \n     It has a cost; it imposes a burden. And just as they whom we \n     commemorate were willing to sacrifice, so, too must we--in a \n     less final, less heroic way--be willing to give of ourselves.\n\n  That is an important lesson, our willingness to repay the debts we \nwho are left behind owe our fallen soldiers, this notion of giving of \nourselves. It is a lesson the students of McNicholas High School in \nCincinnati have taken to heart.\n  On June 24, 2004, 37-year-old Army SSgt Charles ``Chuck'' Kiser, an \nOhio native and former McNicholas High graduate, lost his life in Iraq \nwhile saving the lives of his comrades.\n  The current students at McNicholas wanted to honor and remember Chuck \nKiser this year on Veterans Day, so they went about raising enough \nmoney to hold a ceremony and fly Chuck's wife Deb and their two \nchildren, Alicia and Mark, from Wisconsin to Ohio, for the services. In \ntheir own way, these students gave of themselves. They reached out to \nthe Kiser family and said we will not forget your husband. We will not \nforget your father. We will not forget him either.\n  Chuck Kiser was a loving husband, doting father, and courageous \nsoldier. He grew up in Amelia, OH, in a home with his father Charles \nand six women--mother Glenda and sisters Chris, Denise, Patty, Teresa, \nand Joy. Some say that living with all those women is what toughened \nhim up and made him into such an outstanding soldier. I imagine that is \nvery true.\n  Their father passed away in 2002. Chuck and his dad were very close. \nChuck followed in his dad's footsteps when he entered the military. The \nelder Charles had served in the Navy and was a Korean War veteran. \nChuck's brother-in-law, Bill Grannen, said that ``[Chuck's] father \ninstilled that kind of love of country and commitment in him. I'm sure \nthey're together now.''\n  Chuck was a runner--and a good one, at that. He began his track \ncareer in the third grade at St. Bernadette School and continued \nrunning through college. At McNicholas High School and at the \nUniversity of Cincinnati, he was a champion sprinter. As a high school \nsenior, he finished in second place in the 200-meter run at the state \nClass AA meet. In fact, he also holds the University of Cincinnati \nrecords for the 300 meter and the 300 yard dash indoors. His former \ncoach, Brett Schnier remembered Chuck as his top recruit and that ``he \ncould run about anything.''\n  After a year at the University, Chuck decided to join the Navy, where \nhe would eventually meet and marry the love of his life, Deb. Chuck \nspent seven years in active duty in the Navy, stationed mostly in \nItaly. It was there that he met Deb, and they fell in love. They \nstarted a family while Chuck continued his military service.\n  Following his time in the Navy, he spent seven years in the Naval \nReserves. Later, he entered the Army Reserve because the base was near \ntheir eventual home in Cleveland, WI.\n  Not only was Chuck Kiser a model soldier, he was a model father. He \nloved his children dearly. He was a great dad. He took joy in coaching \nMark and Alicia in various sports. Last year, Chuck coached a Little \nLeague championship team and would often volunteer to work with youth \nat the Zion United Church of Christ in Sheboygan.\n  Chuck Kiser loved all kids and felt especially strong about helping \nthe children in Iraq. According to his brother-in-law:\n\n       Charles really felt like he wanted to secure their freedoms \n     so they could live without the fear they lived under during \n     the dictatorship. He said that if the situation were \n     reversed, he would hope people would come to liberate his \n     children. He believed that in his heart.\n\n  That is why Chuck never hesitated when he and the rest of his Army \nReserve unit--the 330th Military Police Detachment--were deployed to \nIraq earlier this year. He wanted to defend our Nation, and he wanted \nthe Iraqi people to have the same freedoms he and his family enjoyed. \nChuck was proud to be serving his country. He was proud to help the \nIraqi people in whatever way he could.\n  Staff Sergeant Kiser lost his life helping the Iraqi people and \nsaving the lives of his Comrades. He was on guard duty in Mosul, Iraq \nwhen insurgents began firing from a truck loaded with explosives. Chuck \nreturned fire, but was killed when the truck crashed and exploded. Army \nMajor Mark Magalski noted that Chuck saved countless lives in his final \nact of bravery.\n  Upon Chuck's death, hundreds in his hometown of Amelia gathered to \nshow their support for the Kiser family. At the Clermont County \ncourthouse, signs hung that read, ``God Bless Chuck and the Kiser \nFamily.'' Flags were placed in yards and the community came out to help \nthe Kisers in any way they could.\n  I had the privilege of meeting Chuck's family at the memorial service \nheld in his honor, and I want to thank them for sharing their memories \nwith me. The service was fitting for a man\n\n[[Page S11709]]\n\nso full of life. The family requested that the service be a celebration \nof Chuck's life rather than a time of mourning. As patriotic music \nplayed, thousands paid tribute to this American hero. The service was a \ntestament to the love his community had for this brave man--and a \ntestament to the number of lives he touched.\n  Staff Sergeant Charles Kiser was a good, decent, loving man, who \nprotected our Nation bravely. We will remember him always. I yield the \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Mr. President, as we near the completion of the 108th \nCongress, it is an appropriate time to look back over the last 2 years \nand assess where we are. I think by any standard these have been 2 \nyears marked by great achievement.\n  We have kept Americans safe at home, strengthened our economy, and \nvigorously pursued the war on terror. I would like to take a look back, \nas I indicated, at the legislative accomplishments of the 108th \nCongress.\n  Last year the Senate passed 11 appropriations bills left over from \nthe previous Congress, and then pushed through all the normal 13 \nappropriation bills as well as the emergency wartime and Iraq \nreconstruction supplemental appropriations bill. We responded with the \nnecessary funds to suppress the California fires through a supplemental \nappropriations. In all, the Senate passed 27 appropriations bills into \nlaw last year in the first session alone.\n  The Senate also pushed through the economic growth package, cutting \ntaxes on American families by $350 billion, as well as a revolutionary \nnew Medicare prescription drug bill for all of our seniors. The Senate \nbanned the horrific practice of partial-birth abortion. We passed the \nDo Not Call registry at the Federal Trade Commission. We provided tax \nrelief to military families. We passed the Healthy Forests Act, to stop \nthe catastrophic wildfires that have raged across our country. We \nenacted free trade agreements with Chile and with Singapore, and passed \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  The Senate passed the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization \nto revitalize an air transport industry suffering from the effects of \nthe terrorist attack of 9/11.\n  After witnessing more than a decade of repression, the Senate passed \nthe Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act.\n  We secured significant resources to improve our nation's election \nsystems, making it easier to vote and harder to cheat.\n  We passed the President's faith-based initiative, funded the effort \nto eradicate the scourge of global AIDs, and acted to guard our \nchildren against abduction and exploitation by passing the PROTECT Act.\n  We expanded NATO to include most of the former Warsaw Pact Countries \nand passed a significant arms reduction treaty with our enemy-turned-\nally, Russia.\n  We took steps to bridge the digital divide by providing needed funds \nto historically black colleges, awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to \nUK Prime Minister Tony Blair, and affirmed the constitutionality of \nusing the term ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  And that was last year. This year, in the second session of this \nCongress, we passed into law a pension relief and stabilization plan \nfor private sector businesses, workers, and their retirees.\n  We passed into law a bioshield act to improve countermeasures, like \nvaccines, to protect our people from biological, chemical or other \nterrorist attacks.\n  We passed into law the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.\n  We passed into law a Defense appropriations bill, the Defense \nAuthorization bill, a Homeland Security appropriations bill, and a \nMilitary Construction appropriations bill.\n  We passed a supplemental funding bill for operations in Iraq.\n  And we are about to complete work on the nine remaining \nappropriations bills which successfully concludes action on all Fiscal \nYear 2005 spending bills.\n  We have expanded trade opportunities with new free trade agreements \nwith Australia and Morocco.\n  We have also passed expanded assistance to families with the Working \nFamily Tax Relief Act.\n  We passed the Internet tax bill to prevent the imposition of \ncapricious taxes on internet transactions.\n  We expanded the educational opportunities for disabled children by \npassing an improved IDEA reauthorization.\n  Also, we responded to the findings of the 9/11 Commission by \nimplementing reforms in the Senate and are still considering as we \nfinish this session intelligence reorganization measures which are in \nconference now and being discussed on both sides of the aisle.\n  Last, we passed legislation to revise our tax laws to comply with \ninternational trade agreements and, thus, will remove the European tax \non U.S. manufacturers. Of particular interest to the Senator from the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky, that measure included a buyout to aid our \nlong-suffering tobacco growers, many of which reside in my State.\n  These are the legislative accomplishments of a very productive \nCongress, of which we can be justifiably proud. I want to salute the \neffort of my colleagues who made it so, especially the members of my \ndeputy whip team: Lamar Alexander, Wayne Allard, Conrad Burns, Ben \nCampbell, John Cornyn, Mike Crapo, Mike Enzi, Lisa Murkowski, Gordon \nSmith, John Sununu, Jim Talent, and Craig Thomas.\n  I can't thank them enough for all their hard work, their sound \ncounsel and their tireless effort to help win so many close votes. I \nparticularly want to thank my chief deputy whip, Bob Bennett, my \ntrusted adviser and dear friend for many years here in the Senate.\n  But one man deserves particular recognition. During these tough times \nof economic challenges and armed conflict, America has had to \ndecisively confront some monumental questions.\n  Yet here, in the Senate, the majority had just a one vote margin--one \nvote.\n  But America steered a steady course during the 108th Congress only \nbecause this Senate was able to deliver a ``yes'' when ``yes'' was \nneeded--yes to economic recovery, yes to funding the war on terrorism, \nyes to a Medicare prescription drug benefit,--a resounding ``yes'' to \ngetting the business of America accomplished.\n  And here in the Senate, with the smallest of margins, on the toughest \npossible terrain, on the most pressing questions of our time, it was \nthe tireless Bill Frist who delivered that ``yes'' time and time again.\n  A truly remarkable performance by Senator Frist. He has earned \ncertainly my greatest respect and I think the respect of virtually \neveryone in this body. We are also proud to call him our good friend.\n  I also wish our good friend across the aisle, Harry Reid, great \nsuccess as the new Democratic leader. He is a very able man, a very \nskillful legislator, and a worthy opponent. I and my colleagues look \nforward to working with him in the next Congress.\n  Finally, we cannot conclude the 108th Congress without a sense of \nsadness. There are many--in fact there are too many--great Senators who \nare leaving this institution. I have already had an opportunity to \nexpress my goodbyes to Senator Nickles, Senator Campbell, and Senator \nFitzgerald.\n  I also wish a happy and healthy future to our colleagues across the \naisle, Senator Daschle, Senator Breaux, Senator Hollings, Senator Bob \nGraham, Senator John Edwards, and Senator Zell Miller.

Mr. President, I have served here long enough now that I \nhave witnessed a lot of the comings and goings of many fine public \nservants whom I have known on the floor of the Senate.\n  Today, I would like to comment about those who are leaving us, and I \nwant to start, first, with my good friend from South Carolina. Fritz \nHollings and his wife Peatsy are very close friends of ours. They have \nbeen friends since we first came to the Senate. Fritz and I served in \nWorld War II. We have traveled to places where he served and I served \nin World War II, and we are comrades in the deepest sense of that word.\n  He is a very interesting man. I remember earlier this year, when I \nwas asked to cut a tape to be used at a retirement dinner for Senator \nHollings, I told my press secretary I did not think I could do it. As a \nmatter of fact, I ended up appearing in person. As I told my staff, I \nreally cannot conceive of the Senate without Fritz Hollings. It will be \na different Senate. We have not always agreed, but we have always been \nfriends.\n  There have been good times together. I can remember some of the fish \nthat Fritz and Peatsy caught in Alaska, and I can remember tales about \nsome that they did not catch, the big ones that got away.\n  But I do know that having visited with them in their home in South \nCarolina, and visiting with their friends in Charleston, they have a \nreally great life to go home to. They are wonderful people, and we are \ngoing to miss them a great deal.\n  I will say this, that when I first heard of Senator Hollings, it was \nin a story about his role as Governor of South Carolina. He had become \nGovernor, and as he entered the grounds of the Governor's house, he \nfound there were places inside the grounds where prisoners were kept. \nThere were literally, at that time, I think, cells that were partially \nunderground. Fritz did not like that any more than I would have, and he \nfound ways to free those people and to give them another life. As a \nmatter of fact, I remember meeting one of them who was very devoted to \nSenator Hollings.\n  Senator Hollings is a man with a great heart and a great mind and a \ngreat spirit and a temper almost as bad as mine. We are going to miss \nhim, miss him terribly.\n  I hope he will come back often and visit us. I think he has the \nlongest career of all of those who are retiring, obviously, because he \nis the oldest. But he was one of the Ten Outstanding Men of the Year in \nthe United States when he was young. I don't like to tell stories about \nhim, but I think he actually attended a Republican Convention at one \ntime.\n  As a member of the statehouse, as Governor, and as a member of the \nHoover Commission, he distinguished himself in many ways, in \ncommissions where he was appointed by both President Eisenhower and \nPresident Kennedy.\n  We are losing a man who has had a great role in public service. I \nhope we will all wish him well as he departs the Senate.\n\n\n                              Don Nickles\n\n  Mr. President, another Senator who is leaving us is Senator Don \nNickles. Senator Nickles is a man I first met when I was traveling \nthrough Oklahoma with my friend, Senator Bellmon. Senator Bellmon had \nserved here as a Senator. He served as Governor of his State.\n\n  Senator Nickles, obviously, is a man of great capability, too. As a \nmatter of fact, he is the first Oklahoma Republican Senator to be \nelected for four terms. He has had a commitment to his constituents and \nto his colleagues. He, as I, served as assistant Republican leader. \nThat is the highest leadership position ever held by a Member of the \nSenate from Oklahoma.\n  I particularly remember his role as chairman of the Budget Committee \nand his role in the Finance Committee because no one has been more \nstrenuous in expressing his views concerning the level of spending in \nthe United States and the necessity to have firm budget control over \nthe processes of the Senate, particularly the appropriations process \nwhere I have served a great many years.\n  I do believe his commitment to making Federal Government more \nresponsible and less intrusive, his commitment to the basic Republican \nprinciples that government nearest the people is best, has been \ndemonstrated by his service in the Senate. We are going to have a tough \ntime without his guidance. He, I am sure, will be somewhere near us--at \nleast that is indicated.\n  But having met him even before he ran for the Senate, I felt really a \ngreat warmth of friendship for him because I know how hard he worked to \nbecome a Member of the Senate, and I know his commitment, having left \nhis business and coming here to make a new life.\n  Linda and their four children have been known to all of us in one way \nor the other. I think he has a wonderful family, a wonderful wife, and \nwe wish them well.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska yields the floor and \nsuggests the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I am going to give \na speech on the floor regarding wellness and obesity. Is there a time \nconstraint we are operating under now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a 10-minute time limit in effect now, \nbut it has not been strictly enforced. The Senator may ask for more \ntime.\n\n\n                          WELLNESS AND OBESITY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as the 108th Congress comes to a close, \nmany of us are looking back and asking whether we accomplished all that \nwe might have. Now, of course, we are looking ahead to the next \nCongress for opportunities to move forward with some bipartisan \nagendas. What can we work on together to really do something good for \nour country?\n  The last year has been a challenging one. The campaign season always \nmakes it a little more difficult to accomplish tasks that are already a \nchallenge. It is not surprising, then, that many Members of this body \nlook back on the 108th Congress with mixed feelings. I personally view \nit in which some important opportunities have been missed. But I also \nthink some have been offset by what I detect as an emerging bipartisan \nconcern and interest in some issues that have previously not received \nmuch attention.\n  In particular, I have been heartened by the degree of interest shown \nby my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the issue related to \nobesity, health promotion and prevention of premature death and chronic \ndisease.\n\n  This is very heartening that we see on both sides of the aisle strong \ninterest in promoting wellness, in promoting disease prevention. As I \nhave often said, we in America do not have a health care system; we \nhave a sick care system. If you get sick, you get care, but there is \nprecious little out there to keep you healthy in the first place. All \nthe incentives are to patch you up, fix you, and mend you once you are \nill. There are very few incentives to keep you healthy in the first \nplace.\n  Now with all of the recent revelations on obesity and what that is \ndoing to our society, more and more interest is being shown in what we \ncan do as a Congress to change this paradigm, to change us from a sick \ncare system to a truly health care wellness system in our country.\n  I am confident that in this area, we can make some historic progress, \nagain, on a bipartisan basis in the new Congress that will convene in \nJanuary.\n  I have been working for a long time in this area, but I am not the \nonly one who appreciates the urgency of these issues. For example, the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Frist, has shown a keen interest \nin finding ways\n\n[[Page S11711]]\n\nto fight obesity, and he has taken some leadership positions on this, \nas has the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, who is my colleague \non the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. In fact, \nSenators Frist and Bingaman teamed up to pass the Impact bill in the \nSenate and, if enacted, that bill will be a very positive step forward \nin the fight against obesity.\n  Our colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, who has always been a well \nand very active and fit person himself as a devoted jogger, has also \nintroduced a health promotion bill. It would establish the prevention \nof chronic disease as a major priority for the Federal Government. Our \ncolleagues Senator Wyden, Senator Dodd, Senator Cornyn, and Senator \nKennedy have all been very active on the issues of wellness and obesity \nprevention.\n  My aim right now is not to provide an exhaustive list of Senators who \nare active in this area but to show there is a broad bipartisan \ninterest in the Senate on wellness, health promotion, disease \nprevention, a health care paradigm.\n  We have made some progress this year, but given the scope of the \nobesity epidemic, given the spiraling cost of chronic disease, we need \nto act more robustly, more aggressively in the coming Congress. We \ncurrently spend in excess of $1.8 trillion a year on health care in the \nUnited States. Fully 75 percent of that total is accounted for by \nchronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and \ndepression.\n  What these diseases all have in common is that in so many cases, they \nare preventable. In the United States, we fail to make an upfront \ninvestment in prevention. So what do we do? We spend hundreds of \nbillions of dollars on treatment and disability, hospitalization that, \nin many cases, could have been avoided.\n  Again, as we look globally, we Americans take a great deal of pride \nin our system. We have the best hospitals. I also tend to think we have \nthe best doctors. We certainly excel the rest of the world in \nbiomedical research through the National Institutes of Health and \ndisease prevention through the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, which is the premier body in the world in terms of disease \ncontrol. In fact, other countries look to our own CDC for guidance and \ndirection in that area. If you want to get a heart transplant, a hip \ntransplant, or a lung transplant, you come to America. Or if you want \nto get cancer treatment, you come to America. People come from all \nover. Kings, princes, heads of state, the wealthy, and the well-to-do \nall around the world come here to get treatment.\n\n  I would say if we are keeping a scorecard or report card in terms of \ntreatment, we get an A. In terms of prevention and health care and \nkeeping people healthy, I would say we are down around a D minus, close \nto an F. This is what has to be changed.\n  We can take great pride in how we treat, cure, fix, mend, and replace \nparts. Those are great technological advancements. As I said, in so \nmany of those cases, they are preventable, if only we will invest a \nlittle bit upfront.\n  The way we do things in this country is not only foolish, it is \nfinancially unsustainable. We cannot continue down the path on which we \nhave been going for the last 30 to 50 years. We need this new paradigm \nin American health care, a prevention paradigm, a genuine health care \nsystem that concentrates, focuses resources on wellness and prevention.\n  Health care costs are out of control. Health insurance premiums are \nskyrocketing. More and more people in America are not covered with \nhealth insurance, and we have a raft of new studies documenting the \nobesity epidemic and consequences of our failure to emphasize wellness \nand prevention.\n  I have some charts. Caution: Public health crisis ahead. People a lot \nof times say, what business is it of the Government? Do we want a nanny \nGovernment to take care of everybody? No. Shouldn't people be in charge \nof their own wellness? Yes. But when it becomes a public health crisis, \nwhen it is not just me or you, but it is all of us, and when it means \nour tax dollars are going to take care of people with chronic \ndiseases--75 percent of the costs of illnesses in America are due to \nchronic illnesses, most of which are preventable. So it is not just you \nsmoking and not exercising and having a bad diet, it is the fact that \nyou are going to consume health care dollars, and we are going to have \nto pay for it--all of us.\n  It is a public health care crisis. Two-thirds of Americans are \noverweight. Thirty percent of our kids are overweight. That is a public \nhealth care crisis.\n  I would like to cite several of the major caution signs that have \nflashed this year to remind us of the sense of urgency, and the reason \nI am taking the time on the Senate floor today, perhaps our last day of \nthe year, is because it is urgent. As I said, I sense a willingness to \nwork across the aisle, a bipartisan effort to do something about this. \nI remind people of the sense of urgency we have.\n  In March, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study \ndetermined that poor diet and lack of physical activity are now the \nsecond leading cause of death in the United States, leading to over \n400,000 deaths annually. This study warned that poor nutrition and \nphysical inactivity would soon overtake smoking as the leading \npreventable cause of death in America.\n  And by the way, if anyone had any lingering doubts about the dangers \nand destructive forces we are up against, yesterday, Hardee's, the fast \nfood restaurant chain, unveiled its newest offering. And do you know \nwhat it is called? The Monster Thickburger; just what we need--the \nMonster Thickburger.\n  This new product apparently is designed to make a Big Mac look like \nan hors d'oeuvre, a snack. The Monster Thickburger consists--are you \nready for this?--of two one-third pound slabs of hamburger, four strips \nof bacon, three slices of American cheese, and mayonnaise, all served \non a buttered sesame seed bun. Wow, can't wait to sink my teeth into \nthat one. Well, this death-defying sandwich clocks in at 1,420 calories \nand contains a whopping 107 grams of fat.\n\n  Again, does anybody have any doubt on where we are headed? A couple \nof those every week, and one will be in our sick care system pretty \nsoon, too.\n  Also in March, the Food and Drug Administration released its report \ncalled ``Counting Calories,'' which offered a blueprint for confronting \nthe obesity epidemic. Among other things, the FDA recommended \nincreasing the amount of information available to consumers through \nfood labeling. It called for enhanced Federal Trade Commission \nauthority to police false or misleading product claims. It recommended \nthat the Federal Trade Commission take steps to improve nutritional \ninformation available to consumers at restaurants, increase the \ninformation available to consumers through food labeling and \nnutritional information at restaurants.\n  Now, some restaurants do that, I have to admit. If one looks at the \nmenu, it tells them how many grams of fat, how many grams of transfat, \nhow many calories, carbohydrates, perhaps, salt, sodium. So one can be \na little bit more informed about what they eat. We do that in the \nSenate servery. We can go through and see how many grams of fat is in \neverything.\n  I have been told by those who run our servery that since we started \nthat about 3 months ago, one would be amazed at how many more people \nare picking up salads, how many more people are picking up the skinless \nchicken or turkey and things like that, taking skim milk instead of \nwhole milk. It is information. But if one does not have the \ninformation, how do they know? So I am just saying that the Food and \nDrug Administration recommended increasing this information available \nto consumers.\n  In April, after years of careful analysis, the World Health \nOrganization recognized the growing problem of obesity. They issued \ntheir global strategy on diet, physical activity, and health. It urged \ngovernments to review the role of food advertising and marketing, \nparticularly with regard to children. It encouraged schools to \nimplement policies that support children in adopting healthful diets \nand engaging in physical activity. The WHO report expressly stated that \nthe role of government is crucial in achieving lasting change in public \nhealth.\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\n  Now, I will address this a little bit further. It urged governments \nto review the role of food advertising and marketing, particularly with \nregard to children. It encouraged schools to implement policies that \nsupport kids in healthful diets and physical activity. Eighty percent \nof elementary school kids in America today get less than 1 hour of \nphysical activity a week.\n  Now I will bet that the occupant of the chair, the Senator from \nMissouri, and I, the Senator from Iowa, when we grew up, we had PE in \nsmall schools. I went to a two-room schoolhouse. We had 15 minutes of \nrecess in the morning, we had 45 minutes at lunch, and we had 15 \nminutes in the afternoon. We had to go outside. The only time we did \nnot have to go outside is when it was like 20 below. It had to be 20 \nbelow in the wintertime and then we could stay in, but other than that \nwe had to get out and run around. And it was not competitive sports.\n  We have gotten off the track. If one is not involved in the high \nschool football team, the basketball team, the soccer team, wrestling, \nwhatever, swimming, they do not get anything. Every kid needs physical \nexercise and physical activity. We have seen some schools--there are \nsome great schools out there--that ensure that every child, kids with \ndisabilities, get physical exercise and physical activity, if not on a \ndaily basis, two or three times a week. But we have now found \nelementary schools being built in America without even a playground, no \nindoor gym, no playground. So there is a role for government in \nensuring that schools teach and have access to physical activity for \nkids.\n\n  So, again, the role of government in many ways is to support, not as \na nanny but basically to set up systems so that people will be healthy \nstarting early in life. We know what kids learn early is what they \ncarry through, and with the obesity epidemic now among kids in America, \nwith their lack of physical activity, it bodes ill for the future of \nour country.\n  We have also seen a number of new reports on the costs of obesity and \nchronic disease. One study by health economist Ken Thorpe in the \nJournal of Health Affairs determined that in the year 2000 we spent \n$200 billion more on the treatment of disease and chronic conditions \nthan we did just 13 years ago.\n  Five conditions accounted for one-third of the $200 billion increase: \nheart disease, pulmonary conditions, mental disorders, cancer, and \nhypertension. All of them are preventable. Even more startling, some 27 \npercent of the rise in health care spending between 1987 and 2001 is \nattributed to the costs of treating obese patients. Twenty-seven \npercent of the rise is attributed just to treating obese patients. Five \nconditions, one-third of the $200 billion increase, all of that \npreventable. Want to save money? Want to save the impact on our \nbudgets? Want to help families in terms of keeping their taxes down? \nThis is the way to do it. We have to have better prevention.\n  Perhaps most compelling, we have also seen fresh evidence again that \nwe are failing to teach our children about the importance of a healthy \nlifestyle. Perhaps most compelling of all is that the National \nInstitute for Health Care Management Research and Educational \nFoundation found that only 16 percent of kindergarten programs meet the \ndaily recommendations for physical activity by the Centers for Disease \nControl.\n  The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences issued \na major report just last month, October. The report was on preventing \nchildhood obesity, a clarion call to action, urging a comprehensive \nnational response to the childhood obesity epidemic where they focus on \nwellness and prevention. It sets forth the blueprint for a multifaceted \nnational campaign against childhood obesity. This was just last month.\n  The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, the \npreeminent scientific medical body in this country, just last month, \nissued this warning.\n  So we need to act. We cannot twiddle our thumbs any longer. We cannot \nsay, well, that is just the way things are. We cannot just say, well, \nit is free enterprise, and if someone wants to sell a monster thick \nburger and people want to eat it, let them. I am not saying Hardee's \ncannot put out a monster thick burger. They can do it. But I want to \nmake sure that everyone who goes there and eats one of those has \ninformation to tell him or her how many calories, how many grams of \nfat, and what it means to them if they eat that. We need to start \nteaching our kids how to eat right. Experts are saying that this \ngeneration of kids growing up today, if we do not change rapidly, may \nbe the first generation to live a shorter lifespan than their parents. \nThink about that. Our kids will have a shorter lifespan than what we \nhave, the first time ever in history.\n\n  So we have had warnings from everywhere. The Centers for Disease \nControl, Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, \nFederal Trade Commission, National Institutes of Health, National \nAcademy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, World Health Organization--\non and on and on. Every single one of them urges that we use the power \nof the government to promote healthier lifestyles. Yet Congress has, \nthus far, failed to take any comprehensive action.\n  (Mrs. DOLE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Institute of Medicine report on childhood obesity \noffers us a comprehensive approach to fighting obesity. It doesn't say \nthat fighting obesity is the responsibility of government alone, or \njust one sector of society. It calls on all sectors of society to play \na role in fighting obesity. In fact, the Institute of Medicine \nblueprint bears striking similarities to the approach called for in a \nbill that I introduced earlier this year, the Healthy Lifestyles \nPrevention Act, known as the Help America Act of 2004.\n  As you can see from this report, the Institute of Medicine's \nrecommendations mirror my bill in a number of ways. Over here is what \nthe Institute of Medicine recommended to support nutrition and physical \nactivity grant programs. That is in our bill. Nutrition labeling for \nrestaurant foods, that is in our bill. The Federal Trade Commission \nshould have authority to monitor food marketing--how it is marketed to \nkids. That is in our bill.\n  Let me digress for a moment on this marketing to kids. We now have \ncounting books for kids who are just learning to count, 3 years old, 5-\nyear-olds--a simple counting book, learning your 1-2-3-4s and 5s. Do \nyou know what they are? They are called M counting books. You count \nby learning how many M there are.\n  I saw an Oreo cookie counting book. You count by how many Oreo \ncookies there are. So what happens? That will have little kids \nassociate learning, associate getting better and progressing, with \neating Oreo cookies or M, and thus begins a lifestyle and a habit \npattern at a very early age. I found that hard to believe when I saw \nit, that these companies would actually go that far, to put in \nunhealthy food. I like an Oreo cookie as much as anyone else, don't get \nme wrong. You take them apart and eat the inside, you know how to do \nthat. I love Oreo cookies. But let's be honest about it, it is maybe a \nlittle treat you have later on sometime, but to start getting kids in \ntheir counting books to count according to how many Oreo cookies there \nare, I am sorry, that sends the wrong message.\n  The Institute of Medicine recommended that community and child and \nyouth-centered organizations promote healthful eating and physical \nactivity. That is in our bill, too. Help get the YMCAs all over America \nfocused on wellness, and I am happy to report the YMCA is in the \nforefront of this battle, and I am proud of them. They are in the \nforefront of this fight against childhood obesity and for wellness.\n  Improving streets and sidewalks to encourage walking and biking. \nImagine the Institute of Medicine recommending that we build sidewalks.\n\n  There are housing developments being built in America today that \ndon't even have a sidewalk. You want your kids to walk to school or to \nride a bike? I happen to have a house out in rural Virginia. My wife \nand I have lived there for a number of years, since I have been \nprivileged to serve in the Congress. So my kids, when they were growing \nup, went to a public high school in Fairfax County. It was a good \nschool a mile from our house. A mile, that is a great walk for my kids \nto go to school, high school, but there is only one problem. There is \nno sidewalk, on a\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\nbusy street. I wouldn't even let them ride a bike down there. You are \nnot going to ride a bike down that street. There are no sidewalks.\n  Again, every highway bill we pass here, every highway bill in which \nwe take dollars out of the road use fund, the gas tax, and put it out \nto States for building highways and streets, ought to have provisions \nin it that you have to build sidewalks or you have to build walking \npaths. I am told in Europe today you cannot build a bridge unless it \nhas a walking path, bike path, adjoining the bridge across the river or \nthoroughfare or wherever you build it. We ought to be doing that in \nAmerica. If people want to ride bikes or walk, they can't get across \nthe bridge. So that is in our bill, too.\n  Insurers should include screening and obesity preventive services in \nroutine clinical practice. It is in our bill, but how many insurers do \nthat? How many provide that you can go in and have screening, \ncounseling, and you can have preventive services under your insurance \npremium, under your insurance program? I can count the number on two \nhands, probably--maybe one.\n  Schools should draw up nutritional standards for competitive foods in \nschools--competitive foods. I did see one school in Iowa this year in \nwhich they had set up their competitive foods. Competitive foods is a \nfancy name for snacks or vending machines, that kind of stuff. I saw \none school in Iowa that took all that stuff out and only had healthful \nsnacks, 100-percent juice drinks, granola bars, different kinds of \nfruits, things like that. That is the way we ought to be going.\n  Develop school policies to create schools that are advertising free--\nget advertising out of our schools. If you walk down the hallway, there \nis a big Pepsi machine, a big Coke machine. If you walk around the \ncorner, there is your competitive foods, advertising all the candy bars \nand soft drinks and everything else. Why should we allow advertising in \nour public schools? I could never figure that one out.\n  Why don't we advertise here in the Senate? I have an idea, we will \nput up a sign: A Hardee's steakburger right here. Sell some wall space \nhere. I'll bet it would be priceless. These cameras would pick it up \nevery day. If we don't have advertising in the Capitol, why do we have \nit in the schools? Why do we bombard our kids every day with \nadvertising for unhealthy habits?\n  I didn't mean to go through all of these. Those are some of them. But \nthis is what the Institute of Medicine is saying that we ought to do.\n  I mentioned the bill I introduced, the Help America Act. I am going \nto reintroduce it next year. We spent many months working on this, on a \ncomprehensive approach. You just can't address the obesity problem, the \nincrease in chronic illnesses in America by just focusing on what we do \nor what you do in a school. It has to be comprehensive. It has to start \nfrom the earliest time of our lives, in daycare centers, kindergarten, \nelementary schools. So it has to be home-based so we get more \ninformation to our families. It has to be school-based from \nkindergarten right on through high school and college. It has to be \nworkplace-based so that people on their jobsites can have physical \nactivity and wellness support. It has to be governmentally based so \nthat we do not build housing developments without sidewalks or bridges \nwithout walking paths or bike paths; that we build more walking trails \nin our country.\n\n  It has to be Government based and making sure that we have Federal \nTrade Commission monitoring truth in advertising. It has to be \ncommunity based. Communities have to pull together with their local \nYMCAs and others to have wellness programs for the entire community.\n  One of the great things popping up all over America today is mall-\nwalking programs for the elderly, especially in my part of the country. \nIn the wintertime, it is hard for the elderly to get out and malls have \nset up walking programs where elderly people will meet. They can walk \nand they have distance markers. They go around the mall, half a mile, \nthree-quarters, 1 mile. They have a little place where they can stop \nand have water or coffee or tea or whatever they want. You would be \namazed at how many of our elderly are now doing these mall-walking \nprograms. By the way, it is not bad for the mall either. Sometimes they \nstop and shop, too.\n  These are the kinds of things we have to do on a community basis, \nworkplace basis, a community basis to help promote a healthier \nlifestyle in America.\n  I could go on and on about the Institute of Medicine, what they \nrecommended. The point is, we do have an authoritative blueprint for \naction. We have a bill that reflects that blueprint. The bill we \nintroduced earlier this year, we will introduce again next year.\n  So the ball is really now in our court. I intend to reintroduce the \nHELP America Act in the 109th Congress.\n  We need a serious, ambitious probusiness, bipartisan effort to build \non the steps we took this year. There is no question in my mind that \nthe HELP America Act is a bill whose time has come to tackle some of \nthe biggest health challenges of our day, in particular the obesity \nepidemic.\n  We have had report after report and warning after warning on the \nnational level. But we have responded in only an incremental and \npiecemeal fashion. It is as though we were in the midst of a five-alarm \nfire but we stubbornly keep the hook and ladder engine in the firehouse \nrelying instead on the garden hose to fight the fire.

Madam President, I rise today to talk briefly about a \nresolution Senator Schumer and I have cosponsored in the Senate which \nwe introduced yesterday. It is about the Till case.\n  I want to summarize for you the Emmett Till case. I don't normally \nread things on the Senate floor, but, in reviewing the notes from our \noffice for the press conference that we had the other day, I really \ncould not find a better statement for the background of this case than \nthe notes. So I am going to read just a couple of paragraphs.\n  It is a story that I will preface by saying it has to shame every \nAmerican. It is a hard story to listen to--a story from a time that \nthankfully was a very different time in this country but a story that \nhas reached across the 50 years since it happened and is calling for \naction now.\n  In August 1955, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African American was \nvisiting family in Money, MS, from Chicago and allegedly whistled at \nCarolyn Bryant, a white woman. On August 28, Roy Bryant, Carolyn's \nhusband, and his half brother, J.W. Milam, kidnapped Emmett from his \nuncle, Moses Wright's, home. They beat him, dragged him to banks of the \nTallahatchie River and shot him in the head. Bryant and Milam then \nfastened a large metal cotton ginning fan and dumped his body into the \nriver. Three days later, Emmett's body was pulled from the river and \nreturned to his mother, Mamie Till, in Chicago. Mamie Till made a very \ncourageous decision at that point. She decided to leave his casket open \nfor 4 days to show the public what had happened to her son.\n  Tens of thousands of people paid their respects in person and the \npress published photos of Emmett's mutilated corpse around the world. \nIn September 1955, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam stood trial for Till's \nmurder in Mississippi. An all white, male jury acquitted both men, \nafter several women and African Americans were barred from serving on \nthe jury; they reached their verdict after only 67 minutes of \ndeliberation. Emmett's uncle Moses Wright, and another resident of the \ntown, Willie Reed, both testified in court. As a result they were \nforced to flee to Chicago because their lives were in danger following \ntheir testimony. Worldwide, there was tremendous outrage at the murder \nand subsequent acquittal. In November, Wright and Reed returned to \nMississippi and testified before a grand jury investigating the pending \nkidnapping charges against Bryant and Milam. But the grand jury refused \nto indict those men.\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\n  On January 24, 1956, Look magazine published an article in which both \nBryant and Milam described the murder in detail. They received $4000 to \ntell their story. Look published a subsequent article, where Milam \nstated that he did not regret the killing.\n  Both Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam lived the rest of their lives as free \nmen and died of natural causes; Milam died in 1980 and Bryant in 1990. \nMamie Till died in January 2003. Keith A. Beachamp--a documentary film \nmaker from Fort. Greene, Brooklyn--found new evidence about the case, \nincluding never-before-heard eyewitness accounts, while making his \ndocumentary which will air soon, ``The Untold Story of Emmett Louis \nTill.'' The witnesses claim that there were several other people \ninvolved in the murder plot and that some of these individuals are \nstill alive.\n  Mamie Till lived in Chicago until she died in January of 2003. She \nwas rather close to Congressman Bobby Rush who was a colleague of mine \nwhen I served in the House. When Congressman Rush found out about this \ndocumentary, he introduced a resolution calling for the Justice \nDepartment to reopen this case and determine whether it was still \npossible to prosecute some of these other individuals who, according to \nMr. Beachamp, were indeed involved in this crime. Since these other \nindividuals were never tried, much less acquitted, it would still be \nconstitutionally possible to prosecute them, especially in the Federal \ncourt, because there had never, unfortunately, been Federal actions or \nFederal indictments brought against any of these individuals who were \ninvolved.\n  Senator Schumer was considering filing a companion resolution in the \nSenate earlier this year. He approached me to see if I wanted to \ncosponsor it with him. I was very interested in doing that. We both had \ncontacted the Justice Department before we were able to sponsor that \nresolution. I am pleased to say the Justice Department did reopen the \ncase, that was in May, and the Justice Department has been \ninvestigating ever since.\n  This week Congressman Rush, Congressman Charlie Rangel, Senator \nSchumer, and I have sponsored in the House and in the Senate a new \nresolution calling on the Justice Department to devote whatever \nresources are necessary to investigate this matter expeditiously and \nreport back to the Congress and to do justice after 50 years.\n  I am sorry to say--I am ashamed to say--that Mamie Till tried over \nand over again for almost 50 years to get the Federal Government to do \nsomething, which she was unable to do so, particularly in the 1950s \nwhen this evidence was fresh, when a Federal charge could have been \nbrought without violating the constitutional rule against double \njeopardy, but it was not brought. For that, the Federal Government has \nto accept responsibility.\n\n  We do not know what an expeditious and complete investigation will \nreveal. I suppose it is possible either other people were not involved \nin this or that a case cannot be made against them at this late date. \nWhat we do know is that any remaining witnesses, people who might have \nbeen coconspirators in this terrible tragic crime, are getting older. \nIf a case is to be made, it must be made soon because witnesses may \ndie, evidence may become even more stale and unusable.\n  Justice needs to be done for a lot of reasons, in part because, as \nCongressman Rangel says, you have to confront these kinds of crimes, \nthese kinds of tragedies, these wrongs if you are ever to get past \nthem, in part because there may be murderers at large who need to be \nbrought to justice, in part because it is only through the courage of \nMamie Till and the courage of Moses Wright who, in 1955, followed their \nconvictions and protested publicly about this. It took enormous courage \nfor that mother to keep that casket open so the world could see what \nhappened. It took enormous courage for Moses Wright to walk into that \ncourtroom and testify against these white men, but he did it.\n  As a result, this whole incident was one of the seminal events that \nled to the civil rights movement in the 1950s and the 1960s with all \nthe progress we have achieved as a result of that.\n  It is owing to these individuals and to their courage that we do the \nright thing after all this time. I certainly intend to continue doing \nwhatever I can to make certain the Justice Department is held \naccountable for taking action. I know Senator Schumer feels strongly \nthe same way. This is a subject I intend to bring up with Mr. Gonzales \nas his confirmation process moves through the Senate. I certainly hope \nhe is confirmed and I do intend to support that. I think he will make a \ngreat Attorney General. But I want to make certain that he is \npersonally aware of this and personally committed to devoting such \nresources as are necessary, as expeditiously as possible, to see that \njustice so long delayed is now done in this case.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11714-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11714-S11715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Fritz Hollings\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, when the man who sits right next to me \nacross this aisle over here, the senior Senator from South Carolina, \nFritz Hollings, retires at the end of this Congress, this body will \nlose one of its most distinctive and eloquent voices. We will lose a \nmaster legislator, a person who will go down in history as one of the \ntruly consequential Senators of the second half of the 20th century. Of \ncourse, we will lose the presence of a great friend, a colleague whose \npassion and wit burn just as intensely today as when he first entered \nthis Chamber nearly four decades ago.\n  As I said, Senator Hollings sits directly across the aisle to my \nleft, at the desk that was once occupied by another extraordinary \nindividual from South Carolina, Senator John C. Calhoun. But Calhoun \nwas a voice of the Old South, a defender of slavery in the great \ndebates prior to the Civil War. Fritz Hollings, first as Governor, and \nfor the last 38 years as a Senator, has epitomized the New South.\n  Fritz Hollings became Governor in 1958, at the tender age of 36. He \nimmediately set about diversifying South Carolina's textile and farming \neconomy. He planted the State thick with technical colleges. He \naggressively recruited new industries to the State. But, most \nimportantly, he set in motion the peaceful transformation of racial \nrelations in South Carolina.\n  Now, remember--I remember it well; I was a senior in high school just \ngoing into college at that time--this was a time when other Southern \nGovernors were pledging massive resistance to integration. They \nliterally stood in the schoolhouse door. They incited people to keep \nAfrican Americans from going into school or sitting at lunch counters \nor riding on buses.\n  But Fritz Hollings charted a different course as Governor. He showed \ntremendous leadership, real political courage, as he orchestrated the \npeaceful integration of Clemson University. So Fritz Hollings \nepitomizes the New South.\n  He also epitomizes the Greatest Generation. In World War II, right \nout of the Citadel, he served as an Army officer in North Africa and \nlater in Italy earning seven campaign ribbons and the Bronze Star.\n  But I have always believed that what made the Greatest Generation \ntruly great was not just what they did during the war but what they did \nafter the war. As I said, Fritz Hollings played a transformational role \nin South Carolina. Then he came to the Senate, and he played an equally \ndramatic role on the national stage.\n  In 1968, he conducted a series of ``hunger tours'' across South \nCarolina, exposing poverty and Third World living conditions. He went \non to coauthor national legislation that created the Supplemental Food \nProgram for Women, Infants and Children, which we now know today as the \nWIC Program. He championed the Community Health Center Program, \nbringing medical care to the poor and underprivileged. And now \nthousands of community health centers dot the landscape in every State \nof our Union.\n\n  Fritz became a passionate advocate for medical research and the \nNational Institutes of Health, especially cancer\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\nresearch. I know how proud Fritz is of the nationally respected cancer \nresearch and treatment center at the Medical University of South \nCarolina, now known appropriately as the Hollings Cancer Center. In \nfact, at his farewell gala a couple months ago that I went to downtown, \nFritz Hollings raised more than $2 million for the center's programs.\n  Well, it would take a long time to stand here and do justice to \nSenator Hollings' legacy of legislative accomplishments. I will not do \nso. I am tempted to do so because there is so much there. But those of \nus who have served with him over the decades know there is no more \ndedicated fighter for fiscal conservatism in this body or anywhere in \nthis Congress. There is no one who has fought harder for what I call \nfiscal rationality in our spending and taxing programs than Fritz \nHollings.\n  There is no one who has done more when it comes to protecting our \noceans and coasts. It was Senator Hollings who passed the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act in 1972, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the \nOceans Dumping Act of 1976, and the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996. \nSo the next time you go out to look at whales or you see the dolphins \nswimming, the next time you walk along a beach and you don't see all \nthat junk washing up on the shoreline, thank Fritz Hollings. He led the \ncharge on it.\n  And long before it became fashionable, Fritz Hollings was speaking \nout against the indiscriminate outsourcing of American jobs, first in \nthe textile industry, then jobs in the steel industry and \nmanufacturing. In literally scores of speeches on this floor, he has \neducated Members of this body about the fallacies and human costs of \nso-called free trade. That is not fair trade. He has spoken out with \npassion and persistence for fair trade and a fair shake for American \nworkers.\n  Fritz Hollings leaves a personal legacy in this Senate. We will \nalways remember his sharp mind in debate, his wit, and a very sharp \ntongue that could cut to the quick and get at the essence of what the \ndebate was all about. And there is no one who had a greater sense of \nhumor or was more generous and more kind than Fritz Hollings. He could \ncraft humor about others, and he could craft humor about himself--a \ngreat individual, Fritz Hollings.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also publicly pay a big thank you to \nFritz Hollings for the opportunity he gave me 16 years ago. I had just \nbeen elected to the Senate. I was in my first term. It was 1988. Lawton \nChiles, who was then a Senator from Florida, was retiring as chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education.\n  I was a freshman Senator. I was at the bottom of the ladder. So \nLawton left that position and went back to Florida. Most of the \nDemocrats ahead of me--the Democrats were in charge at that time--had \nother subcommittee chairmanships they didn't want to give up. So it \ncame down to Fritz Hollings and me. I knew of the passion that Fritz \nhad for health and education issues. So I assumed he was going to take \nchairmanship of that subcommittee. But I called up Fritz. I let him \nknow that if he didn't take it, I was next in line, that I always had a \ngreat interest in this area. Well, he said he would take that into \nconsideration. I will never forget it. I was at home on a Sunday night. \nHe called me up and said: Well, Tom, I have been thinking about this. \nHe said I would really like to have the Labor, HHS, Education; this is \nin my interest. I have spent so much time on health issues.\n  Well, I thought this was his nice way of telling me, I am sorry, Tom, \nI am going to take the chairmanship, tough luck. But at the end, he \nsaid: Well, I want you to know I am going to stay with the Commerce-\nState-Justice Subcommittee.\n  I could hear him laughing. He had kind of strung me out during this \nwhole phone call, leading me to the point where he was going to say, I \nam really sorry, Tom, but I am going to take it. Then he turned 180 \ndegrees and said: I am going to stay with Commerce-State-Justice. I \ncould hear him chuckling in the background, knowing that he had given \nme a great gift.\n  It was a huge opening for me as a freshman Senator to chair the \nsecond largest Appropriations subcommittee. I will always be grateful \nfor the confidence and the trust that he had in me at that time. I hope \nI have not disappointed him.\n  Fritz Hollings has cast more than 15,000 votes here. He has passed \nmajor bill after major bill. He has spoken out courageously on issues \nof war and peace, trade and budget, civil rights and human rights. He \nhas been a voice for the poor and for the sick and for those who have \nno voice in the political arena. I know Fritz is very fond of a \nparticular quote from Elibu Root, Teddy Roosevelt's Secretary of State. \nThose of us who were at the farewell banquet for Fritz in September \nheard him repeat it on that occasion. He said:\n\n       Politics is the practical art of self government, and \n     someone must attend to it if we are going to have self \n     government. The principal ground of reproach against any \n     American citizen should be that he is not a politician.\n\n  For more than five decades, Fritz Hollings has been a proud \npolitician, an extraordinary public servant, one of the truly \nmagnificent Senators in the history of this body. We will remember his \nlegacy. I am going to miss him as a friend and as someone I could \nconverse with, gain insight from, and share a laugh with, listening to \nFritz go on about fiscal responsibility.\n  Peatsy and Fritz have been a team. I was fortunate to have taken a \ncongressional delegation trip with Fritz and Peatsy last December. We \nwent down to Brazil, looking at all the different things in Brazil--\neverything from rain forests to agriculture to labor conditions. It was \ntruly a magnificent week to spend with Fritz and Peatsy. I will never \nforget it. I will never forget both of them. So I wish both Fritz and \nPeatsy a long and wonderful retirement in their beloved Charleston, SC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are here late on a Saturday afternoon \nas part of what has become truly a deeply flawed process.\n  We have been presented with this huge stack of paper. I think this is \nwell over 3,000 pages. We got it in the middle of the night. We didn't \nhave a hard copy until somewhere after noon today. We are being told \nthat we will vote on it shortly. It reminded me very much of attending \none of the State of the Union Addresses in my first years in the \nSenate. It was in 1988. President Reagan was talking to the Nation, and \nhe held up what was then a conference report that he reported was over \na thousand pages long, weighing 14 pounds. Then he held up a \nreconciliation bill that was 6 months late and was 1,200 pages long, \nweighing 15 pounds, and a long-term continuing resolution of over 1,000 \npages, weighing 14 pounds. He reminded us that was 43 pounds of paper \nand ink, and you had 3 hours--yes, 3 hours--to consider each. He said \nit took 300 people at his Office of Management and Budget just to read \nthe bill so the Government would not shut down. He concluded that \nCongress should not send him another one of these. He said: If you do, \nI will not sign it.\n  President Reagan was right. This is not the way we should do the \npeople's business. We should not have, late on a Saturday, 3,000 pages; \nand there are not more than a handful of people here who know what is \nin it. I know what is in it for the State of North Dakota. I know that. \nBut I don't know what else is in here.\n  I have found one thing that is in here that I think will shock every \none of my colleagues. There is a little nugget tucked away in this \npackage that says the Appropriations Committee chairmen, or their \ndesignees, can call up the tax returns of any individual, any company \nand, without civil or criminal penalty, do whatever they want with \nthose returns.\n  Madam President, think about that. Are we really going to pass \nlegislation that says an Appropriations Committee staffer can look at \nthe individual returns of any American, any company, and there are no \ncivil or criminal penalties for their release of the contents of that \nreturn? I don't think so. That is in this stack of papers.\n  We have provisions saying that the chairman of the Finance Committee\n\n[[Page S11716]]\n\nand the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee can look at individual \nreturns. They are the only Members of Congress who can do that, and \nthere are very severe civil and criminal penalties if they were to \nrelease what they saw there. Those are privacy protections for every \nAmerican taxpayer, every individual, every company. We protect the \nprivacy of those returns with stiff civil and criminal penalties for \nthe release of the information gained in those returns.\n  All of that is thrown right out the window in this stack of paper \nbecause it provides that the Appropriations Committee chairman, or \ntheir designees, can have access to the returns of any American, any \nindividual, any company; and there are no civil or criminal penalties \nfor the release of the information contained therein. I say to my \ncolleague from Idaho I don't think this is his idea of protecting the \nprivacy of the American people.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, the Senator \nbrings up a critical point. Would he cite the page and the subparagraph \nto the body? Clearly, the Senator is stating a charge, if you will, \nthat is very critical and very important for all of us to understand. \nNo one, without court order or subpoena ought to have that kind of \nauthority.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, there are so many different page numbers \non this page, I am not sure which of these page numbers is the relevant \npage number.\n  There are at least three page numbers on the page. That is how \nslapdash this whole thing is. There is a page number 802, there is a \npage number 1112, and there is a page number 85. Take your pick. This \nis what it says, and I quote it to my colleague, section 222:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing the \n     disclosure of income tax returns or return information, upon \n     written request of the chairman of the House or Senate \n     Committee on Appropriations, the Commissioner of the Internal \n     Revenue Service shall hereafter allow agents designated by \n     such chairmen access to Internal Revenue Service facilities \n     and any tax returns or return information contained therein.\n\n  That is the provision that is in this stack of paper. That is an \noutrage. That is absolutely beyond the pale to allow staffers here the \naccess to tax returns of any American citizen, of any American company \nwith absolutely no civil or criminal penalties for the release of that \nprivate information.\n  What is going on here that we have a stack of paper that has a little \nnugget like that stuck in? That cannot be.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question without losing his \nright to floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, does that mean--it just boggles the mind--\nthis goes way beyond the wildest dreams, for example, of J. Edgar \nHoover. Does that mean, for example, if somebody in the press \ncriticizes the chairman or if a constituent wrote in and criticized \nsome action of the chairman or, let us say, that some Member of \nCongress dared to vote against a bill of the chairman, their staff \ncould just go and grab all their tax returns and then just give it to \nanybody and have no penalty?\n  I realize this is not the old former Soviet Union, but this could \npossibly happen in America?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Unfortunately, it is contained in this bill. This bill is \nvery clear:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing the \n     disclosure of income tax returns or return information, upon \n     written request of the chairman of the House or Senate \n     Committee on Appropriations, the Commissioner of the Internal \n     Revenue Service shall hereafter allow agents designated by \n     such chairmen access to Internal Revenue Service facilities \n     and any tax returns or return information contained therein.\n\n  And there are no provisions in the civil law or the criminal law that \nwould protect the release of that information.\n  I tell you, when my staff came upon this and brought it to my \nattention--I used to be a tax commissioner, and one of the things that \nis understood by anybody who deals with tax information is that there \nare rights to preserve the privacy interests of any taxpayer. We have \nlong held in this body and in the body on the other side of the Capitol \nthe people's right to privacy would be protected.\n  This provision, I am told, was stuck in at about midnight last night. \nWithout any debate, without any discussion, without any Democrat in the \nroom, it was stuck into this monstrosity of a bill. I think that is \njust one more indication of how dangerous this process has become--\n3,000 pages dumped on our desks, and we are told to vote in just a few \nhours.\n\n  There is nobody here, other than those who have been in the room, who \ncan understand what is in this bill. If we gave our colleagues a quiz \non what is contained here, I do not think very many of them would pass.\n  Something has to be done here. This cannot become the law of the \nland.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, my only question to the Senator is, is \nhe really surprised that something egregious should be in this long \npackage that none of us have seen or read until a few hours ago? Does \nit really surprise the Senator when we find it packed full of goodies \nfor special interest and policy changes and all kinds of things that \nare passed into law that otherwise would not bear scrutiny? Is he \nreally surprised that all of a sudden now we just pass some other \nbarrier?\n  Isn't it also the fact this is in a bill that none of us have seen or \nread? Should it surprise us that finally happened when we have a system \nthat is broken? The system is broken. This is 9 of the 13 \nappropriations bills that have never seen a debate or discussion or \namending. None, never. So now we find something that--thank God for \nsomebody's staffer who found it buried on page--what did the Senator \nsay, page 1,000-something?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I say to my colleague, my friend, you \ncannot even tell what page number it is because on these pages there \nare three different page numbers. Page 802, page 1112, page 85--take \nyour pick.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I can finally ask my colleague, doesn't it really \nargue again that we have to fix a system that is broken? Here we are, \neverybody trying to get home for the Thanksgiving recess, and we are \ngoing to debate and vote on this ``as quickly as we can'' and anybody \nwho extends the debate is being terribly unfair to their colleagues. I \nhave already had four colleagues who have airline reservations come up \nto me and say: Please don't talk too long this time; you're not going \nto hold up this bill, are you?\n  I am not the one who caused this bill to not appear before us when we \nhave been here for the entire year without acting on nine of the \nappropriations bills. The system is broken, and sooner or later we \nbetter fix it.\n  I am going to identify billions of dollars of pork that are in this \nbill that have had no scrutiny, no competition, no nothing except a \ntestimony of the influence of some member of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  I ask my colleague if he is surprised this should happen.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. First, let me answer the question of the Senator from \nArizona. Am I surprised? I am not surprised there are things in here \nalmost nobody knows about. I started out by going back to President \nReagan's admonishment to us never to permit this to happen again. That \nwas in 1988. This is 2004, and here we are again 16 years later with \nover 3,000 pages dumped on our desks, and we are told to vote on this \nin a few hours. Nobody knows what is in here. We have been scouring \nthis bill--thank goodness some sharp-eyed aide of mine saw this little \nnugget.\n  I must say, I am surprised something such as this could even get \nthrough a flawed process like this one. I am amazed we are about to \npass in the Congress of the United States a provision that would allow \nsome staffers to look at any tax return of any individual, of any \ncompany, and not have civil or criminal penalties apply to them for the \nrelease of that information.\n  I tell you, that is serious. That is serious.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S11717]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the suggestion has been made that the \nsystem is broken. Of course, I thought it would work far more smoothly \nwith a Republican President, a Republican House, and a Republican \nSenate. We had actually passed a budget back last April, which by law \nwe are required to do.\n  Madam President, will the Senator from North Dakota agree that there \nis at least one glimmer of hope here on the system working? This was \nput in by the Republicans in the House, and at least the Democrats in \nthe Senate discovered it. So to that extent, there is at least a \nglimmer of hope.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say, in answer to my colleague, I agree with the \nSenator from Arizona, the system is broken. The system is completely \nbroken when we have 3,000 pages dumped on our desk and we are told to \nvote in 3 hours.\n  Now, that does not make sense. Members do not know what is in this. \nWe find egregious provisions such as this one tucked away that people \ndid not review, did not debate, did not discuss, did not have a chance \nto amend, have not had a chance to vote on, and all of a sudden it is \ncontained in here. That cannot be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are currently in morning business with a \n10-minute time limit, and the 10 minutes of the Senator from North \nDakota has expired. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have a parliamentary inquiry. Where are we on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business.\n  Mr. McCAIN. When do we expect to take up the legislation itself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has not been determined.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I happen to be the ranking member, that is \nthe most senior Democrat, on the Finance Committee. In years past, I \nwas chairman of the Finance Committee when this side had the majority.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Those were the halcyon days.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, those were the halcyon days when this country was \nrepresented really well.\n  But I might say the provision we have been discussing; namely, the \ndegree to which Members of Congress should have access to any \nAmerican's income tax returns, is really an outgrowth of the Nixon \nyears. That is, in the Watergate years, when too many Government \nofficials had access to individuals' income tax returns and we enacted \nso-called Watergate reforms, one of the reforms was a section in the \ncode which basically provides that no one in Congress has access to any \nAmerican income tax return--as well they should not--except for the \nchairman of the Finance Committee and the chairman of the House Ways \nand Means Committee, the committees that have jurisdiction over our tax \nlaws.\n  Someone might ask, why should they have jurisdiction? Why should the \nchairman of the Finance Committee have the right to look into an \nindividual's tax returns? That is a question that should be asked very \nseriously and it is one we should take very seriously.\n  But the reason that is in the law today is so the Finance Committee \ncan exercise jurisdiction or proper oversight over our Tax Code, \nespecially looking into how companies, maybe individuals but certainly \ncompanies, use the tax system to shelter their income--what do they \ndo; how do they do it--so we in the Congress can enact legislation that \ncloses those loopholes. That is what we have done.\n\n  Within the last couple of years, with the so-called Enron reforms as \nwe looked at Enron's tax returns, we found a lot of provisions where \nactually the company was overstating assets in a certain area and \nunderstating in another, sheltering a lot of income, clearly not in the \nspirit of the income tax returns.\n  I might say, too, that, frankly, the Tax Code is so complex and the \nreturns are so complex it is difficult for the enforcement agency, the \nIRS, to look at all of these shelters and to enforce the tax law.\n  As we know, a low percentage of tax returns are currently audited, \nand it is very difficult for the Joint Tax Committee because they do \nnot have the resources to look at all of this.\n  The long and short of this is that we in the Finance Committee, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee and his staff, looked at income tax \nreturns, including Enron, and we made appropriate deletions to protect \nproprietary interests. Nevertheless, we thought we should exercise that \nresponsibility and we did, very carefully and professionally, and the \nresult was not to use individual tax returns but, rather, closing a lot \nof loopholes of which companies, in this case Enron, were unfortunately \ntaking advantage.\n  The current law also provides for civil and criminal penalties for \nany unauthorized disclosure by the chairman of the committee or \nauthorized staff of any unauthorized information, which there well \nshould be. If any of us were to divulge any of the information we might \nhave, we go to jail, and we should.\n  The provision we are talking about here, that is, in this big \nappropriations bill right in front of me, basically says the chairmen \nof the Appropriations Committee, House and Senate, have the same \nauthority, and that they can also exercise that authority and have \naccess to income tax returns without any penalty whatsoever, no \ncriminal penalties, no civil penalties, for any unauthorized \ndisclosure.\n  Well, what does that mean? It does not take a rocket scientist to \nknow that means anybody on the staff of the Appropriations Committee \ncan just take that tax return information and can go to the press, can \nuse it however they want on anybody, without any penalty. That is an \noutrage. Even in the dead of night, who would try to enact a provision \nlike that? And that is what the majority has done very late at night.\n  My staff happened to find this provision several hours ago. I called \nthem this morning to see what they found in the conference report. They \nsaid: We are still trying to download it. We divided it into different \nparts. We are not going to be able to go through it all until 5 o'clock \ntoday, not even see what is in this conference report until 5 today. \nThat is about eight or nine people in my office, each downloading from \nthe House Ways and Means Web site various portions of what is in this \nconference report.\n  I am informed that the House has gone out. I do not know if that is \naccurate, but I am informed the House has adjourned and that is highly, \nhighly reprehensible. They passed this provision in the middle of the \nnight, did not tell a soul, did not consult with the Finance Committee, \ndid not consult with the House Ways and Means Committee. They certainly \ndid not consult with the Finance Committee. The chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee found out about this a few hours ago and he is as \nupset as I am. The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. \nStevens, I am told he did not even know this was in there until a \ncouple of hours ago when he was informed about it. That is what I am \ntold. He did not know it was in there. Come on.\n\n  It seems to me that the one resolution yet available is for the \nSenate to amend--it is a procedural motion here--the enrolling \nresolution, to strike that language and send it back to the House.\n  I have to figure out there is a way for the House to stay and meet. I \nam told they are just doing special orders or something like that. I am \ntold they have not adjourned sine die. It is clear that if they want to \nchange this, the House of Representatives can find a way to change it. \nThey can find a way if they want to. If they do not, I have to reach \none conclusion, they do not want to. They want to give the \nAppropriations Committee chairman this unfettered access to individual \nincome tax returns and the ability to release it to anybody in the \nworld without any punishment, without any civil penalties, without any \ncriminal penalties.\n  I ask the House of Representatives, I ask the Speaker of the House, I \nask the leadership of the majority party in this body, to find a way to \nget the House of Representatives to accept our resolution.\n  I have been told we will have a colloquy or we will take this up \nlater. We all know what happens when we take things up later--it does \nnot happen. Things have a way of getting lost. One has to strike when \nthe iron is hot. The iron is really hot now.\n  When the American public hears about this--we can bet dollars to\n\n[[Page S11718]]\n\ndonuts there is probably nobody in the press gallery right now because \nthey are out writing their stories about this--we are going to hear \nabout this and I would think that the majority party would like to nip \nthis thing in the bud and get it done right now and not have it in the \npress for weeks and months because it is on the doorstep of the \nmajority party of the House and the Senate. It is on their doorstep. If \nthey want to change it and delete it, they can do that. If they do not \nwant to change it or delete it, then they are not doing it.\n  Since I have been in this body, I cannot think--I am sure there are \nothers but I cannot think of an outrage as reprehensible as this one. \nCan my colleagues believe it, unfettered access to individual tax \nreturns which are supposed to be private income, that can be divulged \nto anybody without any sanctions? Come on. How can anybody even \nconceive of suggesting something like that? Somebody did it in the \nmiddle of the night, and I might say we still do not know what is in \nthis legislation. As I said before, the chairman of the committee did \nnot even know about it. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee \ndid not know about it. They do now, and I call on them to do something \nabout this to get this problem solved right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is what happens at the end of a \nsession when things go bump in the night and on your desk you find a \nstack like this. I am a member of the Appropriations Committee. A lot \nof work has gone into this, but by waiting until the end of the session \nto put all of this in front of Members of Congress, it becomes \nliterally impossible for us to meet our responsibility to say to the \nvoters we represent that we know what is here; it is good for America, \nand we are voting for it. You have to operate on faith.\n  That faith is shaken if not destroyed when something comes through \nlike this. If there is anything we are supposed to respect in this \ncountry, it is the right of privacy, particularly when it comes to \nGovernment records. To slip in this section 222 in the Treasury \nappropriation, and give to certain Members of Congress and their staff \naccess to individual income tax returns which they can order up from \nthe Internal Revenue Service and then use the contents with impunity, \nin other words, without any threat of civil or criminal prosecution if \nthey disclose them, is to create a situation which, frankly, is beyond \ndescription.\n  We talked about enemies lists 40 and 50 years ago in America, where \nadministrations would decide which Americans were not friendly and \nthere was a hint or suspicion that the Internal Revenue Service was \ngoing to look at their tax returns. That is as far as it went.\n  Forget the hint of suspicion, this is an outright delegation of \nauthority to elected officials in Congress and their staff to order up \nthe tax returns of any person they choose. Could it be their opponent \nin the last election? Or maybe the candidate who might run against them \nnext time? Could it be a whole branch of contributors to certain \ncauses? All of those things are possible under this.\n  It strikes me as odd, if we are going to respect the right of privacy \nfor individuals in this country, that we would delegate this authority \nand then say that the staff people and Members of Congress who use it \ncan disclose the contents to the public without any fear of \nprosecution. They could turn them over to the press. They could use \nthem on these talk shows. It could happen.\n  In case this sounds as if it is in the realm of the ridiculous, it \nhappened to be on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill that a \nstaffer hacked into my computer and stole 2,000 documents from my \ncomputer and turned them over to the press and special interest groups \nin Washington. He was caught, thank goodness, and now there is an \ninvestigation underway. But he was using material from my staff and my \noffice in an effort to not only try to anticipate what might happen in \nthe committee, but to use it against me politically. That happened at \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, the committee responsible for reviewing \nand designating future Justices in the Supreme Court. It happened \nwithin our committee.\n  Now what we are saying is we will write into law the access of \nMembers of Congress and their staff to, not just the computer memos \ngenerated in my office, but income tax returns; that they could have \naccess to an individual income tax return and disclose it with \nimpunity, without any possibility of being held accountable for that \nfact. That is a troubling development.\n  I do not know who is responsible for it. It happened in an \nappropriations bill that it turns out at least Members on this side of \nthe aisle were not aware it was included. But think about the fact that \nwe are dealing with some 3,400 pages of legislation here. It is not \npossible for us to read through every word of this, every paragraph, \nand to find out if we can trust the contents of this to be something \nthat is good for America and something about which we can cast our vote \nin favor.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for coming to the floor--Senator Conrad from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Baucus from Montana and others, Senator McCain \nfrom Arizona, for bringing to light this outrage.\n  It is not enough for us to limit this outrage to the point where we \nsay we will pass it today and take care of it tomorrow. What happens in \nthe meantime, after this is signed into law? What will happen? I don't \nknow.\n  But we will be giving legal authority to individuals to misuse income \ntax returns of individuals, families, and businesses across America. \nThat, in my mind, crosses a line which we should never allow to be \ncrossed.\n  The Government serves us. We are the masters of this country because, \nin a democracy, the voters rule. When it reaches a point that you have \nto worry about the tyranny of a government invading your privacy, \ndisclosing information which they have no business to publicly \ndisclose, then we have crossed a line which we should never cross.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question? As I read this \nprovision, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee could send what \nare called agents--which I take it means staff?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Then the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is required \nto give them access to the Internal Revenue Service facility and access \nto any tax returns or return information contained therein. So they, in \neffect, have a carte blanche to gain access to any tax information \ninvolving any tax return. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is my understanding. I would say to the Senator from \nMaryland, as you read it, it is even more expansive than I described \nit. I talked about asking for a tax return. As you read this language, \nthey could ask for all of the tax returns of certain individuals or \npeople living in certain areas or people working for certain companies \nor people contributing to certain charities or contributing to certain \npolitical candidates. They could go in and ask for all the information, \nand can do it without any penalty under law if they disclose that \ninformation or misuse it.\n  To think that we would give this authority in an appropriations bill \nof 3,400 pages, and we stumbled upon it in the last few moments, is an \nindication of some of the troubling possibilities in this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely correct. I thank the Senator \nfor answering the question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleagues who read \nthis bill--I don't know if I can hold it, but here it is. I asked that \nit be put on everybody's desk. That is a rule in the Senate. You can \nrequire that because I think just looking at this you see how not \nto legislate. I think Senator McCain has made that point eloquently.\n\n  I am going to speak for about 5 or 6 minutes now. I am going to speak \nmore later.\n  I thank my colleagues who found that ``Big Brother is watching you'' \nlanguage in this massive bill. It is a horrific thought that some \nperson working for the Government can identify a taxpayer and go after \nhim or her, or go after a business without penalty. This is unheard of. \nIf this is a new America, then let me say we have a lot\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\nof work to do around here, and things are going to be slowed down \nbecause as much as everyone wants to get home and get with their \nfamilies, not the least of which is the folks on the floor right now, \nwe may have to sacrifice a little bit if this is the kind of \nlegislation that comes before us in this huge packet.\n  I am going to take just a few minutes to run through another piece of \nlegislation that was thrown in here without any vote in the Senate, \nwithout any hearing in the Senate, without any discussion in the \nSenate, and that is the so-called Weldon amendment which has very many \nadverse consequences for millions and millions of women of reproductive \nage in our country.\n  The Weldon amendment is a sham conscience clause. It takes a good \nconscience clause that was put in place so that doctors who have a \nmoral or religious objection to performing abortion do not have to do \nthat, but what this does is says anyone who wants can claim a \nconscience clause without giving any reason, and expands it to HMOs and \ninsurance companies. Imagine giving an HMO a conscience clause. Since \nwhen do HMOs have a conscience? I haven't met one that did so far.\n  Now, any business entity can decide to tell its doctors who work for \nit that they cannot give women information about their constitutional \nright to choose, even in the cases of rape, incest, and life of the \nmother. In this bill, millions of American women are now at risk, if \nthey are the victim of incest or rape or their life is at stake, they \nwill be denied services and referrals. It is extraordinary to me.\n  Women will be left abandoned in emergency by overriding the Federal \nMedicaid law. It abandons women in emergency rooms who have life-\nthreatening pregnancies. It overrides title X requiring referral to \nappropriate clinicians or clinics. It overrides State laws.\n  Now you have from my colleagues who run this place, the Republicans, \nwho always say they don't like Big Brother--first, you have them going \nafter your tax return, and now you have them overriding State laws that \nrespect a woman who may be in deep trouble because of incest, or rape, \nor her life may be threatened.\n  Can you imagine that? When the American people learn about this--that \na woman could stagger in, having been raped by a relative, and she does \nnot have to be told her constitutional rights. Let me tell you, that \ntreats women worse than criminals.\n  Let us see what we do about criminals. We make sure criminal suspects \nhave to be told their constitutional rights. These folks could be \nsuspected of the most heinous crimes. We have to tell them they have a \nright to remain silent; anything they say could be used against them in \na court of law; they have a right to an attorney before they can be \nquestioned; if they can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed. \nAnd then they are asked, Do you understand these rights?\n  A woman who may be quite poor, who may not know all of her \nconstitutional rights, up to now has been protected because all the \nlaws we have on the books say she needs to be told what her rights are. \nLook what we do here to women. Women don't have their constitutional \nrights explained to them. Under Roe v. Wade, a woman has a right in the \nfirst 3 months of her pregnancy to be told that the decision is hers, \nwithout government interference. After that, she has to be told that \nher health and life must always be protected throughout her pregnancy. \nThese are the constitutional rights of women.\n  Yet with this Weldon language which was put into this bill, without a \nSenate hearing, without Senate debate, without a Senate vote, a woman \nwill be treated worse than suspected criminals.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In our State of New Jersey, public hospitals are not \nallowed to deny abortion services to a woman. What effect will this new \nFederal law have on those women's rights accorded to them under State \nconstitutions?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The State law will be overridden, my friend. And your \nState--and I know you and Senator Corzine are here to fight for your \nState. You fight for your State every single day. Right now, in this \npackage, without one hearing, your State, if this bill passes, is going \nto be told from now on they cannot in any way have protections for \nwomen in the law if that State takes Federal funds. Of course, they all \ntake Medicaid funds. They will not be able to protect women. Not only \nwon't they be able to protect women in the sense that the woman can \nhave a legal procedure, but the woman won't even be able to get a \nreferral.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Can a doctor who works at a hospital that doesn't \nprovide abortion services be prevented from providing a patient with a \nsimple direction to say we don't do it, I won't do it, but there are \nplaces you can go and you ought to check the directory, or check Web \nsites and see if you can find a place to get this done?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. There is a gag rule on doctors. The way it would \nwork would be this: If an organization, an HMO, or a hospital, or an \ninsurance company decides it no longer wants to either provide abortion \nservices or even refer a woman to abortion services, they can say to \nthe doctor who works for them, if you want to work here, forget about \nit. You cannot refer a woman for an abortion. You can't tell her about \nher constitutional rights. It is a gag rule that will now be permitted \non the doctors of this country to the detriment of the patient.\n  I will go over this quickly.\n  Under current law, doctors can choose a conscience objection to \nprovide abortion services. We all support that. If a doctor personally \ndeclares a conscience objection problem, he or she does not have to \nperform an abortion. However, if a doctor doesn't have a conscience \nobjection, under the Weldon amendment, HMOs and insurance companies who \nno longer wish to provide women with information on their \nconstitutional rights can prohibit doctors from performing them and \nreferring women; they will lose their job.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it is my \nunderstanding this provision now being described not only deals with \nconscience issues but also deals with what potentially HMOs or \ninsurance companies can choose to not inform, not because of an issue \nof morality or religious beliefs, but because they just flat out \nbelieve it is not in their best business interests to do that. So we \nare changing the whole generic and fundamental reason on how we are \naddressing this issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. That is why I call it a sham conscience clause. It \ntook a conscience clause we passed in 1997 that was very fair, because \nnone of us, pro-choice or not, wanted to say to a doctor you must \nperform a procedure that you have a religious objection to, and now we \nhave taken that and thrown it out. We say for whatever reason or for no \nreason, not only a doctor but an HMO, an insurance company, can decide \nthey don't want to offer the service regardless of State law, \nregardless of local law, and regardless of Federal law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, to put this in the context of this 3,500-\npage bill that we are legislating outside of the Constitution, of the \nformal processes of hearings, not unlike the abomination of the IRS \nwhere we are creating policies that are changing both State law and \nprivacy issues, both in the case of a woman's right to have access to \nprotecting her health, and dealing with things like the Federal privacy \nlaws with regard to the IRS--what we are doing with these 3,500 pages \nis the American people are getting legislation tucked into bills \nwithout any kind of debate or transparency.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. What we have going on here is this enormous \nspending bill, and buried in it is legislation that was tacked on, in \nmany cases never discussed, such as this one Senator Conrad discovered, \nwhere a committee staff can look at Senator Grassley's tax returns or \nmy tax return, or Senator Corzine's income tax returns, or anybody's \ntax return, and give it to the press. They could choose someone who is \na constituent of ours. They could choose someone and find out what \ncharities they are contributing to.\n\n[[Page S11720]]\n\n  This is the big government watching us, and the Weldon amendment is \ntucked in here without any vote by this Senate, either in committee or \non the floor. I will tell you right now, talk about big government \nwatching you. This is big government overriding State laws in many \nStates. It is big government that is abandoning women in the emergency \nrooms who have life-threatening pregnancies, who walk into emergency \nrooms, and under a different law that protects this woman, she has to \nbe stabilized. No more; not with the Weldon amendment.\n  I wanted to say to my colleagues that I was willing to stand on my \nfeet as long as it takes because of the outrage I feel for the women in \nthis country because of the way they are treated in this bill. But I \nhave been able to work with Senator Frist, Senator Reid, and Senator \nDaschle, and it looks as though we will be able to reach an agreement \nto have a vote on my bill to repeal this Weldon amendment within the \nnext couple of months. At that time, we will shed light on it. I will \nhave far more to say about it. I wanted to tell my friends here--and I \nthank Senator Feinstein, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Corzine, who \nare on the floor--how much I appreciate your leadership on this.\n  This is an outrage.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may ask the Senator from California, the Senator \nis saying she has a commitment. Will that be expressed?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will not allow a vote until we have a colloquy read on \nthe floor between myself, Senator Reid, and Senator Frist which \npromises we will be able to have an up-or-down vote on the Weldon \namendment sometime around April, sometime before that, where we can \ndebate this on both sides, where we can share our views on it. Then I \nwill feel in my heart we have done the right thing by the women in \nAmerica, at least protecting them by letting the light shine on this \npiece of legislation, which is a shame for the women of this country, \noverriding State law, overriding laws that protect a woman who might \nwalk into an emergency room, practically at death's door, and no longer \nwould receive treatment.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I speak in strong opposition to a very \ntroubling provision in this bill that will potentially take away \nAmerican taxpayers' right to privacy regarding their personal income \ntax return.\n  The section I refer to is Section 222 of the bill. This section will \nallow any agent designated by the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee access to tax returns and tax return information.\n  Section 222 provides this sweeping new authority while at the same \ntime it throws aside years of detailed strict statutory protections for \ntaxpayers that also ensure the privacy of taxpayer information.\n  Given that the language in this section can be interpreted to \neliminate all restrictions on access to taxpayer information and \npublication of taxpayer information, there is nothing to prohibit the \nAppropriations Committee from obtaining taxpayer information, \ninformation about a corporation, information about an individual and \nreleasing it to the press without fear of penalty.\n  There is no reason that the Appropriations Committee cannot obtain \ntaxpayer information, your 1040, and just posting it on the Web.\n  This poorly drafted and even more poorly conceived legislation will \nbring us back to the doorstep of the days of Nixon, Truman and similar \ndark periods in our tax history when tax return information was used as \na club against political enemies.\n  My colleagues may find these concerns over the top but I can assure \nyou that when it comes to protection of taxpayer information the \nhistory has been a very troubling one and it is only through constant \nvigilance that we have been able to give Americans confidence that \ntheir tax return information will be protected and private.\n  I find it especially troubling that this language which will harm the \nvolunteer tax system and make the work of the IRS harder comes in an \nappropriations bill that fails to even provide the the full funding \nrequested for the IRS by President Bush.\n  What is more important, providing more money to the IRS to combat tax \nshelters, or allowing Appropriations staffers the right to dance \nthrough private citizens' tax returns at will? This is an outrage.\n  Just so my colleagues understand the claim for this language is that \nit is to allow the appropriations committee with access to IRS \nfacilities for oversight purposes but not the ability to examine \nindividual tax returns, data or information.\n  This is the statement that was made in colloquy between the chairman \nof the Ways and Means Committee and the Chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee in the other body.\n  The statement between the two members further states that it is the \nintent of the Appropriations Committees that all access to taxpayer \ninformation remains governed by the disclosure and privacy rules of \nSection 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  For my colleagues information, Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue \nCode generally governs and protects taxpayer information.\n  What is particularly frustrating is that Section 6103 already \nprovides the Appropriations Committee a means to have access to \ntaxpayer information--within the protections and limitations provided \nby law to protect taxpayer privacy.\n  The Appropriations Committee can seek permission for access to \ntaxpayer information from the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee \nor myself, in the Senate, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I have \nreceived no request for access to taxpayer information from the \nAppropriations Committee during my time as chairman.\n  However, I would say that my colleagues know my reputation for \noversight and encouraging oversight and I have been very open minded \nabout granting such requests. In addition, any committee can appeal for \nsuch authority to the House or Senate for authority--that also has \nnever taken place by the Appropriations Committee to my knowledge. \nAgain, if that authority is granted the protections provided under \nSection 6103 are still in place.\n  This provision in the omnibus bill reflects a mindset that Members \nor, more likely, their staff--don't want to be bothered with such \nlongstanding successful mechanisms to provide access for legitimate \ncongressional oversight and have instead opted for the ``easy way \nout.''\n  And let me be clear, the ``easy way out'' contained in this bill will \njeopardize taxpayer privacy and taxpayer information.\n  Let me make a final point. This section places the Commissioner of \nthe IRS in the position of possibly forcing him to violate the law \nunder Section 6103. The Commissioner of the IRS is still covered by \nSection 6103 and the penalties for improper disclosure.\n  It is my early review of this language that this Section 222 will put \nthe Commissioner in the position of an improper release of tax \ninformation in violation of 6103. In such a case it is my view that the \nCommissioner should not release any tax information under this Section \n222.\n  They say haste makes waste. In this case, with Section 222, haste has \nmade a hash of years of efforts to protect taxpayer information and \nensuring that taxpayer information is kept private. It is disgraceful \nthat all this is being done because some Members of the Congress can't \nbe bothered with following the simple rules in place to protect \ntaxpayer information. Now, I have been satisfied since this has come to \nour attention that this goes much further than what the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee has desired, or even more so, that he was not \naware of the sweep of this legislation and that it will be corrected \nshortly in other action taken by this body under the leadership of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee--and presumably, I am also told, with \nthe adherence of the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. So \nthis may no longer be an issue.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to tell the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I checked with \nChairman Young, Bill Young of the House\n\n[[Page S11721]]\n\nAppropriations Committee. Neither of us was aware this had been \ninserted in the bill. It was inserted at the request of one staff to \nanother, reliance on the statement made by one that the front office \nhad been briefed and is fine with this.\n  That was not right. No Member had ever seen it. It came out during \nthe readout. I am pleased that after it was presented to the body, it \nwas found. It does not represent the policy of the Appropriations \nCommittee. None of us have even ever discussed in a meeting either on \nthis side or the House of Representatives any further access to \ntaxpayer information. It came strictly from a staff request to another \nstaffer.\n  It is absolutely a mistake. I apologize to the Senate. I am sorry \nthat both the Senator from Iowa and his colleague, Chairman Thomas in \nthe House, properly were exercised over it. It is a mistake. It will be \ndeleted. We have made an agreement it will be totally deleted from this \nbill.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Iowa yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would this not be, the explanation just provided by the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, incredibly disturbing, that \nwe would have a bill before us, that we would have a few hours of \ndebate, and if it had not been for the alert staff, one of the staffers \nover here, this would have been passed into law?\n  This would have been passed into law. Now we find out how it \nhappened. One staffer had an agreement with another staffer, and it was \nplaced into a multithousand-page document that none of us had ever seen \nor read.\n  Doesn't the Senator from Iowa find this incredibly disturbing, that \nthere will be all kinds of pressure we vote as soon as possible on this \nbill because we all want to get out of here, that it is just \ndiscovered, but it was done by two staffers?\n  Has this system broken down completely here in the U.S. Senate?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. To the Senator from Arizona, I cannot disagree with \nwhat he says. But we do have a bill before us. And the fact is, the \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee has assured me--and he \nis a man of his word--that he is going to take action to get this out \nof here. That does not detract anything from what the Senator from \nArizona said about the bill, but I am satisfied as far as this \negregious provision being taken care of.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I do. But I want to say thank you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Arizona is absolutely warranted in his \ncomments. As I said, I apologize to the Senate. We thought we had these \nbills read through twice. Both sides read them through twice by people \nwho are involved in them.\n  I have to tell the Senator from Arizona, I do not sit there for 10 \nhours as that is being read. I rely on the people who have been with us \nnow for years and years to tell us that it has been checked properly, \nthat there is nothing in the bill that has not been approved by the \nbodies respectively and in conference.\n  But this error happened. I do apologize to the Senate. It is \nunfortunate. And it is more than a mistake; it is a terrible disaster, \nand we will have to examine our whole procedures to see if there is any \nway we can prevent it in the future. But it has happened now, and we do \napologize.\n  Congressman Young is as disturbed about it as I am, and his statement \nwas: ``Take it out now.'' And that is what we are going to do.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think the Senate should be assured.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I was present in the caucus when the Senator from North Dakota raised \nthis issue and read the language, and I think I have listened to all of \nthe commentary. I very much respect the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. I have served on that committee for 10 years now.\n  I have a very hard time accepting that this is just an inadvertent \nstaff submission, and I wanted to say why. Because this section 222, if \nyou read it in its entirety, is really an egregious abuse of power. If \nyou go down to line 17, it says: ``allow agents.'' We are not talking--\nthis is not even staff. This is anyone the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee would designate, in written form, would have \n``access [to all] Internal Revenue Service facilities and any tax \nreturns or return information'' such as legal information, cases \nbrought.\n  I cannot believe that some staffer, for some technical reason, wanted \nto insert this in the bill. I think this is an egregious overreach of \npower. I think we ought to do the right thing by it, and the right \nthing, for me, is to vote down this bill, call the House back, have \nthem reconference the bill, and do it the right way. I do not think \nthis language should be active for 1 minute, let alone 1 day. It is \njust a terrible, egregious abuse of power.\n  I do not tend to be suspicious. But I see the Senator from Idaho \nthere, and I see the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee here. Does \nanyone believe, really, that some staffer, without any permission, \nthought up a scheme by which a chairman's ``agent'' could have access \nto every IRS facility anywhere in this Nation, and every single IRS \nfiling of every citizen of this Nation?\n  I mean, you know, we were not born yesterday. We did not come down \nwith the first snow. I think that is asking for an impossibility. How \ncan we believe that? I think to just shuffle this off----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator from California yield for a quick \nquestion?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Could you see that this information might be used in \na political campaign?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely. Absolutely. I can even see it being used \nto go after some district attorney in Texas.\n  I find this an egregious abuse of power. I think we ought to spend \nsome time on it. We ought to talk about what it means. I do not think \nany Member of this body ought to accept the fact. And if some staff \ndoes have the power to simply put something in that is so widespread, \nhave the House of Representatives already pass it--and a bright staffer \nof Senator Conrad's found this. What if we had passed this bill?\n  Senator McCain is absolutely right. This place is broken. And it \nstarts by having one party left out of conference, which has become \nmore and more an accepted trait. That is how this place is broken. You \nare going to have one party where one person can insert things in the \ndead of night, in huge bills, which come to this Chamber. It has \nalready passed 345 Members of the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. It has been floating around here \nthat this is somehow a staffer who put this in. I do not know the \nanswer to that question. But certainly someone is responsible and \ncertainly it should not take an investigation lasting a year to find \nout who. Someone was responsible for this.\n\n  I ask the Senator from California, does the Senator feel we ought to \nknow who the person responsible is, and certainly anyone who would \nexceed his or her authority as a staff person to put in that kind of \nlanguage, I ask the Senator, does the Senator think that person ought \nto continue employment in either the U.S. House or the U.S. Senate?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think there certainly ought to be an investigation. \nI cannot conceive of a staffer doing this without authorization. I \ncannot conceive of a staffer--if this is so staff can go and look at \ntax loopholes, in the first place, the Appropriations Committee does \nnot need this. The Finance Committee can do that. Why does the \nAppropriations Committee need this authority? It does not make any \nsense.\n  Not only that, if you are going to copy the legislation that relates \nto the chairman of the Finance Committee, there is a sanction there, a \nvery heavy sanction for misuse of that information.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Civil and criminal.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If you are going to copy it, why not copy that part \nof it? This is not a copy job. This is somebody's innovative thinking \nof how they\n\n[[Page S11722]]\n\ncould get their minions access to the tax returns of individuals who \nmight be political opponents or who might come up against them in some \nway or for general resource information to use against an individual, \nagainst a company, against a member of the press, at any given time.\n  Everything we have tried to do, with Social Security numbers, with \nprivacy, is to protect individuals' rights to their own privacy. Every \nstricture of the IRS is to protect an individual's right to privacy.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me just finish. I am just getting wound up. Let \nme just finish this windup.\n  Here, in the dead of night--this is not poorly thought out. This is \nvery carefully thought out. Whoever did this knew exactly what they \nwere doing, and they got it through one House.\n  Please, don't shuffle this under our desks with a resolution. This \nbill should be defeated. It should go back. The House of \nRepresentatives, which passed it, should at least have to come back to \nWashington and correct their error. This is the way I feel. I think the \nAmerican people would be just appalled if they knew this was in the \nbill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will yield, certainly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It was represented on the floor that there was a colloquy \non the House side, and in that colloquy they suggested there was no \nintent for this language to permit access to individual tax returns.\n  In that colloquy, they suggested, there was no intent. Now, the \nSenator has read this language. Do you believe the representation that \nhas been made on the House floor that this didn't intend to access \nindividual tax returns?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely not, because twice on line 14 and lines 19 \nand 20, it reinforces that it is a tax return or return information. It \nbroadens it from tax return.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I might say to the Senator, if you go to lines 18 and 19, \nthat says `` . . . allow agents designated by such Chairman access to \nInternal Revenue Service facilities and any tax returns or return \ninformation contained therein.''\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It gives them free access to every IRS facility \nanywhere in America, to go and rummage through and do whatever dirty \nwork they want to do.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will ask a second question. On the House floor, they \nmade the representation that this was intended to preserve the \nprotections for individuals' rights to privacy. Now, I ask the Senator \nfrom California, is there anything in here that has a protection for \ntaxpayers of their private return information?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I worked on privacy legislation, and this absolutely \ndoes not have any protection for an individual.\n  Mr. CONRAD. In fact, it completely sweeps aside all of the \nprotections that are in law because what it says is:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing the \n     disclosure of income tax returns or return information, upon \n     written request of the Chairman of the House or Senate \n     Committee on Appropriations, the Committee of the Internal \n     Revenue Service shall allow agents designated by such \n     Chairman access to Internal Revenue Service facilities and \n     any tax returns or return information contained therein.\n\n  There is no protection; it is out the window. There is no criminal \npenalty, no civil penalty. They could call up the return of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, if they didn't like the speech he gave on the floor of \nthe Senate; they could get that return and they could release it to the \npress and have absolutely no penalty.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think I would be the first.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may make a comment--and then I \nwill defer to a question by the Senator from Idaho. I think this is so \nMachiavellian--to realize this power is being given to just one Member \nof the House and one Member of the Senate, and it is a power that I \nthink is broader than that which now exists with sanctions for the \nChairman of the Finance Committee. It is not just a staffer, it is an \nagent that can go. You can hire an investigator. You can have your \ncampaign chairman designated to go in writing. That is the broad \nfashion in which this phrase or this section is written. It is a very \nfrightening thing.\n  As I say, I don't often get exercised or upset about things, but the \nmore I read, the more I saw that it was very carefully put together. It \nis extraordinarily dangerous and a real abuse of power.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I share the Senator's outrage. I agree that \nthe Appropriations Committee chairman and ranking member and/or their \nstaffs or designees do not need this authority. You heard the Finance \nCommittee chair speak, and the ranking member has spoken; they have \nthis authority. But in them gaining this authority, there are very real \nsanctions against any disclosure.\n\n  I know this is an opportunity to make a substantial amount of \nhypotheticals. Agents are also our staffs. That is what is intended \nwithin the law, and that is what is in the law today as it relates to \nthe Finance Committee. I agree with the Senator; this ought to come \nout. You heard the chairman of the Appropriations Committee say it will \ncome out. It is now not law, nor will it become law. I think that is \nwhat is most important.\n  Is the system broken? Yes. This represents a broken system. What is \nnot broken about it are the keen eyes of all of us and our staffs. The \nranking member of the Budget Committee and his staff have found this, \nso the system is not broken; it just got discovered. It is not in the \ndark of night; it is a dark early evening. It is 6 o'clock and we are \ndoing the business of the country.\n  The Senator from California is absolutely right in what she says. I \nam not going to play hypothetical. That is the politics I will not \nenter into. But I agree with her and I suggest that we can talk a great \ndeal about this section, but it will never become law because you and I \nand the Senator from North Dakota, and everybody else on this floor, by \na vote of probably 100-0, will not allow it to happen. I thank the \nSenator for his diligence.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the comments of the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I will wrap this up. I commend my friend and \ncolleague, the junior Senator from California, Senator Boxer, for her \nindefatigable effort and perseverance on the Weldon amendment. I want \nto say how strongly I agree with her. I will submit for the Record a \nletter I circulated, signed by Senators Boxer, Snowe, Clinton, Lincoln, \nMikulski, Stabenow, Murray, Cantwell and Collins. I think if I could \nprobably sum it up for everybody, this is just one more step in \nremoving a woman's right to choose. It is a terrible step because it \nalso subjects a woman without resources to a situation where she cannot \nfind help, particularly in a rural area.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2004.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: We are writing to oppose a provision \n     called the federal refusal clause from being included in the \n     FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This provision was \n     included by Representative Dave Weldon in the FY 2005 House \n     Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill and it would allow a \n     broad range of health-care companies to refuse to comply with \n     federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to \n     abortion services.\n       Should this provision become law, federal, state, or local \n     government may no longer require any institutional or \n     individual health-care provider to provide, pay for, or refer \n     for abortion services. This will mean that medical providers \n     in hospitals and clinics across the country will likely be \n     victims of demonstrations and intimidations as this provision \n     allows that they be forbidden from providing abortion care to \n     women who need it, and also to deny women referrals to \n     another provider. It will interfere with the authority of \n     Attorneys General to reject, approve or impose terms on the \n     sale or transfer of assets by nonprofit health entities as \n     under current law. For example, an Attorney General could no \n     longer reject a merger proposal on the grounds that the \n     result would be diminished community access to full \n     reproductive health services.\n       This provision has never been considered in the Senate. \n     There have been no hearings held and no debate about this \n     provision. Further, this provision puts all states' Labor-\n     HHS-Education funding at risk and will require them to change \n     existing laws.\n       The federal refusal clause is harmful to women and denies \n     women access to reproductive health services. We ask that you \n     oppose\n\n[[Page S11723]]\n\n     its inclusion in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely, Thank you for your consideration.\n         Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Olympia Snowe, Hillary \n           Rodham Clinton, Blanche L. Lincoln, Barbara A. \n           Milkuski, Debbie Stabenow, Patty Murray, Maria \n           Cantwell, Susan Collins.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I just ran up here. I thought I heard the \nSenator from California say the chairman had sought this power?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No, I did not say that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I hoped that was not the case. In any event, the Senator \nfrom California did say it was a one-sided review, with the Republicans \nreviewing this. The staff reads out our bills--joint staff, House and \nSenate, Republican and Democrat. I don't want to embarrass anybody here \ntonight. I am sure every Senator and Congressman will talk to their \nstaff about this mistake. I assure the Senate that there were members \nin the minority from the Senate and from the House and members from the \nmajority from the Senate and House that read this bill through twice. \nIt wasn't just the majority; it was the minority and the majority \nstaff.\n  This is a mistake. It is clearly a mistake. It is an unfortunate \nmistake. I have talked to the chairman of the House committee. He was \nappalled, as I was, when we found it was in there. To my knowledge, no \nMember of the House and Senate was asked about this staff request. A \nrepresentation was made that the front office had cleared it. Actually, \nwe have to have a signoff from the minority as well as the majority \nstaff for their section of these bills. We have that signoff.\n  If the Senator from California wishes, I will tell her the members of \nthe staff on the Democratic side who reviewed this section and signed \noff on it. I don't want the Record to show it was a partisan review. We \ndo not have partisan reviews of our bills. As a matter of fact, there \nis no committee that works on a bipartisan basis more than the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Again, I apologize to the Senate. Members of my staff are going to \nanswer to me tomorrow. I want the Senate to know it was a bipartisan \nstaff from the House and the Senate that made this mistake, a terrible \nmistake. I question any staff member who would ever approve this \nlanguage without referring to a Member of the Congress to whom he or \nshe is responsible.\n  I hope the Senator from California understands it is not something we \nsought, not something we wanted. Both the chairman of the House \ncommittee and I sought to delete it the minute we found it. It was too \nlate. The House had already passed it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to discuss a \nprovision in the bill about which I think there was strong bipartisan \nagreement, because it will lift a significant burden off of minority \ncontractors around the country who wish to do business with the \nGovernment.\n  Now, as Senators know, the program under which you get certified as a \nminority contractor in the Federal Government is called the 8(a) \nProgram. State and local governments have similar certifications for \ncontracting as a minority contractor with those governments. This \npresents a serious problem for minority small businesses seeking to do \nbusiness and to take advantage of goals or set-aside programs because \nthey are, after all, small businesses. They have to get recertified \ntoday, having gotten recertified under the Federal Government, under \nState government, and recertified under local government. It is a time-\nconsuming and expensive process.\n\n  The provisions in the bill which reauthorize several of the Small \nBusiness Administration programs also contain a provision about which \nwe had unanimity on both sides of the aisle which provides that once a \nbusiness is certified as an 8(a) contract on the Federal level, it does \nnot have to go through recertification on the State and local levels in \norder to do business in programs which are federally funded.\n  This is going to save minority small businesspeople many thousands of \ndollars and, in many cases, make it possible for them to participate \nwhere otherwise they would not be able to, and enlarge their \nopportunities to do business with the Government.\n  It is a piece of legislation that I have worked on throughout this \nCongress, and I am very pleased and grateful to the chairman and \nranking member, as well as the chairmen and ranking members of the \nSmall Business Committee in the House and Senate for agreeing to it.\n  I want to establish for the purpose of legislative history that the \npurpose of it, again, is to make clear that once a minority small \nbusiness is certified as an 8(a) contractor on the Federal level, they \nare automatically certified as a minority contractor in State and local \nprograms which receive Federal funds.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record letters of support \nfrom the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the National Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Greater Kansas \nCity, the Minority Business Council of St. Louis, and the Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce of Metropolitan St. Louis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: Harry Alford,\n     Sent: Thursday, Aug. 7, 2003,\n     To: Hall, Heath, (TALENT)\n     Subject: Section 8(a) Language.\n       Heath: The National Black Chamber of Commerce is in strong \n     support of your language for ``Section 1. PARTICIPATION IN \n     FEDERALLY FUNDED PROJECTS''.\n       We surveyed 7200 8(a) companies and received responses from \n     1227 which is a 17% response rate. The first question was: \n     Would you approve of official 8a certification being accepted \n     at local government entities such as city, county, state and \n     even private corporations who are federal contractors? The \n     response was positive 1183 versus 44 which is a Yes vote by \n     96.4%.\n       The second question was: Do you find the current system \n     where you must get certified at various places redundant, \n     time consuming and costly? The response was positive 1165 \n     versus 62 which is a Yes vote by 95%.\n       Based on the response of the survey and on behalf of over 1 \n     million Black owned businesses in the nation, we support Sen. \n     Talent's effort on this matter. This will truly be helpful, \n     economical and fair.\n                                                  Harry C. Alford,\n               President/CEO, National Black Chamber of Commerce, \n     Washington, DC.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    United States Hispanic Chamber\n\n\n                                                  of Commerce,\n\n                                     Wasington, DC, July 31, 2003.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Chair, Senate Small Business Committee, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Snowe:\n       On behalf of the 1.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses \n     represented by the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce \n     (USHCC), I wish to express support for the Section 8a \n     Certification amendment to the House Small Business Act \n     Reauthorization legislation proposed by Sen. James M. Talent \n     (R-MO). The USHCC supports this critical amendment because we \n     believe it will streamline the 8a certification process for \n     many Hispanic-owned businesses, greatly enhance their \n     efficiency, remove barriers to certification and increase \n     their access to federally funded projects.\n       The majority of Hispanic-owned businesses we represent are \n     small businesses that are eligible for 8a certification. \n     Currently, small businesses are required to obtain multiple \n     certifications--at the federal, state and/or local levels. \n     This can be costly and time-consuming. This is particularly \n     burdensome for our members because most Hispanic-owned \n     businesses are small businesses with fewer than 25 people, \n     limited budgets and limited time. For many Hispanic \n     businesses, this requirement has also proven to be a barrier \n     to certification. The amended language would eliminate the \n     need to obtain state and/or local government certification if \n     a small business has already obtained federal 8a \n     certification. We believe our members would benefit greatly \n     from this because it would help focus their efforts, \n     resources and energy where it is needed most--on growing \n     their business, rather than on paperwork and procedures.\n       Not only would this amendment alleviate regulatory burdens, \n     and ensure that more Hispanic businesses enter the \n     certification process, but we believe that it will also help \n     increase business for Hispanic firms. Currently, federally \n     certified 8a small businesses must be certified by their \n     particular state and sometimes by the local government to \n     have access to projects that are funded by the federal \n     government. This amendment would provide federally certified \n     8a small businesses with access to all state and local \n     projects entirely or partly funded by the federal government.\n       As you know, Hispanic-owned businesses comprise a vital \n     part of our nation's economy. The more than 1.2 million \n     Hispanic-owned firms employ 1.3 million people and generate \n     $200 billion in annual gross receipts. With Hispanics now \n     officially the largest minority in the country with a \n     population of 38 million, we must ensure that Hispanic \n     businesses have every door open to them so they\n\n[[Page S11724]]\n\n     can continue to be powerful contributors of the U.S. economy.\n       The USHCC joins the many other trade and professional \n     associations in supporting the Section 8a Certification \n     Amendment.

The \n     elimination of the multiple certification process will \n     provide our members with greater access to all State and \n     local projects funded in whole or in part by Federal funds. \n     In addition, this will greatly decrease business costs and \n     improve the Section 8(a) program.\n       Thank you for your continued leadership and support of \n     minority small businesses in the St. Louis area. We look \n     forward to working with you in securing the passage of this \n     very important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     James B.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to this \nsweeping gag rule with which we have become familiar. It is against \nwomen's health. It has just been slipped into the omnibus spending \nbill. Even though most of this country is pro-choice, the House \nRepublicans have inserted radical anti-choice language into this \nlegislation.\n  One thing I have learned in my time in politics is that if one of the \nparties is shameless, the other party cannot afford to be spineless. I \nam pleased that my colleagues have caught on to what is going on here \nand are trying to make sure we all understand what is in this huge bill \nwe are looking at. It deserves a thorough examination.\n  I think the Senator from Maryland indicated that if you recognize \nsome mistakes in this pile of paper, one thing you know is that there \nare many others that lurk in the voluminous bill before us. So the \neffect of this Republican provision to allow doctors to be gagged from \neven discussing abortion with their patients is outrageous.\n  This morning, I heard our majority leader, Senator Frist, say that \nthe Senate should focus on ``putting the doctor-patient relationship \nfirst.'' But here the Republican majority is inserting language that \nwould block doctors from even talking to their patients about legal \nmedical procedures.\n  Under current law, if a doctor's religious beliefs prevent him or her \nfrom providing abortion procedures, then he or she cannot be forced to \nperform the procedure or even discuss it. That is called the conscience \nclause, and I think it makes sense. But what is in this omnibus bill \ngoes way beyond the conscience clause. It is a gag rule that allows a \nhospital or an HMO to order its doctors not to perform, discuss, or \neven provide basic information on abortion, and that certainly is not \nputting the doctor-patient relationship first. That is putting politics \nfirst.\n  Even if a doctor believes that the information on abortion would be \ncritical to saving the life of the mother, this new provision could be \nused to prohibit that doctor from providing such lifesaving \ninformation.\n  To put it simply, this is an outrageous attack on women's health and \nwomen's rights.\n  In addition, this Republican provision overrides State laws. I asked \nthe Senator from California a question as she was making her remarks: \nWould this eliminate the possibility that even though in the State of \nNew Jersey, my State, for example, if we allowed under our State \nconstitution the right for a woman to have an abortion, that it could \nbe overridden by Federal law if this becomes law. And the answer is \nyes--state's would not be able to enforce their own constitutional \nprotections. I guess the Republican Party suddenly wants to preempt \nState or local law from ensuring a woman's access because it does not \nsuit their agenda.\n  My State of New Jersey has such a law, but now our law would be \noverridden by this Federal gag rule, and that is totally unacceptable.\n  The provision goes so far as to say that any State or local \ngovernment that attempts to enforce its own laws or policies in the \narea of abortion could have all of its Federal labor health and \neducation funding canceled--cancel the funding for those essential \nservices.\n  My only complaint is this is not States rights, it is State bullying.\n\n  One year ago, President Bush--how well I remember it, and I am sure \nmost of my colleagues do--signed an anti-choice bill into law. It was \nan extraordinary event not just because of the terrible bill that he \nwas signing into law, but also it was quite an image that appeared in \nnewspapers across the country.\n  This is the image. Look at the image again: Smiling faces of all \nmen--all men. Not one woman Republican or Democrat stood with them when \nthe President signed that bill. They are all men, and it is downright \nfrightening. I call this photo a ``male-a-garchy.'' This photo says to \nwomen: Your right to make choices about your health and your body is \nbeing taken back from you, and these men are doing it, right here, with \nsmiling faces, and the President, with pen in hand, is signing the \nbill.\n  This trend is going to continue to be enforced by this bill today. \nThe bill before us takes away the decision-making power from women and \ndoctors, and puts it into the hands of men who lead hospitals, \ninsurance companies, and HMOs. Supporters of this gag rule claim this \npolicy change is necessary to make sure that health care providers are \nnot forced to perform abortions.\n  I want to make it crystal clear that under current law, no doctor or \nnurse in this country is required to provide or discuss abortions \nagainst their will. Unlike the conscience clause, this gag rule does \nnot protect doctors' rights, it takes doctors' rights away. Doctors \nhave a duty to ensure that patients\n\n[[Page S11725]]\n\nhave access to accurate information so that they can make the medical \ndecisions that are best for them.\n  This bill would gag them from providing that information and denies \nwomen the right to understand all of their medical options.\n  Women have the right to access to medical information about all of \ntheir options, not just those that the ``male-a-garchy'' wants them to \nhear. So I say to women across this country: Be aware, the right to \nchoose is in dire jeopardy. This bill today is yet another attempt to \nchip away at the right to reproductive choice.\n  Look at the size of the bill that we have just received. It is \nthousands of pages. Hidden within these pages is the attack on a \nwoman's right to choose.\n  It is wrong to take away people's rights by slipping it into a giant \nspending bill without any debate, without any discussion, and \nconcealing it in such a way that if we were not lucky and did not catch \nit, even though it was suggested we are studying all of these bills--\nbelieve me, when there is that much paper and it arrives so late, one \ndoes not have time to do it, and it is just luck when it is found. To \nput it bluntly, it is not becoming of a democracy.\n  I am pleased the Senators from California have secured an ironclad \nagreement from the majority leader to take up this issue before the end \nof April of next year. We look forward to that debate. The American \npeople deserve better. Open up the records. Talk about it plainly. \nDebate it fairly, and then if it comes to a vote, the people in the \ncountry will see who voted for and who voted against women's rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I speak for \n10 minutes now and then when we go to the bill for an additional 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, beginning this year, during consideration \nof the fiscal year 2004 Omnibus appropriations bill, I stood on the \nfloor and spoke about how our economic situation, our vital national \nsecurity concerns, required us to take greater effort in prioritizing \nour Federal spending and we could no longer afford business as usual. \nLittle has changed since January. Here we are again, nearly 2 full \nmonths into fiscal year 2005 and we have before us another \nappropriations monstrosity. Let me remind my colleagues that because of \nour inability to get much done under the regular order, this is the \nthird year in a row we have had to pass a mammoth consolidated \nappropriations bill. In fact, we have been forced to consider huge \nOmnibus appropriations bills for 6 of the last 8 fiscal years.\n  This is a remarkable package. This is a remarkable thing. I would \nargue that not one Member of the Senate or our loyal staffs is \nphysically capable, even if they wanted to, to read this many-thousand-\npage document. This system cannot continue.\n  Another thing that is very dispiriting, it always is considered at \nthe last minute before we go out or the last hour or the last 2 hours. \nWhy? Because the members of the Appropriations Committee know it will \nnot bear scrutiny.\n  We were able to uncover an egregious action on the part of the \ncommittee that has been fully ventilated, but if we were going to go \nout next Monday night, we would be debating this Omnibus bill next \nMonday night. If we were going out Christmas Eve, we would be debating \nChristmas Eve. It is in the appropriators' benefit for us to do it at \nthe last minute.\n  This many-hundred-page document deserves a lot more than my half-hour \nand the chairman of the Appropriations Committee's 20 minutes. Why? Why \nare we going to talk so little about it? I would like to talk for hours \nabout it, but I do not have the courage to hold up the travel plans of \nall of my colleagues. So I am only going to talk for half an hour about \na $388 billion, 1,632-page document. That is disgraceful. We are not \ndoing what we should do for our constituents. We have an obligation to \noversee their tax dollars.\n  I am going to talk about a number of the provisions. Some are fairly \nentertaining: The Clemson University, South Carolina Call Me Mister \nProgram. We are going to spend money on the curriculum development on \nthe study of mariachi music. I am going to go over some of them. They \nare remarkable.\n  The good old Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is back. We are going to give \nthem some money again. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is hurting badly.\n  It goes on and on and on: beautification projects, libraries. We are \nback to the old snake management in Guam. That is only $515,000; \n$175,000 for research into tree fruits quality. All of them, of course, \nhave a specific location. We are going to spend $443,000 to research \nand develop baby food containing salmon; $3 million for the Center for \nGrape Genetics in Geneva, NY; $2.3 million for an animal waste \nmanagement research laboratory in Bowling Green, KY; $100,000 for the \nPuerto Rican Traveling Theater in the Bronx; $100,000 for the Cedar \nCreek Battlefield Foundation. By the way, the Cedar Creek Battlefield \nFoundation proudly proclaims on their Web site that they receive no \nGovernment funding and will continue to operate as an independent \norganization.\n\n  Then there is $100,000 for the Belle Grove Plantation, an 18th-\ncentury grain and livestock farm. Here is a great one, $1 million for \nthe Norwegian American Foundation to fulfill its charter. What is the \ncharter of the Norwegian American Foundation that they need $1 million \nof my taxpayers' money?\n  It goes on and on. The energy and water, of course, is $1.796 billion \nfor construction of inland waterway projects; $12.5 million for the \nDallas floodway extension; $24 million for portions of the Big Sandy \nand Upper Cumberland River Project. A couple of these projects that \ncaught my eye are because they direct the Corps to continue with the \nconstruction of harbor projects in accordance with ``the economic \njustification.'' In other words, no cost-benefit analysis but economic \njustification. Then there is $324.5 million for Cape Girardeau, MO; $12 \nmillion, if it is going to continue, another one of the worst projects \never conceived by Congress, the Yazoo Basin, Yazoo Backwater Pumping \nPlant in Mississippi, in which the Clarion Ledger, a Mississippi \nnewspaper, had to say in an editorial, ``Death of This Boondoggle Long \nOverdue\":\n\n       So why does the Yazoo Pump Project survive-very few people \n     would benefit and the plan is so costly . . . running it \n     would be an ongoing destruction of wealth and wildlife. Yet \n     pump proponents were at it again trying to resurrect this \n     Frankenstein monster.\n\n  Core support for the International Fertilizer Development Center, \n$2.3 million. I had no idea we had an International Fertilizer \nDevelopment Center, much less that it needed $2.3 million for core \nsupport of it.\n  I guess $500,000 for Idaho weed control; $2 million for Atlantic \nsalmon grants; $790,000 for the Bering Sea Fisherman's Association. I \nguess the Bering Sea Fisherman's Association cannot raise their dues \nenough to sustain themselves. We have to give them $790,000. We go \nthrough this every year. Three million for Wheeling Jesuit University \nfor the National Technology Transfer Center for a coal slurry \nimpoundment pilot project; $20 million to Project GRAD-USA in Houston, \nTX, for continued support and expansion of the program focusing on \nschool reform; $350,000 for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in \nCleveland for music education programs. Being a fan of rock and roll \nmyself, I guess that is well justified.\n  The fact is we are looking at a deficit of enormous proportions where \nAlan Greenspan as recently as the day before yesterday warned us about \nthe impact on our economy. Some of these, such as what is being done on \nNASA funding, is harmful to the mission and capabilities of NASA \nitself. According to information compiled from the Congressional \nResearch Service, the total number of earmarks has grown from 4,126 to \n14,040 in fiscal year 2004. In terms of dollars of earmarking, it has \ngone from $26.6 billion to $47.9 billion. That is in the space of 10 \nyears.\n  If you extrapolate that, we are really on a remarkable path. I was \nshocked when I read a recent report ``Is Pork Barrel Spending Ready to \nExplode? The Anatomy of an Earmark'' by Ronald D. Utt, Ph.D., published \nby the Heritage Foundation, which details a new scheme by lobbyists to \nsell earmarks.\n\n[[Page S11726]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [Published by the Heritage Foundation, Nov. 10, 2004]\n\n  Is Pork Barrel Spending Ready To Explode? The Anatomy of an Earmark\n\n                       (By Ronald D. Utt, Ph.D.)\n\n       A news item appearing this November in a Virginia newspaper \n     reveals the emergence of what may be a lucrative new lobbying \n     strategy that could substantially increase federal pork-\n     barrel spending. In the past, earmark-seeking entities \n     approached earmark-providing lobbyists for assistance in \n     getting a piece of the federal budget. But in this new \n     strategy, lobbyists openly sell such services to unserved \n     institutions and individuals by convincing them that they \n     might be eligible for an earmark, providing that they are \n     willing to pay a four-figure monthly retainer.\n       The new strategy was recently revealed by way of a \n     prospective earmark for a $3.5 million community sports \n     complex in Culpeper County, Virginia. The county has just \n     begun construction on the project, which was to be funded \n     with the proceeds of a county bond offering the voters \n     approved a few years ago. But that financial arrangement \n     might change now that a lobbyist paid the county a visit and \n     pointed out that, for a fee, the county could get the federal \n     government to pay for the complex. As reported in the Free \n     Lance Star, a county official says that ``he had been \n     approached by a representative of Alcalde and Fay, a Northern \n     Virginia lobbying group, who expressed optimism that funds \n     for the $3.5 million sports complex could be tied to one or \n     more federal appropriation bills.'' [1]\n       The article also noted that ``The cost of hiring Alcalde \n     and Fay would be $5,000 per month, with an 18-month \n     recommended contract.'' While the average American family \n     might consider this a steep price, the prospective \n     arrangement's payoff reveals what a bargain it is for the \n     county. With their fees totaling $90,000 for a prospective \n     federal grant of $3.5 million, Alcalde and Fay are, for all \n     intents and purposes, selling federal taxpayer money for just \n     2.6 cents on the dollar. Anyone who has suspected that \n     Washington places little value on taxpayers' hard-earned \n     dollars now has an idea of just how diminished that value \n     is--somewhat less than the market price for defaulted \n     Argentine debt.\n       How the Culpeper transaction unfolds bears watching for \n     several reasons. From the perspective of federal fiscal \n     integrity, this new earmark strategy could open the \n     floodgates to me-too projects across the country that would \n     otherwise be funded with local resources. Just thirty miles \n     down the road from Culpeper is the town of Fredericksburg, \n     which is now in the process of committing itself, and its \n     budgetary resources, to a $6 million recreation complex with \n     indoor and outdoor swimming pools. Now apprised of Culpeper's \n     prospective earmark, could the elected officials in \n     Fredericksburg be faulted for ringing up a lobbyist of their \n     own?\n       And in the not-too-distant future it is quite likely that \n     the federal budget process will no longer take place in the \n     halls of Congress, as the Constitution requires, but in the \n     dozens of offices of Washington's top lobbyists--largely \n     driven by generous contracts between the firms and their \n     clients.\n       Another reason this process bears watching is for how it \n     reflects on Congress. The lobbyist is proposing to sell \n     something that is not really his to sell. That he believes he \n     can deliver it tells us that something is terribly wrong in \n     Congress. It is one thing for members of Congress to make \n     pork-barrel spending promises to their constituents and \n     deliver on them, but it is quite another that earmarks can be \n     bought and sold like bushels of wheat on the open market by \n     private speculators. And apparently, all this wheeling and \n     dealing is taking place without any involvement (at least not \n     yet) by a member of Congress.\n       As noted earlier, if Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the \n     Constitution reserves exclusively to Congress the power of \n     appropriating money from the U.S. Treasury, how is it that \n     these lobbyists have come by the same privilege, and who has \n     allowed it to happen?\n       That is a good question, and in the event that the County \n     of Culpeper signs a contract with Alcalde and Fay to secure \n     $3.5 million for the sports complex now being built, the \n     Heritage Foundation, in partnership with fiscally responsible \n     members of Congress, will closely track this process and \n     determine how, and at what point, the writing of \n     appropriations bills was outsourced to the lobbying community \n     on a for-profit basis.\n       Alcalde and Fay, of course, is not the only firm engaged in \n     the misdirection of federal resources through the pay-to-play \n     process. In a process previously described (See Heritage \n     Backgrounder No. 1527, ``Can Congress Be Embarrassed into \n     Ending Wasteful Pork-Barrel Spending? ''), the market for \n     earmarks in appropriation bills has been growing rapidly and, \n     given its profitability, will likely continue its robust \n     growth. In recent years, some members of Congress and \n     government officials--notably former OMB head Mitchell \n     Daniels, Sen. John McCain, and Rep. Jeff Flake--have tried to \n     dampen the practice, but they have had little success in \n     cultivating a greater awareness of fiscal hygiene among the \n     vast majority of their colleagues who believe that electoral \n     success grants unlimited access to taxpayers' credit cards. \n     Between 1997 and 2004, appropriations earmarks have increased \n     from under 2,000 to over 10,000, and this year's failed \n     highway reauthorization contained more than 3,000 pork-barrel \n     earmarks, compared to 1,800 in the previous bill and only 10 \n     in the highway bill passed by Congress in 1982.\n       That Congress once showed budgetary restraint and fiscal \n     continence suggests that the propensity to earmark is not \n     some inherent flaw in American democracy, but rather a \n     willful irresponsibility now embraced by all too many \n     members. Among the many tasks confronting the re-elected \n     President Bush will be to reduce federal spending from its \n     near record levels as a share of GDP and to narrow the \n     deficit, which now hovers at $413 billion. A good place to \n     find fiscal redemption is in the appropriation bills that \n     will soon come across the President's desk. The first step in \n     the process should be a sharply worded veto threat. It would \n     be a welcome change if that veto threat included excess \n     earmarks as one of many items that would merit a presidential \n     rejection.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I quote:\n\n       That Congress once showed budgetary restraint and fiscal \n     continence suggests that the propensity to earmark is not \n     some inherent flaw in American democracy, but rather a \n     willful irresponsibility now embraced by too many members.\n\n  We now have a deficit of $413 billion.\n\n       A good place to find fiscal redemption is in the \n     appropriations bills that will soon come to the President's \n     desk. The first step in the process should be a sharply \n     worded veto threat. It will be a welcome change if that veto \n     threat included excess earmarks as one of the many items that \n     would merit a presidential rejection.\n\n  Here is the stark reality of our fiscal situation. According to the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the unfunded Federal financial \nburden, such as public debt, future Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid payments, total more than $40 trillion, or $140,000 per man, \nwoman, and child.\n  To put this in perspective, the average mortgage which is often a \nfamily's largest liability is $124,000, and that is often borne by the \nfamily breadwinners, not the children, too. But, instead of fixing the \nproblem, and fixing it will not be easy, we only succeeded in making it \nbigger and more unstable, more complicated and much more expensive.\n  I point out that it is well known that the President very soon will \ncome over and ask for an additional $70 billion to fight the war in \nIraq. I believe--and I said this a long time ago, and it is true today \nand it will be true when I say it again a year or two from now--we are \ngoing to be in Iraq for a long time. I pray every day that we prevail. \nI pray every day for the young men and women who are serving and in \nharm's way. But there is no doubt in my mind that we will have many \nbillions of dollars yet to spend on Iraq and Afghanistan. All of us are \naware we now face a growing threat from North Korea and a recent very \nserious one from Iran.\n  There is no one I know who is an expert outside the administration \nwho does not believe we are going to have to spend a lot more money on \ndefense, one reason being that our military is too small. We need as \nmany as 80,000 more men and women in the Army. We need 20,000 to 30,000 \nmore men and women in the Marine Corps. It is all going to cost money. \nBut, instead, we are going to spend tens of billions of dollars in \nwasteful and unnecessary spending and increase this debt on future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  We can't afford to do this. We cannot afford to continue a broken \nsystem such as this, where the night we are going out of session we \nhave a 1,630-page bill that none of us have seen or read and in which a \nparticularly onerous provision which, if it hadn't been for the Senator \nfrom North Dakota bringing to our attention, would have been an \nunprecedented invasion of the American family's privacy. But there are \nother provisions in this bill which no one has seen or read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator have \nadditional time, if he desires it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, The Conference Report, once again, \ncontains earmarks of $10 million for the Alaska Fisheries Marketing \nBoard--is there something wrong with these fish that warrants such an \nexpensive program to convince us to eat them? And now it also has $1 \nmillion for the Wild American Shrimp Initiative. I am hoping\n\n[[Page S11727]]\n\nthat the appropriators could explain to me why we need $1 million for \nthis--are American shrimp unruly and lacking initiative? Why does the \nUS taxpayer need to fund this ``no shrimp left behind'' act?\n\n  At the Department of Justice, Section 619: $100,000 for the Puerto \nRican Traveling Theater in Bronx, NY for outreach and programs. This \ntheater has produced 104 plays in both English and Spanish, and is not \ncommunity based; $100,000 for The Cedar Creek Battlefield Foundation. \nIt preserves lands where battles were fought, reenacts battles. It \nproclaims on their website that ``the Cedar Creek Battlefield \nFoundation receives no government funding and will continue to operate \nas an independent organization.''\n  Then $100,000 for the Shenandoah Valley Travel Association. This \nassociation presents a comprehensive tourism guide to attractions, \nlodging, restaurants, shopping and other services.\n  And $100,000 for the Belle Grove Plantation. Belle Grove is a \npreserved 18th-century grain and livestock farm.\n  And $1,100,000 for the MountainMade Foundation for outreach and \npromotion, the education of artists and craftspeople, and to promote \nsmall businesses, artisans and their products.\n  And $1,000,000 for the Norwegian American Foundation to fulfill its \ncharter. This foundation promotes further cooperation among all \nNorwegian American organizations.\n  Mr. President, while I understand that the omnibus before us is a \nglaring and wasteful sign of the Senate's failure to consider and pass \nindividual appropriation bills, I had hoped that the bill would succeed \nin hold the line against wasteful and unnecessary pork following a vote \nto raise the debt limit. My colleagues have become accustomed to my \nrailing against pork-barrel spending, but if there was ever a time when \nwe all needed to rally against it for the good of our country, our \neconomy, and our current commitments and security priorities, it is \nnow.\n  This bill in no way reflects the fiscal realities of our times. One \ncan go directly to the energy and water appropriations section of this \nbill to take a quick read of the pork fantasies that federal taxpayers \nwill be plagued by.\n  Senator Feingold and I sent a letter to leadership last week urging \nthe exclusion of Water Resources Development Act provisions because of \nthe costly and wasteful water projects included as well as the neglect \nof much-needed Army Corps reform. I am heartened to see that the bill \nwith the full compliment of costly water projects was not included. \nHowever, there are billions of dollars earmarked for a host of water \nprojects.\n  Let's start at the top of the big ticket list-$1.796 billion is \nprovided construction of inland waterway projects. I was relieved to \nsee that funds are provided for the rehabilitation of specific locks in \nthe Upper Mississippi-Illinois Waterway, but not for the incredibly \nwasteful $2.3 billion locks expansion project.\n  This project has received attention in papers throughout the country \nbecause it is such an extreme example of a very expensive and \nunnecessary water project that some members are determined to foist on \nAmerican taxpayers. A New York Times editorial from November 18th \ndiscussing the possible riders to be attached to the omnibus bill \nstated, ``but the worst by far is a proposed $2 billion expansion of \nthe lock system on the upper Mississippi River, a project that the \nNational Academy of Sciences has twice reviewed and twice declared a \nwaste of money.''\n  After a conscientious economist at the Corps blew the whistle on this \nproject and heads rolled, the National Academy of Sciences undertook a \nstudy of the project and then a second oneI guess just in case Congress \nwas ignoring the first one- and both conclude that this project cannot \nbe justified by current or projected barge traffic and there are \ninexpensive and effective alternatives available.\n  And in spite of this irrefutable, objective information, there have \nbeen concerted efforts to get Congress to approve spending $1.8 billion \ndollars to satisfy special interests instead of the public interest. \nIt's wrong and its shameful. Speaking of interests, the interests of \nyour own state would also be affected by this project because it will \nsuck up such a significant percentage of the Corps program funding \nthere just won't be enough to go around in years to come.\n  Next to the mother of all wasteful Corps projects, other earmarks \nlook downright insignificant: $12.5 million for the Dallas Floodway \nExtension, $24 million for portions of the Big Sandy and Upper \nCumberland River Project, and a not too surprising number of Alaska \nprojects. A couple of these caught my eye as they direct the Corps to \ncontinue with the construction of harbor projects in accordance with \n``the economic justification'' contained in the Engineers report. I've \nnot seen the cost-benefit analysis of these projects but this language \nensures that there won't be any question regarding their justification.\n\n  The rest of this section of the bill is a litany of multi-million \ndollar projects earmarked for Missouri, California, Hawaii and other \nstates and I hope that these are all worthy projects. There is $324.5 \nmillion provided for flood damage reduction in Cape Girardeau, Missouri \nand I don't know where all that money is going but $12 million of it is \ngoing to continue another one of the worst projects ever conceived by \nCongress. This is the Yazoo Basin, Yazoo Backwater Pumping Plant, \nMississippi which I've spoken against on the Senate floor before. Well, \nits back.\n  Again, this is another of those projects that newspapers like to \nwrite about in pointing out the folly of congressional spending. Here's \nwhat the Clarion Ledger, a Mississippi newspaper had to say in an \neditorial titled ``Death of this Boondoggle Long Overdue'', ``So why \ndoes the Yazoo Pump Project survive--very few people would benefit and \nthe plan is so costly . . . running it would be an ongoing destruction \nof wealth and wildlife. Yet pump proponents were at it again trying to \nresurrect this Frankenstein monster''. The New York Times concurred, \n``Yazoo Pump ranks among the most indefensible projects undertaken at \nCongressional behest. It would drain 200,000 acres of valuable wetlands \n. . . and would benefit nobody except a relatively small number of big \ngrowers, who already drink copiously from the public trough''.\n  I highlight this egregious project among others to make the point \nthat this bill clearly reflects that we are not doing our essential job \nof expending public funds wisely and responsibly and if not now then \nwhen will we ever take this duty seriously?\n  The report language earmarks up to $2,000,000 for Water Missions \nInternational to develop clean water treatment projects in developing \ncountries; At least $4,000,000 for the International Fertilizer \nDevelopment Center; $1,000,000 directed for support of the United \nStates Telecommunications Training Institute; $1,000,000 for the \nInternational Real Property Foundation; $3,000,000 for Internews, to \npromote freedom of the media in Indonesia; $3,000,000 for the \nFoundation for Security and Sustainability; and $2,000,000 for Zanmi \nLasante.\n  Mr. President, the Interior bill language also includes individual \nlocation specific earmarks and provisions in this section of the \nlegislation. Of note: a provision stating that, out of amounts for \nResource Management maintenance is provided for the herd of long-horned \ncattle on the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge; a provision stating \nthat, notwithstanding any provision of law including NEPA, nonrenewable \ngrazing permits authorized by the Jarbidge Field Office, Bureau of Land \nManagement within the past 8 years shall be renewed; $1.5 million is \nearmarked for wood products wastewater treatment plant repairs in \nCanton, NC; $5.0 million is earmarked, in addition to its normal \nallocation, to Alaska Region to establish a 3-year timber supply; $18 \nmillion is earmarked to continue a multi-year project coordinated with \nthe private sector for FutureGen in Alaska; $50 million is made \navailable for a request of proposals for a Clean Coal Power Initiative \nfor competitively awarded research, development, and demonstration \nprojects; $18 million is made available to carry out naval petroleum \nand oil shale reserve activities; $500 million, which was not requested \nby the President, in included as additional funding for wildland fire \nsuppression funds for fiscal year 2005.\n\n[[Page S11728]]\n\n  Mr. President, I did not have enough time to count every earmark in \ndivision E of the conference report, but it is safe to say that there \nare well over 1,000 individual location specific earmarks in this \nsection of the legislation. Of note: $500,000 for Idaho weed control; \n$2 million for Atlantic salmon grants administered by the National Fish \nand Wildlife Federation; $500,000 for Lahonton cutthroat trout; $1.8 \nmillion for eider and sea otter recovery at the Alaska SeaLife Center; \nand $250,000 for concho water snake delisting efforts in Texas.\n  For the Bureau of Land Management there are 32 location specific \nearmarks for land acquisition, including $3.4 million for the Baca \nNational Wildlife Refuge in Colorado and $2 million for the James \nCampbell National Wildlife Refuge in Hawaii. These 32 earmarks amount \nto almost $23 million in spending.\n  The National Recreation and Preservation provisions include $2.5 \nmillion for the Chesapeake Bay Gateway and $750,000 for the Alaska \nNational Parks. The Historic Preservation Fund is loaded with 84 \nlocation-specific earmarks totaling $15 million. There are 78 earmarks \nin the construction account totaling approximately $192 million. Some \nof the more egregious examples of these earmarks include: $8.7 million \nfor the Crater Lake National Park in Oregon; $3.0 million for the Blue \nRidge Parkway in North Carolina; $7.4 million for Denali National Park \nin Alaska; $10.8 million for Gettysburg National Memorial Park in \nPennsylvania; $10 million for the Lassen Volcanic National Park in \nCalifornia; $15.5 million for Olympic National Park in Washington; and \nover $15 million for Yellowstone National Park.\n  Mr. President, every year I marvel at how well the residents of \nAlaska make out in these appropriations bills. This year is no \nexception. Throughout the division E, earmarks for Alaska abound. Just \na sampling of these projects include: $1.2 million for the Alaska \nmineral resource assessment program; $100,000 for the Alaska Geological \nMaterials Center; $150,000 for the Alaska Whaling Commission; $900,000 \nfor the Marine Mineral Technology Center; $98,000 for the Alaska Sea \nOtter Commission; $790,000 for the Bering Sea Fisherman's Association; \n$346,000 for the Chugach Regional Resources Commission; $750,00 for the \nrural Alaska Fire Program; and $750,000 for the Alaska native aviation \nprogram.\n  Out of the Employment and Training Administration account the bill \nprovides the following amounts for non-competitive grants: $2,200,000 \nfor the AFL-CIO Appalachian Council, Incorporated; $1,500,000 for the \nAFL-CIO Working for America Institute; $4,000,000 for the Black Clergy \nof Philadelphia and Vicinity; $2,600,000 for the National Center on \nEducation and the Economy.\n  Out of the Departmental Management Salaries and Expenses account the \nbill provides: $7,000,000 for Frances Perkins Building Security \nEnhancements.\n  Out of Department of Labor project pilots and demonstrations, the \nstatement of managers suggests the following earmarks: $100,000 for 413 \nHope Mission Ministries, Philadelphia, PA for employment skills \ntraining for disadvantaged adults and ex-offenders; $500,000 for Alaska \nDepartment of Labor and Workforce Development, Juneau, AK to fund \ntraining for gas pipeline workers; $200,000 for Central State \nUniversity, Wilberforce, OH, to implement a world class modular \nautomation training system; $225,000 for Cook Inlet Tribal Council for \nthe Alaska's People Program in Anchorage, AK; $50,000 for Fashion \nBusiness, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, for workforce development and \ntraining; $500,000 for Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, \nRobotics and Automated Systems for Nursery Industry.\n  Out of DoL Mine Safety and Health Administration, the statement of \nmanagers suggests the following earmarks: $750,000 for infrastructure \nimprovements at the Mine Academy in Buckley, WV; $3,000,000 for \nWheeling Jesuit University for the National Technology Transfer Center \nfor a coal slurry impoundment pilot project.\n  This conference report includes funding for a number of important \npublic health programs and research activities funded through the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HIS). However, the \nappropriators were once again unable to allow the Department to \nallocate funds through merit based grants and took it upon themselves \nto select projects which they believe to be worthy of funding. The HHS \nsection of the Joint Explanatory Statement includes 53 pages full of \nmore than 1,400 earmarks, totaling over $603 million.\n  Some particularly large examples include: $10 million for the Medical \nUniversity of South Carolina Oncology Center in Charleston, South \nCarolina, for the construction of the Allied Health Technology Tower; \n$10 million for the Shepherd University in Shepherdstown, West \nVirginia, for the construction of a nursing education facility; $10.25 \nmillion for the University of Louisville, in Louisville, Kentucky, for \nthe Baxter III Research Building; $10 million for the University of \nSouth Alabama in Mobile, Alabama; and $10 million for the West Virginia \nUniversity for the construction of a Biomedical Science Research \nCenter.\n  It shouldn't be surprising to any of my colleagues that the section \nof the Joint Explanatory Statement for the Department of Education is \nagain loaded up with pork barrel projects designated to schools and \norganizations which the members of the Appropriations Committees, \nrather than the Department of Education, deemed worthy of federal \ndollars. In the 43 pages of the statement, devoted exclusively to pork, \nthe appropriators included an estimated 1,147 earmarks, amounting to \nwell over $392 million.\n  Among the more egregious examples is: $20 million to Project GRAD-USA \nInc, in Houston, Texas, for continued support and expansion of the \nprogram focusing on school reform; $18 million to provide assistance to \nlow-performing schools in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department \nof Education; and $15 million for the Iowa Department of Education to \ncontinue the Harkin grant program.\n  $350,000 for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, \nOhio for music education programs.\n  I am sure that many Americans would be surprised to learn that there \nare even state specific earmarks in the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations. The appropriations bill that is supposed to fund the \nwork of Congress and its related offices is also being used to ``bring \nhome the bacon.'' The bill specifically earmarks $300,000 in funding \nfrom the Library of Congress (LOC) for the University of South Carolina \nfor the preservation of Movietone Newsreels. The Joint Explanatory \nStatement mandates that the LOC establish a program under its Adventure \nof the American Mind initiative in Georgia. Clearly both are worthwhile \nendeavors, but why are the University of South Carolina and the state \nof Georgia more deserving of these distinctions then any other \nuniversity or state.\n  The conference report provides $1.1 billion more than requested by \nthe President for the federal-highway program. All of the extra \nfunding, plus another $100 million, is used to $1.2 billion for 795 \nearmarked projects. Among the projects deemed worthy of funding are: \nAccess to the Ebenezer Swamp Wetlands Interpretative Center in Alabama \n($225,000); The Girl Scouts Golden Valley Council bridge project in \nCalifornia ($150,000); Farm crossings in Ventura County, California \n($500,000); and Streetlights and a salt dome for Markham, Illinois \n($300,000).\n  The conference report prohibits the use of funding to implement or \nenforce any provision of the new hours of service regulations to \noperators of utility service vehicles, or to the transportation of \nproperty or passengers to or from a motion picture or television \nproduction site. I find this particularly ironic given the fact that \nCongress, as part of the 8-month extension of the highway program \npassed in September, mandated that the new hours of service regulations \nremain in place for the next year in spite of the decision of the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals striking down the regulations as arbitrary and \ncapricious.\n  The conference report provides $1.217 billion for Amtrak, $317 \nmillion above the amount supported by the President without significant \nreform and restructuring, continues strong oversight by the Department \nof Transportation, and requires Amtrak to begin paying back its $100 \nmillion loan from the Federal Railroad Administration. While I am\n\n[[Page S11729]]\n\nrelieved that the appropriators continue to resist Amtrak's pleas for \nsignificantly higher funding, I am concerned about that Amtrak will use \nits appropriation to simply continue operating the same train network, \nand continue to rack up record operating losses.\n  I agree completely with the conclusions reached yesterday in a report \nby the Department of Transportation's Inspector General on Amtrak's \n2003 and 2004 financial performance and requirements. The report states \nthat ``The bottom line is that the existing system is not sustainable \nat current funding levels . . .'' and that ``Amtrak's management must \nfind ways to reduce its need for operating subsidies and set better \npriorities for capital dollars.'' As I have said many times, it is time \nto restructure Amtrak. Amtrak should focus on short-distance corridors \nwhere rail service can compete with other modes of transportation, and \nthe long distance trains should be restructured or eliminated. If \nAmtrak won't follow implement this strategy, then it is the \nresponsibility of Amtrak's Board of Directors, the Secretary of \nTransportation, and Congress to make it happen.''\n  The conference report also contains a provision that would expand an \nexisting waiver for the state of New Hampshire from the 80,000-pound \ntruck weight limit on the Interstate System. Trucks would be allowed to \noperate at up to 99,000 pounds on Interstates 89 and 93 (in addition to \nI-95 which is current law). Bad, Very Bad.\n  The conferees state that returning the Shuttle fleet to flight should \nbe NASA's highest priority because it's the first step in the Space \nExploration Initiative. Just two weeks ago, NASA notified the Commerce \nCommittee that the Shuttle return to flights costs for fiscal year 2005 \nalone would exceed $762 million. The Commerce Committee awaits NASA's \nplan for covering these costs. Whatever the plan, it is only further \ncomplicated by the fact that the conference report contains 16 pages of \nearmarks in the NASA budget, including such things as $1,000,000 to the \nSouthern Methodist University to develop multifabrication manufacturing \ntechnology, $750,000 for the GeoTREE project at the University of \nNorthern Iowa, and $3,000,000 for our familiar friend, the ultra-long \nballoon program at New Mexico State University.\n  The conferees go on to say that if NASA needs more money just send in \na supplemental request. It would be given full and fair consideration \nby Congress. Maybe we should just send the blank check now and ask NASA \nto fill it out. This type of behavior represents no accountability and \nactually encourages NASA to spend without regard to budgetary reality.\n  The liberation of NASA continues by the conferees' granting NASA \nunrestrained transfer authority between the ``Exploration \nCapabilities'' account and the ``Science, Aeronautics, and \nExploration'' account. This was requested by NASA and granted by the \nAppropriators under the disguise of the need for flexibility to \ntransition to full cost accounting. These two accounts represent over \n$16 billion. In essence we're saying, ``NASA, do what you want with the \nmoney.'' The statement of managers goes on to say that the transfer \nauthority can be used for purposes other than addressing full cost \naccounting, but that NASA should ``do so with restraint.'' I don't \nunderstand--the statement of managers earlier specifically said that \nwould have ``unrestrained transfer authority.'' What's the ``do so with \nrestraint'' all about?\n  Inserted in the last section of the omnibus, in a miscellaneous \nsection, is a provision which would modify federal pension laws for \nmultiemployer pension plans covering employees working in the State of \nAlaska.\n  Title 6 in CJS, Page 170--prevents FCC from implementing February 27, \n2004 recommendation of the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal \nService that universal service fund (USF) support only be provided to \nprimary lines in order to keep the USF solvent.\n  This section removes the ability of the FCC to act of the \nrecommendation of the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service \nadvocating that universal service funds should be used only toward \nconsumers' primary telephone line.\n  This is a significant limitation on potential action by the FCC. I \nobject to this provision because it should have been considered, \nreviewed and acted upon by the members of the Committee of \njurisdiction, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, before being enacted into law. No member of the \nCommittee approached me requesting to move legislation on such a \nlimitation. I am unable to state whether this is a good policy decision \nbecause, similar to the FCC, the Committee of jurisdiction was not \nprovided the courtesy to review and consider the proposed policy \nchange.\n  In CJS, missing page 60--which covers funding for NTIA, which is \nunder Commerce jurisdiction, so unknown funding levels.\n  As Chairman of the Committee of jurisdiction over National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), I regret that \nI am unable to comment on the appropriations levels for this \nadministration because the levels were not made available in the text \nof the bill. Although this may be merely a clerical error, it is \nunacceptable, nonetheless.\n  In CJS, section 112--Alaska Telecommunications provisions to resolve \nseveral pending FCC proceedings involving investigations into Alaska \nrate tariffs and reviews Alaska telecommunication rates.\n  This section, slipped into the omnibus under the cloak of darkness, \nremoves the ability of the FCC to act on several pending proceedings \naffecting the rates of Alaskan telecommunications services.\n  I object to this provision because it should have been considered, \nreviewed and acted upon by the members of the Committee of \njurisdiction, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, before being enacted into law. Additionally, the FCC \nwas nearing competition of the proceeding and the Committee could have \nacted in response to the FCC's actions if Congress found the outcome to \nbe detrimental to Alaskan consumers. No member of the Committee \napproached me requesting to move legislation to end the tariff \ninvestigation and other proceedings involving Alaska telecommunications \nservices. While I understand both parties to the tariff dispute support \nthe provision included in the omnibus, I am unable to state whether I \nsupport it because the Committee of jurisdiction was not provided the \ncourtesy to hold hearings and mark up legislation on the issue.\n  I object to the inclusion of this legislation in the omnibus. I \nactually support the content of this legislation, which is the product \nof lengthy negotiations among the Judiciary and Commerce Committees of \nboth Houses. The bill ensures that rural consumers will continue to \nenjoy network programming, and for the first time, provides a means for \nthese same consumers to enjoy high definition network programming via \nsatellite. I nevertheless regret that this important policy was added \nto an appropriations vehicle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send to the desk a joint resolution.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate is in a \nperiod for morning business with Senators allowed to speak for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, earlier the Senator from Idaho indicated \nthis provision that would allow Appropriations staffers, the designees \nof the Appropriations Committee leadership, to access any tax return in \nthe country would not become law. I listened to that. I hoped it was \nnot the case. But I don't see any way that, if we pass this bill \ntonight, this provision does not become law.\n  Let me just go through where we are, at least my understanding of \nwhere we are. I would like to be corrected if I am wrong.\n  In this bill, these 3,000 pages that have been put before us today \nand we are asked to vote hours later, that spends $388 billion, there \nis a provision that says the agents of the Appropriations Committee can \nhave access to any tax return in the country and that there is no legal \nprotection for them. That is the provision that is here. It\n\n[[Page S11730]]\n\nhas already passed the House of Representatives. If we pass this bill \ntonight and it goes to the President for signature, that will become \nthe law of the land.\n  I am understanding that Senator Stevens, acting in good faith here--\nand he is acting in good faith and he is, I think, doing his level best \nto try to correct this--is proposing the passage of a concurrent \nresolution that would pass here.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Joint.\n  Mr. CONRAD. A joint resolution removing this provision. But that \nwould be subject to the House acting and the House will not be prepared \nto act, I am told, until December 6. At the same time, we are running \nout of time on a continuing resolution and the President will be \nrequired to sign this Omnibus bill, I am told, before that continuing \nresolution removing this power, this ability to have agents look at any \ntax return in the country and release them without any penalty, without \nany civil penalty, without any criminal penalty.\n  When the Senator from Idaho says this will not become law, that is \nnot right. This will become law if we pass this tonight. That is my \nunderstanding. I would like to be corrected if that is not the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct that the provision would stay in \nthe law. But we will pass a joint resolution. It is my understanding \nthat will be passed and the Speaker of the House and chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee guaranteed this would be the case when the \nHouse reconvenes.\n  Meanwhile, it is our understanding that the President of the United \nStates will issue a statement when he signs the bill that this section \nshall be disregarded because of the action taken by the Senate and the \ncommitment of the House to act when it comes back. I think that is a \ngood-faith effort to correct a serious mistake, a terrible mistake.\n  The Senator is right about the section. But I want to assure him the \nimplication that either the chairman of the House committee or I, as \nchairman of this committee, ever wanted such authority is wrong. We \nnever sought it. It was an accident, a mistake. A representation was \nmade by one staff member that the front office in the other body had \ncleared this. On the basis of that, it was put into the section.\n  When it was before the bipartisan staff in both Houses, it was not \neven noticed. Under the circumstances, it is something the Senator from \nArizona criticized and I too criticize it. It is something contrary to \nanything I have ever had happen in over 30 years on the committee. But \nit can be corrected and the law will not be permitted.\n  By the way, it takes the request of the chairman of either House to \ntrigger it. We have stated categorically we will not trigger this \nsection. It is not available to anyone else. It is available only to \nthe chairman of the House Appropriations Committee or the chairman of \nour Senate committee. And I have stated categorically on the record we \nwould never use that. We didn't seek this authority. We are as appalled \nas the Senator from North Dakota. I hope you would rely upon our good \nfaith to try to correct the staff error. Certainly no Member of \nCongress that I know of, other than the person who originally suggested \nit in the House, ever sought this. I am led to believe the language is \nnot what he sought, but it is one of those things that happened at the \nlast minute. It is a terrible thing.\n  We are in this situation because we never had a budget. We never \npassed our appropriations bills at the time we should have. We had to \nconstruct a ceiling we would operate under. Senator Byrd and I have \ntried our best to comply with the circumstances. But we didn't get the \nchance to even look at it--the Appropriations Committee on these nine \nbills--until after we came back from the August recess. We have been \nunder pressure now since we came back. We have been under pressure now \nfor 3 days. Some of my people haven't slept for 2 days, and one of them \nmade a mistake--one of my staff. I can tell you he had not had sleep \nfor 2 days.\n  This is a serious situation. It shouldn't happen. The Senator from \nArizona is right. It should never happen. I pray to God it will never \nhappen. It will not happen under my watch. My watch is over tonight, \nbut I guarantee you that during the time I am chairman, I will not use \nthis authority and it will be taken out of this bill.\n  The first reaction of the chairman from Florida, Bill Young, was, \ntake it out; take it out now. I share that reaction.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I have no \nquestion about the good faith of the Senator from Alaska--none. His \nword is good for me because he has demonstrated repeatedly to me his \nword is good.\n  The problem I have is I am about to be asked to vote for this measure \nand it will become law. The President can make any declaration he wants \nupon signature of the law that he doesn't consider it effective. That \nhas no legal standing. The fact is the House has passed this. If we now \npass it, and the President signs it before that joint resolution is \neffective, this will become the law of the land. And it is a mistake. \nIt shouldn't happen. It should never have happened.\n  I know this was not moved by any Member of the Senate. I know this \nhappened as a result of something that happened on the House side. \nStaff were involved on the House side, and misrepresentations were made \nabout clearances being made.\n  The fact is this is in the bill. We have to think about what this law \nprovides. This says an agent of the Appropriations Committee could get \nunlimited access to tax returns in this country and have absolutely no \nlegal penalty for releasing it to the public. They could call up the \ntax return of any Member of the U.S. Senate, any individual in this \ncountry, any writer for any newspaper.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't read anything in this provision that either \nchairman can release the information. He makes the assertion that if we \nuse this power, we can release it. There is no such provision.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I beg to differ with the chairman. I am an old tax \nadministrator. I know tax law. This provision says very clearly:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing the \n     disclosure of income tax returns or return information, upon \n     written request of the Chairman of the House or Senate \n     Committee on Appropriations, the Commissioner of the Internal \n     Revenue Service shall hereafter allow agents designated by \n     such chairman access to any Internal Revenue Service \n     facilities and any tax returns or return information \n     contained therein.\n\n  Because it says ``notwithstanding any other provision of law,'' that \nsweeps aside all of the privacy protections that are available in law.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for you. This provision is clear \nin terms of its legal impact.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator says he has respect for this Senator, he \nwill believe me. We didn't ask for that authority. We would not use \nthat authority. We detest this section, and I am tired listening to \npeople say somehow or other we intended to use it. We don't intend to \nuse it. It is going to come out of this bill. It is going to come out \nof this law and it is not going to be used. I don't know how I can be \nany firmer. I am tired of it. We have been working hard on this bill. \nWe did not do this. To imply we did--either Congressman Young or I did \nit--is wrong, wrong.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I did not imply that the Senator did this.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator implied that I will use it; that I would \ndisclose it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator, it is in the law if we pass this bill tonight. \nSenator, I say through the Chair, the point is this: I am not \nquestioning the chairman. I am not. But I am questioning this body \ntonight passing this legislation that has already been passed by the \nHouse, and it becomes the law of the land upon the signature of the \nPresident of the United States. That is wrong.\n  Part of the reason we are here is because we have a process that has \nbroken down. We have a process that has produced a 3,000-page bill that \ngets slapped on our desk and we are told to\n\n[[Page S11731]]\n\nvote on it in a few hours without knowing what is in it. It is wrong. \nIt is wrong.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to finish and then I would be happy to yield \nfor any question of the Senator.\n  Let me say this: For a number of years we have had this process \nongoing. In 1988, President Reagan, in a State of the Union Message, \ntold us never again; don't send me another bill like it because I am \nnot going to sign it. He was right. He said in his 1988 State of the \nUnion that you have sent up here a 1,100-page bill and you had 3 hours \nto review it. You don't know what is in it. Nobody knows what is in it. \nDon't do it again. Don't send me another bill like this because I will \nnot sign it.\n  Here we are tonight. We don't have a 1,200-page bill, or 1,100--we \nhave 3,300 pages. We don't know what is in this bill. There are a \nhandful of people who know what is in this bill. Most of us don't know \nwhat is in this bill. If somebody, some sharp staff had not caught \nthis, we would be making this the law of the land.\n  Now I find out there is no way to prevent this from becoming the law \nof the land if we pass this bill tonight.\n  That, to me, is a mistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to state again the protection for \nthe minority on this bill was in the people who were with my staff when \nit was read through. If there was a mistake in it, it is borne equally \nby your side of the aisle as well as ours. I have accepted the total \nresponsibility as chairman. No question about it; a bad mistake was \nmade. But let me go back.\n  Senator Byrd and I begged for a budget resolution in May, in June, in \nJuly, and when we came back in September. We didn't get a budget \nresolution. The Senator is on the Budget Committee. Why didn't we get a \nbudget resolution? We said if we don't, we will have another one of \nthose nights when we will have a big Omnibus appropriations bill. I \npreached it right here on the floor. I will dig it out, if you want. I \nsaid if you don't, we will have a midnight session again trying to get \na bill through that no one knows what is in it because we have had to \nmove and move these limits.\n  There are provisions in this bill that must become effective or \npeople will lose rights as of Sunday. We are trying our best to get it \ndone. A mistake has been made. I hope the Senate would take my word. It \nis my word. I don't think I have ever broken my word to any Member of \nthis Senate. That was a mistake. It says as chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee I can trigger that and ask for access. I have \nsaid I would never do it. I did not seek it. The chairman of the House \ndid not want it. He is appalled by it. It is a provision that, even if \nit becomes law, cannot be utilized except by Bill Young and me, Ted \nStevens. We have said we will not do it.\n  Isn't that enough? Isn't that enough? Do I have to get down on my \nknees and beg the other side?\n  This bill must become law because people have rights that will be \naffected by it if we don't pass it until we come back in December. That \nis all there is to it. It is not my fault. I hate working under these \npressures. My staff hates it. As a matter of fact, it is a terrible way \nto do business, but I had nothing other than to try to do it.\n\n  As a matter of fact, we had to take one bill and do it in the last 3 \ndays because we could not get agreement between the people involved. It \nhas been a terrible bill to handle.\n  I hope the Senate appreciates the work that people have done this \nlast week to try and get to the point where we could pass it before we \nleft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, with respect to the Budget Committee, I am \non the Budget Committee. I am not the chairman of the Budget Committee. \nOur friends on the other side were in control of the House and the \nSenate. Failure to get a budget resolution was not on our side. Failure \nto get a budget resolution lay on their side.\n  But that is not the point of this discussion tonight. The point of \nthe discussion tonight is we have a process that is broken. There is no \nbetter evidence than the fact that we have a provision that would open \nthe tax returns of every American, every American company, to some \nstaffer in the Appropriations Committee, with absolutely no penalty on \nthat staffer if they were to release the private information contained \nin that individual's tax return. That is wrong.\n  The chairman of the committee says, I never sought this power. I \nbelieve him. He said the chairman of the House never sought the power. \nI believe him.\n  The fact is, the provision is here. Somebody wanted it. Somebody got \nit in here. The fact is, the current chairman of the committee is not \ngoing to be the new chairman of the committee. And the same is true on \nthe House side. These two Senators have said they would not use the \npower. How about the two Members who are going to be the chairmen? They \nwould be able to use the power because if we vote for this bill \ntonight, with this mistake in it, unfortunately, it will become law.\n  I don't want to explain to my constituents back home that every tax \nreturn in America is open to some staffer and there is absolutely no \nlegal penalty for them making it public. That is a serious mistake. \nThere is a desire to take this out. Let's take it out.\n  I ask unanimous consent these provisions be deleted from this bill. I \nam specifically referring to section 222 of the provisions that are \nfound on page 1,112 of the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am a little confused. I am really \nconfused.\n  Senator Conrad, who brought this issue to the Senate's attention, \nsolves the problem by asking unanimous consent to take this offensive \nlanguage out of the bill, this ``Big Brother is watching you and your \ntax returns'' out of the bill, and the passion showed by Senator \nStevens in his previous remarks, I was really taken in by them. I felt \nthat he was really upset and that he wanted to resolve this matter. Yet \nwe have an objection to take this out.\n  If the House went home, bring the House back. They shouldn't have \ngone home with this terrible provision pending.\n  I don't quite understand what just happened. I guess there will be an \nexplanation, but let the record be clear there was objection from the \nRepublican side to take out this offensive language which gives \npermission for the chairman of the Senate and House Appropriations \nCommittee to designate staff to look at any American's tax return, any \nbusiness tax return they decide they want to spy on.\n\n  There was a unanimous consent request to delete that by Senator \nConrad, and there was an objection. I am confused. We could have \nresolved that, and it could have been taken care of, but instead we \nhave an objection. I am sure there is a good reason. Maybe Senator \nStevens will explain it, but deleting the language resolves it on our \nside, and we can get on with the bill.\n  I have a problem with the health issue in this bill that is going to \nadversely affect women of America. I talked to Senator Stevens. He was \nvery honest and said it had to stay in because of the House, but I was \nable to work with Senator Reid and Senator Frist and we got agreement \nand I will not object because we will have a chance to vote up or down \non that offensive legislation sometime before April 30.\n  Senator Conrad made a very wise motion to, essentially, ask unanimous \nconsent to remove the offending language, and we could have resolved \nit.\n  I am confused.\n  I yield the floor so my colleague can have his own time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska and I have, for \nmonths, been importuning the Senate, the leadership, and anyone else \nwho will listen, not to end this session with the passage of an Omnibus \nappropriations bill. I have, for years, opposed passage of Omnibus \nappropriations bills.\n  We have seen within these last few years, especially, this \nexcrescence on the skin of the body politic grow until now it has \nbecome malignant.\n  I warned and warned and warned against Omnibus appropriations bills. \nI have complained that the leadership of the body has not worked \ndiligently to prevent our being caught with our backs against the wall \nat the end of the session and with the absolute necessity at that point \nto act in haste and to act upon many appropriations bills at once, with \nall that portends. That makes it difficult, if not impossible, for \nMembers to examine what is in the bill.\n  So much of this is done at the hour of midnight and beyond. Staffs \nhave to read through these bills and work on them, and Senators who \ncannot do that have to depend upon the work of those staffs. They are \nliterally dead, as it were, with fatigue when they do this job this \nway.\n  I have, time and time again, said to Senator Stevens: I hope we will \navoid Omnibus appropriations bills. There is no good served with \nOmnibus appropriations bills. When that happens, we invite the \nexecutive branch into the exercise. It seems my colleagues, so many of \nthem on both sides of the aisle, do not view that as a danger to the \nSenate, a danger to the constitutional system, and really a danger to \nthe liberties of the people.\n  We should pass 13 appropriations bills every year. I said that time \nand time and time again. The distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee at this moment, Senator Stevens, has done his \nlevel best to get 13 appropriations bills passed and brought to the \nfloor.\n  But I tell you, my friends, we have lost too much time with other \nthings that could have waited, and now we find ourselves in the bind, \nwhen we do not have enough time to do the proper work on these \nappropriations bills. I am sick of this process. I am ashamed of it. I \ndo not know if there will ever be a better example of what can happen, \nwhat can go wrong with this nefarious process of putting off \nlegislation.\n  Appropriations bills are the only bills we actually have to pass. \nThey are bills to keep the Government running. This has to do with the \noversight process, the examination of witnesses through the \nappropriations hearings. This is the absolute best form of oversight, \nwhen we can say to a witness from the administration, whatever \nadministration it is: How have you done under this qualification here, \nthat you would be limited to such and such, a number of dollars? What \nhave you done? What has been the result? We are strangulating this \noversight tool. We are wiping it out when we do not bring to the floor \nthese bills on time.\n  We get to the pass here. This is the pass. And we are cut off at the \npass. Oh, we have to do this. We have to do this. We need to cut the \ntime on the bill. We need to limit ourselves. Here in this case, only \ntwo of these appropriations bills have ever passed the Senate. Only two \nthis year, right?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Four, Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Four passed the Senate. In any event, only two of the nine \nbills that are in the omnibus have passed the Senate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, that is a shame. That is a disgrace upon the \nescutcheon of the Senate. I am greatly concerned about that process. I \nhave been, and I have many times expressed it to my dear friend, Ted \nStevens, who has worked his tail off in trying to get these bills \nthrough the committee and through the Senate.\n\n  Now, we cannot go on like this. We just cannot go on like this. I \nhope other Senators and I hope the leadership on both sides will see \nwhat can happen when we are brought to the wall, with our backs to the \nwall, and we have to ram through such important legislation without \ngiving it careful consideration because we do not have the time and we \nrush these--can you imagine what is happening to the process when we \napprove appropriations bills in the Senate Committee on Appropriations \nand then do not bring those bills to the Senate? We do not bring those \nbills to the Senate.\n  I will tell you, friends, I have been in this body now 46 years this \nyear, and it was never that way in the old times. We always passed the \nappropriations bills. I believe you will find on the record, we passed \nthem, with my help, on both sides of the aisle. I never did anything by \nmyself. It was an absolute cooperation between both sides of the aisle \nin the Appropriations Committee. We did not have all of the \nrecriminations and the fault finding. We worked together, and we \nbrought those 13 bills to the floor, and we acted on them.\n  Something badly wrong is happening to the appropriations process in \nthe Senate, and I hope and plead with my colleagues that we take a good \nlook at what is happening and that we all, as it were, rise up in arms \nagainst this way of pushing everything to the end of the session.\n  We have squandered time. You remember the filibuster one night we had \nhere? Remember the filibuster one night? Well, that is just one example \nof how we have foolishly squandered our time. And we have not been in \nhere 5 days a week working. How about that? We ought to do better.\n  I feel very, very badly about what has happened here. I never knew \nanything about this. I never knew this was in the bill until after I \ngot up in the conference today and urged Senators to vote for it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Neither did I.\n  Mr. BYRD. I said: I don't like this process. I don't like the fact \nthat the minority is being shut out--at least one stage. I do not think \nthe minority should ever be shut out. That is not in the book of the \nlegislative process. That is not in the legislative process as I taught \nit over at American University. That is not in the legislative process \nas I learned it from those who came before me. That is not in the \nlegislative process as it was when I was the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor an additional 10 minutes, if necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and I thank all Senators.\n  And so it is a terrible albatross around the neck of the Senate, and \nit is a terrible disservice to the people of these United States, who \nneed to have their Senators examine bills carefully.\n\n[[Page S11733]]\n\n  Part of it is our fault. We don't have to be out of here on Mondays. \nWe don't have to be out of here on Friday afternoons. They didn't run \nthe Senate like that when I was coming up here. I didn't run the Senate \nlike that when I was majority leader. I told my own crowd: You elected \nme leader, and you can throw me out if you want to, but as long as I am \nleader, I am going to be leader. I am not here for the pleasure of \nMembers. I am here to get the work done. And we worked and we had \nvotes. Any of you who were here when I was majority leader, we had what \nwere called bed check votes on Monday morning at 10 o'clock.\n  So I don't like this process. We are getting paid to work 5 days a \nweek, 6 days a week, or 7 days a week, if it is necessary. I hope we \ndon't start coming in here on the Sabbath and working. We need to keep \nthe Sabbath day holy. But I say to you, my friends, we ought to get \naway from this bog-tailed schedule that we work on here--being in the \nSenate 2 days a week, or 2\\1/2\\ days.\n  So there are many things that can be attributed to the breakdown \nhere. There are many complaints that can be made, many fingers can be \npointed, and many truths can be stated, pointing out where we are \nfalling down.\n  A number of Senators, may I say, have come to the floor to denounce, \nrather harshly, this provision that was included in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, which would authorize--I know Ted Stevens; he \nwould never want this kind of authority. That is laughable. He would \nnever want this kind of authority. I would not either--chairmen of the \nAppropriations Committee and their designees to access the tax returns \nof companies and individuals. Why, this is a slam at the integrity of \nthe Appropriations Committees of the two Houses, and especially it is a \nterrible thing to have somebody put this in a bill and lay this burden \non the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We don't want that. I \nhave been chairman and I would not want that kind of authority.\n  I want to thank Senator Stevens for coming to the floor and pledging \nto do what he can to correct this problem. I recognize that is not his \nfault. It is the inevitable result of a horrendous process that has \ndeveloped in these last few years. You can go back and see the record \nfor yourselves. The record speaks and the record tells the truth.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that I knew nothing of this provision \nuntil after I had made my fine speech in the caucus talking about this \nbill, how good it was and how bad it was, and then urged Senators to \nvote for it, saying that it was better than having a continuing \nresolution. And lo and behold, the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota got up right behind me and he and the Senator from Montana \npointed out that this language was in the bill. I had not seen it. If I \nhad known about it, I would have been the first Senator to the floor to \ndeplore it. I would have done everything in my power to keep it from \nbeing included. It is egregious and it ought to make every Senator \nhopping mad at the process that caused it, at the process that caused \nthis in the wee hours of the night--to have our staffs operate with \nfatigue in going over these matters.\n  Why do we have to do it in the wee hours of the night? Because you \nare up against the gun, up against the deadline.\n  Look at this massive piece of work that must be examined. This is \nwhat happens--I will say it again--when the Congress writes legislation \nbehind closed doors. This is what happens when the Congress tries to \ncobble together nine appropriations bills, seven of which have never \nbeen considered by the Senate, into an Omnibus appropriations bill. \nThis is exactly why we failed the people out there who are watching \nthrough those electronic lenses. We fail the American people when we \ncannot complete the appropriations process on time.\n\n  I think it is a disservice to the chairman of the committee and to \nSenators who try hard to keep things going here and to move on a \nschedule that will get us through and not keep us waiting until the end \nof the session, when it is too late to act with care and to properly \noperate the oversight process. We open ourselves up to these kinds of \nabuses.\n  I am told that the Senate now will do something about this. We have \nalready allowed a unanimous consent request here that has been agreed \nto. I hope--that isn't quite enough--the majority leader, who was here \na moment ago, will try to get a commitment from the Speaker of the \nHouse.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. I am told by my colleague, Senator Stevens, that \nwe have that commitment. Well and good. They will join the Senate in \npassing the joint resolution to remove this provision. I am also \nconcerned about what the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nbrought up when he spoke of the fact that when a bill is passed into \nlaw, it is a law, and it is either going to be repealed or vetoed. We \nneed to hear from the leaders of both bodies that this provision will \nbe removed, and we need also to hear from the leaders of both bodies \nthat this won't happen again.\n  I myself had said that I would vote for this bill. I am going to vote \nagainst it out of protest against this awful process. I have campaigned \nagainst this process on the floor; I have urged that we not let \nourselves get into a situation wherein we have to nail together, tape \ntogether, put together pieces of appropriations bills, and whole \nappropriations bills, and come out with an Omnibus appropriations bill. \nAnd now we are going to be faced with a conference report that we \ncannot amend. So I will vote against this process. I will not support a \nprocess that results in this kind of chicanery. I thank all Senators \nfor listening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Now, \njust 18 days after the election, we see in this bill breathtaking \narrogance of power. It is an abuse of power because it gives power to \nRepublican leaders, at the expense of your right of privacy, to pry and \nsnoop into your tax returns.\n  They can even leak your taxes to the press and post them on the \nInternet without penalty. It is an abuse of power because it gives \ninsurance companies the power to deny your right to know all of your \nhealth care options. It gives insurance companies the power to order \nyour doctor to tell you only part of what you need to do.\n  It is an abuse of power because this bill gives the power to \ncorporations to prevent you from knowing where your food comes from. It \nis an abuse of power because it gives companies the power to deny your \nright to overtime pay.\n  What other abuse of power is in this bill?

Mr. President, we are in the midst of a very important \ndiscussion, of course, as we are considering what to do. As the \nleadership meets to consider what we should do that hopefully will \neither move this process forward or come up with some other resolution, \nI thought I might take a moment to speak about our colleague, Senator \nBreaux, and his retirement.\n  This would probably be a good time to talk about the senior Senator \nfrom Louisiana and to pay tribute to him because he would be one of the \nSenators most certainly who could help us figure out this situation. He \nhas been helping us figure out situations like this for 32 years with a \nlot of success and, I might say, with a lot of respect from all the \nMembers in this body, both on the Republican side and the Democratic \nside.\n  It might be appropriate for me to speak a few moments about the great \ncontribution this man has made to this body.\n  Senator Breaux came to the House when he was 28 years old, and after \nfour children and now three grandchildren, he leaves us after serving \nwell and admirably for 32 years.\n  When he came to Congress 32 years ago at the age of 28, he was the \nyoungest Member of Congress to be serving at that time. He has served \nwith 7 Presidents and 16 Congresses. He served with President Nixon, \nPresident Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, \nPresident Clinton, and now currently with President Bush. He served \nthrough 16 Congresses for 32 years in times of war and peace, through \nrecessions and irrational exuberance. He has served as a husband, as a \nfather, as a grandfather, and he served our State with great grace, \ngreat steadiness, and great leadership through it all.\n  It might not come as a surprise to my colleagues as we consider at \nthis time what we are going to do to look at this picture of John \nBreaux that will give us all a laugh. I do not know whether he was \nplaying Li'l Abner or a farmer, but this is on his Web site and he \ndisplays it proudly. It shows a sense of humor, even as a young man.\n  He has been called brash and good looking and confident, and he still \nis that today. He is not only a storyteller, but a great dealmaker. He \nhas a rollicking sense of humor. He is admirable. He is hard-working, \namiable, smart, a bridge builder, a strategic thinker, and someone who \nhas our deepest respect. He has been, and continues to be, a team \nplayer.\n  I found this picture of John Breaux with his uniform on, which is the \nway he pretty much came to work every day, with his hat on, a baseball \ncap on, his uniform on, maybe just in a suit, but ready to get the work \nof the Senate done and get the work of Congress done.\n  There is probably not a major piece of legislation passed by this \nSenate that did not have John Breaux's assistance. He was the \nteammaker, always ready to bat or pitch or catch or sit on the \nsidelines or referee because he basically did it all.\n  He was also considered a strategic thinker and a great leader for our \ncountry. He, as many of us, gets the opportunity to not only speak on \nthis floor but to be on major television and radio programs speaking \nabout the great issues of the day. And he most certainly has put his \nmark on many pieces of legislation.\n\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, as a member of the Commerce \nCommittee, and as a member of the Fisheries Committee in the House \nduring the time he served there, I can say there is probably not a \nmajor piece of legislation that has not felt the good mark of Senator \nBreaux: always there with a compromise, always there with a suggestion, \nalways there with a little prodding. We and the people of our Nation \ncan be grateful for his wisdom and his input at those critical times.\n  Whether it was the Medicare overhaul, laying the groundwork for a \nstronger Social Security system, or whether it was legislation related \nto agriculture, to sugar or rice, the commodities in Louisiana that are \nso important, John was always there.\n  I want to say a word about a very important bill--and we will show \nJohn playing tennis because this demonstrates that not only is he a \ngreat athlete and team player, but he is a great tennis player. What I \nlike about this picture is he always kept his eye on the ball. Despite \nall of the great work that Senator Breaux did in this Senate on so many \npieces of legislation, helping all States, he always kept his eye on \nthe ball--the State of Louisiana.\n  There are 4.5 million people who live in our State--wealthy people, \npoor people, people who live far out in the woods in the country and \npeople who live in the great urban centers of New Orleans and our \ncapital city of Baton Rouge and our other cities. Not only did he keep \nhis eye on the ball in Louisiana, he kept his heart with us.\n  I can tell you he has left a great mark on our State.\n  There is an act we are proud of that we now call the Breaux Act. It \nis referred to as Wallop-Breaux, but at home we call it the Breaux Act \nbecause John, in his typical quiet, responsible fashion, crafted a very \nspecial tax arrangement that is ongoing--and we will not talk too much \nabout the details, John, on the floor--but there was a very special \narrangement made years ago with members of the Finance Committee that \nhas helped us finance and send money to the State of Louisiana that has \nliterally laid the groundwork to save our coastline.\n  It is not just Louisiana's coastline; it is America's wetlands. Two-\nthirds of the Nation is drained by it. Forty percent of the fisheries \nare in the Gulf of Mexico. The greatest shipping channel in all of \nNorth America comes through that Mississippi Delta.\n  Because John kept his eye on the ball--and although he did all this \ngreat work for the Nation, he always loved Louisiana the most, always \nput his State first--we are now able to build a great environmental \nlegacy to save this coastline. We already lost the size of the State of \nRhode Island, but because of John's work, because of his great \nstrengths and great sense of humor, great respect, and great \nintelligence, he was able to lay that groundwork.\n  Whether it was advocating for senior citizens in our State when they \ndid not have an advocate, or showing up at senior centers early in the \nmorning and late at night, whether it was advocating for children \nthrough education or whether it was advocating for sugar, he did it \nall.\n  Maybe this picture says it the best. On the front page of one of our \nNation's leading magazines, here is Senator Breaux sitting at the table \nholding all the cards and most of the chips, which is the most \nimportant thing about this picture, with the elephant on one side and \nthe donkey on the other, and John Breaux in the middle. At times, we \nneed men and women in the middle. We need people who can listen to both \nsides and try to figure it out.\n  Tonight, that is what we are trying to do on the Senate floor, just \ntrying to figure out this situation. It is a serious situation, and I \ndo not at all mean to be light about it, but figuring it out is what we \ndo as leaders, making our government work.\n  While I do not gamble too much myself, I can most surely appreciate--\nand there are plenty of people in Louisiana who do gamble. So we are \nproud of this picture and proud of John, but deals need to be made on \nprinciple and for the people. The people need the government to always \ngive them a fair deal, a good deal, and a square deal, and that is what \nJohn did.\n  So, John, on behalf of so many people in Louisiana and around the \nNation, let me say that you are going to be missed because you will not \nbe a Member, of course, of the Senate, but we know that we can call \nyou. We know that we can reach you. We know that you will always be \nadvocating for us in Louisiana and for our Nation.\n  Let me also mention what has not been said on the floor and what was \nnot said in my remarks. Besides having his name on many bills, the \nphone conversations and quiet consultations that he held with \nPresidents and with senior Members of this body, his wisdom was found \nand went through those conversations and into legislation that became \npart of the work of this body and the Congress.\n  So, John, for all of your not only legislative work but for your good \ncounsel to us, to Presidents, to leaders of nations, to leaders in \nindustry, we thank\n\n[[Page S11735]]\n\nyou for that and may you look forward to many happy years with Lois. I \nknow that your father Ezra, and I know that your mother, God rest her, \nwould be proud. I know that your father Ezra has watched you all these \nyears and continues to be very proud of you. From Crowley, LA, from a \nyoung man who ran when he was 28 years old on the theme of experience \nmatters, and was brash enough at 28, having never served a moment to \nsay that experience matters, let me say, experience does matter, and we \nare proud to have had a Senator with the kind of experience and legacy \nof my senior Senator from Louisiana, John Breaux.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while we are continuing to try to \nresolve our current situation, I will speak for a moment about \nsomething else today. Today is National Adoption Day. The Senator from \nIdaho and I spoke at some length yesterday in anticipation of today, so \nI will not go into too much detail, but I thought maybe some of my \ncolleagues would be pleased because they worked so hard on this issue. \nIt is an important issue. One out of six Americans has been touched by \nadoption.\n  While we were working in Washington, in our capitals and cities all \nacross America, over 4,000 children were adopted today. That those \nchildren found forever families and parents who have prayed and hoped \nfor either their first child into their family or children added into \ntheir family through adoption was made possible today because our \ncountry honors this day as National Adoption Day.\n  Both President Bush and President Clinton before him were wonderful \nadvocates of promoting a better system of foster care and child care in \nour Nation for the children of America. We believe, as Members of the \nSenate, there is no such thing as unwanted children, just unfound \nfamilies. Many of us do a lot of work in this area in terms of \nlegislation to try to make our system work more effectively and \nefficiently so that all children can have the dream of a family, a \nmother, a father, at least one parent, to raise them, to bring them up.\n  We think that governments do a lot of things well--I, at least, think \ngovernments do a lot of things well--but one thing it does not do well \nis raise children. Families raise children. That is where children \nbelong, in families. When they are separated from their birth parents \nfor one reason or another--and there are many: war, famine, disease, \nand sometimes having to be separated from parents because of gross \nabuse and neglect--our work is to get them reconnected as soon as \npossible to a relative, to a responsible, caring adult, to at least \nsome family in the community right there where they are and, if not, \nsomewhere in the world.\n  I have a heartwarming and also heartrending story about a little boy \nfrom Louisiana. For the sake of time, I will quickly tell the story \nbecause it truly is touching.\n  Eight years ago, a little boy was born at Tulane Hospital. I am not \ngoing to say his name for the record. That was the wonderful news about \nbeing born, but the sad news was he was born with AIDS. He was so sick, \nso fragile and frail that his birth mother basically abandoned him and \nno one stepped forward for him.\n  The nurse that cared for him fell in love with him and basically took \nhim home to her house. She and her husband raised, nurtured, and loved \nthis little boy for many years. She tried through our system to adopt \nthis child for years. I am not exactly sure if I could explain to \nMembers why this never took place when the child was 2 or 3 or 4 except \nfor bureaucracy or that people did not care enough.\n  Here is a little boy, dying of AIDS, wanting parents, a parent \nwanting this child, but the system did not work fast enough.\n\n  The happy part of the story is one judge in my State, Judge Taylor, \nafter this came to his attention, decided to take action, and action he \ntook. He brought all the court, which is unheard of, all the clerks, \nall of the lawyers to the hospital room where this little 8-year-old \nboy was lying in a frail condition, and he brought the prospective \nparents to the hospital room and they conducted the adoption ceremony \nright there in the hospital room. This is the only time I have ever \nheard of this. Maybe it has happened before, but this happened in New \nOrleans, LA, just in the last year.\n  He was so frail that his doctors insisted that the heart monitor be \nkept on the whole time that this was going on. When the judge said the \nwords, this child is now adopted, his heart rate went up to normal for \nthe first time in his life. The child could not speak, but the monitors \nsaid what the child was feeling when he was adopted because his last \nwish was that he would be adopted. Through the Make a Wish Foundation \nthis all happened.\n  So the child was adopted, and his now new parents stood by his \nbedside and hugged and cried. That is the happy part of this story. I \ndo not know what kind of system was not working that would leave this \nlittle boy without these parents so long, but the happy news is he was \nadopted and they became his parents. The sad part of the story is that \nhis little life did not go much further than that, and within basically \na day of that ceremony, he passed on.\n  The great thing that I want to say today about National Adoption Day \nis that this child did not die an orphan. He died as a son. For this \nchild and for the parents who adopted him, it was a wonderful ending.\n  So the work that we do in the Senate, whether it is on finance, tax, \nhealth care, or military, there is not too much work that we can do \nthat is more important than connecting children to families, families \nwho will love them, nurture them, and give them the best opportunity. \nWe cannot promise our children rose gardens. We cannot protect them \nfrom harm or injury or disease, but we can give our children love for \nas long as we have them and, of course, they give us back so much more.\n  In honor of National Adoption Day, I thank all of our great leaders \nin Louisiana that made this wonderful story happen, and I congratulate \nthe judges on our bench in New Orleans, the social workers who were on \nthe positive side of this story, the parents themselves, the medical \nstaff at Tulane University, and my sister Madeleine, who is a wonderful \njudge, who shared this story with me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 18, 2004]\n\n                Agencies Press Effort To Speed Adoptions\n\n                          (By Kristen A. Lee)\n\n       In 1998, Judge Michael Nash, the presiding judge of the \n     juvenile court in Los Angeles, had a disturbing realization: \n     Foster children were languishing too long in the system \n     before their adoptions were completed.\n       So with the support of a team of lawyers working pro bono, \n     Judge Nash opened his court on a Saturday and completed 130 \n     adoptions in one morning. Buoyed by that success, Los Angeles \n     courts have had about 20 more Saturday sessions, handling the \n     adoptions of 7,000 children.\n       Under the leadership of the Alliance for Children's \n     Research, the program initiated by Judge Nash's court has \n     expanded into a national drive. On Saturday, the fifth annual \n     National Adoption Day, child welfare groups and family courts \n     across the country plan nearly 200 events and hope to \n     complete more than 3,000 adoptions.\n       Nationwide, 129,000 foster children are waiting for \n     permanent homes, according to a study released yesterday by \n     the National Adoption Day Coalition, a group of child welfare \n     organizations and private companies. Inadequate communication \n     between state child welfare agencies and the courts, crowded \n     court dockets and heavy caseloads were the most significant \n     obstacles cited to placing children in permanent homes. And \n     states\n\n[[Page S11736]]\n\n     continue to report that finding adoptive parents is a \n     challenge--especially for older children and those with \n     special needs, like behavioral problems or disabilities.\n       But the study also found that state child welfare agencies \n     and juvenile courts were taking innovative steps, as Judge \n     Nash did, to better serve children and families.\n       The number of adoptions in the United States has increased \n     significantly in recent years. In 1998, 37,000 children were \n     adopted. In 2002, the number rose to 53,000.\n       The analysis was conducted by the Urban Institute, a \n     nonpartisan economic and social policy research organization. \n     The data was culled from federally mandated reports.\n       According to the study, the adoption process is complicated \n     by the constant coordination required between child welfare \n     agencies and family courts. Scheduling difficulties can slow \n     the process, as can differences in outlook between agencies \n     and the courts. The overwhelming majority of state agencies \n     reported such differences led to delays in terminating the \n     rights of birth parents.\n       ``The courts may have one perspective and the agencies may \n     have another,'' said Rob Geen, director of the Child Welfare \n     Research Program at the Urban Institute. These disagreements, \n     he added, ``lead to breakdowns and delay the adoption of \n     children.''\n       Senator Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who is co-\n     chairwoman of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption \n     Institute, described the system as ``somewhat broken.'' \n     Federal financing for foster care should be funneled to the \n     states in a more focused way, she said, adding, ``The passion \n     is there, the people's support is there, but the system \n     itself needs a tremendous amount of shoring up.''\n       Many states are already taking steps to address delays in \n     the adoption process by reorganizing staff, scheduling more \n     training and working better with the courts.\n       Judge Nash credits the special Saturday sessions for \n     cutting the number of children under his court's jurisdiction \n     to 28,000, from 54,000 in 1998. ``We have to move faster in \n     taking care of those kids,'' he said.\n       But Mr. Geen said that there can be good reasons for delay. \n     ``The system is set up to address the birth parents' \n     rights,'' Mr. Geen said. ``It's not just finding a car,'' he \n     said of adoption. ``There are reasons why the process should \n     take a considerable amount of time.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are now in a serious \nquandary and a quagmire in some part due to the fact this institution, \nand our counterpart across the Hall, has difficulty in effective \ncollaboration. With that said, I want to talk about what I think is \nreally one of the outstanding examples of what can happen when our \nChamber and our friends in the House of Representatives decide there is \nan issue important enough to collaborate on to do something important \nfor the people of America.\n  We have had, over the last 15 years, a series of the most serious \nfailures of American intelligence in our Nation's history. It didn't \njust start with September 11, 2001, and it didn't end with the \ncircumstances that led to the war in Iraq. Going back over the decade \nof the 1990s we had the World Trade Center attack in New York, we had \nattacks against our embassies in Africa, we had failure to detect that \nIndia and Pakistan had become nuclear powers, we had the loss of the \nUSS Cole in Yemen--all of those, which should have been detected, \npreempted, and the tragedy avoided by the effective professional work \nof our intelligence agencies. We didn't get what we thought we \ndeserved.\n  I wish to particularly commend this evening Senators Collins and \nLieberman as well as Senators Roberts and Rockefeller for the \noutstanding leadership they have given in trying to overcome this \nvulnerability, this unnecessary vulnerability.\n  When I look at a final piece of legislation, I approach it in this \nmanner. First, what were the problems--or maybe, what were the missed \nopportunities that led us to believe it was important that we develop \nthis legislation? And now, at the end of the process, how well does the \nfinal product solve or at least substantially mitigate the problem that \nhad led to our concern in the first place?\n\n  As it relates to the status of our intelligence agencies, we have had \na number of problems that have each contributed, in their own way, to \nthis series of failures. We have had the problem of the difficulty in \nthe intelligence agencies adapting to changing adversaries and the \nchanging global threat environment. The Cold War was the most \nfundamental historic event in the history of the American intelligence. \nOur intelligence agency had been focused for the better part of 45 \nyears on the Soviet Union. We knew their languages. We knew their \ncultures. They were an entity very similar to the United States of \nAmerica. We could almost anticipate what their actions would be.\n  Today, we have a massively asymmetrical adversary. Groups such as al-\nQaida and Hezbollah and Hamas and Islamic Jihad, nations which are not \nnation states or tribes of tribes driven by extreme religious beliefs. \nWe have not adapted to that change, and we have paid a high price for \nthat failure to adapt. I am pleased to say there are provisions in the \nIntelligence Reform Act--and I hope we will soon take it up--which will \nbegin to alter that situation.\n  We are establishing a strong Director of National Intelligence, or \nDNI, who will be able to provide overall leadership and direction. He \nor she will not be responsible for the management of a line agency, as \nis the case today, where the Director of Central Intelligence is also \nthe Director of the CIA. But, rather, he will be able to focus on those \nissues that will affect the entire community of intelligence and will \nhave the responsibility to assure that we are sensitive and responsive \nto new developments.\n  I believe one of the areas in which we will face the greatest \nchallenge in this responsiveness will be in our domestic intelligence. \nThe FBI has been one of the agencies finding it most difficult to \nrespond to a new environment. There has been a pattern of continuing to \nfollow the culture of law enforcement when we need a new culture of \nintelligence to best protect our domestic vulnerabilities.\n  I am pleased at some of the progress Director Mueller has made. I \nbelieve we should continue to explore other alternatives to see if they \nwill better protect our domestic security. I am pleased that under this \nlegislation, the FBI, while not a unit of the Department of National \nIntelligence, will be still under the direct control of the FBI but \nwill be considered part of the intelligence community family. I hope at \nan early date there will be an analysis of what should be our mission \nstatement for domestic intelligence and then what changes in the FBI or \nfurther organizational changes will be required in order to fulfill \nthat mission.\n  A second major problem has been the failure of the intelligence \ncommunity to provide the big picture, strategic intelligence. Our \nformer colleague, Pat Moynihan, used to regularly complain that, while \nwe knew a great deal about the telephone system inside the Kremlin, \nnobody had observed the fact that the Soviet Union was near collapse. \nWe have had similar failures to see the big picture, in terms of the \nfailure to recognize the presence of terrorist cells within the United \nStates, cells which were supported by terrorist entities or those \nsupported by foreign governments. In the runup to the war in Iraq was \nanother massive failure to give appropriate strategic intelligence. It \nis hoped the strong Director of National Intelligence will now have an \nopportunity to focus on these strategic issues. It is also hoped, as \nthis legislation gives a heightened priority to source information--\nthat is information that is available through public documents, \nnewspapers, and other means--that it will receive a new importance in \nterms of arriving at overall intelligence conclusions.\n  There also has been a serious failure in human intelligence. We have \nmany people in the intelligence agencies who understand the culture and \nthe language of Russia. We are grossly inadequate in terms of people \nwho understand the culture and language of the Middle East and central \nAsia. This legislation supplements legislation that\n\n[[Page S11737]]\n\nwe have already passed in the Defense authorization bill which would \nestablish a framework for what I would refer to as a ROTC, Reserve \nOfficers Training Corps, except in this case not for the military but, \nrather, for intelligence purposes.\n  We have a sound foundation upon which to base the reform of our \nintelligence agencies. The problem we face tonight is that sound \nfoundation which probably would pass this body by a vote of almost that \nwhich passed a few weeks ago, which was 96 to 2, and by a substantial \nmajority in the House of Representatives, is being held up by a few \nMembers of the House who wish to see the status quo retained or have \nother goals which are unrelated to the reform of the intelligence \ncommunity that they have been unable to secure incorporation in this \nfinal conference report.\n  It would be a very sad conclusion of this session of Congress if one \nof the most pressing issues facing our Nation and the security of \nAmericans; that is, provision of an intelligence capability that will \nallow us to understand our new adversaries will allow us to preempt the \nactivities of those adversaries and will put us in a position to do \nwhat President Bush stated was our goal when he said our goal in the \nwar on terror does not end with al-Qaida; it only starts there. It \nextends to all terrorist groups which have global reach. We will find \nthem. We will stop them. We will destroy them.\n  We cannot carry out the Bush doctrine in the war on terror unless we \nhave substantial enhancements in our intelligence community.\n  This is not something that just came upon us a few months ago. There \nis literally a stack higher than my desk of reports that have been \nwritten just since the end of the Cold War pointing out consistently \nthe limitations in making recommendations to enhance our intelligence \ncapability. These were totally ignored until 9/11. Even after 9/11 we \nwere extremely slow to appreciate the urgency of reform of our \nintelligence agencies. We had to go almost to the third anniversary \nafter 9/11 before serious consideration was being given.\n  For us today to announce we again have failed to take action to \nprotect the American people would be a tragic condemnation of this \nsession of Congress, and an unnecessary condemnation. We have an \nexcellent proposal which has been endorsed by the 9/11 Commission, by \nleadership, and by the families of the tragedy of 9/11. For us to walk \naway from this opportunity that we now have to demonstrate that through \nbipartisan and bicameral actions this Congress is able to identify a \nserious national problem, deal with that problem, and enact it into law \nwould be itself yet another tragedy.\n  I hope when we reach the week of December 6 and the House returns \nthat the House will resolve its internal disputes and the President \nwill continue his involvement. I personally urge the President to \nparticularly direct attention to the Pentagon where I think much of the \nenergy for recalcitrance has emanated and that we will, before this \nyear is over, pass an intelligence reform bill which will serve the \ninterests of the American people and will bring honor to the Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He is someone who exemplifies the \nbest qualities of a U.S. Senator. His integrity and wisdom and his \ncareful attention to matters large and small have been superb during \nhis 38 years of public service to the State of Florida. It has been \njust extraordinary. I wish him well and I will miss him. I will miss \nhis leadership and his guidance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11737-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INTELLIGENCE REFORM CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I also join Senator Graham in his remarks \nurging the House to pass the intelligence reform conference report, \nwhich I am told most, if not all, of the members of the Senate \nconferees signed. I salute Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman who \nheroically over the last weeks have attempted to reach an agreement on \nthis important measure.\n  I note that he cochairs the 9/11 Commission with former Governor Kean \nand former Representative Hamilton who have endorsed it strongly, as \nhave the family members.\n  I agree with Senator Graham. It is a tragedy that after that \nCommission report, after we held hearings in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee of the Senate, on which I am proud to serve, during the \nAugust recess, marked up the bill which had overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport, I believe every amendment added to that bill in that \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, it had bipartisan majority support, \npassed here on the Senate floor, I am proud to have supported it--to \nwalk away from it now after the Senate and House conferees agreed to \nthe legislation because of the resistance of a few members in the House \nRepublican caucus who are evidently able to persuade their Members and \nleadership not to proceed with it is a tragic loss for the people of \nAmerica. It is a terrible failure on the part of the House to live up \nto its agreement. To go through that lengthy process and not have the \nfinal measure approved tonight is a tragedy for our country and for our \nsecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11737-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11737-S11739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I also wish to comment briefly on the Omnibus \nappropriations measure which is before us and to express my concern \nabout one omission which has severe consequences for my home State of \nMinnesota, which is the elimination of the Senate's action to prevent \nMinnesota and other States from having their title I education funding \ncut last year and this year.\n  In 2004, Minnesota was 1 of 12 States to suffer a reduction in title \nI funding. Minnesota schools received $12.3 million less in fiscal year \n2004 than we did in 2003. We lost that $12.3 million in funding, even \nthough our number of title I-eligible students increased by over 3,600. \nFor this fiscal year 2005, Minnesota is only one of two States in the \nNation to lose title I money, even though the number of our title I-\neligible students will increase again.\n  In this conference report, Minnesota will receive $15.3 million less \nthan we did 2 years ago for title I education with probably 10,000 more \npoor students.\n  The Senate bill corrected the worst of that injustice. It said that \nno State would lose title I funding if their number of poor students \nincreased. It didn't give those States any more money, even though that \nis what we should get--more title I money to serve more title I-\neligible students. It only protected us from getting less funding. Now \neven that protection has been removed.\n  Presumably, the House conferees would not agree to it. They have all \nof their porkbarrel projects in the bill, all of their unnecessary \nspending, and even their shameful attempt, as has been discussed here \ntonight, to allow their leaders to examine the tax returns of law-\nabiding Americans. All that garbage is in the bill, but the funding for \npoor students in Minnesota was taken out of the legislation.\n  Our schools in Minnesota are already hard hit by other funding cuts. \nNow they must provide their services to more students with less money.\n  So much for compassionate conservatism, so much for No Child Left \nBehind. Those slogans ought to be prosecuted for consumer fraud. They \ndon't tell the truth. Even worse, they are betrayals of our Nation's \nchildren, of our neediest children.\n  Once again, this legislative process has impoverished the truly needy \nwhile it enriches the truly greedy.\n  Poor schoolchildren don't have full-time lobbyists to prowl the Halls \nof Congress and serve their interests. Poor schoolchildren can't make \nbig campaign contributions to big people who even make bigger \ncontributions to their special projects. Poor schoolchildren have to \ndepend upon us and on the House.\n  The Senate stood up for poor schoolchildren in Minnesota this year. \nThe House Republicans let them down in the $388 billion spending bill, \na foot and\n\n[[Page S11738]]\n\na half of paper. In all that money, the House Republicans cut our \nfunding by $25 million for the poorest kids in Minnesota. And then they \nwent home.\n\n  They should come back on Monday and remove the tax inspection \natrocity from this bill. And when they do, they should also correct the \nterrible injustice they served upon the children of Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I first thank my friend from \nMinnesota for his very kind remarks and for the tenacity with which he \noversees, supports, and advocates for the education of the children of \nhis State. I admire his priorities.\n  I wish I could say the same thing about another action taken today in \nthe House of Representatives. We have a neighbor with which we have had \nlong historic and cultural ties. The case could be made that there \nwould not be a United States of America today but for the aid of this \nneighbor. And that neighbor is the country of Haiti. Haiti is the \npoorest country in the Western Hemisphere, one of the poorest countries \nin the world. It is a country with a gigantic illiteracy problem, a \ngigantic health problem, a gigantic unemployment problem. We have \ndemonstrated the fact that actions in Haiti have an effect on our \nnational interests by having invaded Haiti repeatedly during the 20th \nand now into the 21st century.\n  Our typical invasion has been to deal with whatever was defined as \nthe immediate problem, stay there for a brief period of time, and then \nleave. Soon all the problems that caused our previous involvement \nrecurred.\n  We invaded Haiti yet again earlier this year. I am concerned we may \nwell have to repeat that if we do not take action to deal with two \nfundamental problems. One is security, the second is jobs.\n  In terms of security, we left Haiti in June of this year with the \nunderstanding that the United Nations would provide significant \nsecurity forces. Approximately 6,000 were committed from a variety of \nnations in the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere. As of the middle of \nlast month, less than half of those 6,000 commitments had been \nfulfilled. That contributes substantially to violence, to threatening \nthe stability and continuation of the government. It has encouraged the \nsame kind of forces that used to man the Tonton Macoutes and the \nmilitary services of the Duvaliers to seek a hope that they might \nresurrect themselves.\n  Second is that the economy of Haiti has continued, as unbelievable as \nit is, to slide further into wretched poverty.\n  There was legislation introduced by my good friend, Senator DeWine of \nOhio--I was pleased to cosponsor it--which would have given to Haiti \nsome of the benefits which this Congress has recently provided to the \npoorest nations of Sub-Saharan Africa, to allow Haiti to have some hope \nof building an economy that allows some 75,000 to 100,000 Haitians to \nget a job, generating a sufficient income to support their families. \nThat legislation passed this Chamber unanimously. It had the total \nsupport of the Senate. That legislation went to the House of \nRepresentatives. Senator DeWine and I and others testified before the \nWays and Means Committee as to the urgency of action, both the \nhumanitarian aspects of this legislation, but, also, frankly, the self-\ninterests of the United States of America in avoiding another collapse \nof that neighboring country.\n\n  I have been joined now by Senator DeWine. Senator DeWine has given an \nenormous amount of compassionate, aggressive leadership to this issue, \nand we had every expectation that we were on a track to get this \nlegislation adopted in the House of Representatives until our first \ndisappointment occurred when the leadership of the Ways and Means \nCommittee decided to abandon the legislation that had already passed \nunanimously in the Senate and adopt a competing but much diluted bill \nfor their effort to provide some assistance to Haiti.\n  I cannot speak for Senator DeWine, but I speak for myself, that I was \ndisappointed the extent of the legislation that the Senate had passed \nlooked as if it was unlikely to be enacted, but at least there would be \nsomething that the U.S. Congress would have done for the people of \nHaiti and again for our own self-interest. Unfortunately, we have heard \nin the last 36 hours that it looks as if even that thin response will \nnot be brought before the House of Representatives during this session \nof Congress.\n  I am extremely disappointed at what that says about our real values \nin terms of feeling a kindredship with our neighbors within this \nhemisphere. I am also disappointed at what that says about the Chambers \nof the U.S. Congress. My hope burns eternal, and now that it appears as \nif there is a reasonable expectation that we will return the week of \nDecember 6 to take final action possibly on the omnibus monstrosity \nthat stands before the Senate, and hopefully also on the subject of my \nprevious remarks, intelligence reform, I hope we would also place on \nthe agenda at that last hour an opportunity for Members of Congress to \nshow they were not cold-hearted and without concern for fellow human \nbeings, and that this effort, as minimal as it is, would be a symbol of \nour concern and, hopefully, a platform from which more effective and \nextensive U.S. action could be taken.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I wonder if my colleague will yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I yield.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Would my colleague agree--my colleague certainly is an \nexpert on Haiti, having traveled there many times--the situation in \nHaiti is certainly not getting any better today; with this trade \nlegislation we have talked about, both the House version of the bill \nand the Senate version of the bill would appreciably help the situation \nfor the people of Haiti as well as help our foreign policy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Absolutely. In fact, in addition to all the \nsystemic problems I cited, in the last few months Haiti has been hit \nwith two dramatic climate-based tragedies. Earlier in the year on the \neast side of the country there were massive floods that resulted in the \ndeaths of over 1,000. Then during this hurricane season on the western \npart of Haiti, there were similar floods that cost in excess of 1,000 \nlives.\n  I would refer my colleagues to a program that appeared just last \nnight on the ``NewsHour'' about the circumstances in Gonaives, the \nthird largest city in Haiti, which was the epicenter of that hurricane \nthat hit just a few weeks ago. And yet today the circumstances are, if \nanything, worse than they were the day after the hurricane passed.\n  So I say to the Senator, yes, anything that we could do that would \nhelp and would show our willingness to help would be very well received \nin Haiti.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I wonder if my colleague from Florida would yield for \nanother question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Yes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. My colleague has studied this issue, I know, extensively. \nI wonder if he would agree that the proposed bill from the Senate, as \nwell as the proposed bill the House was considering, while both would \nhave a significant impact on the people of Haiti in the future as far \nas actual job creation, it would have, really, minimal impact, if any \nimpact, on the United States as far as jobs. In fact, would he agree \nalso that some of the experts we have consulted believe these two bills \nwould actually help create jobs in the United States?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I say to the Senator, of all the exports that \ncome in to Haiti, the vast majority come from the United States of \nAmerica, including most of their food. Therefore, if the purchasing \npower of the Haitian people is even minimally increased, it will make a \ngood neighbor and a good consumer of U.S. goods even more capable of \ndoing so.\n  So I agree with the Senator's economic assessment that the modest \namount of aid that we are giving, not in the form of aid but rather aid\n\n[[Page S11739]]\n\nthrough trade, will redound to our economic benefit as well as to our \nsense of national comity with our neighbors in the hemisphere.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague who has been such a \nleader on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BURNS).

Mr. President, I expect that before long we will have \nthe opportunity to get into the discussion of the omnibus proposal that \nhas been referred to earlier this evening. I want to just bring some \nmatters in the omnibus bill to the attention of our colleagues in the \nSenate and also to those in our country who are interested in where we \nare going to end up in the education provisions of this budget, and to \nalso speak briefly about where we will be on the questions of health \ncare as well.\n  In this omnibus proposal, as we said--it has been mentioned here--it \nis really a question of priorities and choices. What we are going to \nsee is real cuts in the Head Start Program. It is a program that is a \nlifeline for millions of our children to help prepare them to enter \ngrades K-12.\n  We have strengthened the quality of Head Start Programs in recent \nyears, but we are going to see a real cut in the Head Start Programs \nunder this budget. It is not even going to keep up to the current \nservices. What we are going to see is a real loss to thousands and \nthousands of children across this country.\n  The most important programs we have in terms of educational \nachievement and accomplishment are the afterschool programs that make \nsuch a difference to children who may be falling behind, to help assist \nthem to keep up with their classmates, and to also give them the help \nand assistance that makes a very important difference in terms of their \nown achievement and accomplishment.\n  This program is vastly oversubscribed. It is one of the most \noversubscribed programs that we have in our educational arsenal. The \nreason it is oversubscribed is because it has had such success in \nhelping and assisting needy children in our country. That program is \ngoing to be further cut under this proposal.\n  One of the key aspects of the No Child Left Behind was a recognition \nthat what we needed in our schools across the country were smaller \nclass sizes, well-trained teachers, curriculum reform, parental \ninvolvement, and afterschool programs. But one of the things we needed \nwas going to be well-trained teachers. We made a commitment in the No \nChild Left Behind Program that we were going to enhance the teacher \nquality for the high schools in our country. That program is going to \nbe cut in terms of teacher quality in upgrading the skills of teachers \nin our high schools.\n  Our vocational educational programs, which are so important in \npermitting young people to acquire skills to be able to compete in an \nincreasingly complex economy, those programs for vocational education \nare going to be cut.\n  As well, some 28 percent of the technology educational funding for \nprograms that are in our schools to help our young people develop the \ninsight into the new kinds of technologies which are so important for \nthem to be able to succeed in their own education and to carry on their \neducation will be cut.\n  Finally, the Pell grant remains at $4,050 for the fourth consecutive \nyear, while we have seen public college tuition has gone up more than \n35 percent over the last 4 years. This is going to mean that tens of \nthousands--hundreds of thousands--of young students, who have the \nability to be able to go on to college, will be denied that opportunity \nbecause the Pell grant is falling further and further behind.\n\n  If we are talking about an education budget, this is not the \neducation budget.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. President, I want to make a brief comment, as well, on the health \ncare crisis that we are facing. I think all of us understand the \nexplosion of health care costs, the increasing number of the uninsured \nthat exists in our society.\n  We know we passed a Medicare bill for prescription drugs that was \nmore help and assistance to the pharmaceutical industry and the HMOs \nthan it was to our senior citizens.\n  But it has been against that background, if we look at where we are \nin terms of the health care budget in this proposal, we have cut a \nquarter of a billion dollars in real terms from NIH.\n  Mr. President, this is the age of the life sciences. This is the age \nof the life sciences, with the human genome project, the increasing \nopportunities we are going to have with stem cell research, other types \nof research. We know the extraordinary progress we made out at NIH. We \nhave the real possibilities of breakthroughs in so many different areas \nof health. If we were to solve the problems of Alzheimer's, we would \nempty two-thirds of the nursing home beds in my own State of \nMassachusetts. We are seeing a reduction in the NIH.\n  We have seen that the support for bioterrorism readiness in our \nNation's hospitals is going to have a significant cut. The recruitment \nfor the National Health Service Corps is cut by a third. That is a \nprogram that serves the underserved communities of this country. And \nthe Office of Minority Health is cut by 10 percent.\n  Mr. President, the list goes on. Those who are strongly committed to \nhaving opportunities in education and also opportunities in the health \ncare field recognize this budget really does not address the needs and \nthe opportunities we have in these areas. I will have an opportunity to \nget into greater detail at another time about these underfunded \nprograms on this particular proposal.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know the last several hours have been \ndifficult hours. A lot of people have been wondering exactly what is \ngoing on with the Omnibus bill, which people expect to vote on later \ntonight, which we will be voting on shortly. We will lay out the \nunanimous consent request in a few moments.\n  The language we have been talking about over the last 2, 2\\1/2\\ \nhours--I will refer to it as the Istook language--everybody agrees \nshould not be in the underlying Omnibus bill. It was brought to \npeople's attention when staff had looked at it late this afternoon, and \neverybody agrees it should not be in there.\n  The challenge we have had, from a procedural standpoint, is that the \nHouse has passed the Omnibus bill with that in it. Now we are to \naddress it, and both Members of the House, including the Speaker, whom \nI have talked to directly, and our colleagues say it should not be \nthere.\n  Procedurally, how do we accomplish that? Once we pass this bill, it \nwould become the law of the land. It should not be there, but it would \nbe there for a period of time. The potential for abuse would exist.\n  Mutually, we have agreed the only way to eliminate that is to send a \ncorrecting enrollment resolution back to the House of Representatives. \nThe problem is they are not there. What we will do shortly--it will be \nin the UC--is we will pass that resolution, send it to the House. The \nHouse will receive that most likely on Wednesday. We also tonight will \npass a continuing resolution, which we will comment on shortly, to \nallow business to continue tonight; and we will address the Omnibus and \nwill vote on the Omnibus bill tonight and hopefully pass that bill. \nThat bill will be sent to the desk, and it will be held there until the \nHouse acts, which will likely be Wednesday. At that point, and not \nuntil that point, this bill will actually be sent to the House or \nactually become law. Thus, there will be no window where this clause, \nthis Istook language, will be law. It will not pass until it has been \ncorrected in the bill, taken out of the underlying Omnibus bill.\n\n[[Page S11740]]\n\n  Procedurally, it means we will pass the continuing resolution \ntonight. We will have to do a modification of the adjournment \nresolution, but we will have one rollcall vote on the Omnibus. There \nwill be a period of time of 30 minutes for debate prior to voting on \nthat bill, and there will be a rollcall vote tonight. That is the first \nexplanation.\n  I will turn to the Democratic leader to make it a little simpler than \nthat and to comment on what we have agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the majority leader has described \nthe situation accurately, and I believe it is the best way in which to \nresolve what has been a very understandable concern on the part of so \nmany Members on both sides of the aisle. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota for first flagging this question and the \nissue and calling it to our attention, and all of those who have \noffered ways in which we might resolve the problem tonight.\n\n  The solution has four parts. First, we will pass the continuing \nresolution that will accommodate the time that will be required for us \nto resolve this matter.\n  The second will be that we will pass the conference report and, as \nthe majority leader has noted, we will hold it at the desk.\n  The third is that we will pass a resolution that will allow the \ncorrection in the conference report, an enrolling resolution. That will \nbe part of this process.\n  Fourth is that the House will take up the matter on Wednesday. We \nwill hold it at the desk until that matter has been resolved, and then \nsend it to the President once this work has been completed.\n  This is, by far, the safest and easiest and, in some ways, the most \nconfident way in which to address this question. I think, having \naddressed it in these four parts, we can all be satisfied that we will \nhave accomplished what we set out to do, which is fix the error and \npass the legislation.\n  Many on our side may want to express themselves after we vote on it. \nPeople have expressed concern about other parts of the bill and, \nthroughout the day, our colleagues have expressed themselves on the \nconference report in ways outside of this particular problem. But I \nthink, procedurally, this is the right way to approach the matter.\n  I think, ultimately, it accommodates the concerns people have had on \nboth sides of the aisle. I hope we can reach agreement tonight to allow \nthis process to go forward.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What if the House doesn't act on it? What assurance do \nwe have? Does the majority leader have assurance that the House will \nact on Wednesday?\n  Mr. FRIST. We expect them to act. They said they will act. This bill \nwill be held at the desk. If they don't act, this bill will not be sent \nover. That is part of the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So it is the understanding of the majority leader that \nthey will act on Wednesday. After that takes place, the ordinary \nprocedure will be followed in terms of the enrollment and sending it to \nthe President?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am relieved at what has been worked out \nhere, because this will prevent this provision from ever becoming law. \nThis provision never should become law. It would open up the \npossibility and potential for abuse. I want to repeat for the record \nthat I have no doubt Senator Stevens would never have used this \nprovision for an untoward purpose. I feel the same way about Chairman \nYoung. The problem was this would have become the law of the land. \nThere will be future chairmen of the Appropriations Committee. I think \nwe all know enough about human nature that if there is potential for \nabuse, abuse is likely to occur. This is a place where we could have \nhad very serious abuse, with the opening up of people's tax records and \nthe use of those records to punish people, or to help people, or to do \nother nefarious things that should never be permitted in this country. \nSo I am relieved this will not ever become law.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the Democratic leader suggested, we \nrealize a number of people want to make further comments. The unanimous \nconsent request we will propound shortly will allow for 30 minutes of \ndebate. Other people have expressed an interest, after the vote, in \nbeing able to offer their views, which we encourage. That way, we can \ngo ahead with our unanimous consent request after 30 minutes for \ndebate, to be equally divided, and proceed with a rollcall vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11740-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are now in day 51 of the fiscal year. In \norder to finally bring the fiscal year 2005 appropriations season to a \nclose, the Senate has before it a $388 billion, nine bill, 3,016-page \nmonstrosity of a bill. Here it is, right here on the desk. Take a look \nat it.\n\n[[Page S11741]]\n\n  Of the nine appropriations bills in the bill, only two were ever \ndebated in the Senate. The conference report includes a miscellaneous \ndivision that contains 32 unrelated provisions, most of which have \nnever been considered by the Senate.\n  There is not a single Member in this body who can say that he or she \nhas read this bill. It contains complex and controversial matters. It \ncontains an across-the-board cut of eight-tenths of 1 percent that \narbitrarily reduces veterans medical care programs, health care \nprograms, highway construction, and global AIDS programs.\n  At midnight last night, a 64-page small business reauthorization bill \nwas put in the bill without consultation. It contains controversial \nmatter that was not in the freestanding bill that the Senate debated \nover a year ago.\n  During the development of the appropriations bills this year, the \nHouse and Senate reviewed the President's budget carefully and, in some \ncases, approved provisions that moved the Nation in a different \ndirection from that which the White House wanted. The White House \nissued veto threats on several of these issues.\n  The Senate provision to block the administration's overtime \nregulation which could eliminate overtime pay for 6 million Americans \nis dropped from the bill.\n  Provisions that were in both the House and Senate bills concerning \nCuba trade are all gone.\n  The Senate provisions to overturn the Mexico City family planning \npolicy and modify the Kemp-Kasten rules for funding the U.N. Population \nFund have disappeared.\n  At midnight last night, at White House insistence, and through the \nintervention of the House Republican leadership, the language that \nwould have required a fair competition before Federal jobs are \ncontracted out was pulled from the bill.\n  Yet here we are on a Saturday, 51 days into the fiscal year, forced \nto vote on this monstrosity in the form of a $388 billion unamendable, \nunread conference report.\n  The bill is entitled ``Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005.'' It \nshould be entitled ``Lame Appropriations Act, 2005.''\n  The Federal fiscal year started on October 1. While we have been \nwaiting for the Republican leadership to bring appropriations bills to \nthe floor, the country's schools, the country's hospitals, the veterans \nseeking health care, the FBI agents fighting terrorism, the \nconstruction workers wanting to build bridges and highways, the \nfarmers, and the scientists across America have had to wait.\n  Why the delay? First, despite the fact that we have a Republican \nPresident, a Republican House, and a Republican Senate, our Republican \nGovernment could not produce a budget. We had a record deficit for \nfiscal year 2004 of $413 billion. This Bush deficit exceeded the \ndeficit record that he set for fiscal year 2003 of $375 billion.\n  Yesterday the President signed a bill to increase the debt limit to a \nrecord $8.2 trillion--$8.2 trillion of debt, and yet we do not have a \nbudget. Without a budget, the appropriations process was delayed. We \nare living in a land of make-believe.\n  For months, the Senate pushed aside work on appropriations bills to \nfocus on political debates. We pushed aside the people's interest so \nparty interests could take center stage before the elections, but in \ndoing so we failed, once again, to get our job done. This is a lameduck \nCongress, but the lame politicking in this Senate started long before \nthis week.\n  Time after time, we have put a hold on the investments in this Nation \nthat every Senator knows we must make in order to put points on a \npolitical scoreboard, like this is some big game. But when we play \ngames like these, the real losers are the American people.\n  Fifty-one days into the fiscal year and, once again--this is not the \nfirst time--once again, we have a mammoth, unamendable omnibus \nconference report in front of us. Sadly, it has become almost an annual \nritual that we shackle ourselves with these omnibus monstrosities. It \nis not good--not good for the Senate, not good for the American people, \nnot good for your political system. We did in 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, \n2001, 2003, and 2004.\n  When I was chairman from 1989 to 1994 and again in 2001, we produced \n13 individual bills annually.\n  That is the way to protect Congress's power of the purse. That is the \nway to protect the American people. That is the way to respect Members' \nrights to debate important legislation. We should not go down this road \nagain next year. The woolly mammoth became extinct ages ago. I hope one \nday that the same will be said for such mammoth appropriations bills.\n  The fact that we have such massive legislation on our desks tonight \nis not the fault of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the \nsenior Senator from Alaska, Ted Stevens. He would have moved Earth and \nsky if it had meant finishing 13 individual appropriations bills on \ntime. But not even his Herculean efforts could change the plain and \nhonest truth of this Senate. Namely, when it comes to this Senate \ntoday, politics wins every time.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank my chairman, my colleague, my \nfriend, Senator Ted Stevens. This will be the final appropriations \nconference report that Senator Ted Stevens will guide through this \nChamber, and how we will miss that fine, steady hand at the helm. While \nhe does not leave the Appropriations Committee, thank God, he does \nleave the chairmanship after this session.\n  I thank him for his unflinching friendship over the years. We do not \nalways agree, Senator Stevens and I. No. I respect his views. I hope he \nrespects mine. And the same can be said of the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the appropriations subcommittees, both when this side is \nunder control of the Senate and when this side is in the minority. At \nthe end of the day, we always know that party is not the most important \naspect of life. Faith in God, love of family, the Constitution and the \ncountry, Senator Stevens knows, as I do, that these are far more \nimportant than the fate of a partisan agenda.\n  Because of the limitations placed on the Congress by the \nadministration, more veterans will go without medical care. I have to \nsay that this administration meddles in the appropriations process more \nthan any other administration I have ever seen in my 46 years as a \nSenator, and as my 52 years as a Member of the Congress.\n  Fewer children now will receive the educational services promised by \nthis President and this Congress in the No Child Left Behind Act. \nScientists will be left scrambling for research dollars. Families \nliving in rural America will see their clean water pushed off for \nanother year. This bill shortchanges America's future, and I say to all \nSenators that because of the President's arbitrary limits on \ndiscretionary spending, $8 billion worth of increases above the \nPresident's budget request that were contained in the bipartisan Senate \nappropriations bill were eliminated.\n  Now, that is the White House meddling, a White House that does not \nseem to recognize that there is a Constitution of the United States; a \nWhite House that does not seem to recognize that there is a separation \nof powers; a White House that does not seem to remember that the \nlegislative branch is not indeed subordinated to the executive branch. \nRelative to the Senate bills, title I education for the disadvantaged \nis cut by $661 million; special education by $658 million; the National \nInstitutes of Health by $537 million; EPA clean and safe drinking water \ngrants are cut by $312 million; VA medical care by $235 million; $975 \nmillion in cuts in public housing; $277 million is cut from the \nNational Science Foundation and the effort to help communities to hire \nnew police officers; the COPS program is cut by $154 million.\n\n  These are big numbers. Honestly, they probably do not mean much to \npeople, but behind each dollar is an American citizen. Cuts to special \neducation mean that fewer children with disabilities will receive the \nspecialized services they need. Cuts to title I mean that young people \nliving in poor school districts will have fewer classroom opportunities \nto brighten their paths to their future. Fewer dollars for COPS means \nfewer officers on the streets, the very time when crime is up and the \nterrorist threat is very real across America.\n  That brings us to where we are today. The legislation before us \nincludes some increase above the President's request for such programs \nas veterans medical\n\n[[Page S11742]]\n\ncare, highways, low-income home energy assistance, State and local law \nenforcement, the manufacturing extension program, Amtrak and Corps of \nEngineers construction. However, I cannot vote for this Omnibus \nappropriations bill, and I extend my sincere apologies to my colleague, \nTed Stevens. I honor him and I will always remember him as one of the \nvery finest chairmen of the Appropriations Committees under whom I have \nserved in my 46 years in this body, but I cannot vote for this Omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  I intended this morning to vote for it. Omnibus bills bring the White \nHouse to the table and put them in charge. I have said that time and \ntime again. Let me say it again. Omnibus bills bring the White House to \nthe table and put them, the White House, in charge. Omnibus bills allow \nthe White House to set arbitrary ceilings on spending. Omnibus bills \npreclude Members' rights to debate significant issues. Omnibus bills \nproduce bad legislation, such as the ill-conceived language on giving \nstaff authority to review tax returns.\n  Need I say more? No, I shall not say more. I will vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his comments. He has been my good friend for a long time. He and I \nhave worked together now through my 36 years in the Senate, and as he \nstates, we have not always agreed, but we have always been able to work \ntogether in the spirit of friendship and real understanding. I really \nhave great admiration for the Senator from West Virginia.\n  This is my swan song. I had expected to stand before the Senate and \nbe proud of the product we have before us. I consider what happened in \nterms of the staff mistake a stain upon my service as the chairman.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 4818, the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill \nwas the legislative vehicle for the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  The conference report includes $388.4 billion in discretionary \nfunding for the following nine appropriations bills: Agriculture, \nCommerce-Justice-State, Foreign Operations, Interior, Energy and Water, \nLabor-HHS, Legislative Branch, Transportation-Treasury, and VA-HUD.\n  Our fiscal year 2005 spending will be within the $821.9 billion \ndiscretionary cap.\n  The conference report includes an across-the-board cut of 0.8 percent \nfor each appropriations bills.\n  This bill will provide the needed funds to keep this Government going \nfor this fiscal year.\n  As my chairmanship of our Appropriations Committee draws to a close, \nI want to take a few minutes to acknowledge and commend some close \nfriends and some of the hardest-working and most dedicated staff I have \nhad the privilege to work with.\n  Let me begin with my good friend from West Virginia, our committee's \nranking member, Senator Byrd, who has been a member of the committee \nsince 1958. He and I have worked together throughout my 36 years in the \nSenate and it has been an honor to lead this committee with him since \n1997. We have not always agreed, but we have always been able to put \nour differences aside and work toward the common good. I especially \nwant to thank him for his efforts over the past year. We both had hoped \nand worked toward getting our appropriations bills across the floor on \nan individual basis. But, this was not possible. And, I want my good \nfriend to know how much I personally appreciate his and his staff's \ncooperation in recent days as we've brought this process to a close. I \nwill miss the partnership we have shared on this committee.\n  Chairman Bill Young of Florida has been my partner across the Rotunda \nsince 1999. He has become a good friend and ally in our steadfast \nefforts to complete our work. He, too, is stepping down from his \nchairmanship and I want to take this opportunity to thank him and his \nstaff for their assistance and perseverance in getting our work \ncompleted. Bill has great respect for the institution that we serve and \nfor his beloved House Appropriations Committee. His heart continues to \nbe with the men and women of our Armed Forces. After the House \nrecesses, he and his wife Beverly regularly visit wounded soldiers up \nat Walter Reed Medical Center. I hope Bill Young will be returning as \nchairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We will continue \nto work as a team dealing with modernization of our weapons systems, \nour military personnel programs, and the national security of this \ngreat country.\n\n  Over the years, I have had opportunity to work with Dave Obey as both \nchairman and ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee. \nCongressman Obey and I have been on opposite sides of a number of \nissues, but I know of few Members who have his great intellect and \npassion. Dave Obey is a truly dedicated Member of Congress who cares \nabout the institution, and the legislative process. He is a realist who \ngives his all in debate, but understands compromise and the need to \nmove the business of Government forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a chart printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           FY 2005 Conference\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]                     BA\nAgriculture......................................................16,982\nCommerce, Justice, State.........................................40,027\nEnergy and Water Development.....................................28,488\nForeign Operations...............................................19,705\nInterior.........................................................20,039\nLabor, HHS, Education...........................................143,309\nLegislative Branch................................................3,575\nTransportation, Treasury.........................................25,846\nVA, HUD, Independent Agencies....................................93,861\nWeatherization (division J).........................................230\nOther items (division J)............................................107\nAcross-the-board 0.8 cut (division J)............................-3,471\nCrime Victims Fund (limitation)....................................-283\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n    Total discretionary spending................................388,415\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \nRequested emergencies:\n  LIHEAP                                                            300\n  Postal equipment                                                    7\n  Sudan                                                              93\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now, I would like to turn to the clerks of our \nsubcommittees.\n  Pat Raymond has worked for me for more than three decades in the \nSenate and will be retiring at the end of the year. Pat began as my \nscheduler on my personal staff. She has supported me on the \nGovernmental Affairs, Rules, and Appropriations Committees.\n  From flextime, to postal reform, to the Federal retirement system, \nand as staff director on this Agriculture Subcommittee, and earlier on \nthe Treasury Subcommittee, Pat has never lagged in her dedication to \nhard work. Always thorough and precise, always a stickler for details, \nPat's also well-known as a quick study.\n  Even more important than the attributes I have mentioned, has been \nPat's loyalty to me personally, to this institution, and to our Nation. \nAs an Alaskan, she understands the true ``can do'' pioneer spirit that \nhas made it possible for her to accomplish even the toughest of \nchallenges.\n  The Energy and Water Appropriations bill, in particular, was put \ntogether in record time. The product represents a truly remarkable \naccomplishment. It is comprehensive, yet elegant in its simplicity. It \nsets out an ambitious course for the Corps of Engineers, Department of \nEnergy, and Related Agencies. With few words, it cuts through years of \nred tape. After reading the bill, the phrase ``the Secretary shall'' \nhas become one of my favorite phrases in the English language.\n  Tammy Cameron, our majority staff director, Drew Willison, our \nminority staff director, and their able staff worked on a bipartisan \nbasis and negotiate a bill with the House in 48 hours. They pulled a \nrabbit out of a hat I thought was long dead. Tammy just took on this \nnew assignment 2 years ago having worked with Senator Campbell on the \nTreasury Subcommittee. She has learned a complex subject matter in a \nvery short time, and has earned the respect of the highest ranking \ngenerals in the Army. On behalf of Senator Byrd and the entire full \ncommittee, I want to congratulate Tammy and the entire staff and extend \nmy heartfelt thanks. And, I hope when these proceedings are concluded, \nthey will all go home to bed and sleep for a week.\n  Scott Gudes is one of those staffers who has become a member of my \nfamily. He keeps moving back into the\n\n[[Page S11743]]\n\nhouse. Scott began with me on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \nworking with Sean O'Keefe, where he learned with a real master. And he \nhas used what he learned with Sean ever since.\n  He served for almost 5 years as deputy under secretary for Oceans and \nAtmosphere at NOAA, and worked as the acting NOA administrator under \nsecretary in 2001. 1 worked closely with him to resolve the Stellar sea \nlion crisis which threatened to close down Alaska's fisheries, and \nalmost closed down the Senate. As many of my colleagues will recall, \nwhile others were drinking eggnog, Congress remained in session until \ndays before Christmas while we resolved that crisis. Scott was \ninstrumental in that effort, and helped administer the resolution we \nadopted.\n  He formerly worked for Fritz Hollings on the Commerce-Justice-State \nSubcommittee as well as on the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee. \nHe has a reputation as a fair, even-minded problem solver, and has a \nheart for the world's oceans. As NOAA administrator, he had a \nreputation for rolling up his sleeves and working as crew on research \nvessels, and he has rolled up his sleeves for us.\n  The senior Senator from Pennsylvania often refers to Bettilou Taylor \nas the 101st, and for good reason. She has helped me craft new \ninitiatives in Alaska to address health care, labor, and education. \nJust yesterday, I got a report on the Denali Commission clinic effort, \na program Bettilou created. To give an example of the difference just \none person can make, since she instituted this program, there are now \n41 new health care clinics in remote villages in Alaska that had none, \nand another 67 in the planning stage and another 26 under construction. \nBecause of Bettilou and her staff, thousands of rural Alaskans now have \nhealth care where they had none before.\n  She is hard driving, but fair; creative but down to earth; demanding \nyet caring. She knows health policy and education probably better than \nany single person in the Senate including her subcommittee chairman, \nand she can run circles around her adversaries. The word ``can't'' is \nnot in her vocabulary. I once described one of her bills as a ``work of \nart.'' She is truly one of the Mona Lisa's of the Senate.\n  Mary Dietrich began with me on the Labor/HHS Subcommittee. She has \nworked now for several years as the clerk on the DC Subcommittee, and I \nthink it is no small coincidence that the District's finances turned \naround about the same time Mary showed up. She has worked closely with \nthe City government in helping them shepherd the city toward financial \nsolvency, and has taken a particular interest in programs for children \nand the arts. At the staff level, she almost single handedly pushed \nthrough the DC voucher program that no one else thought had a chance of \nsucceeding. But she persevered, and today hundreds of poor children are \nattending some of the cities best private schools. They will never know \nwho Mary Dietrich is and will never be able to thank her, but today I \nsay thank you on their behalf and on behalf of the Senate.\n  While Bono has led the public effort to address the worldwide crisis \nof AIDS/HIV, there is another rock star behind the scenes who has \nshaped our Nation's response to that crisis. Paul Grove has drafted \ndozens of provisions to improve the lives of people around the world--\nfrom people living with AIDS and TB to children without limbs who \nreceive wheelchairs. Together we have created a new program to bring \nfresh water to dozens of African villages which has changed thousands \nof lives each day.\n  Paul is a child of the Foreign Service and has lived across the \nglobe, including 2 years with the International Republican Institute in \nCambodia. Paul is quietly competent, but his actions speak loudly about \nthe kind of person Paul is and the difference he has made in the world.\n  Rebecca Davies is a woman who has found her moment in history. Tough \nand uniquely qualified, Rebecca Davies has undertaken the task of \nhelping create a whole new department of the government with the most \nimportant role of our time, protecting our Nation from terrorism. She \nformerly served as Deputy of the Appropriations Committee with service \non the Budget Committee. I can probably count on one finger the number \nof people who have the knowledge of the Federal budget process that \nRebecca Davies carries in her head.\n  She has worked on the Treasury Subcommittee, Agriculture Subcommittee \nand each time left her mark. Together we created a series of programs \nfor rural America while she was at Agriculture from rural water and \nsewer programs to funding to reduce the high cost of energy to funds to \naddress public facilities in poor rural communities. As a result of her \nefforts, the honey bucket, what used to be the primary sewer system in \nAlaska, will soon be the subject of a museum exhibit.\n  I rest better each night knowing that Rebecca Davies is looking out \nfor our Nation's homeland.\n  Bruce Evans began his career on the Alaska scene with my former \ncolleague, Slade Gorton. A product of the Senate, Bruce is known by all \nas a practical problem solver with a great wit and a ``can do'' \nattitude. Of all the subcommittees I have worked with, I have probably \nthrown as much at Bruce Evans as any staffer on my committee. From \ntimber harvest to oil and gas development, if I am working on a \ncontroversial issue, you can bet Bruce Evans is finding the solution.\n  With Bruce's insight and quiet competence, together we have improved \nthe lives of Alaska Natives from health clinics to alcohol treatment to \nfire fighting to save villages from destruction. And while I don't have \na public reputation as an environmentalist, Bruce has worked quietly on \nmy behalf to protect Alaska's wildlife. He created the State wildlife \ngrant program funded this year at about $70 million, provided resources \nfor research on wildlife from walrus to polar bears, provided the funds \nto take the Aleutian Canada goose off the endangered list, and restored \nAlaska's fisheries. Denali National Park is often called the crown \njewel of the national park system. Bruce Evans is one of the crown \njewels of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Carrie Apostolou began her career with me on the VA-HUD Subcommittee. \nIntensely organized and detail oriented, ``slipping through the \ncracks'' is something you never have to worry about with Carrie. She \nhas shepherded the Capitol Visitor Center through the process, and is \nresponsible for the unprecedented security improvements we all see \neveryday. When the Capitol Visitor Center opens in 2006, it will be a \ntestament to Carrie's persistence.\n  Dennis Ward, came to our committee 2 years ago with a strong and wide \nranging military background. He served in the Air Force as an officer \nfor 18 years, taught political science at the U.S. Air Force Academy, \nand was a political affairs officer at the Ballistic Missile Defense \nOrganization. He is diligent and tenacious and his abilities were \nevident to all of us when he worked fervently to complete action on the \nMilitary Construction Appropriations bill earlier this year. I look \nforward to a continued close working relationship with Dennis, as I \ncontinue my work on defense issues.\n\n  Jon Kamarck is one of the leading public housing experts in the \nCongress. He is known as a tough adversary, but kind and compassionate. \nHe has exercised the committee's oversight responsibilities with vigor, \nand many an agency has trembled in its boots when Jon finds \nindifference or incompetence. He has a reputation for demanding \ncompliance with the laws he helps write, because he is as passionate \nabout good Government as he is about helping people. There is a kinder, \ngentler side of Jon Kamarck agencies don't always see but I have seen \nas he meets with Eskimo people with no running water or works with low \nincome people living in squalor. If ever there was a staffer who \nembodied my personal motto it is Jon Kamarck: ``to hell with the \npolitics, just do what's right.''\n  And last of all, but first among equals is Sid Ashworth. Sid knows \nmore about the Department of Defense than just about any one I know. \nShe is responsible for the largest annual budget of any department, and \nhas overseen revolutionary changes in our national defense from smart \nbombs to stealth bombers. She has the daily burden of reading \nintelligence reports, living every day with the knowledge of the \nthreats that plague us. A former Defense civilian from Hawaii, Sid has\n\n[[Page S11744]]\n\nforged a close working relationship with Charlie Houy that mirrors my \nown relationship with Dan Inouye. Sid is a woman who operates in what \nis sometimes viewed by some as a man's world. She has broken through \nstereotyped, and is universally revered by secretaries and generals \nalike. She is innately fair, intensely dedicated, and fiercely loyal. I \nam glad I have her by my side every day.\n  I also want to acknowledge a few of the hardworking staff from the \nother side of the aisle. Terry Sauvain, Senator Byrd's staff director \non our committee, has worked tirelessly along side of my staff to get \nour work done for the year. Terry has long been known as someone who is \nable to effectively work on both sides of the aisle. He is known as the \nmaster of West Virginia and my staff has learned a great deal from him \nsince I became chairman in 1997.\n  Chuck Keiffer, Senator Byrd's minority staff director, also deserves \nmy thanks. He came to the Appropriations Committee 4 years ago from the \nOffice of Management and Budget and has vast experience on the fiscal \nissues. I want to acknowledge him and thank him for his assistance and \nservice during my tenure as chairman.\n  And finally, I want to thank Charlie Houy, the minority clerk for the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee. Charlie has been with the \nAppropriations Committee for nearly 20 years, working for both the \nminority and majority. He is a consummate expert on defense issues and \nis well respected by those at the Department of Defense and his \ncolleagues on the Hill. As chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, I look \nforward to continuing to work with Charlie and thank him for all of the \nhard work he has put in over the past year. I am proud to say he is my \nfriend.\n  Mr. President, we deal with a lot of important and controversial \nissues in this body. Maybe nowhere is that more the case than on this \nSenate Appropriations Committee.\n  I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to chair this \ncommittee with so much history and tradition. Senator Byrd has often \nreminded us of the historical context of this committee and our role \nwhich was specified by our Founding Fathers in the Constitution. And, I \nwould be remiss if I did not note that I and all our members have been \nfortunate to have been supported by such outstanding professional \nstaff.\n  I remember when Senator John C. Stennis was preparing to leave the \nSenate in 1988. And he attributed his long and distinguished career to \njust a few things. The first, was good staff.\n  So, I want to take a minute to recognize one such individual, our \ncommittee staff director, Jim Morhard. Jim is a consummate \nprofessional. He has truly done it all here on appropriations. He \njoined the committee after a career in the Navy Comptroller's office, \nand then in the Senate under Senators Wilson and Kasten. Jim staffed \nthe military construction bill as both the minority and majority staff \ndirector. Jim worked on Defense Subcommittee and with some reluctance, \nanswered my request for him to take over the Commerce-Justice-State \nSubcommittee. This is considered by many the most difficult of our 13 \nsubcommittees to handle.\n  At Commerce-Justice-State, Jim Morhard distinguished himself working \nas ``clerk'' or staff director under Senator Judd Gregg. Jim dealt with \na variety of issues from Securities and Exchange Commission fees to \nNOAA fisheries programs to small business technical assistance. Long \nbefore September 11, 2001, Senator Gregg and Jim sought to wake up the \nJustice Department and FBI and enhance our counterterrorism programs. \nOn September 11, many of those first responders had taken part in \ntraining in counterterrorism exercises that were put forward by our \nCommerce-Justice-State Subcommittee.\n  In early 2003, I asked Jim to move up and become staff director for \nthe entire committee. There was no staff that I considered more capable \nor prepared. Jim has always carried out his tasks with tact, fairness \nand bipartisan spirit. He has great expertise at the technical aspects \nof the appropriations job. He can make ``the numbers work'' and draft \nthe bill and report language. And, he has the creativity to critically \nanalyze programs and policies and come up with compromises that move \nthe institution forward.\n  I think about the same day Jim came on board, we began work on the \nfirst of two Iraq/Afghanistan supplementals. I think he has been \nworking tirelessly ever since, shepherding through these bills and \nhelping me get the 2004 and this 2005 omnibus appropriations bills \nthrough the Senate, through conference and to the President for \nsignature.\n  The executive branch has countless programs to recognize employees \nand excellence. Unfortunately, we here in the legislative banch do not. \nBut, one should not assume that we do not recognize personal and \nprofessional excellence when we see it. And, I want to express my \nappreciation to Jim on behalf of the committee and the entire Senate \nfor a job well done.\n\n\n     the bering sea nonpollock groundfish fisheries buyback program\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as part of the fiscal year 2005 \nConsolidated Appropriations conference report there is a section that \nprovides for a vessel buyback program for the Bering Sea/Aleutian \nIslands nonpollock groundfish fisheries. Senator Murray, is it your \nintention that section 219 of Title II of the 2005 Consolidated \nAppropriations conference report is only to provide for a non-pollock \ngroundfish fishery capacity reduction program for catcher processor \nvessels engaged in these fisheries in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct. Section 219 is intended to provide a \nvessel buyback program to be financed through a capacity reduction loan \nfor this fishery.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding that the North Pacific Fishery \nManagement Council will develop the fishery management plans for the \nBering Sea/Aleutian Islands non-pollock groundfish fisheries and \nnothing in this section should be construed to impede or change the \ncouncil's development of these plans. Is this your understanding?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes. This section should not be interpreted as requiring \nthe North Pacific Fishery Management Council to rationalize these \nfisheries. In fact, nothing in this section should interfere with the \ncouncil process with respect to development of fishery management plans \nfor this fishery or any ongoing work of the council on fishery \nmanagement plans or ``rationalization'' of other fisheries.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Murray, there is language in this section that \nstates that future amendments to the fishery management plans in the \nBering Sea/Aleutian Islands should not ``penalize'' members of any \ncatcher processor subsector for achieving capacity reduction under this \nact or any other provision of law. Could you explain in greater detail \nwhat this means? In particular, I want to make sure that nothing in \nthis act would preclude the North Pacific Fishery Management Council \nfrom accommodating CDQ interests in future Bering Sea and Aleutian \nIslands non-pollock fishery management plans.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes. This language does not prevent the North Pacific \nFishery Management Council, National Marine Fisheries Service, or any \nother agency from enforcing any Federal law with respect to any member \nof this sector, including the conservation and management provisions of \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act. The act shall not prevent the council from \nraising the CDQ share of the harvest for this fishery consistent with \npast Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands rationalization efforts or as part \nof any eventual rationalization process. And finally, this reference to \npenalties should never be construed to prevent the council from \nimplementing initiatives to reduce bycatch in this sector, which has \nhistorically had the highest bycatch rates in the Bering Sea/Aleutian \nIslands.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, over the last several hours, much debate \nhas taken place regarding section 222 of division H of this omnibus \nappropriations bill. I wish to associate myself with the remarks of \nmany of my colleagues that have insisted that this egregious provision \nbe removed. And, I wish to thank the majority leader and minority \nleader for establishing a path forward that will ensure that this \nprovision will never become law.\n  Under the agreement announced earlier by the majority leader, the \nentire\n\n[[Page S11745]]\n\nconference report on the omnibus appropriations bill, once passed by \nthe Senate, will be held at the desk and will not be forwarded to the \nPresident for his signature until the House has passed a correcting \nresolution that will nullify section 222. That correcting resolution \nwill also be passed by the Senate today.\n  With that guarantee in place, and with the knowledge that section 222 \nof division H of the omnibus bill will never become law, I am pleased \nto vote in favor of the bill so that the people of my State and all \nother States can reap the benefits of the important programs funded in \nthis bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, unfortunately, in the Omnibus bill, the \nRepublican leadership blocked Senator Harkin's amendment to repeal the \nadministration's rule that denies overtime protections to 6 million \nworkers. Bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate strongly \nsupported the Harkin amendment and it was part of our Senate bill.\n  In fact, the Senate has voted four times to block the Bush overtime \nrule, and the House has voted twice to block it. Yet, the Republican \nleadership keeps refusing to accept the will of Congress and the will \nof the American people. Instead, it continues its unfair assault on \nAmerica's workers and their right to overtime pay.\n  In today's economy, workers are obviously concerned about losing \ntheir jobs, their pay, their health benefits, their retirement \nbenefits, and their unemployment checks. Now more than 6 million \nemployees also have to worry about losing their higher pay for working \novertime.\n  These men and women are nurses. They are police officers. They are \nschool teachers. They are long-term care workers. They are assistants \nin mental health facilities.\n  Make no mistake, overtime cuts are pay cuts. When workers lose their \novertime pay protection, they still work longer hours, but they get no \nextra pay for doing so, even though they have had the right to time-\nand- a-half pay for overtime work ever since the 1930s.\n  Clearly, we need a policy to create more jobs, not eliminate jobs. By \ntaking away workers' right to overtime, the administration's rule \nundermines job creation, since it allows businesses to require \nemployees to work longer hours for no extra pay, rather than hire new \nworkers.\n  Pure and simple, denying overtime is a thinly veiled cut in workers' \npay and boost employers' profits. In this troubled economy, it makes no \nsense to ask any workers anywhere in America to give up their overtime \npay.\n  Instead of making hard-working men and women work longer hours for \nless pay, businesses should create new jobs by hiring more employees to \ndo the work.\n  We know that employees across America are already struggling hard to \nbalance their family needs and their work responsibilities. Requiring \nthem to work longer hours for less pay will impose an even greater \nburden in this daily struggle.\n  According to the Families and Work Institute, two of the most \nimportant things that children would most like to change about their \nparents are that they wish their parents were less stressed out by \ntheir work, and they wish they could spend more time with their \nparents.\n  The General Accountability Office says that employees without \novertime protection are twice as likely to work overtime as employees \ncovered by the protection. In other words, businesses don't hesitate to \ndemand longer hours, as long as they don't have to pay higher wages for \nthe work.\n  Protecting the 40-hour workweek is vital to protecting the work-\nfamily balance for millions of Americans in communities in all parts of \nthe Nation. The last thing Congress should be doing is to allow the new \nantiovertime rule to make the balance worse for workers than it already \nis.\n  Congress cannot look the other way while more and more Americans lose \ntheir jobs, their livelihoods, their homes, and their dignity. Denying \novertime pay rubs salt in the wounds of this troubled economy. Denying \nthe will of Congress and the American people in this Omnibus bill \ndoesn't settle the issue. This battle is far from over. The fight will \ncontinue until workers' overtime rights are restored.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose this omnibus appropriations \nbill. It has become something of an annual event to consider these \nmassive, must-pass measures. Because this particular bill has come to \nus in the form of a conference report, we are unable to even offer an \namendment to the legislation. Those who crafted this measure are, of \ncourse, fully aware that this bill is completely shielded, and as a \nresult they were free to include numerous provisions that would \ncertainly have generated amendments were they to come to the body in an \namendable vehicle.\n  There are many questionable provisions, all of them safe from the \nscrutiny that the amendment process affords. There will be a few \neditorials written lamenting some of these provisions, but that will be \nit. Absent some extraordinary action by Congress, they will become law \nalong with the rest of this measure.\n  Others will detail the billions of dollars of unauthorized, earmarked \nspending included in this bill. Let me just note that these \nquestionable provisions come at a very real cost. First and foremost, \nby approving these provisions, Congress shirks its duty as stewards of \nthe taxpayers' money. We have an obligation to our constituents to \nensure that the money we levy in taxes is spent wisely.\n  Beyond that, by providing funding for these unauthorized, earmarked \nprograms, we are diverting funds from areas that our constituents have \ntold us are true priorities. I am deeply concerned, for example, about \nthe level of funding provided for the National Institutes of Health, \nNIH. Providing an increase of less than 3 percent is not sufficient to \nmaintain the current pace of biomedical research.\n  I am pleased to have supported successful recent efforts to double \nthe NIH budget, and abruptly slowing the growth of the NIH will \nundermine the progress that has been made through this doubling. It is \nimportant that we provide NIH with the funding it needs to ensure that \nwe receive the extraordinary health and economic benefits that this \nvital biomedical research provides.\n  At a time when our country is facing increases in the number of \npeople diagnosed with serious, costly diseases such as cancer, \nAlzheimer's disease, heart disease and diabetes, as well as an ever-\npresent bioterrorism threat, biomedical research needs to be a national \npriority, and as such it needs to be adequately funded.\n  Devoting billions of dollars to unauthorized special interest \nearmarks also means less funding for our children. Again this year, \nCongress and the administration have underfunded elementary and \nsecondary education programs. As schools around our country settle in \nto their third year under the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, we will \npass an appropriations measure that does not give states and districts \nthe funding that we promised them in exchange for higher accountability \nstandards. The law requires that States and districts comply with NCLB \nas a condition of receiving funding, yet we are not providing them the \npromised resources that will help them to succeed. And I am concerned \nthat the NCLB accountability structure will sanction schools that fail \nto meet adequate yearly progress despite the fact that Congress is not \nproviding these important resources.\n\n  In addition, just 1 day after the Senate and the House passed the \nconference report reauthorizing the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, we will pass an omnibus spending bill that underfunds \nthe fiscal year 2005 authorization level contained in that very \nconference report.\n  Again we are failing to provide the full 40 percent of special \neducation costs promised to the States when IDEA was enacted in 1975, \nand, ironically, we are doing it 1 day after telling States that the \nIDEA conference report puts them on the path to full funding in 6 \nyears. The IDEA reauthorization conference report authorized $12.3 \nbillion for fiscal year 2005, and the omnibus spending bill before us \ncontains $11.5 billion for this purpose. Thus, before the ink on the \nIDEA conference report is even dry, we are already breaking a promise \ncontained in it to the tune of more than $800 million.\n  I regret that the Senate missed an opportunity earlier this year to \nmake\n\n[[Page S11746]]\n\nspecial education spending mandatory, and I regret that the well-\nintentioned authorization levels in the IDEA conference report are \nbecoming little more than an empty promise 24 hours after the Senate \nand the House agreed to these funding levels.\n  As bad as what is in this omnibus appropriations bill is what is not \nin it. The administration was again successful in blocking language \nincluded in the both the House bill and the committee-passed bill in \nthe Senate that would have reversed the harmful provisions of the \nDepartment of Labor's new overtime rule. Despite repeated bipartisan \nopposition to this rule in both houses of Congress, the small group of \nMembers who drafted the omnibus conference report stripped out these \nprovisions, which would have prevented millions of workers from losing \ntheir overtime benefits under the Bush Administration's rule. I am \ndisturbed that--for the second year in a row--an omnibus appropriations \nconference report was used as a vehicle to override the will of a \nmajority of Members of both houses with respect to this harmful rule.\n  And, I am disappointed that the conferees chose to delete language \nthat would have halted the administration's campaign to contract out \nadditional Federal jobs to the private sector. Federal employees should \nhave the right to compete for their jobs on a level playing field.\n  In addition, I continue to oppose the Administration's efforts to \nreclassify thousands of jobs that are critical to our national security \nas not ``inherently governmental'' in nature in order make these jobs \neligible to be contracted out.\n  I also want to especially note that because this omnibus \nappropriations bill comes to us in an unamendable form, there will not \nbe a rollcall vote on the automatic, back door Member pay raise. As my \ncolleagues know, that issue is germane to the Treasury-Transportation \nAppropriations bill and thus an amendment forcing a vote on the Member \npay raise can be offered to that bill without being subject to a point \nof order. But, because the Treasury-Transportation bill has been folded \ninto this omnibus package, no one will be able to offer an amendment to \nforce a vote on what will be a roughly $4,000 pay raise that is \nscheduled to go into effect in January.\n  This is not the first time the Member pay raise has been shielded in \nthis manner. In one instance, the Treasury-Postal bill was slipped into \nthe conference report on the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, \nand thus completely shielded from amendment. And during 2002, the \nSenate did not consider the Treasury-Postal bill at all.\n  This makes getting a vote on the annual congressional pay raise a \nhaphazard affair at best. And it should not be that way. No one should \nhave to force a debate and public vote on the pay raise. On the \ncontrary, Congress should have to act if it decides to award itself a \nhike in pay. This process of pay raises without accountability must \nend. I have introduced legislation to do just that, but until that \nlegislation is enacted, Senate leadership should not shield the \nTreasury-Transportation appropriations bill from amendments.\n  Finally, let me join others in expressing my concern about inclusion \nof a provision in this bill that could reduce access to the full \nspectrum of reproductive health services. This provision is far too \ncontroversial to be shoved into a must-pass Government spending bill, \nespecially when the committee with jurisdiction did not have a chance \nto consider it and the Senate did not have a chance to debate it.\n  Mr. President, the appropriations process needs reform. I have been \npleased to join the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici in advocating \nbiennial budgeting, and certainly we need to seriously consider that \nreform. I have also joined with my good friend, the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, in advocating a change to Senate rules that would \npermit points of order to be raised against many of these extraneous, \nunauthorized earmarks, and this body should seriously consider that \nreform as well.\n  The Senate needs to act on those reforms and others before we \nconsider another one of these giant, must-pass omnibus appropriations \nbills.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I want to concur with \nthe statement issued earlier by Chairman Grassley of the Senate Finance \nCommittee regarding section 222 of this bill.\n  I don't understand the reasoning or motivation behind this provision. \nBut it is clear that it could be easily abused.\n  This is a great example of how the process is inadequate in terms of \npassing legislation without legitimate input from the Members of this \nbody.\n  The thought of an individual Member of a legislative body, including \nthis one, having access to tax records of individual Americans is \nunacceptable and must be changed; but equally importantly the process \nneeds to be changed.\n  I am not attributing bad motives, but this must be changed and I take \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee at his word that it will \nbe changed.\n  We need to change this process to ensure mistakes like this are not \nmade in the future.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly express my \nconcern with section 205(d) of the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Act. This subsection addresses endangered species issues \nin the Middle Rio Grande in New Mexico.\n  These issues, particularly in the midst of an ongoing drought, have \nbeen very controversial in my home State. Over the last year or 2, \nhowever, there has been a commitment by the diverse stakeholders and \ninterest groups in the Middle Rio Grande region to cooperate on \ncreative approaches that would address endangered species needs. These \napproaches all have the goal of balancing the need for environmental \nrestoration with a recognition of the need to protect the interests of \nwater users who are dependent on the limited supply provided by the Rio \nGrande.\n  One thing that has helped to foster this cooperative approach is to \nfully and completely discuss the different issues facing the \nstakeholders. This process has included legislation. Last year, the New \nMexico delegation collaborated on a legislative provision that was a \nresponse to a controversial court decision affecting water use in the \nMiddle Rio Grande. While this effort was not without some controversy, \nthe end product was the result of much discussion and debate, and \nseemed to be accepted, even embraced, by most of the stakeholders.\n  Section 205(d) of the Energy and Water bill, while somewhat innocuous \non its face, undermines the practice of full disclosure and debate. The \nprovision provides the biological opinion controlling water operations \nin the Middle Rio Grande, with full protection from legal challenge for \na period of 10-years--the effective timeframe of the opinion. In last \nyear's appropriation bill, we provided a maximum of 2 years of \nprotection, which was the most controversial aspect of the provision.\n  I am concerned that this provision, that will most certainly be \nenacted into law without any notice or significant comment, may disrupt \nthe cooperative environment that has developed over the last few years. \nIf so, it would be a most unfortunate turn of events. The biological \nopinion, at least up until now, appears to be effective in allowing \nwater use in the Middle Rio Grande to continue without jeopardizing the \nexistence of the endangered species in the region. That is a positive \nstep. Moreover, given the progress being made and the cooperative \nmethods being employed, section 205(d)'s 8-year extension of a \ncontroversial provision, is an unnecessary distraction at this point in \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I want to address a troubling provision \nin the Criminal-Justice-State, CJS, Appropriations bill, contained in \nthe omnibus, that applies to any nonprofit legal services organization \nreceiving funding from the Legal Services Commission, (LSC). This \n``private money restriction'' precludes these nonprofits from using any \nof their private funds--including individual donations, foundation \ngrants, and State and local government funds--for any non-LSC-qualified \nservices.\n  The private money restriction places an unfair and costly burden on \nprivate and other non-Federal funds dedicated to helping families in \nneed. As a result of the private money restriction, most\n\n[[Page S11747]]\n\ncivil legal services providers are forced to stop providing non-LSC-\nqualified services altogether. Many of the most vulnerable individuals \nand families--such as certain legal immigrants, including some battered \nwomen and children, mothers in prison trying to maintain visitation and \ncustody of their children, and elderly homeowners seeking to file class \nactions to protect themselves from predatory lenders--find themselves \nwithout access to legal services at all.\n  LSC has attempted a ``fix'' for this problem by allowing \norganizations to use their own private funds for non-LSC-qualified \nservices only if they create physically separate nonprofits with \nseparate staff, offices and equipment. Wasting scarce private resources \non duplicate staff and offices adds significant costs and results in \nfewer families being served.\n       Congress can provide a real ``fix'' for this problem by \n     amending the CJS Appropriations bill to treat the privately \n     funded activities of legal aid nonprofits equally with the \n     privately funded activities of other nonprofits. In \n     particular, we can require LSC grantees to abide by the same \n     longstanding rules promulgated by the Office of Management \n     and Budget for nonprofit grantees of Federal agencies and by \n     the IRS for all nonprofit 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) organizations, \n     as well as new rules promulgated by the Bush administration \n     for faith-based groups. These rules authorize nonprofits \n     receiving Federal funds to engage in various privately funded \n     activities without requiring them to maintain physically \n     separate entities with separate staff and equipment.\n       Under this alternative approach, the restrictions on \n     Federal LSC funds would still apply, whether one agrees with \n     them or not, but they would allow local providers and donors \n     to use private money to serve their communities as they see \n     fit. I hope that in future discussions about the CJS \n     Appropriations bill, we can consider this alternative \n     approach to the problems that this bill will create for \n     America's families and service providers.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that Section 219 of \nTitle 2 of this Act includes the statutory language necessary to \nauthorize and implement a Non-Pollock Groundfish Fishing Capacity \nReduction Program for the catcher processor sector of the Bering Sea \nand Aleutian Islands SAI This program represents a positive step \nforward for the Puget Sound-based commercial fishing industry. Passage \nof this Act concludes more than a year-long effort to craft an \nappropriate capacity reduction program for the catcher processor sector \nof the BSAI non-pollock groundfish fisheries.\n  Reducing capacity in these fisheries will improve the ability of the \nNorth Pacific Fishery Management Council to manage the groundfish stock \nand contribute to the long term economic viability of the many \nbusinesses and people involved in the harvesting, processing and \ndelivery of the highest quality seafood products to consumers. This is \nimportant not just to the fishermen who take such great risks up in the \nfrigid waters of the North Pacific, but to the myriad of small \nbusinesses throughout the Puget Sound region that support this \nindustry: ship repair yards, equipment suppliers, insurance brokers, \ntransportation companies, and marketers.\n  My predecessor, Warren Magnuson, set out 24 years ago to put in place \na system to Americanize and manage our nation fishery resources. His \nhard work and vision, championed also by a young Senator from Alaska, \nTed Stevens, led to the innovative regional council structure we know \ntoday. I am proud that the North Pacific Council has managed the \nfisheries in its jurisdiction so successfully that it is singled out in \nthis country as a model for maintaining sustainable fisheries.\n  Despite the success of the North Pacific Council in maintaining \nhealthy fish stocks, there have been problems in the region as a result \nof overcapacity in the fishing fleets. The North Pacific Council has \naddressed many issues to help prevent overcapitalization, including \nlicense programs and limited entry requirements, but once there are too \nmany fishing vessels it becomes a very challenging problem. These are \nsituations where development of fisheries has outpaced the ability of \nthe resource to support, either biologically or economically, the \nfleets of fishing vessels built to harvest this national resource. \nThere is a Federal nexus here, when overcapitalization is the result of \nFederal programs or Federal management decisions. Congress has a record \nof stepping in when needed to assist in resolving these problems, and \nthis Act follows the American Fisheries Act, the West Coast Groundfish \nBuyback, and the Crab Buyback in the North Pacific.\n  I disagree with those who say that this is a problem caused by the \nfishermen alone, and that they should bear the brunt of any economic \nconsequences of an overcapitalized fishery. Yes, they do have \nresponsibilities, and this bill makes them part of the solution. It is \nthe remaining fishermen who will be responsible for repaying the loans \nused to reduce capacity in the fleets. That is an investment from them \nto preserve their future in these fisheries, and it will contribute to \nthe broader economic stability of the Puget Sound region.\n  I must add that fisheries legislation is never easy to draft. It is a \nvery technical subject overlaid with the very lively history of \nparticipants in the fisheries. As Maggie noted on the eve of passage of \nthe original fisheries management act:\n\n       We cannot satisfy everybody. I know fishermen pretty well. \n     They are pretty hard to get to agree on a lot of things. They \n     are independent people.\n\n  This sentiment remains very much true today. We have worked hard to \naccommodate a variety of perspectives in this bill, and I am satisfied \nthat the results are positive.\n  The Non-Pollock Groundfish Fishing Capacity Reduction Program for the \ncatcher processor sector of the BSAI authorized in this Act is a \nlegitimate use of Federal resources to restore balance in these \nfisheries and to promote their long term viability. I look forward to \nworking with the people in the fishery and representatives from the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service and the North Pacific Council to \nimplement this program consistent with the intent of Congress.\n  The purpose of this program is to reduce excess harvesting capacity \nin the catcher processor sector of the BSAI non-pollock groundfish \nfisheries. Reducing excess harvesting capacity will contribute to the \nfuture rationalization and long term stability of these fisheries. This \nstatement is intended to clarify certain provisions contained in the \nAct and to facilitate its prompt implementation.\n  Subsection (a) provides definitions relevant to this Act and defines \nthe four subsectors participating in the capacity reduction program: \nAFA trawl catcher processors, longline catcher processors, non-AFA \ntrawl catcher processors, and pot catcher processors.\n  Subsection (b) authorizes a $75 million capacity reduction program \nfor the BSAI non-pollock groundfish fisheries.\n  Subsection (c) allocates the $75 million in loan authority among the \nfour catcher processor subsectors to reflect their relative \nparticipation in the non-pollock groundfish fisheries: $36 million to \nthe longline catcher processor subsector; $31 million to the non-AFA \ntrawl catcher processor subsector; $6 million to the AFA trawl catcher \nprocessor subsector; and $2 million to the pot catcher processor \nsubsector. In the event any of the subsectors does not use the funds \nallocated to them by January 1, 2009, then any remaining funds roll \nover to a fund available to all four subsectors.\n  Subsection (d) establishes the basic contractual relationship between \nmembers of a subsector who choose to participate in a capacity \nreduction plan by agreeing to sell their license, their vessel, or \nboth, to the Federal Government. Before the Secretary may disburse \nfunds, a seller must enter into a binding reduction contract with the \nFederal Government, subject only to approval of a capacity reduction \nplan pursuant to a referendum described in subsection (e). The binding \nreduction contract must include provisions governing revocation of all \nFederal fishing licenses, fishing permits, and area endorsements issued \nfor a vessel, and if relevant, the scrapping of a vessel, that is \npurchased through a capacity reduction plan authorized by this Act. It \nis intended that licenses currently attached to a vessel and all \nassociated vessel catch history will be retired.\n\n  It is anticipated that the subsectors will use their loan authority \nto reduce both active and latent capacity. The importance of \nencouraging the elimination of latent licenses is to prevent the re-\ncapitalization of the fishery from within the fleet. The August 2004\n\n[[Page S11748]]\n\nDepartment of Commerce report on addressing overcapitalized fisheries, \nU.S. Action National Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing \nCapacity, identifies latent capacity as a serious problem to be \naddressed in capacity reduction programs. The report cautions that \nsimply targeting active vessels with large catch histories may result \nin ctivating the latent boats and licenses, and frustrating the intent \nof the buyback effort. Unless latent capacity is addressed, the goal of \nthe Non-Pollock Groundfish Fishing Capacity Reduction Program will be \nundermined.\n  When dealing with active capacity, a participant will sell both a \nvessel and its qualified licenses. However, when eliminating latent \ncapacity, there may be circumstances where only a license is purchased \nthrough the capacity reduction program. This could occur when a vessel \nhas sunk or was otherwise destroyed by fire or accident, and is not \npresently active in the BSAI non-pollock groundfish fisheries. There \nalso will be circumstances where vessels have little or no catch \nhistory, but have qualified for a license. In this situation such \nvessels and licenses represent another form of latent capacity and \nshould be targeted in specific capacity reduction plans. In some cases \nthere may be no current vessel named on a qualified license. The price \npaid to purchase such licenses associated with a sunk or destroyed \nvessel is expected to be less than the price paid for an active vessel \nand its licenses.\n  Subsection (e)(1) establishes a framework within which individual \nsubsectors may develop capacity reduction plans. This includes a fee \nsystem that will repay the full amount of a capacity reduction loan \namount in a timely fashion. The subsectors may use negotiations, \nbidding systems, a reverse auction, or other methods appropriate for \nidentifying excess capacity to be reduced. This flexible approach is \nintended to utilize the knowledge and incentives of the participants in \na subsector to develop capacity reduction programs that maximize the \nelimination of excess fishing capacity at the least cost and in the \nshortest time.\n  Subsection (e)(2) authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to review and \napprove capacity reduction plans devised by each subsector. Once a \nsubsector completes its capacity reduction plan, it is submitted to the \nSecretary for review to determine consistency with this Act. Subsection \n(e)(2)(A-E) sets forth the requirements for Secretarial approval. To \napprove a subsector capacity reduction plan, the Secretary must \ndetermine that plan is consistent with the requirements of subsection \n(b) of section 312 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, with certain exceptions \nspelled out in this Act. Each subsector plan must include a fee system \nfor full and timely repayment of the loan, and must achieve the maximum \nsustained reduction in fishing capacity for the least cost in the \nminimum amount of time. Maximum sustained reduction may be demonstrated \nthrough a showing that the vessels and licenses to be purchased will \nachieve the greatest reduction in harvest capacity through use of the \nloan authority available to a subsector. Data related to vessel catch \nhistory and performance capabilities may be used to satisfy this \nprovision.\n  Subsection (e)(2)(E) expressly allows subsectors covered by this Act \nto upgrade their vessels to achieve efficiencies in fishing operations. \nThis provision does not alter the existing statutory or regulatory \nrestrictions on vessel length, tonnage or horsepower. The North Pacific \nCouncil retains authority to tailor vessel upgrades to meet the goals \nof fisheries management plans within its jurisdiction.\n  Subsection (e)(3) authorizes the Secretary to oversee referenda by \neach subsector to approve capacity reduction plans and requires the \nSecretary to notify subsector participants of an upcoming referendum. \nFollowing secretarial review and approval of a subsector capacity \nreduction plan, the Secretary is required to notify, to the extent \npracticable, all members of the subsector affected by such plan. The \nSecretary notice will include information on the proposed fee system, \nthe schedule, procedures, and eligibility requirements for \nparticipation in a subsector referendum, and an estimate of the \ncapacity to be reduced. This is purely a notice requirement--not a \nrulemaking--and it is not required to be published in the Federal \nRegister.\n  Subsection (e)(4)(A) authorizes the Secretary to implement the \nindividual subsectors capacity reduction plans. Within 90 days after a \nsuccessful referendum, the Secretary is required to publish in the \nFederal Register a notice that includes the specific terms and \nconditions governing the purchase of licenses and vessels and a \ndescription of the fee system established for repayment of the loan. \nThis is not a rulemaking. The purpose of this notice is to provide a \npublic record of what has been purchased and how the loan is to be \nrepaid.\n  Subsection (e)(4)(B) expresses the intent of Congress that Section \n312(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act not apply to the capacity reduction \nplans governed by this Act.\n  Section (e)(5) establishes the authority of the Secretary to collect \nfees from the remaining members of a subsector necessary to repay the \ndebt obligations incurred as a result of an approved capacity reduction \nplan. It is intended that the Secretary exercise this authority through \nregulations that will govern the fee collection system and ensure that \nthe Federal Government can collect such fees. These regulations will \nbind the remaining members of a subsector and obligate them to repay \nthe capacity reduction loan. Revenues to cover the loan repayment fees \nwill be derived from the sale of fish harvested in the BSAI non-pollock \ngroundfish fisheries.\n  Subsection (f) establishes the required actions by entities other \nthan the Secretary to impose restrictions on vessels, revoke licenses \nand associated fishing rights, and scrap vessels. Subsection (f)(1)(A) \nrequires the National Vessel Documentation Center, at the request of \nthe Secretary, to revoke any fishery endorsements issued to a vessel \nunder section 12108 of Title 46, U.S.C. It is expected that the \nNational Vessel Documentation Center will annotate each buyback vessel \ndocumentation with language provided by the Secretary to notify future \npurchasers that they will not be able to receive any fishery \nendorsements. Subsections (f)(1)(B and C) require the Maritime \nAdministration to restrict a vessel to U.S. flag status and refuse to \ngrant approval for foreign registration or operation under foreign \nauthority by such vessel. Subsection (f)(2) requires that vessels \npurchased under this Act designated for scrapping conform to the \nprocedures established for a reduction vessel under section 600.1011(c) \nof Title 50, CFR. Scrapping of vessels pursuant to this provision shall \nbe overseen by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration--\nNOAA--and performed consistent with NOAA requirements. The cost to \nscrap a vessel will be paid by the buyback participant.\n  Subsection (g)(1) specifies the eligibility criteria for \nparticipation in the BSAI Non-Pollock Groundfish Fishing Capacity \nReduction Program. It also limits participation in the BSAI non-pollock \ngroundfish fishery to ensure the goal of capacity reduction is \nachieved.\n  Subsection (g)(2) expresses the sense of Congress that the North \nPacific Council continue with its efforts to rationalize the BSAI non-\npollock groundfish fisheries. This statement is intended to reinforce \nthe Council commitment to adopt such management measures necessary to \npromote stability in these fisheries. This includes final action in a \ntimely fashion on Amendments 80a and 80b, and the development and \napproval of sector allocations for the BSAI Pacific cod fishery. It is \nthe understanding of Congress that the North Pacific Council will take \nfinal action on Amendments 80a and 80b by the fall of 2005, and adopt \nBSAI Pacific cod sector allocations by the end of 2005. Amendments 80a \nand 80b are particularly important to the non-AFA trawl catcher \nprocessor subsector as this fleet seeks to comply with the North \nPacific Council pending Improved Retention/Improved Utilization--IR/\nIU--requirements. It is essential that the North Pacific Council take \nfinal action on Amendments 80a and 80b prior to implementing new IR/IU \nrequirements.\n  Subsection (g)(2)(B) makes clear that subsectors who eliminate excess \ncapacity through a capacity reduction plan authorized by this Act not \nbe penalized by the North Pacific Council. This provision is intended \nto discourage the Council from reducing a subsector\n\n[[Page S11749]]\n\nBSAI non-pollock groundfish allocations as a result of that subsector \nreduction of fishing effort through programs authorized under this Act. \nThis does not preclude the North Pacific Council from exercising its \nauthority to manage these fisheries, including taking actions to \naddress bycatch concerns or changes in stock levels. In addition, this \nSubsection would not prevent the North Pacific Council from raising the \nCDQ share of the harvest for this fishery consistent with past Bering \nSea and Aleutian Islands rationalization efforts or as part of any \neventual rationalization process.\n  Subsection (h) requires the Secretary to report annually to the \nrelevant Congressional oversight committees on the implementation of \nthis Act. Reports shall include details on the individual capacity \nreduction plans, an assessment of their cost-effectiveness, and the \nachievement of the goals set forth in section 312(b) of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I comment on the portion of the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 that reauthorizes the Small \nBusiness Administration. Of particular importance to me is the \ninclusion of many aspects of my prior bills, the Small Business \nAdministration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003, S.1375, \nwhich was approved by the Senate on September 26, 2003 by unanimous \nconsent, and of my more recent SBA bill, the Small Business \nReauthorization and Manufacturing Assistance Act of 2004, S.2821. These \nprovisions reauthorize for 2 years the programs administered by the \nSmall Business Administration under the Small Business Act and the \nSmall Business Investment Act of 1958, and contain significant \nimprovements to the SBA's lending and technical assistance programs.\n  For over a year, I have worked with the House Small Business \nCommittee and the administration, making numerous attempts to \naccommodate my colleagues and to resolve outstanding issues that \nblocked the passage of a comprehensive bill. Various forms of my \noriginal bill have been introduced over this period in order to help \nmove the other body's stalled legislation, while in the meantime our \nNation's small businesses have waited to receive the benefits of \nimproved SBA services that are contained in this bill.\n  The vast majority of businesses in each State in this country are \nsmall businesses. In Maine, 98 percent of businesses are small \nbusinesses. By enacting these provisions Congress is fulfilling its \nobligation in helping our entrepreneurs reach their American dream.\n  The SBA is a vital resource not only for our Nation's 25 million \nsmall businesses, but also for the millions of Americans relying upon \nsmall business ownership as an alternative to the ``traditional \nworkplace'' where corporate America once offered life-long futures for \nworkers.\n  The SBA's fundamental purpose is to ``aid, counsel, assist, and \nprotect the interests of small-business concerns.'' The methods for \ncarrying out Congress mandates include a wide array of financial, \nprocurement, management, and technical assistance programs tailored to \nencourage small business growth and expansion. As the economy continues \nto recover and grow, it is essential that Congress send a message that \naffirms long-term stability in the programs the SBA provides to the \nsmall business community.\n  In the 50-year period since the establishment of the SBA, there have \nbeen many revisions and additions to the methods and organizational \nstructure used by the SBA to respond to the evolving needs of small \nbusiness. This bill builds upon those changes creating a stronger \nfoundation for the SBA to deliver its programs.\n  Since 1953, nearly 20 million small business owners have received \ndirect or indirect help from one of the SBA's lending or technical \nassistance programs, making the agency one of the government's most \ncost-effective instruments for economic development.\n  The SBA current loan portfolio of more than 200,000 loans, worth more \nthan $45 billion, makes it the largest single supporter of small \nbusinesses in the country. Last year alone, lenders have made 83,912 \nloans to small businesses in the SBA's two major loan programs, with a \ntotal value of $16.5 billion.\n  Moreover, the SBA Small Business Investment Company program's current \nportfolio of more than 16,900 financings with an initial investment \namount of $17.2 billion makes it the largest single equity-type backer \nof U.S. businesses in the Nation. Since 1958 the venture capital \nprogram has put more than $42.3 billion into the hands of small \nbusiness owners, and this year it has produced investments of more than \n$2.6 billion in small businesses.\n\n  The SBA estimates that in the last fiscal year its loan and venture \ncapital programs have provided small businesses with $19.7 billion in \nvarious forms of financing, enabling small businesses to create or \nretain 716,144 jobs.\n  In my home state of Maine alone, almost 2,500 SBA loans have been \nprovided since 1999, for a total of over $288 million, to small \nbusinesses that might not have qualified for loans through alternative \nchannels. These loans are critical to providing capital to small \nbusinesses in every state and now more will be available to them for \nsupplying this country with additional production, jobs, and income.\n  Through a great deal of hard work, many aspects of S.1375 that \nimproved the SBA's largest loan program--the 7(a) program--were \nincluded in the omnibus package. To give you some examples, a National \nPreferred Lenders Pilot Program will be created, in which lenders \nalready operating as Preferred Lenders in the 7(a) program in many \ndistricts can be granted Preferred Lender status on a nation-wide \nrather than district-by-district basis, thereby greatly increasing the \nprogram's efficiency. The maximum size of 7(a) Express loans have been \nincreased from $250,000 to $350,000 and the maximum 7(a) guarantee is \nincreased from $1 million to $1.5 million.\n  The SBA 504 loan program, which supports real estate and machinery \ninvestments, will also benefit. The maximum 504 guarantee, previously \n$1 million, is increased to $1.5 million for a general 504 guarantee \nand $4 million for a guarantee that supports a manufacturing project. \nFor a loan that supports one of the nine ``public-policy'' goals named \nin the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the maximum guarantee is \nincreased from $1.3 million to $2 million.\n  Let me share some additional highlights of the provisions that are \nincluded.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, co-chair of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing, \nand Senator from a state with a rich manufacturing history, I am keenly \naware that our nation's economy and security depends on our industrial \nbase.\n  Unfortunately, manufacturing jobs in the United States have declined \nsince their historic peak in 1979 and that loss has accelerated in \nrecent years. Small business manufacturers constitute over 98 percent \nof our nation's manufacturing enterprises. It is impossible to \noverstate the role of small manufacturers within the overall \nmanufacturing industry and our nation's economy.\n  The bill includes a section that derives from S. 1977, the Small \nManufacturers Assistance, Recovery, and Trade, SMART Act, which I and \noriginal cosponsor Senator George V. Voinovich introduced on November \n25, 2003. Specifically, it establishes a Small Business Manufacturing \nTask Force within the Small Business Administration, charged with \nensuring that the administration is properly addressing the particular \nneeds of small manufacturers.\n  I am also particularly pleased that the Omnibus bill contains $109 \nmillion for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a cost-effective, \npublic-private partnership that helps small and medium-sized American \nmanufacturers modernize to compete in the demanding global marketplace.\n  The MEP's funding had been drastically reduced in 2004, dropping \nto $39.6 million from a previous level of $106 million. Those drastic \ncuts threatened to destroy the MEP program, which is relied upon by \nsmall manufacturers across our nation.\n\n  At a time when these manufacturers are facing an unprecedented level \nof competition from across the globe, it is vital that we continue to \nprovide them the tools and resources that allow them to remain \ncompetitive and to\n\n[[Page S11750]]\n\ncontinue to provide well paying jobs to millions across our country.\n  For our veterans who give so much to our nation and who continue to \ntake risks on the battlegrounds of the business world, the bill \nincludes language that I originally included in S. 1375, extending the \nAdvisory Committee on Veterans Affairs as a separate entity to continue \nits functions through September 30, 2006.\n  The Advisory Committee responsibilities include providing better \nassistance and support to veterans who are forming and expanding small \nbusinesses, and providing advice to Congress and the Small Business \nAdministration on policy initiatives to promote veteran \nentrepreneurship.\n  With this legislation, Congress is also taking important steps \ntowards fulfilling its promises to pry open the doors of public \nprocurement for small businesses. Small entrepreneurs continue to face \npersistent barriers in accessing government prime contracts and \nsubcontracts. Many of these barriers have been erected in the middle of \nthe very programs designed to assist small entrepreneurs who are socio-\neconomically disadvantaged or who do business in Historically \nUnderutilized Business Zones. Therefore, it has been no surprise that \nthe Federal Government has never come close to satisfying its statutory \nHUBZone prime contracting goals.\n  Among other items taken from my earlier SBA bill, S.2821, this bill \nexpands the definition of HUBZone-eligible firms to promote inflow of \ncapital to HUBZone areas, tap the potential of small agricultural \ncooperatives, and place tribally-owned HUBzone firms on equal footing \nwith other participants. It also extends the HUBzone program to \nmilitary base closure areas such as the former Loring Air Force Base \nand protects companies located in rural HUBZone areas like Aroostook \nCounty, ME, from losses of their HUBZone status due to area \nredesignations. Duplicative paperwork burdens imposed on 8(a) firms \ntrying to do business with state and local governments are also being \nlifted.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to comment on the funding levels \nprovided for the SBA in this bill. Since FY 2001, funding for the SBA \nhas decreased by more than 32 percent, the largest decrease of any \nagency funded with discretionary spending. I understand the need to be \nparticularly fiscally responsible this year, given the size of the \ndeficit, but such a large cut to programs that focus on creating jobs \nis a mistake.\n  The funding included for the SBA Microloan program will provided \nentrepreneurs with a source of financing when no other options are \navailable. With over $27 million in loan provided through this program \nlast year, I am satisfied that the bill closely reflects my funding \nrequest.\n  I am pleased with the funding levels provided for the SBA technical \nassistance programs, especially the funding provided for the Women's \nBusiness Center program. During this Congress, I worked with the \nadministration and the House of Representatives to pass legislation \nthat would sustained funding for the most experienced centers.\n  With women-owned firms generating almost $2.5 trillion in revenues \nand employing more than 19 million workers, they are the fastest \ngrowing segment of today's economy. In my home state of Maine alone, \nmore than 63,000 women-owned firms generate more than $9 billion in \nsales. The funding included in this bill for these centers ensures that \nthere are resources available to continue creating success stories for \nAmerica's women entrepreneurs.\n\n  I am deeply concerned that the final Omnibus bill did not reflect the \nSenate bill and include funding for the SBIR and STTR programs of $2 \nmillion and $250,000 respectively. These programs facilitated over $1.5 \nbillion in government research and development grants to small \nbusinesses. Moreover, since the inception of the program in 1982, SBIR \nfirms have produced more than 4,100 patents. Without the funding for \nthese programs not only do our small businesses suffer but so does our \nnation. These programs capitalize on the small business sector's \ninnovative potential. Technological innovation creates jobs, improves \nour way of life, and helps American companies maintain their \ncompetitive advantage.\n  I applaud America's small businesses that continue to rise to the \nchallenge of keeping this country innovative and strong. Three to four \nmillion new business start-ups each year and 1 in 25 adult Americans \naccept the risks of starting a business. Today's small business owners \nare making plans for tomorrow, including decisions that will create \napproximately two-thirds of all net new jobs helping to sustain local \ncommunities, according to a recent National Federation of Independent \nBusiness survey.\n  Over the last 5 years the SBA's programs and services have helped \ncreate and retain over 6.2 million jobs. According to the SBA, the \n$65.5 billion awarded to small businesses in Federal prime and \nsubcontracts in FY 2003 will create or retain close to 500,000 jobs. \nThis bill should bring about similar or even greater results in the \nnext few years.\n  Too much was at stake for small businesses, and the economy as a \nwhole, to allow SBA reauthorization to languish. It was time for \nCongress to find essential agreement and fulfill its obligation to \nAmerica's small businesses. Clearly, if we strove for anything less, \nwe'd have failed to support the backbone of our economy, our hope for \ninnovation and new technology, and our small firms that employ millions \nacross the nation.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues who joined me in supporting this crucial \nlegislation, thereby bolstering American small businesses and \nprotecting Americans' dreams.\n  Mr. President, Division K of H.R. 4818, the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act for 2005, contains the Small Business \nReauthorization and Manufacturing Assistance Act of 2004. Since the Act \nwas incorporated directly into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for \n2005, no committee report accompanies the legislation.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am submitting for insertion in the Record, the \nattached explanation of Division K. I would expect the administrator of \nthe Small Business Administration, in implementing the provisions of \nthis act, to accord the enclosed explanation the same weight in \ndivining congressional intent that the administrator would give to \nlanguage in a conference report. This expectation is particularly \nappropriate in this circumstance because the provisions were negotiated \nand agreed to in cooperation with my counterpart in the United States \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization \nAct of 2003, S.1375, is a bill to reauthorize most programs at the SBA \nfor Fiscal Years 2004, 2005, and 2006. Additionally, the bill makes \nchanges to various existing programs and authorizes several new pilot \ninitiatives. S.1375 was adopted by the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship by a unanimous vote of 19-0.\n  S. 1375 was the product of a series of hearings and roundtable \ndiscussions that the committee held in 2003 on a wide spectrum of \nissues and SBA programs.\n  The committee completed its series of hearings and roundtables on SBA \nreauthorization with a hearing on June 4, 2003, that included SBA \nAdministrator Hector Barreto. This hearing provided an additional \nopportunity for the agency to respond to issues raised during the \nprevious roundtable discussions, discuss its legislative package that \nwas submitted to the Committee for review, and comment on the \nPresident's fiscal year 2004 budget submission. The hearing also \nexamined a number of agency management issues including the SBA's \nefforts to obtain a clean audit opinion on financial statements, \nimplementation of a loan monitoring system, and workforce \ntransformation plans.\n  In addition to containing sections from the Small Business \nAdministration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003, the \nOmnibus includes sections that derive from S. 1977, the Small \nManufacturers Assistance, Recovery, and Trade (``SMART'') Act, offered \nby Senator Snowe and original cosponsor Senator George V. Voinovich, \nintroduced on November 25, 2003.\n  Examples of provisions from the SMART Act contained in the Omnibus \nare sections that increase manufacturers' access to capital, and a \nprovision that creates a Small Business Manufacturing Task Force, \nwithin the SBA,\n\n[[Page S11751]]\n\ncharged with ensuring that the SBA is properly addressing the \nparticular needs of small manufacturers.\n  Throughout the hearings and roundtables, the Committee's objectives \nhave been to single out the SBA programs that work well, identify the \nreasons for their superior performance, and apply those principles to \nprograms that need improvement. The voluminous amount of information \nthat the Committee collected through the hearings and roundtable \ndiscussions held this year and in the previous Congress as well as \ninformation received directly from small business stakeholders has \ncontributed greatly to achieving that goal and the results are \nreflected in the bill.\n  While not all of the provisions of S.1375 are contained in Division K \nof H.R. 4818, I believe that by providing appropriate authorization \nlevels, updating and improving SBA lending and technical assistance \nprograms, and introducing new initiatives to assist America's 21st \nCentury entrepreneurs, this bill will provide a sound foundation for \nthe agency to begin its next 50 years of even greater service.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following these remarks an \nexplanatory statement describing the small business provisions of H.R. \n4818 be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11751-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11751-S11767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  STATEMENT DESCRIBING PROVISIONS OF DIVISION K OF H.R. 4818 FILED BY \n                        SENATOR OLYMPIA J. SNOWE\n\n\n                       Section 101. Express Loans\n\n  Section 7(a)(25)(B) authorizes the Administrator to create pilot loan \nprograms. In exercising that authority, the Administrator created an \n``Express Loan Pilot Program.'' The program authorizes lenders to use \ntheir own forms in submitting requests to the Administrator for the \nissuance of guarantees. Two significant restrictions are imposed by the \n``Express Loan Pilot Program:'' the guarantee cannot exceed 50 percent \nof the loan and the maximum loan amount is $250,000.\n  Section 101 codifies, with a few significant differences, the \nprovisions of Pub. L. No. 108-217, which addressed the Express Loan \nProgram. The two most significant changes are the permanent \nauthorization of the Express Loan Program by creating a new paragraph \n(31) in Sec. 7(a) of the Small Business Act and the statutory increase \nin the size of such loans to $350,000.\n  Section 101 defines an ``express lender'' as any lender authorized by \nthe Administrator to participate in the Express Loan Program. Congress \nexpects that the Administrator will establish by rule the standards \nneeded to qualify as an Express Lender.\n  Section 101 defines an ``express loan'' as one in which the lender \nutilizes, to the maximum extent practicable, its own analyses of credit \nand forms. Congress fully expects that the conditions under which \nexpress loans are made will not vary significantly from those \nconditions that currently exist under the ``Express Loan Pilot \nProgram.'' Nevertheless, Congress understands that the Administrator \nmay wish to revise the standards and operating procedures associated \nwith ``express loans.'' Nothing in the statutory language should be \ninterpreted as prohibiting the Administrator from imposing these \nadditional requirements that are otherwise consistent with the \nstatutory language.\n  Section 101 codifies the existing concept of the Administrator's \n``Express Loan Pilot Program.'' In other words, the ``Express Loan \nProgram'' is one in which lenders utilize their own forms and get a \nguarantee of no more than 50 percent.\n  Section 101 restricts the program, including the increased loan \namount of $350,000, to those lenders designated as express lenders by \nthe Administrator. Designation as an express lender does not limit the \nlender to making express loans if the lender has been authorized to \nmake other types of loans pursuant to Sec. 7(a) of the Small Business \nAct. Although a lender may only seek status as an express lender, this \nsection was included to ensure that the Administrator not limit the \nability of an express lender to seek other lending authority from the \nAdministrator. Nor is the Administrator permitted to change its \nstandards for designating an express lender in a manner that only \nauthorizes the lender to make express loans. To the extent that the \nlending institution wishes to offer a full range of loan products \nauthorized by Sec. 7(a) and is otherwise qualified to do so, the \nAdministrator shall not restrict that ability on the lender's status as \nan express lender.\n  Section 101 prohibits the Administrator from revoking the designation \nof any lender as an express lender that was so designated at the time \nof enactment. This prohibition does not apply if the Administrator \nfinds the express lender to have violated laws or regulations or the \nAdministrator modifies the requirements for designation in a way that \nthe express lender cannot meet those standards. Congress does not \nexpect that the Administrator will impose new requirements for express \nlenders that prohibit them from making loans under other loan programs \nauthorized by the Small Business Act for which they have approval from \nthe Administrator.\n\n       Congress, at the request of the Small Business \n     Administration, determined that it was appropriate to expand \n     the size of ``express loans'' to $350,000. Any change in the \n     size of an express loan now will require action by Congress.\n       Congress is concerned that the Administrator will take \n     regulatory actions that unduly favor express lending over \n     other types of lending authorized by Sec. 7(a) of the Small \n     Business act. As such, Congress incorporated a provision \n     prohibiting the Administrator from taking any action that \n     would have the effect of requiring a lender to make an \n     express loan rather than a conventional loan pursuant to \n     Sec. 7(a). Any significant policy change in the operation of \n     the lending programs authorized by Sec. 7(a) of the Small \n     Business Act requires notification to the House and Senate \n     Small Business Committees. Furthermore, the statutory \n     language on notification goes beyond that which is required \n     pursuant to Sec. 7(a)(24) of the Small Business Act.\n\n\n                    section 102. loan guarantee fees\n\n       Section 102 increases the loan guarantee amount to a \n     maximum of $1.5 million. Given the fact that borrowers are \n     getting an additional increment in loan guarantees, the \n     sponsors determined that it would be appropriate to require \n     an additional 0.25 percent fee for the amount of guarantee in \n     excess of $1 million. Thus, on the amount of the guarantee \n     between $1 million and $1.5 million, the upfront fee \n     authorized pursuant to Sec. 7(a)(18) of the Small Business \n     Act increases from 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent but only for \n     that portion of the loan guarantee in excess of $1 million. \n     This is consistent with typical commercial lending practices \n     of charging fees that are commensurate with the lenders' \n     exposure to risk.\n       Section 102 also raises the fee collected by the \n     Administrator from banks of the unpaid balance of deferred \n     participation loans. To avoid situations such as those that \n     occurred at the end of calendar year 2003 in which the \n     Administrator was required to drastically reduce lending and \n     impose other restrictions on the program, Congress determined \n     that it would be appropriate for the Administrator to have \n     some discretion in setting the fee paid by lenders on the \n     unpaid balance. The total amount of the fee cannot in any \n     year, exceed 0.55 percent of the unpaid balance. Congress \n     expects the Administrator to use this authority only when \n     needed to drive the cost, as that term is defined in the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act, of the loan program to zero, i.e., \n     not need an appropriation. Any use of this discretion to \n     raise the fee beyond the current level of 0.5 percent should \n     trigger the notification provisions in Sec. 7(a)(24) of the \n     Small Business Act. As a further oversight tool, Congress \n     expects that the Administrator would satisfy any relevant \n     committee's request for information on the utilization of \n     this discretion.\n       Finally, Congress determined that the Administrator also be \n     given the authority to lower fees charged to borrowers and \n     lenders if the subsidy cost becomes negative, i.e., the fees \n     will actually take in more money to the government than it \n     costs to operate the Sec. 7(a) loan program. Congress adopted \n     an approach that the Administrator, should it undertake a fee \n     reduction, first consider reducing the fees set forth in \n     clauses (i)-(iii) of subsection 7(a)(18)(A) and then reduce \n     fees on lenders. As a further restriction on the discretion \n     of the Small Business Administration, the fees that were \n     charged to borrowers on the date of enactment of this \n     conference report may not be raised. Congress adopted this \n     language to ensure that any fee increases to borrowers \n     beyond the statutory limits requires the action of \n     Congress.\n\n\nSection 103. Increase in Guarantee Amount in Institution of Associated \n                                  Fee\n\n       Access to capital is vital to the growth of small \n     businesses. Particularly for manufacturers and high \n     technology research and development businesses, typical \n     amounts of capital available under the existing loan limits \n     authorized by Sec. 7(a) of the Small Business Act often are \n     inadequate. Given the importance of capital to grow small \n     businesses, Congress determined that it would be appropriate \n     to permanently increase the amount\n\n[[Page S11752]]\n\n     of the loan guarantee from $1 million to $1.5 million. No \n     additional changes were made in the overall statutory cap of \n     a gross $2 million loan. Thus, the Administrator will be able \n     to guarantee up to $1.5 million of a $2 million loan rather \n     than the current limit of $1 million. Congress expects that \n     this will increase the number of lenders willing to make \n     loans to small manufacturers who face significant global \n     competition.\n\n\n                      Section 104. Debenture Size\n\n       Congress raised all of the loan limitations for qualified \n     state and local development companies (``CDCs'') because they \n     had not been raised in many years and the long-term financing \n     needs of small businesses were not being met by loans that \n     did not exceed the thresholds for loans made pursuant to \n     Sec. 7(a) of the Small Business Act. Raising the loan \n     limitations has two effects. First, it signifies the \n     recognition that Title V of the Small Business Investment Act \n     and Sec. 7(a) of the Small Business Act has very different \n     purposes in mind. Second, an increase in the threshold allows \n     more effective economic development projects to be funded by \n     CDCs.\n       Congress believes that the increases to $1,500,000 for \n     regular projects, $2,000,000 for public policy goal projects, \n     and $4,000,000 for small manufacturers will provide \n     significant new financial inputs to small businesses in \n     general and to small manufacturers in particular.\n       While all small businesses whose primary industrial \n     classification is in North American Industrial Classification \n     sectors 31, 32, and 33 (the sectors for manufacturing), not \n     all small business concerns in those sectors are considered \n     small manufacturers. Congress adopted a requirement that \n     small manufacturers should be limited to those small business \n     concerns that have all of their production facilities are \n     located in the United States. Congress does not intend that \n     small business concerns that have manufacturing facilities \n     situated outside of the United States should be denied \n     assistance under programs operated by the Small Business \n     Administration. However, special benefits should be afforded \n     to those manufacturers whose production facilities are \n     located in the United States. Finally, the definition in \n     Sec. 106 is identical to the definition in this section \n     thereby avoiding any potential interpretive concerns about \n     what the legislature meant when it used the same term in \n     different sections of legislation.\n\n\n                     Section 105. Job Requirements\n\n       The Administrator has promulgated regulations, pursuant to \n     Sec. 501 of the Small Business Investment Act mandating that \n     a loan made by a CDC must create or save one job for each \n     $35,000 in guarantee. This standard has not been revised \n     since it was adopted in 1990. The standard clearly does not \n     reflect inflation or the dramatic increases in productivity \n     that has led to higher wages for all employees. Congress \n     determined that the standard should be revised to take \n     account of the changes in the economy during the past 14 \n     years. Therefore, Sec. 105 statutorily raises the job \n     creation standard to one job for every $50,000 in \n     guarantees.\n       Manufacturing requires greater capital investment than \n     other businesses. Such investment may lead to higher \n     productivity for small manufacturers and therefore fewer jobs \n     created per investment. Congress does not want to prejudice \n     the ability of CDCs to fund projects that would assist small \n     manufacturers. Section 106 establishes a standard that \n     authorizes CDC loans to small manufacturers if the project \n     creates one job for each $100,000 of guarantee.\n       CDCs do not need to meet job creation standards for \n     individual loans if the loan is used to further one of the \n     public policy objectives in Sec. 501(d). Section 105 modifies \n     that requirement slightly by exempting a particular project \n     from the job creation standards if the project was meeting a \n     public policy objective and if the CDC's overall loan \n     portfolio creates one job for $50,000 in guarantees.\n       Since the basic premise of loans made pursuant to Title V \n     of the Small Business Investment Act is to encourage economic \n     development, Congress concluded that it made sense to \n     establish a different standard for job creation in \n     economically-depressed areas or places with unusually high \n     wage requirements. Congress believes that CDCs should be \n     provided more leeway in creating jobs in economically-\n     depressed areas and Alaska and Hawaii. As a result, CDC loans \n     in these areas only need to meet a more lenient job creation \n     standard of one job per $75,000 of guarantee in certain \n     areas.\n       Given the importance of small manufacturing to economic \n     development, Congress excluded loans to small manufacturers \n     from the calculations needed to determine whether a CDC's \n     loan portfolio meets the overall job creation standard of one \n     job per $50,000 of guarantee or the $75,000 standard for \n     high-wage and economically-depressed areas. Congress intends \n     that the public policy goals set forth in Sec. 501 should be \n     accomplished without reference to job creation for small \n     manufacturers. Section 105 also authorizes the Administrator \n     to waive any of the standards when appropriate. Congress \n     expects that the Administrator will promulgate regulations \n     specifying when the job creation standards will be waived. \n     Two restrictions are imposed on the Administrator's \n     discretion. First, the Administrator may not waive the \n     requirements concerning small manufacturers. Second, the \n     Administrator may not mandate a job creation standard with a \n     number lower than that set forth in Sec. 105 but does have \n     the liberty to set a higher dollar guarantee per job \n     standard. These restrictions ensure that the Administrator \n     does not undermine the ability of CDCs to lend to small \n     manufacturers.\n\n\n Section 106. Report Regarding National Database of Small Manufacturers\n\n       Institutions of higher education can play a vital role in \n     reviving small manufacturers. Universities must purchase \n     large amounts of standard manufactured products (often on an \n     annual basis--such as furniture for dormitory rooms). They \n     also often purchase very sophisticated tools and laboratory \n     equipment that small manufacturers may produce. Congress \n     believes that some mechanism should be in place so that \n     institutions of higher education can identify suppliers from \n     the universe of small manufacturers. While not an ideal \n     system, a database similar to PRO-NET represents a useful \n     model for making institutions of higher education aware of \n     the capabilities of small manufacturers. PRO-NET is a \n     database operated by the federal government in which the \n     capabilities of numerous small businesses are outlined. \n     Contracting officers use PRO-NET to find small businesses \n     capable of providing goods and services. Section 106 \n     requires the Administrator and the Association of Small \n     Business Development Centers to study the viability of \n     creating a PRO-NET-like database that all institutions of \n     higher education can use to identify small manufacturers \n     (the definition is identical to the definition in \n     Sec. Sec. 104-05) capable of providing their procurement \n     needs. The bill also requires a report to Congress on the \n     viability and cost to establish such a database.\n\n\n                    Section 107. International Trade\n\n       All Sec. 7(a) loans can be used to refinance existing debt \n     except for international trade loans. Congress determined \n     that the restriction did not make sense especially since \n     businesses harmed by unfair international competition will be \n     more competitive if their debt service payments are lower. \n     Therefore, Congress authorized businesses otherwise eligible \n     for an international trade loan to use it for refinancing of \n     debt but only to the extent that the Administrator determines \n     the applicant's existing debt is not structured with \n     reasonable terms and conditions. Congress expects that the \n     Administrator examine the interest rate being charged \n     relative to the interest rates generally available for \n     similar businesses to determine whether the terms and \n     conditions are not reasonable.\n       To obtain an international trade loan, the applicant must \n     demonstrate that the business either is engaged in or \n     adversely affected by international trade. To avoid the \n     necessity of having to prove adverse effects if other \n     government agencies already reached that conclusion in the \n     same industry as the borrower, Congress mandated that the \n     Administrator must accept as conclusive proof of injury a \n     finding by the Secretary of Commerce issued pursuant to \n     chapter 3 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974 or any \n     determination by the International Trade Commission. If an \n     applicant is in an industry for which the Commission or the \n     Secretary has made an injury finding, Congress concluded that \n     it would be pointless to require the small businesses so \n     suffering to go through the additional expense of presenting \n     new evidence to the Administrator of injury.\n       Congress intends that the utilization of the findings by \n     the Secretary or the Commission is not a limiting factor if a \n     small business can present other evidence of injury. For \n     example, the Commission or Secretary may not find that an \n     industry was injured or that no claims were made to either \n     agency. Nothing in Sec. 107 prevents a small business from \n     presenting of evidence of specific injury to his or her \n     business. The Administrator then would be required to rule on \n     the adequacy of the proof, and if sufficient evidence was \n     found of injury, make a loan under Sec. 7(a)(16).\n       Section 107 also provides for an increase in the size of \n     international trade loans. Given the nature of international \n     trade, Congress typically has mandated that loan caps be \n     $250,000 higher than those for conventional Sec. 7(a) loans. \n     This section maintains that practice and increased the cap \n     for international trade loans based on the increase in the \n     guarantee fees for conventional loans.\n\n\n               Section 121. Program Authorization Levels\n\n       This section amends Sec. 20 of the Small Business Act and \n     provides for authorization of appropriations. Congress \n     selected authorization levels with sufficient room to allow \n     for expected growth and expansion of programs authorized by \n     the Small Business Act and Small Business Investment Act. \n     Congress also determined that an authorization of \n     appropriations not elsewhere provided should apply to all of \n     the Small Business Investment Act.\n       Finally, Congress concluded that the existing standing \n     authorization of appropriations only for carrying out title \n     IV of the Small Business Investment Act was illogical. \n     Section 121 amends Sec. 20 to provide for an authorization of \n     appropriations not elsewhere provided for carrying out both \n     the Small Business Act and all titles of the Small Business \n     Investment Act.\n\n\n                Section 122. Additional Reauthorizations\n\n       The Small Business Development Center (SBDC) program's \n     authorization levels are set forth in Sec. 21 of the Small \n     Business Act. Congress provided modest authorization \n     increases for the SBDCs to take account of necessary growth \n     in providing services to entrepreneurs. In addition, Congress \n     also extended the authority of SBDCs to provide\n\n[[Page S11753]]\n\n     drug-free workplace counseling. This authority would have \n     lapsed without the change. The extension of authority will \n     give the SBDC grantees sufficient time to coordinate their \n     actions with the grantees under the revised drug-free \n     workplace program.\n       Given the SBDCs expertise in providing assistance to \n     entrepreneurs, Congress established a program authorizing \n     grants to SBDCs that are willing to offer advice in \n     communities that are economically challenged due to business \n     or government facility down-sizing or closing. Congress \n     expects that this assistance will first be offered to \n     communities suffering from plant closings, then to \n     communities suffering from government office closings, and \n     finally to base realignments. To the extent that other bases \n     are closed in future years, Congress expects that legislation \n     concerning such closures will provide additional assistance \n     to the surrounding communities and that assistance provided \n     under Sec. 122 should be utilized in other areas that do not \n     receive the directed assistance associated with base \n     closures.\n\n\n      Section 123. Paul D. Coverdell Drug-Free Workplace Program \n                        Authorization Provisions\n\n       Congress recognizes that small businesses need drug free \n     workplaces. Drug-free workers boost productivity and reduce \n     the costs of health care coverage and absenteeism. As a \n     result, Congress reauthorized the program for two years at \n     the five million dollar level. In addition, to ensure that \n     funding is maximized to eligible intermediaries that \n     specialize in providing drug-free workplace assistance to \n     small businesses, Congress adopted a limitation on the amount \n     of funds that can be awarded to SBDCs for carrying out the \n     purposes of the Paul D. Coverdell Program. Furthermore, \n     Congress, again in an effort to maximize limited dollars, \n     restricts the use of funds for administrative purposes to \n     five percent of the total made available to grantees. Nothing \n     in this limitation restricts the drug-free workplace advice \n     that SBDC grantees are authorized to provide in their normal \n     course of operations.\n\n\n                     Section 124. Grant Provisions\n\n       Congress recognized that improvements in coordination \n     between the activities of drug-free workplace eligible \n     intermediaries and SBDCs might improve delivery of services \n     to small businesses. As a result, Congress established a \n     grant program within the Paul D. Coverdell Drug-Free \n     Workplace Program to promote cooperation between eligible \n     intermediaries and SBDC grantees. Congress expects that the \n     Administrator award the two-year grants to those applicants \n     that best demonstrate the capacity to deliver advice in a \n     coordinated manner between SBDCs and eligible intermediaries.\n\n\n       Section 125. Drug-Free Communities Coalitions as Eligible \n                             Intermediaries\n\n       Congress recognizes that there are numerous entities that \n     receive grants under chapter 2 of the National Narcotics \n     Leadership Act of 1988 but are not currently authorized to \n     participate as eligible intermediaries under the Paul D. \n     Coverdell Drug-Free Workplace Program. This section makes \n     these National Narcotics Leadership Act grantees, which could \n     provide valuable insight into establishing drug-free \n     workplaces, eligible to receive awards under the Paul D. \n     Coverdell Drug-Free Workplace Program. Inclusion of new \n     additional parties should not be interpreted as directing the \n     Administrator to favor them over others that apply for grants \n     under the Paul D. Coverdell Drug-Free Workplace Program.\n\n\n       Section 126. Promotion of Effective Practices of Eligible \n                             Intermediaries\n\n       To ensure that the Paul D. Coverdell Drug-Free Workplace \n     Program operates optimally, Congress mandates that the \n     Administrator provide best practices to eligible \n     intermediaries. The Administrator should use all of its \n     available outreach resources, including SBDCs, Women Business \n     Centers, and district offices to insure that eligible \n     intermediaries are kept apprised of best practices.\n       Congress also believe that the performance of eligible \n     intermediaries should be assessed and measured. Such \n     evaluations will be useful to Congress when it considers what \n     changes, if any, need to make the program even more \n     effective. This section establishes the procedures for \n     collecting data needed to evaluate the efficacy of the \n     program.\n\n\n                    Section 127. Report to Congress\n\n       This section requires the Administrator to use the data \n     collected under Sec. 126 and report to Congress on the \n     efficacy of the program and dissemination of drug-free \n     workplace information. Congress expects the relevant \n     committees to examine the report and make necessary \n     legislative changes as a result to ensure optimal operation \n     of the Paul D. Coverdell Drug-Free Workplace Program.\n\n\n               Section 131. Lender Examination and Review\n\n       Current practice authorizes SBIC licensees to pay for \n     examination and reviews conducted by the Administrator. \n     Congress determined that the same principles should apply to \n     lenders authorized to make government-guaranteed loans under \n     Sec. 7(a). This section grants the Administration the \n     authority to charge for examinations and reviews. The section \n     also requires that the fees be directed to lender oversight \n     activities including the payment of salaries and expenses of \n     Administration personnel involved in such functions. This \n     authority does not imply that the fees may be directed to the \n     reimbursement of other functions of the Administration.\n\n\n            Section 132. Gifts and Co-Sponsorship of Events\n\n       Gifts and co-sponsorships play a useful role in the Small \n     Business Administration's performance of its outreach \n     function to small businesses. Congress determined that even \n     broader language than is currently permitted was necessary to \n     ensure the Administration's continued ability to obtain gifts \n     and seek co-sponsorships. In particular, Congress recognized \n     that in many instances the Administration does not receive \n     gifts but rather contributions are made by a co-sponsoring \n     entity to an Administration event, such as small business \n     forum. In other instances, the SBA uses gifts to pay for \n     promotional materials, such as cards that are handed out in \n     district offices to promote an event. This section clarifies \n     and broadens the existing authority of the Small Business \n     Administration to obtain gifts and co-sponsorships in order \n     to expand the agency's outreach. To ensure appropriate \n     clarity, Congress added the term ``recognition events'' \n     which would include Small Business Week and sponsorship of \n     dinners during that period. The section also requires the \n     Administration to recognize the co-sponsors of such events \n     but only to the extent of their contributions. No \n     endorsements of the co-sponsors products or services are \n     permitted.\n       In order to ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise \n     in the solicitation or acceptance of gifts, Congress requires \n     the General Counsel to determine whether a conflict of \n     interest exists. If a determination that a conflict of \n     interest exists, the General Counsel is empowered to prohibit \n     the solicitation or acceptance. Finally, the language \n     clarifies that the Administrator may delegate the approval of \n     co-sponsorships to the Deputy Administrator, Associate \n     Administrators, and Assistant Administrators. No personnel \n     located in district or regional offices are permitted to \n     approve co-sponsorships. Congress adopted this restriction to \n     ensure close cooperation with the General Counsel of the \n     Administration.\n       Congress also requires that the Inspector General audit the \n     use of such gifts and co-sponsorships. This avoids potential \n     abuses of the program through independent oversight of an \n     official whose investigations cannot be impeded by the \n     Administrator or Administration personnel. Congress wanted \n     additional assurances (beyond the Inspector General audit) \n     that the Small Business Administration achieved a proper \n     balance between this new expanded authority and \n     accountability. As a result, a sunset date of 2006 was added \n     in order to properly monitor this new authority before \n     considering making this language permanent in the Small \n     Business Act.\n\n\n            Section 141. Service Corps of Retired Executives\n\n       Currently, the Administrator has the discretion whether to \n     permit the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) to \n     maintain offices at the headquarters of the Administration \n     and pay employees of SCORE. Congress determined that the \n     vitality of SCORE should not be subject to whims of the \n     Administrator and therefore require that the Administrator \n     maintain SCORE's offices at the Administration's headquarters \n     and continue to pay for the salaries of SCORE personnel. \n     Congress notes that this will not require any increased \n     appropriation since these services and expenses are currently \n     included in the Small Business Administration's budget.\n\n\n         Section 142. Small Business Development Center Program\n\n       Congress remains concerned that SBDCs were and may continue \n     to be revealing the name of businesses that seek their advice \n     to Administration employees for functions unrelated to the \n     financial auditing or client surveys needed to oversee the \n     operations of the SBDC grantees. Congress believes that such \n     behavior is intolerable. This section prohibits the \n     disclosure of client information (including the name, \n     address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and e-mail address) \n     of any concern or individual receiving assistance from a SBDC \n     grantee or its subcontractors (who operate service centers \n     that business owners can utilize to obtain advice) unless the \n     Administrator is ordered to make such disclosure pursuant to \n     a court order or civil or criminal enforcement action \n     commenced by a federal or state agency. Congress expects that \n     SBDC grantees will only respond to formal agency requests, \n     such as civil investigative demands, and subpoenas.\n       Congress also recognizes that the Administrator has \n     significant management responsibilities to ensure that \n     federal taxpayer dollars are wisely used by grantees and are \n     in compliance with the law, regulations, and the cooperative \n     agreements signed by SBDC grantees. Congress authorizes the \n     SBDC grantees to provide client names for the purposes of \n     financial audits conducted by the Administrator or \n     Inspector General and for client surveys to ensure that \n     the SBDC grantees are satisfying certain aspects of their \n     grant agreements. Congress recognizes that client surveys \n     may be misused and impose restrictions on their use. Until \n     regulations are in place to ensure that SBDC grantee \n     client's privacy is protected to the maximum extent \n     practicable given the management oversight responsibility \n     of the Administrator, Congress requires client surveys to \n     be approved by the Inspector General and any approval \n     incorporated into the\n\n[[Page S11754]]\n\n     semi-annual report made to Congress.\n       This section also makes a technical change in wording of \n     the SBDC program. It renames the certification program as an \n     accreditation program. The change was made because \n     institutions are accredited not certified. Since the program \n     determines the quality of SBDCs, it makes sense to have them \n     accredited not certified. An identical change is made in \n     Sec. 20(a)(1)(D)-(E).\n\n\n      Section 143. Advisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs\n\n       Congress has determined that the federal government must \n     provide better assistance and support to veterans in their \n     efforts to form and expand small businesses. In 1999, as part \n     of this effort, Congress established an Advisory Committee on \n     Veterans Business Affairs. Its responsibilities included \n     providing advice to Congress and the Small Business \n     Administration on policy initiatives that would promote \n     entrepreneurship by veterans. The responsibilities of this \n     advisory board were to be taken over by the National Veterans \n     Business Development Corporation on October 1, 2004. Congress \n     determined that the Advisory Committee's role was \n     sufficiently beneficial that it should not be subsumed within \n     the National Veterans Business Development Corporation. As a \n     result, Congress authorized an extension of the Advisory \n     Committee as a separate entity to continue its functions \n     through September 30, 2006.\n\n\n               Section 144. Outreach Grants for Veterans\n\n       The Administration is authorized to provide outreach grants \n     to help disabled veterans start and expand small businesses. \n     Congress determined that the outreach grants should not be \n     limited to disabled veterans. This section extends the \n     authority to provide outreach programs to veterans and \n     reservists.\n\n\n              Section 145. Authorization of Appropriations\n\n       To express Congress' concern about adequate efforts to \n     assist veterans, Congress determined that the Small Business \n     Administration's Office of Veterans Affairs should have a \n     separate authorization. This section provides for that \n     separate authorization for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\n\n\n    Section 146. National Veterans Business Development Corporation\n\n       A ruling by the Department of Justice concluded that the \n     National Veterans Business Development Corporation was a \n     federal agency for all purposes and thus subject to, among \n     other things, federal administrative, personnel, and \n     procurement laws. Congress, when it created the corporation, \n     never intended that it would be considered a federal agency. \n     The legislation mandated sufficient fundraising by the \n     corporation that would eliminate the need for federal \n     funding. While that fundraising continues, Congress \n     determined that its original intent concerning the status of \n     the corporation should be honored. This section makes it \n     clear that the corporation is to be considered and treated as \n     a private entity and not an agency or instrumentality of \n     the Federal government.\n\n\n          Section 147. Small Business Manufacturing Task Force\n\n       Manufacturing jobs in the United States have declined since \n     their historic peak in 1979 and that loss has accelerated in \n     recent years. Small business manufacturers constitute over 98 \n     percent of our nation's manufacturing enterprises. It is \n     impossible to overstate the role of small manufacturers \n     within the overall manufacturing industry and our nation's \n     economy. The House and Senate Small Business Committees have \n     placed a high priority on trying to resuscitate the small \n     business industrial base because economic security in the \n     United States cannot occur in a purely post-industrial \n     economy.\n       Section 147 establishes a Small Business Manufacturing Task \n     Force within the Small Business Administration, charged with \n     ensuring that the Administration is properly addressing the \n     particular needs of small manufacturers. Specifically, the \n     Small Business Manufacturing Task Force will: (a) evaluate \n     and identify whether existing programs and services are \n     sufficient to serve small manufacturers' needs, or whether \n     additional programs or services are necessary; (b) actively \n     promote the SBA's programs and services that serve small \n     manufacturers; and (c) identify and study the unique \n     conditions of small manufacturers, and develop and propose \n     policy initiatives to support and assist them. This section \n     also instructs the Small Business Manufacturing Task Force to \n     submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the \n     President and the Senate and House Small Business Committees \n     not later than 12 months after the effective date of the bill \n     and annually thereafter. In carrying out their obligations \n     under this section, Congress expects that the Task Force will \n     consult with other agencies that have manufacturing \n     responsibilities, such as the Department of Commerce.\n\n\n     Section 151. Streamlining and Revision of HUBZone Eligibility \n                              Requirements\n\n       The Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) \n     program was designed to direct portions of federal \n     contracting dollars into areas of the country that in the \n     past have been out of the economic mainstream. HUBZone areas, \n     which include qualified census tracts, poor rural counties, \n     and Indian reservations, often are out-of-the-way places that \n     the stream of commerce passes by, and thus tend to be in low \n     or moderate income areas also characterized by comparatively \n     high unemployment. These areas can also include certain rural \n     communities and tend generally to be low-traffic areas that \n     do not have a reliable customer base to support business \n     development. As a result, businesses have been reluctant to \n     move into these areas and expend the necessary funds to \n     develop the infrastructure for creation of jobs. It simply \n     has not been profitable, without a customer base, to keep \n     those businesses operating.\n       The HUBZone program seeks to overcome these problems by \n     providing the means for Federal procurement activities to \n     become customers for small businesses that locate in \n     HUBZones. While a small business works to grow, expand its \n     payroll, and establish a solid base of commercial or other \n     customers, federal business opportunities can be of vital \n     importance. Federal prime and subcontracts can become an \n     important source of revenue for a HUBZone small business, and \n     prime contracts in particular can help stabilize revenues, \n     establish valuable past performance record, and maintain \n     future profitability.\n       In past years, the HUBZone program has encountered issues \n     relating to the statutory requirement that a HUBZone firm be \n     entirely owned and controlled by individual U.S. citizens. \n     This requirement means that all HUBZone applicants need to \n     be owned by human beings directly and not human beings \n     organized as business entities. However, many small \n     business owners and small business investors prefer to \n     take advantage of various corporate forms in order to \n     limit the personal liability for themselves and their \n     families. Exceptions for Alaska Native Corporations, \n     Indian tribal governments, and community development \n     corporations were added by the Small Business Act \n     reauthorization legislation in 2000. Even with those \n     changes, the presence of a corporate entity or a limited \n     liability company with an ownership stake in a small \n     business would have automatically disqualified an \n     otherwise eligible firm from participation in the HUBZone \n     program. Small agricultural cooperatives, which already \n     maintain presence in rural HUBZones, would have faced \n     similar restrictions. These rules unnecessarily impede the \n     flow of capital to the very areas that need it the most \n     and create compliance conflicts with other small business \n     procurement programs.\n       Section 151 addresses this problem through streamlining and \n     revision of the eligibility requirements for HUBZone small \n     businesses to include small businesses that are 51 percent \n     owned by United States citizens, as well as to include small \n     businesses which are small agricultural cooperatives or are \n     owned and controlled by small agricultural cooperatives.\n       In addition, HUBZone firms owned by the Indian tribes have \n     been facing peculiar challenges due to statutory requirements \n     that they must hire a certain percentage of its workforce \n     performing a federal contract or subcontract from Indian \n     reservations or adjacent areas. These requirements, while \n     motivated by the desire to spur economic development of the \n     tribes, over time had the unintended consequence of putting \n     tribally-owned firms at a disadvantage in comparison with all \n     other HUBZone concerns by imposing a geographic restriction \n     on the kinds of contracts that tribally-owned HUBZone firms \n     could perform. Geographic restrictions also impeded business \n     synergies between tribally-owned HUBZone firms and Alaskan \n     Native Corporations. To remedy this disparity, Section 151 is \n     providing tribally-owned HUBZone concerns the option of \n     qualifying for the program based on locating in, and hiring \n     workers from, either Indian reservations or any other \n     HUBZones on the same terms as available to other HUBZone \n     firms. Congress notes that the Indian tribes, as owners of \n     the HUBZone firms, will be receiving expanded economic \n     benefits from new contracting opportunities.\n\n\n               Section 152. Expansion of Qualified Areas\n\n       Congress observes that the HUBZone area qualifications are \n     also in need of improvement. Paradoxically, economically \n     distressed rural communities in states with high \n     unemployment--among the neediest of needy areas--currently do \n     not qualify for the HUBZone program because rural areas \n     currently must qualify in relation to the statewide \n     unemployment average. As an example, in calendar year 2003, \n     Alaska had a statewide unemployment rate of 8.0 percent. To \n     qualify as a HUBZone area, it was necessary for an Alaskan \n     rural community to have an 11.2 percent unemployment rate. \n     But, in 25 of the 50 states, a rural community could have \n     qualified as a HUBZone with an unemployment range of 7.8 \n     percent or less.\n       Section 152 addresses this problem by modifying the \n     definition of a ``qualified nonmetropolitan county'' to \n     provide the option of comparing the unemployment statistic \n     for that area to the statewide average or to the national \n     average. The new statutory HUBZone definition should give the \n     Small Business Administration flexibility to address both \n     national and state-wide unemployment disparities without \n     hurting the states that have comparatively low \n     unemployment overall, but with pockets of serious \n     unemployment.\n\n[[Page S11755]]\n\n       Congress recognizes the drastic economic ramifications of \n     military base closures and that the HUBZone program can \n     uniquely harness the strength and the creativity of the \n     private sector by providing incentive for small businesses to \n     relocate to areas suffering such ramifications. According to \n     congressional research, more than 300 military bases closed \n     or realigned between 1988 and 2003 and more than 50 percent \n     of these bases were located outside of a designated HUBZone. \n     Therefore, Congress intends that, upon the later of the \n     enactment of this act or the date of final closure, existing \n     as well as future military base closure areas be designated \n     as HUBZones for a period of five years in order to \n     reinvigorate the productive capacity of such areas and \n     leverage existing local customers and a skilled workforce. \n     Congress believes that new businesses and new jobs created \n     through the HUBZone small firms mean new life for areas \n     affected by base closure.\n       Additionally, Congress notes the existence of numerous \n     complaints that the current definition of HUBZone qualified \n     areas based on census income data, in conjunction with the \n     definition of HUBZone qualified redesignated areas, fail to \n     provide adequate time to recoup a return on investment. These \n     concerns appear justified. Congress observes that the HUBZone \n     program is relatively young, and the federal government is \n     not even close to meeting its statutory prime contracting \n     goal of 3 percent. Because the HUBZone program was enacted \n     into law in 1997, the initial HUBZone areas were designated \n     on the basis of the 1990 Census. However, the federal \n     government conducted another census in 2000. As a result, \n     many areas were redesignated after only 3 years of the \n     program's existence. The statute currently grandfathers the \n     redesignated areas into the program for 3 years.\n       Congress notes that, at the time of the last redesignation, \n     the small business community received comparatively few \n     benefits from the HUBZone program despite the substantial \n     workforce recruitment, compliance, and business development \n     efforts that must be expended by each of the HUBZone firms. \n     These small businesses, which made business decisions to \n     pursue the HUBZone strategy by locating in a HUBZone, \n     adjusting their ownership structure, and recruiting HUBZone \n     residents are in danger of being penalized for the federal \n     government's slow initial implementation of the HUBZone \n     program. Further, anecdotal evidence indicates that it may \n     take a long time for a new firm to secure a federal contract, \n     and that multiple-order contracts commonly envision task \n     orders over a number of years. In these circumstances, a 3-\n     year grandfather clause would appear not to provide \n     sufficient time for a small business to generate a return on \n     the HUBZone investment. By comparison, companies under the \n     Sec. 8(a) program can maintain such a designation for 9 \n     years, and a general small business designation can be \n     maintained indefinitely. Therefore, Congress imposes a \n     moratorium on HUBZone area redesignations by providing for an \n     extension of the redesignation period until the conclusion of \n     the 2010 Census. No certified HUBZone firm shall be \n     decertified as a result of either the redesignation process \n     based on the 2000 Census data or any revised unemployment \n     data subsequent to December 21, 2000, the date of passage of \n     enactment of the HUBZone in the Native America Act. It is the \n     intent of Congress to have the Small Business Administration \n     reinstate any HUBZone firm previously decertified based on \n     these two criteria.\n       Congress also finds that, concurrently with the moratorium, \n     a study on the effectiveness of the HUBZone area definitions, \n     including the redesignation period, must be conducted by the \n     Office of Advocacy of the United States Small Business \n     Administration. The Office of Advocacy is chosen to conduct \n     this study for its particular expertise in small business \n     procurement, rural small business development, and general \n     small business matters. Congress directs the Office of \n     Advocacy to examine the impact and effectiveness of the \n     HUBZone definitions on small business development and jobs \n     creation, and expect that the Office of Advocacy will \n     periodically consult with congressional small business \n     committees on matters concerning this study. Findings and \n     recommendations of the study must be reported to \n     congressional small business committees by May 1, 2008.\n\n\n                Section 153. Price Evaluation Preference\n\n       With regards to the application of existing HUBZone price \n     preferences to international food aid procurements conducted \n     by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), \n     Congress concludes that the preferences as they currently \n     stand are hindering the goals of U.S. foreign humanitarian \n     food assistance programs. This view is supported by extensive \n     consideration of market data from the Kansas City auction \n     office of the USDA Farm Service Agency, the structure of \n     auction tenders and other auction processes, as well as data \n     supplied by the industry. It appears that there is a risk of \n     various unintended and undesirable consequences to applying \n     the current HUBZone mandate to international food aid \n     acquisitions. In particular, it appears that, in the context \n     of food aid tender auctions, the claimed job gains fostered \n     by the current price preference are offset by job losses in \n     other communities, the non-HUBZone small businesses \n     attempting to compete may experience undue harm, and the \n     competitive supplier base may atrophy. In turn, this may \n     undermine USDA's capacity to secure adequate foodstuffs for \n     malnourished persons and increase the costs to the food aid \n     programs without realizing adequate jobs creation and \n     business development benefits.\n       The HUBZone price preference alternative adopted in this \n     act (a 5 percent price evaluation preference on 20 percent of \n     the contract) would alleviate these potentially damaging \n     effects on the U.S. food aid system. Congress believes that \n     this approach would preserve the HUBZone program's goal of \n     providing HUBZone-eligible companies with a meaningful \n     opportunity to compete while ensuring that the USDA has an \n     adequate capacity of supply from which to draw to deliver \n     emergency food aid in catastrophic situations. This approach \n     would also eliminate the current HUBZone program's \n     application problem which directly penalizes non-HUBZone \n     small businesses due to the nature of the food aid auctions. \n     The potential for job losses in other communities would be \n     limited. Importantly, this approach also reflects the \n     cornerstone of America's efforts to provide food assistance \n     to the world's neediest people through competitive markets.\n       According to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and \n     congressional architects of the Small Business Act, an \n     overarching purpose of small business procurement programs is \n     to assure a vibrant, competitive supplier base for the \n     Federal Government. Price preferences are employed to further \n     this purpose, and should be structured accordingly. Congress \n     notes that, in general, price preferences have been a \n     valuable tool for encouraging a more robust supplier base. \n     Nevertheless, Congress believes that, in these very special \n     circumstances, it is important to encourage competition by \n     keeping multiple vendors actively bidding in our food \n     assistance programs to secure the lowest cost procurement \n     and emergency supply chains in the case of humanitarian \n     crisis. This approach builds on the current small business \n     10 percent set-aside by an additional 20 percent \n     allocation of every tender to small businesses and HUBZone \n     applicants. It guarantees full and open competition, \n     including competition pursuant to the Small Business Act, \n     in food aid procurement tenders to assure that U.S. food \n     aid programs do not suffer consequences inconsistent with \n     the intent of the price preference program. The approach \n     in this legislation safeguards the dual interests of a \n     vibrant small business presence in federal procurements \n     and robust food aid programs.\n\n\n                  Section 154. HUBZone Authorizations\n\n       Congress notes that the Federal Government has failed to \n     meet its statutory HUBZone contracting goals every single \n     year these goals have been in effect. Continuous, dedicated \n     authorization of the HUBZone program is essential to continue \n     the effort to bring economic opportunities to the HUBZone \n     areas. Therefore, Congress extends the current authorization \n     of appropriations of $10,000,000 for the SBA's HUBZone \n     program through Fiscal Year 2006.\n\n\n        Section 155. Participation in Federally Funded Projects\n\n       Section 155 removes the burdensome paperwork requirements \n     for additional certification by firms seeking to perform any \n     State, or political subdivison projects that utilize federal \n     dollars if they are currently certified, or otherwise meet \n     the applicable qualification requirements, for participation \n     in any program under Sec. 8(a) of the Small Business Act.\n       This change will: (1) provide federally certified Sec. 8(a) \n     small businesses with access to all State and local projects \n     funded in whole or in part by the Federal Government; (2) \n     eliminate the burden of requiring Sec. 8(a) small businesses \n     to get certifications from the State or local government or \n     both in addition to their federal certification under \n     Sec. 8(a); and, (3) decrease certification costs and \n     eliminate time delays associated with the burden of receiving \n     additional State or local government certifications for \n     businesses authorized to participate in program established \n     by Sec. 8(a) of the Small Business Act.\n\n\n   Section 161. Supervisory Enforcement Authority for Small Business \n                           Lending Companies\n\n       This section creates a new Sec. 23 of the Small Business \n     Act. It gives the Administrator specific enforcement and \n     supervisory authority over Small Business Lending Companies \n     (SBLCs) and Non-Federally Regulated SBA Lenders as those \n     terms are defined in Sec. 162 of this conference report. The \n     vast majority of lenders authorized to make loans pursuant to \n     the Small Business Act have their lending and other \n     activities overseen and regulated by federal financial \n     regulators, including loans and corporate transactions \n     related to their general lending practices. The Administrator \n     makes no effort at regulating lending institutions except for \n     their authority to make Sec. 7(a) loans.\n       In contradistinction, there are a few institutions that are \n     authorized to make loans pursuant to Sec. 7(a) of the Small \n     Business Act that are not typical lending institutions. SBLCs \n     (except for two which are wholly-owned by national banks) are \n     subsidiaries of industrial corporations and thus not subject \n     to any regulation by financial regulators, other than certain \n     filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n     Non- federally regulated SBA lenders have some state \n     oversight but the extent varies according to state law. \n     The only authority that the Administrator has with respect \n     to these\n\n[[Page S11756]]\n\n     lenders is the ability to prohibit them from making loans \n     pursuant to Sec. 7(a). The Administrator has no authority \n     to take other regulatory action, similar to that available \n     to banking regulators, to protect the public and the \n     federal treasury. Congress concurs with the \n     Administrator's request that greater authority is needed \n     to regulate SBLCs and Non-Federally Regulated SBA Lenders.\n       The basic approach adopted by Congress enables the \n     Administrator to supervise the soundness and safety of \n     institutions authorized to make loans pursuant to Sec. 7(a) \n     but are not otherwise subject to the strict oversight imposed \n     by federal financial regulators. Congress concurs with the \n     Administrator's request that specific enforcement and \n     supervisory authority are needed. These authorities include \n     the power to: issue cease and desist orders, impose civil \n     money penalties, mandate capital standards, and remove \n     officers and directors who are acting in an unsafe and \n     unsound manner. The power and authority tracks closely the \n     powers granted to the Administrator with respect to \n     regulation of SBICs and their officers and employees. In some \n     cases, Congress differentiated regulatory powers applicable \n     to SBLCs and those applicable to Non-Federally Regulated \n     Lenders. Nothing in this section grants the Administrator the \n     authority to be extended to overall corporate management of \n     the parent that owns a SBLC.\n       Congress provides for the Administrator to issue capital \n     directives mandating maintenance of certain capital \n     standards, including the requirement to increase its level of \n     capital. The section also authorizes the Administrator to \n     issue cease and desist orders by the SBLC or Non-Federally \n     Regulated Lender. To ensure that the capital directive is \n     used sparingly and only in appropriate circumstances, the \n     Administrator is required to promulgate regulations on \n     capital directives and may only delegate the authority to the \n     Associate Administrator for Capital Access.\n       The Administrator also is empowered to suspend or remove \n     officials that have management responsibility for the \n     entity's lending pursuant to Sec. 7(a) of the Small Business \n     Act. No authority, explicit or implied, is authorized to \n     remove or suspend officials that do not have management \n     responsibilities with respect to Sec. 7(a) lending. Thus, \n     Congress expects that the Administrator take action not to \n     suspend the Chief Executive Officer of General Electric \n     Corporation but only its SBLC subsidiary.\n       Prior to the issuance of any order under this section \n     except for a capital directive, the Administrator is required \n     to provide any target of the order a hearing pursuant to \n     Sec. Sec. 554, 556, and 557 of the Administrative Procedure \n     Act. The section delegates the responsibility of conducting \n     the hearing to administrative law judges but the final \n     responsibility on determining whether an order should issue \n     rests with the Administrator based on the record developed at \n     the adjudication. The approach is similar to that used by \n     independent federal regulatory agencies such as the Federal \n     Communications Commission or Federal Trade Commission. Those \n     agencies use administrative law judges to conduct hearings \n     and the commissioners use that record as the basis for their \n     legal and policy determination. This bifurcation of the \n     hearing from the decisionmaker ensures that the hearing will \n     be fair and provide an opportunity for the target of an order \n     to make the best possible case before an impartial fact-\n     gathering tribunal.\n       The Administrator is authorized to issue orders prior to a \n     hearing if extraordinary circumstances exist and the order is \n     needed to protect the financial or legal position of the \n     United States. The Administrator only should use the power to \n     issue orders without a hearing only under those circumstances \n     in which an agency issues a rule without notice and comment, \n     i.e., a truly exigent circumstance, see, e.g., NRDC v. Evans, \n     316 F.3d 904, 912 (9th Cir. 2002); Utilities Solid Waste \n     Group v. EPA, 236 F.3d 749, 754 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (good cause \n     to forgo notice and comment applies only in emergency \n     circumstances), or when a federal court would issue an ex \n     parte temporary restraining order (but in order to preserve \n     and protect the federal government rather than the status \n     quo). Cf. Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Brotherhood of \n     Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers, 415 U.S. 423, 439 (1974) \n     (noting that ex parte restraining orders necessary evil to \n     protect status quo). The section then provides that the \n     procedures for holding a hearing, including the notice \n     requirement, be commenced within 2 days after the issuance of \n     the order. Congress believes that this comports with the \n     fundamental fairness exhibited by federal courts when issuing \n     an ex parte temporary restraining order.\n       Congress' approach defines final agency action for purposes \n     of a challenge to the issuance of an order by the \n     Administrator and authorizes that a challenge may be \n     commenced in federal court within 20 days after issuance of a \n     final order. For purposes of fundamental fairness to \n     individuals, Congress also believes that interim relief in \n     federal court is appropriate for a stay of an order issued \n     prior to hearing until the hearing itself is completed. Both \n     of these provisions were added out of an abundance of \n     caution. Although Congress believes that federal court \n     jurisdiction challenging the Administrator's action may \n     constitute a ``federal question'' pursuant to Sec. 1331 of \n     the Title 28, United States Code, Congress determined that \n     explicit authority to challenge the Administrator's orders in \n     federal court removes any question that this decision has \n     been remitted solely to the discretion of the agency and is \n     not subject to review under Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 \n     (1985).\n       This section authorizes a court to appoint a receiver for \n     the entities subject to regulation pursuant to this section. \n     The receiver is entitled to take possession of assets of the \n     SBLC or Non-Federally Regulated SBA Lender. Congress intends \n     this authority to extend only to the SBLC or Non-Federally \n     Regulated Lender's portfolio of loans or other instruments \n     guaranteed by the Administrator including any debentures, \n     participating debt, or securities issued pursuant to the \n     Small Business Investment Act.\n       Congress believes that suspension, revocation, or cease and \n     desist is an extraordinary remedy. Each requires an extremely \n     high burden of proof related to willful misconduct that may \n     present a difficult case for the Administrator to prove. \n     Therefore, the bill also provides the Administrator with the \n     authority to seek court-imposed civil penalties for the \n     failure to file reports required by the Administrator. Such \n     penalties shall issue when the failure to file is willful and \n     not due to neglect. The failure to file required reports for \n     more than two reporting periods is, in the opinion of \n     Congress, sufficient, but not the only evidence of willful \n     neglect. Congress expects the Administrator to promulgate \n     regulations outlining the factors that determine willful \n     neglect for the purposes of civil penalties (as an aid to the \n     entities regulated pursuant to Sec. 23). These regulations \n     also must contain standards for exempting SBLCs and Non-\n     Federally Regulated Lenders from the civil penalty provisions \n     as well as the procedures used for determining whether the \n     institution qualifies.\n\n\n Section 162. Definitions Relating to Small Business Lending Companies\n\n       Almost all of the lenders authorized by the Administrator \n     to issue guaranteed loans pursuant to Sec. 7(a) are lending \n     institutions regulated by a federal financial regulator. \n     However, there are a few institutions that make guaranteed \n     loans that are not subject to federal financial regulatory \n     oversight or regulation by a state banking authority. The \n     Administrator classifies these institutions generically as \n     ``small business lending companies.'' However, that universe \n     actually consists of two separate entities--small business \n     lending companies (not financial institutions) and financial \n     institutions not subject to any agency authorized to review \n     the safety and soundness of depositary institutions. Since \n     Sec. 161 adds a new Sec. 23 granting the Administrator power \n     to regulate these entities, Sec. 162 adds two new subsections \n     to the definitions in the Small Business Act defining small \n     business lending companies and non-federally regulated SBA \n     lenders.\n\n\nSection 201. Amendment to Definition of Equity Capital with Respect to \n                  Issuers of Participating Securities\n\n       Congress determined that changes were needed in the \n     definition of equity capital with respect to any company that \n     issues participating securities. Such companies, \n     participating securities SBICs, commit to invest an amount \n     equal to the outstanding face value of participating \n     securities solely in equity capital. Equity capital refers to \n     common or preferred stock or a similar instrument, including \n     subordinated debt with equity features. Equity capital issued \n     by participating securities SBICs previously provided for \n     interest payments to be made to the Administration contingent \n     upon--and limited to--the extent of earnings on equity \n     capital. However, since the inception of the Participating \n     Security SBIC program, the majority of SBICs have not \n     realized sufficient profits with which to meet their \n     financial obligations to the federal government. This has \n     resulted in serious financial loss for the federal \n     government. In order to mitigate these losses, the definition \n     of equity capital has changed so that participating security \n     SBICs do not have to realize profits on their investments in \n     order to make payments to the Administration. If a \n     participating security SBIC is experiencing overall losses on \n     their investments but has other sources of funds such as \n     invested excess funds, royalty payments, licensing fees and \n     the like, Congress intends that these funds may be used to \n     meet their obligations to the Administration.\n\n\n                Section 202. Investment of Excess Funds\n\n       This section provides SBICs with additional flexibility for \n     handling funds prior to investments in small businesses by \n     allowing SBICs to invest such funds in additional types of \n     securities. Currently, SBICs holding cash, prior to investing \n     in a small business, are only permitted to invest directly in \n     obligations of the United States, obligations guaranteed by \n     the United States, or in certificates of deposit maturing \n     within one year or savings accounts that are in institutions \n     insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the \n     Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. This section \n     modifies the current restriction by permitting SBICs to \n     invest in securities, mutual funds, or instruments, which \n     themselves invest solely in the obligations that are \n     currently permitted. For instance, Congress expects that \n     SBICs will be able to invest in mutual funds that, in turn, \n     invest in the government-backed obligations already \n     authorized for investment in SBICs. Congress believes that \n     this modification will provide SBICs with greater flexibility \n     and a wider range of short-term investment options.\n\n\n                  Section 203. Surety Bond Amendments\n\n       Section 203(a) clarifies that the current $2 million limit \n     on surety bonds applies to the\n\n[[Page S11757]]\n\n     bond guarantee and not the contract size. Congress adopted \n     this clarification to prohibit contracting officers from \n     determining that small businesses would not qualify for an \n     Administration-backed surety bond for a contract worth less \n     than $2 million even though it was part of a bundle of \n     contracts that exceeded $2 million. For example, a small \n     business might be denied a surety bond if the small business \n     had a contract for $1.5 million, but that contract was part \n     of a $12 million bundle of contracts that had been awarded \n     simultaneously.\n       Section 203(b) requires that an audit of each participating \n     surety shall occur every three years instead of annually. \n     This reduction in the frequency of audits will save \n     participating sureties time and money and allow them to \n     allocate these resources to more productive uses. In \n     addition, this will enable the Administrator to focus on more \n     critical elements since the sureties already provide reports \n     on a periodic basis that would identify problems during the \n     interregnum between audits.\n       Currently certain sureties designated by the Administrator \n     may issue, monitor, and service surety bonds issued pursuant \n     to Title IV of the Small Business Investment Act. This \n     authority ceased to be operative on September 30, 2003 (but \n     has been extended for short periods of time on a temporary \n     basis). Congress determined that the authority for this \n     program should be made permanent. Section 203(b) makes that \n     change by repealing Sec. 207 of the Small Business \n     Reauthorization and Amendment Act of 1988.\n\n\n              Section 204. Effective Date of Certain Fees\n\n       Loans made pursuant to Title V of the Small Business \n     Investment Act do not require any appropriation. Fees charged \n     to borrowers and CDCs absorb the costs associated with the \n     issuance of such loans. When the zero-subsidy for the program \n     was instituted, Congress made the fee authority temporary to \n     see whether the program could survive without an \n     appropriation. The program has succeeded admirably and \n     Congress does not expect that an appropriation to fund loans \n     made by CDCs will be made for the foreseeable future. As a \n     result, Congress determined it was pointless to continue, as \n     temporary, the Administrator's authority to charge fees for \n     loans made pursuant to Title V of the Small Business \n     Investment Act. Section 204 grants the Administrator \n     permanent authority to charge fees.\n\n  Mr. President, I oppose language that has been included in the fiscal \nyear 2005 Omnibus Appropriations that was authored by U.S. \nRepresentative Dave Weldon the so-called Abortion Non-Discrimination \nAct amendment. This language will have a chilling effect on women's \naccess to legal reproductive health services.\n  The Weldon language would allow a broad range of health-care entities \nto refuse to comply with existing Federal, State, and local laws and \nregulations pertaining to abortion services. This harmful language will \nseverely limit patients' rights and access to services and information, \nthereby impeding their ability to make informed decisions about their \nhealth care options.\n  I join my colleagues in supporting a conscience clause that would \nallow doctors to opt-out from providing abortion services due to their \nmoral or religious beliefs. That's why I worked with former Senator Dan \nCoats in 1996 to construct a conscience clause that is in law today \nthat ensures medical students and medical teaching institutions have \nthe ability to refuse to participate in abortion training if it is \nagainst their personal beliefs, while ensuring that women would have \naccess to the highest quality medical care.\n  But this is not what the language in the Weldon amendment does. The \nAbortion Non-Discrimination Act is instead a sweeping new exemption \nfrom current laws and regulations pertaining to abortion services. Far \nfrom constituting a ``conscience clause,'' as the sponsors claim, the \nlanguage that is included in the Omnibus is an overly broad opt-out \nfrom compliance of state or local laws ensuring access to abortion \nservices which could have the consequence of limiting the availability \nof safe and legal health care.\n  This language would change existing law to say that Federal, State, \nor local governments may not require a health-care entity--broadly \ndefined to include insurance companies, hospitals, and HMOs, among \nothers--to perform, provide coverage of, pay, or even, most shockingly, \nrefer for abortion services. Any law or regulation that did so would be \nconsidered ``discrimination'' against the health-care entity, in the \nwords of the bill, and the requirement could not be enforced. What's \nmore, the State or local entity that tried to enforce that law, would \nlose all funding under this bill.\n  Further, this language ignores the fact that more than 40 states \nalready have conscience clauses that are in law today that allow \nindividuals--and in many states larger health entities--to opt out of \nproviding abortion services. In doing so, the authors of this provision \nundermine what in many cases were hard fought and carefully crafted \nconscience clauses instituted by our State and local governments.\n  Instead of accepting the language included in the bill before us, the \nSenate must have the opportunity to work, as Senator Coats and I did in \n1996, to devise a compromise that would result in a conscience clause \nthat allows for conscientious objection without impairing the provision \nof health care in America.\n  I am opposed to the inclusion of this language in the omnibus. This \nlanguage will have a detrimental effect on women's health, it will \noverride a state's or a locality's ability to require access to these \nservices, and it will prevent women from exercising their right to \ndecide what health care services they want to seek and limit their \nability to access information about such services.\n  Senator Boxer has received a commitment to revisit this issue with \nconsideration of legislation that would repeal this language before \nMarch 1, 2005. I join my colleagues in supporting a conscience clause \nbut I object to the language included in this bill and the process that \nhas brought us to this point today.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I oppose the passage of the Omnibus \nappropriations conference report.\n  The bill before us was written in a process that is the legislative \nequivalent of painting a room in the dark. You don't know exactly how \nthe room will look until you turn on the lights, but you can be sure \nthat it will be a mess. And, of course, that is what has happened. This \nbill is a mess.\n  The Republican leadership has taken nine spending bills, funding 13 \nGovernment agencies with more than $388 billion, and combined them into \na single bill that is more than 3,000 pages long. On top of all that \nspending, they have included several riders that make unrelated changes \nin Federal law. Most of these bills were never debated or amended by \nthe full Senate. Many of the provisions haven't even had a committee \nhearing. The only people who have had a chance to review and amend the \nbill are the Republican leadership and the White House, and all of that \nwent on behind closed doors. And the public, the press and almost every \nMember of Congress has had no real opportunity to review them before we \nvote and send them to the President to become law.\n  So it comes as no surprise that this massive spending bill, created \nby a terribly flawed process, is itself terribly flawed.\n  The Republican majority and the Bush administration have provided \ninadequate investments in education, housing, small business and a \nnumber of other important domestic priorities.\n  The Community Oriented Policing Systems program, called the COPS \nprogram, has been eviscerated, and funding for the Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grant program has been cut. Both of these programs \nhelp our cities and towns fight crime and protect our citizens but \nputting well-trained and well-equipped cops on the street. And both \nprograms had played an increasingly important role in homeland \nsecurity.\n  The bill does not keep our promise to care for our veterans. The \nfunding level included in the conference report for veteran's \nhealthcare, while above last year's level, is insufficient to meet the \nneeds of our veterans. Today, 500,000 veterans are prevented from \nreceiving health care through the Veterans Administration. New veterans \nare fighting to obtain the services they have earned. Thousands more \nare waiting for disability ratings. The Congress had an opportunity to \nmake a real difference in the lives of those who have given so much for \nthis country, and the Congress failed.\n  The bill harms small businesses by failing to provide access to the \ncapital they need for investment and growth. As the ranking member of \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I know how \ncritical small business loans are to expanding economic opportunity, \nespecially in low-income neighborhoods. Unfortunately, the bill \neliminates all funding\n\n[[Page S11758]]\n\nand increases fees for the program at the Small Business Administration \nthat is the largest source of small business loans in the Nation.\n  I will not try to list all the worthwhile programs that have been cut \nor eliminated, because the list is just too long. The point is simple: \ndozens of Federal investments that help our cities and towns, our \nschools, our small businesses, our police, our environment and much \nmore have been needlessly cut. And those cuts will do needless harm to \ncommunities and families all across the country.\n  And along with the spending provisions of the bill, the White House \nand the Republican leadership have attached riders that make changes in \nFederal law. These are provisions that have not been considered by the \nHouse or Senate, and in many cases have not received a committee \nhearing or markup.\n  The bill includes a provision that will prevent Federal, State and \nlocal governments from requiring any institutional or individual health \ncare provider to provide, pay for, or refer for abortion services. Ten \nof my female colleagues, including two Republicans, have expressed \ntheir strong opposition to that provision and affect it may have on \nreproductive health services. In a letter to the Appropriations \nCommittee, they point out that the provision has never been considered \nand never had a hearing in the Senate. It comes down to this: whether \nyou support or oppose this provision, and I oppose it, this is no way \nto do the people's work. Whatever you think of this provision, it does \nnot belong in a 3,000 page spending bill. It deserves a hearing, a \ndebate and vote.\n  Another provision that was included with no vote, hearing or \ndiscussion by the Senate would allow congressional staff access to the \ntax returns of individuals and businesses. There is absolutely no \njustification for such a provision in this bill or anywhere else. It is \na shocking abuse of power by the Republicans. This provision, which \nwould allow congressional staff to review any private citizen's tax \nreturn, is unacceptable. It tramples the rights of our citizens and \ngrossly violates the public trust. I am pleased to hear the assurances \nof the majority leader that this provision will be removed from the \nbill. However, we need to understand how it came to be included in the \nconference report. Who in the Congress sponsored this provision? Who in \nthe White House approved it, since we know the White House has blessed \nthis bill?\n  Is there any good in this bill? Of course there are many worthwhile \nFederal programs that are funded. Like a broken clock is right twice a \nday, a bill spending $388 billion will get a few things right.\n  I am pleased that the conference report includes $62 million for the \nYouthBuild program, which is a highly effective comprehensive program \nthat helps at-risk youth obtain an education and take responsibility \nfor their lives and their communities. YouthBuild is the only national \nprogram that provides young adults an immediately productive role in \nthe community while also providing equal measures of basic education \ntoward a diploma, skills training toward a decent paying job, \nleadership development toward civic engagement, adult mentorship toward \novercoming personal problems, and participation in a supportive mini-\ncommunity with a positive set of values.\n  And there are other good programs this bill has funded adequately. I \nam grateful for the good that will come from this legislation, \nincluding funding for Federal projects and programs in Massachusetts.\n  On a whole, the bad outweighs the good in this bill, and I will vote \nagainst it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is difficult to vote against this \nomnibus appropriations bill because it provides funding for many \nprograms that I support. In fact, it contains many provisions that I \nworked to have included.\n  However, we are confronted with this legislation containing funding \nfor fiscal year 2005 which under normal circumstances would have been \ncontained in nine separate appropriations bills and which should have \nbeen done prior to the beginning of this fiscal year last October 1. \nOnce again, for the third consecutive year, and all too frequently in \nrecent years, the Senate finds itself considering a massive \nappropriations bill, in this case totaling about 3,000 pages and \nspending nearly $400 billion, and containing important legislation \nwhich doesn't belong in an appropriations bill at all. We have had only \na matter of hours to read and consider this bill.\n  This is a process which reflects poorly on the Congress both because \nit represents a failure to get the Nation's work done on time, and \nbecause of its huge size and the inclusion of matters which were not \npreviously considered in the Senate hinders the kind of careful \nconsideration and debate which wise decisionmaking demands. It is \ncertain that Senators will only learn after the fact details about many \nprovisions which have been added.\n  And perhaps most importantly, because these omnibus bills are delayed \nuntil the waning hours of each Congress, the White House is included in \nthe meetings as the language is written, in order to avoid a \nPresidential veto. This weakens the constitutional prerogative of the \nlegislative branch to control the Nation's purse strings and it \nundermines the critical oversight role which the Congress plays, in \npart, through its appropriations activities when they are conducted in \nthe normal manner.\n  One example of the consequences of this hurried and extraordinary \nprocess is a provision in the bill late yesterday by our Republican \ncolleagues that provides the chairman of the House or Senate \nAppropriations Committee or his or her staff access the tax returns and \nother tax return information of any corporation or individual. Further, \nit would exempt the chairman or staffer gaining access to these returns \nfrom any provision of law governing the disclosure of income tax \nreturns. The House did not debate that provision. The Senate did not \ndebate that provision. However, somehow it ended up in this bill. This \nis an outrage. The Senate passed a resolution earlier tonight in an \neffort to eventually remove this provision from law, however if this \nbill is adopted, this provision violating the privacy of income tax \nreturns will become law and we will have to hope that the House of \nRepresentatives will follow through and the President will sign the \nresolution to remedy the situation.\n  For every egregious provision like the one above that we find, there \ncould be several more that were missed.\n  I am also concerned about the failure of this bill to adequately fund \nvital education initiatives. The bill before us underfunds title I by \n$500 million below the President's budget request; this critical \nprogram provides aid to states and school districts to help \neducationally disadvantaged children achieve the same high academic \nperformance standards as other students. The bill before us also \nunderfunds the important Individual with Disabilities Education Act by \n$415 million and it underfunds the National Science Foundation at $62 \nmillion below the fiscal year 2004 funding level and $278 million below \nthe budget request. Additionally, this legislation does not provide for \nan increase in the maximum Pell Grant award--the very foundation of aid \nfor many needy students. It remains at the current level of $4,050, \nrather than increasing toward the authorized maximum award level of \n$5,800.\n  This bill also cuts funding for local law enforcement programs that \ncould compromise the safety of communities around the country. Not only \nare our police on the beat essential for maintaining community safety, \nbut they are the first line of defense against potential terrorist \nattacks. This bill cuts funding for the Community Oriented Policing \nServices, COPS, program by over $140 million from last year's funding \nlevel. This program provides vital funding to our first responders and \nI cannot support such a drastic cut in funding.\n\n  Throughout Michigan and the rest of the country, our cities are \nstruggling to finance urgent upgrades to municipal sewer systems to \nprevent discharges to the environment or private property. These \ncommunities have very high water and sewer rates and cannot handle \nadditional debt. The State Revolving Loan Fund, which has received \n$1.35 billion per year from Congress in the past several fiscal years, \nhas helped to clean up polluted waters, however more money is needed to \nhelp communities such as ours in Michigan with\n\n[[Page S11759]]\n\nsignificant needs. This bill does the opposite; it cuts funding for the \nState Revolving Loan Fund which will harm our ability to clean up our \nwaters and upgrade our aging sewer systems.\n  This bill deletes a provision contained in both the House and Senate \nLabor-HHS appropriations bills that would have prohibited enforcement \nof the administration's overtime regulation that went into effect in \nAugust 2004.\n  I am also disappointed that this bill provides less funding for the \nIRS than the administration requested. This legislation provides $400 \nmillion less than the President requested. This overall dollar figure \nreflects $166 million less than requested for tax enforcement, which is \na non-sensical and irresponsible decision. Tax enforcement is an \nunusual area of the budget where a relatively small increase pays for \nitself many times over by increasing the amount of revenue collected. \nJust days ago the IRS announced that its fiscal year 2004 enforcement \nrevenue of $43 billion represented a roughly four-to-one return rate on \nits overall budget of $10.2 billion, a return that is even greater when \nonly enforcement funding is taken into account. And this return on \ninvestment doesn't even take into account the fact that vigorous \nenforcement also has a word-of-mouth effect that goes beyond the direct \nrevenue generated. Unfortunately, this conference report does not give \nthe IRS nearly the resources it needs to ensure this vigorous \nenforcement, so we will continue to leave honest taxpayers shouldering \nan unfair share of the burden while many tax dodgers escape scot free. \nWhen only one in five known tax cheats is even chased by the IRS, and \nwhen fewer than 1 percent of the estimated 1 to 2 million individuals \ndodging taxes by using offshore bank accounts have pending IRS \nenforcement actions, there is obviously a lot more the IRS could be \ndoing to improve enforcement.\n  Mr. President, while this bill funds many programs that I support, on \nbalance I cannot support this legislation. For the reasons I have \nmentioned, and others, I will vote against this Omnibus bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will vote against the omnibus \nappropriations conference report. The bill before the Senate contains 9 \nappropriations bills, 7 of which were never debated, amended, or voted \nupon by the Senate. The bill spends $388 billion, and, together with \nits explanatory language, it is 3,646 pages long.\n  Throughout the day today, I and several members of my staff have been \nreading and analyzing the provisions of this bill. During the \nexamination, we discovered a particularly egregious provision. It would \nhave allowed an agent of the chairman of the House or Senate \nAppropriations Committee to look at the tax return of anyone in \nAmerica. And, further, it would have allowed them to release the \nprivate information contained in those returns without any civil or \ncriminal penalty. That would have created the opportunity for an abuse \nof power almost unprecedented in our history.\n  Thankfully, my staff and I were able to catch this, and after \nstrenuous debate, the provision will be nullified. But this is an \nindication of how completely flawed this process has become. None of us \ncan know what other inappropriate provisions are in this bill. There \nsimply has not been enough time to thoroughly scour the more than 3,600 \npages in this bill.\n  There are a number of provisions in this bill that are good for North \nDakota that I worked hard to have included, but it is clear to me this \nappropriations process is broken. Former President Ronald Reagan in his \n1988 State of the Union Address told us we should not do business this \nway. He was right.\n  For that reason, I am obligated to oppose this conference report.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is the toughest VA/HUD bill we have \never faced.\n  In putting this bill together, we were told by the Republican \nleadership that we had to do two things. First, we had to fund veterans \nmedical care $1.2 billion above the President's budget request. Second, \nwe had to fund NASA at the President's budget request of $16.2 billion. \nIn addition, we had to provide enough money to renew Section 8 housing \nvouchers. Even though this was not a priority for the President, it was \na priority for us.\n  I agree with these priorities. I have fought for these priorities. \nBut in order to fund these priorities, we had to cut $3 billion from \nother programs. This is a shell game.\n  The Republican leadership gave us an allocation for conference that \nis $3 billion less than we had for our Senate bill. With the exception \nof VA medical care, Section 8 and NASA, we had to cut all other \nprograms an average of 4 percent below last year.\n  For the first time in history, we had to cut essential programs to \npay for these priorities. These are real cuts to programs that help \npeople and communities. This is the illusion of being compassionate. We \nwere forced to do this because of the budget caps that we are forced to \nlive under by the Republican leadership.\n  These spending caps put a stranglehold on essential programs. The \nRepublican leadership created this situation and unfortunately, the \nAmerican people will pay the price.\n  Our No. 1 priority has always been our veterans. Senator Bond and I \nwill always make veterans the number one priority in this bill. We have \nincreased veterans medical care by $1.5 billion over last year, and \n$1.2 billion more than the President requested in his budget. We \neliminated the President's proposal to increase deductibles and co-pays \nfor veterans. It is wrong to ask veterans to pay more for their medical \ncare, especially when we are fighting a war. We created a new \nprosthetics and holistic care program to find new ways to treat and \ncare for veterans, especially for our veterans returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  For this reason alone, we had to produce a bill, even under these \ncircumstances. If we didn't produce a bill this year, we would not have \nenough money to care for our veterans, particularly our veterans \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We have increased funding for NASA to help fund the repairs to the \nSpace Shuttle so we can return to flight next year and fix the Hubble \nSpace Telescope.\n  Returning the Shuttle safely to flight is our top NASA priority. We \nare fully committed to implementing the recommendations of the Gehman \nCommission, and we have given NASA sufficient funding to accomplish \nthis goal. We have provided the full budget request, $4.3 billion, to \nfund the Space Shuttle and we have provided NASA with unprecedented \nflexibility to add more funds for the Space Shuttle, if they need it.\n  We added $300 million to NASA's budget to fund a servicing mission to \nthe Hubble Space Telescope, the most successful scientific instrument \nsince Galileo's telescope. I have fought to save Hubble and I am proud \nthat my colleagues have joined me in this fight by providing an \nadditional $300 million to fund a servicing mission in 2007.\n  We also made a down payment on the President's Exploration Initiative \nso we can begin a new era in space exploration and we protected NASA's \ncritical science programs such as Living With A Star and Earth science \napplications to help us better understand the Earth's environment.\n  For National Service, the overall budget was cut by over $3 million \ncompared to last year but we were able to fund AmeriCorps at a level \nthat supports 70,000 new volunteers, despite the cut in funding. This \nwill allow us to maintain the momentum we started last year.\n  However, these increases come at a price. To provide these needed \nincreases for veterans and NASA, we had to cut essential programs, \n``including housing programs. Senator Bond and I have a responsibility \nto fund the renewals of Section 8 vouchers. We added funding for \nSection 8 renewals, but we had to cut other programs to pay for it.\n  We were forced to cut housing for the elderly by $26 million. Housing \nfor the disabled is cut by $10 million. The Community Development Block \nGrant Program, one of our most popular programs in this bill, and one \nof the most important programs for State and local governments, is cut \nby $200 million compared to last year. We should not have to be forced \nto shift funding from one essential program to another.\n  For EPA, we were forced to make cuts because of the budget cuts \nimposed on us by the Republican leadership. The clean water State \nrevolving\n\n[[Page S11760]]\n\nfund was cut by $250 million compared to last year. That means every \nState will get less money for sewer construction.\n  EPA's successful science and technology programs--the programs \nlooking at innovative and cost effective solutions for environmental \nprotection--are cut by $40 million compared to last year. Overall, EPA \nis cut by over $300 million compared to last year.\n  Thanks to the Republican budget cuts, we are shifting the burden of \nenvironmental protection to State and local governments. I am opposed \nto this and fought it every step of the way.\n  For NSF, Senator Bond and I have fought to incease funding for \nscience and technology by fighting to double NSF's budget over 5 years. \nYet, the budget cuts imposed on us forced us to cut $60 million from \nNSF's budget compared to last year.\n  Fortunately, we were able to increase funding for our historically \nblack colleges and universities and maintain graduate stipends at \n$30,000 per year--two of my top priorities.\n  But we will not be able to maintain our leadership in science and \ntechnology if we are forced to cut NSF funding. We will not be able to \nproduce the new technologies that lead to the new jobs if we have to \ncut basic research funding. This is not a sound policy.\n  Senator Bond and I have done the best we could do under the \ncircumstances. We had no choice but to produce a bill. A CR would have \nbeen worse for our veterans and we could not let that happen. We have \nsoldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Without an increase in VA \nmedical care, we would not be able to care for them once they return \nand enter the VA system.\n  Senator Bond and I would never let that happen, but it is wrong to \nhave to cut other important programs to pay for it. I hope that we will \nnot face this situation next year.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I voted to approve the Conference \nReport to Accompany H.R. 4818, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of \nFiscal Year 2005. As many of my colleagues in both the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives have discussed at length today, this bill \ncontains a provision, Section 222, which could be interpreted in a way \nas to cause concern regarding the protection of the privacy of I.R.S. \ndata of U.S. taxpayers. As a Member of the Senate, and particularly as \na member of the Senate Finance Committee, I take the American \ntaxpayers' rights to privacy regarding their personal income tax \ninformation very seriously. I supported a joint resolution, passed \nearlier today by the Senate, which calls for the removal of this \nprovision from this conference report. In addition, I understand that \nthe chairmen of the House Appropriations, Senate Appropriations, House \nWays and Means and Senate Finance Committees have made clear their \nintentions to insure that this provision is deleted or otherwise \nremoved at the earliest possible opportunity. I also understand that \nthe President of the United States is expected to issue a statement \nindicating that this provision of the conference report shall be \ndisregarded. It is with reliance upon these commitments, and with my \nintentions to follow this issue closely to insure that this situation \nis corrected at the earliest possible opportunity, that I cast my vote \nin support of this conference report today.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the House and Senate are \nconsidering whether to approve the conference report to H.R. 4818. H.R. \n4818 is what is commonly called in the Congress an omnibus \nappropriations bill. Basically, an omnibus bill rolls a number of other \nbills into a single legislative vehicle for an up-or-down vote on the \nfinal package. It is a method frequently used by the Appropriations \nCommittee at the end of the legislative session after the committee has \nfailed to complete its work in regular order. It enables the \nAppropriations Committee to appropriate funds at the end of the year. \nWithout this appropriation, the Government would shut down. So, it is \nmust pass legislation.\n  Work on this bill was completed last night around midnight. Since \nthat time, my Finance Committee staff has been scouring the package to \ndetermine whether there are any provisions within the jurisdiction of \nthe Finance Committee in the bill. Unfortunately, the Appropriations \nCommittee often includes authorizing language on matters within the \njurisdiction of my committee, but fails to notify us. The result is \nusually poorly drafted and short-sighted provisions, many of which have \nunintended effects. Unfortunately, this year is no different.\n  Let's just take one area--international trade. A few years ago, the \nAppropriations Committee included an amendment which required that \nmonies collected as countervailing duties and antidumping duties be \ndistributed to the petitioners who filed the underlying cases. Many of \nour trading partners thought this provision violated our international \nobligations because it enables petitioning industries to not only have \nduties placed against competing imports, but to also receive these \nduties. The World Trade Organization agreed and found the amendment to \nbe contrary to our trade obligations. Nevertheless, the law is still on \nthe books. As a result, many of our export industries may face \nretaliatory sanctions.\n  As I said, this amendment was slipped into an appropriations \nconference report without full debate in the Senate. The Finance \nCommittee, as the committee of jurisdiction and the committee with \nexpertise in international trade, never had a chance to review the \namendment. Now, I'm not surprised that a bill that was never considered \nby the committee of expertise or even the full Senate was found to \nviolate our international commitments.\n  But, even aside from the WTO ruling, there are a number of other \nproblems with the way the amendment operates. For example, earlier this \nyear the Congressional Budget Office issued a report in which it found \nthat, regardless of the economic harm which can be caused by \nretaliation, the amendment is detrimental to the overall economic \nwelfare of the United States. An earlier report issued by the \nDepartment of Treasury Inspector General found that the Bureau of \nCustoms and Border Protection made $25 million in overpayments when \ndisbursing funds. The report also faulted the Bureau of Customs and \nBorder Protection because qualifying expenditures claimed by domestic \nproducers are not verified on a routine basis. So, there are a lot of \nproblems with the way this program functions that are totally \nindependent from our WTO obligations.\n  But because the Finance Committee never had an opportunity to review \nthe amendment, these problems were never addressed. Instead of working \nwith the Committee to address these problems, they took a different \ntack. In this year's omnibus appropriations bill they decided to \nrequire our United States Trade Representative and the Department of \nCommerce to negotiate the right for WTO members to distribute monies \ncollected from antidumping and countervailing duty measures. In short, \nthey are directing our trade negotiators to go back to the negotiating \ntable and try to negotiate for something which we have already lost. I \ndoubt our trading partners will be sympathetic.\n  The Appropriations Committee also required the Office of the United \nStates Trade Representative to create a new position of Chief \nNegotiator for Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement. Now, this may \nbe good idea--but, again the Finance Committee has not had an \nopportunity to review this provision so we do not know if this is an \nappropriate use of government resources or not. We do know that the \ndecision about whether to create new trade negotiating positions is up \nto the Finance Committee, not the Appropriations Committee.\n  Unfortunately Mr. President, these provisions are just exemplary. \nThere are many other provisions in the bill dealing with international \ntrade that, frankly, should not be in there. Whatever position you may \ntake on the merits of these provisions, international trade \nnegotiations and antidumping and countervailing duty laws are plainly \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Finance. The vast \ntrade implications of these provisions were not carefully weighed by \nthe Committee on Finance. This is bad precedent--and I sincerely hope \nwe will not see similar actions in the future.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Omnibus \nappropriations bill. I think the American\n\n[[Page S11761]]\n\npeople would be appalled by the process under which the Senate is \nconsidering this bill. Provisions have been added that have never been \ndebated, never had a hearing, and never had a vote in the Senate. It is \nthousands of pages long, and yet the Senate has had only a few hours to \nread the bill. We are just beginning to learn about all of the \nprovisions that have been added.\n  Already, we have learned about an outrageous provision that would \nallow for a complete reversal of longstanding privacy protections. The \nbill contains a provision that allows Appropriations Committee \nchairman, or their designees, to review the tax returns of any American \ncitizen. Any individual, any corporation could have their very private \ninformation poured over by any number of people. Not only would the \nprivate, sensitive tax information be available to the Chairmen and \ntheir staffs--they would be able to distribute that information without \nincurring any penalties. This egregious ``oversight'' is inexcusable. \nThat a provision with this impact, on both privacy rules and on powers \nof the Senate, would be slipped in at the midnight hour with no \noversight, is an offense to every Member of the Senate and most \nimportantly, to the American people.\n  While I am relieved that promises have been made to remove this \negregious provision, this is just an example of the danger that comes \nwith rushing a bill like this through the Senate. This is simply \nindefensible. The American people deserve a more serious effort, and I \ncannot support a bill that has been rushed through in this manner.\n  I am also troubled by much of what we already know about this bill. \nThis bill demonstrates that the budget deficit our Nation is facing \ntoday is causing real cuts in important programs and real pain for \nworking families. These tight budget numbers are the consequence of a \nfiscal policy that puts reckless and expensive tax cuts for the \nwealthiest in our country above all other priorities. That policy has \nleft us with huge deficits and the inability to fully fund some of our \nNation's most pressing needs--needs like education, health care, law \nenforcement and housing. Clearly, we need to take another look at our \nNation's fiscal policy and finally put together a budget plan that meet \nthe needs of American families.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill before us simply falls short on too \nmany of our priorities. I recognize that it includes a $500 million \nincrease for the title I education program for disadvantaged students \nand a $607 million increase for special education. I am grateful that \nincreases were provided during these difficult times but let's not \nforget that even with these increases, funding for No Child Left Behind \nis still far below the levels authorized when the law passed. We are \nstill not coming anywhere close to our commitment to fund 40 percent of \nthe costs of special education. And once again, the maximum Pell Grant \naward has been frozen leaving more students with higher student loan \ndebts or shut out of higher education altogether. These are just a few \nexamples. I believe we should be able to do better when it comes to our \nNation's students and schools.\n  In addition, I am very disappointed with the practical elimination of \nthe COPS Universal Hiring program. The Omnibus appropriations bill \nallocates a paltry $10 million for this nationwide program--a program \nthat has added tens of thousands of police officers to police \ndepartments across the country. Not surprisingly, the COPS program has \nbeen overwhelmingly popular among our local police departments in \nWisconsin and beyond. Moreover, crime has been steadily decreasing in \nthe past decade thanks in part to the COPS program. A mere $10 million \nis not enough for a program that received more than $300 million just a \nfew years ago. Quite simply, this appropriations bill demonstrates an \ninsensitivity to the needs of our police officers who are also the \nfirst line of defense in the war on terror.\n  This Omnibus bill also contains inadequate support for energy saving \nresearch. One of the programs that I was disappointed did not receive \nsufficient funding in this bill was the Department of Energy's \nIndustrial Technologies program. This program is an important effort to \ninvest in our manufacturing base by increasing energy efficiency. This \nprogram invests in research to improve industrial energy efficiency and \nenvironmental performance in eight basic, energy intensive industries \nnamed by DoE as Industries of the Future: aluminum, chemicals, forest \nproducts, glass, metal casting, mining, petroleum and steel.\n  An example of such a program in Wisconsin that is applicable to all \neight DOE Industries of the Future in Wisconsin is the project \n``Wireless Sensor Network for Advanced Energy Management Solutions'' \nwhich applies advanced communications and sensors technology to \nindustrial motors. The projected benefits from this program in 2020 \ninclude energy savings of 279 trillion Btus, $1.3 billion and 116 \nmillion pounds of pollutant reduction.\n  It is my hope that DOE reconsider this very important technology \ndevelopment and that the Interior Appropriations subcommittee focus \nnext year on this program because of the impact it will have on our \nmanufacturing capabilities in the United States.\n  I am also very concerned about the across-the-board cut that is \nincluded in this bill. The bill includes a cut of 0.83 percent that \nwill apply to every program. That means the increases some programs \nreceived will be scaled back, and those programs that received flat \nfunding will actually get a cut from last year's levels after the \nacross-the-board reduction goes into effect.\n  I am particularly disappointed that this bill fails to address one \ncritical area that is very important to me regarding dairy. As I have \nstated many times before on the floor of the Senate, dairy is an \nextremely important part of the economy of the Upper Midwest. For \nWisconsin alone, employment associated with dairy farming, processing \nand related activities is estimated to be about 160,000, generating \nroughly $5 billion in income annually.\n  During the 2002 farm bill, a new dairy program was created, called \nthe Milk Income Loss Contract, MILC, program, to provide \ncountercyclical assistance to all dairy farmers in the nation, whenever \nmarket prices for milk fall below certain trigger levels. The program \nprovides assistance in the form of direct payments to producers, up to \nthe first 2.4 million pounds of production annually, when market prices \nare low. While the MILC program uses the market as a reference price to \ntrigger assistance, it does not directly intervene into the market.\n  In 2002 and the first half of 2003, dairy prices reached 25-year \nlows. During that time, the MILC program provided dairy producers with \nmuch needed assistance. Wisconsin dairy producers have received $413 \nmillion in assistance under the program to date.\n  Without a doubt, dairy producers prefer to receive their income from \nthe marketplace. Fortunately, milk prices have recovered over the last \nyear, and as a result, the MILC program is now dormant. However, the \nsafety net provided by the MILC program has been extremely helpful, \nparticularly during times of low market prices. Unfortunately, the MILC \nprogram is scheduled to expire in September of 2005, 2 years earlier \nthan the rest of the farm bill commodity programs.\n  Recognizing this problem, a bipartisan, multiregional coalition of \nSenators sought to remedy the situation during this year's \nappropriations process by extending the MILC program for 2 more years. \nSuch an extension would put the MILC program on equal footing with \nother farm bill commodity programs.\n  On October 7, the President of the United States personally entered \nthe debate on MILC extension. He traveled to Wisconsin to voice his \nsupport for the MILC program and before a group of Wisconsin dairy \nfamilies stated:\n\n       I know that the Milk Income Lost Contract Program is \n     important to the dairy farmers here in Wisconsin. The milk \n     program is set to expire next fall. I look forward to working \n     with Congress to reauthorize the program so Wisconsin dairy \n     farmers and dairy farmers all across this country can count \n     on the support they need.\n\n  Our effort to extend the MILC program was also endorsed by a \nbipartisan, multiregional group of Governors. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Governors' letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11762]]\n\n\n                                                    Nov. 12, 2004.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chair, Senate Appropriations Committee,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Committee,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Young,\n     Chair, House Appropriations Committee,\n     Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. David Obey,\n     Ranking Member, House Appropriations Committee,\n     Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Stevens and Byrd; Representatives Young and \n     Obey: We are writing today to urge you to support a two-year \n     extension of the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program, as \n     was recently passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee by \n     a vote of 18 to five.\n       The MILC program, created by the 2002 farm bill, has been \n     extremely helpful to dairy producers nationwide, by providing \n     financial assistance when milk prices fall below certain \n     target prices. The program has helped to stem the tide of \n     dairy farm loss in our states, especially when milk prices \n     fell to historic lows in 2002 and the first half of 2003.\n       Without question, dairy producers in our states prefer to \n     receive their income from the market. As designed, the MILC \n     program is dormant when market prices are strong, as they \n     have been during most of 2004. When milk prices fall, \n     however, the MILC program provides an effective safety net \n     for the dairy-dependent communities in our states.\n       Unfortunately, the MILC program is scheduled to expire on \n     September 30, 2005, two years earlier than the other farm \n     bill programs, The bipartisan Senate provision would extend \n     the MILC program by two years, to bring it in line with the \n     timing of the rest of the farm bill, assuring a continued \n     safety net for dairy farmers nationwide in the event of \n     future price declines.\n       We therefore strongly urge you to support the inclusion of \n     the Senate MILC extension provision on one of the remaining \n     Fiscal Year 2005 appropriations conference reports scheduled \n     for enactment this year.\n           Sincerely.\n       Governor Jim Doyle, Wisconsin.\n       Governor Mark R. Warner, Virginia.\n       Governor Bob Holden, Missouri.\n       Governor Edward Rendell, Pennsylvania.\n       Governor John Baldacci, Maine.\n       Governor Jennifer Granholm, Michigan.\n       Governor Mike Rounds, South Dakota.\n       Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, Louisiana.\n       Governor Tim Pawlenty, Minnesota.\n       Governor James H. Douglas, Vermont.\n       Govemor Michael Easley, North Carolina.\n       Governor Dirk Kempthorne, Idaho.\n       Governor Tom Vilsack, Iowa.\n       Governor George E. Pataki, New York.\n       Governor Bob Taft, Ohio.\n       Governor John Hoeven, North Dakota.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Our MILC extension was adopted twice by Senate conferees on \nappropriations measures, and each time it was shot down by House \nnegotiators. Notwithstanding assurances of executive support and \ngubernatorial support, House Republican negotiators thwarted our \nefforts to include MILC extension in the various appropriations \nmeasures. I am extremely disappointed they did so.\n  One can reasonably assume, given the President's assurances in \nWausau, WI, that MILC extension will be a part of his budget submission \nnext year. While that is welcome, I caution my fellow MILC supporters \nand dairy farmers all across the nation to take that eventual \ndevelopment with a grain of salt.\n  Budget resolutions themselves are not enacted into law. They form a \nblueprint for subsequent Congressional action. Putting MILC in the \nPresident's budget, by itself, won't get the job done. It will take \nconcerted and cooperative effort on both sides of the capitol to extend \nthe MILC program.\n  Despite the serious problems I have noted above, it is worth \nmentioning several positive things in this bill that are of importance \nto my State, and I want to thank the chairman and ranking member, \nSenators Stevens and Byrd, for working to accommodate my priorities.\n  First, I am pleased that juvenile justice programs fared much better \nthan the President's original budget request. In that proposal, \njuvenile justice programs--which fund afterschool and other juvenile \ncrime prevention programs, intervention initiatives that work to \nredirect troubled teens, youth mentoring programs, substance abuse \nprevention and education projects, and programs that help keep kids out \nof gangs--received just under $200 million. Through our work with \nSenators Gregg and Hollings throughout the year, we have been able to \nincrease that number to $384 million in this appropriations bill and I \nthank my colleagues for their support and cooperation. Though \nencouraging, we must remember that juvenile justice programs and our \nchildren deserve more funding than that. Just three years ago, these \nprograms received roughly $550 million. Dollars spent on juvenile crime \nprevention is a wise investment. We can and must do better.\n  I am also grateful for the efforts of Senators Specter and Harkin in \nworking so hard to accomodate my State's needs for additional funding \nfor Hmong refugees. The U.S. Government announced in December, 2003, \nthat 15,000 Hmong refugees living in Thailand would be resettled in our \ncountry, primarily in Wisconsin, Minnesota and California. The \nresources provided in this bill will provide job training, health care, \neducation and other support services and help our communities assist \nthem with their basic needs. I know it was very difficult to find \nscarce resources in this tight budget, and I greatly appreciate the \nhard work of Senator Specter and Senator Harkin to meet this need.\n  The bill before us also makes progress in meeting the need to provide \nassistance for low-income people trying to pay their rising heating \nbills. Funding for LIHEAP has been seriously underfunded coming into \nthe heating season. As the prices of heating oil and natural gas \ncontinue to go up, an economic disaster was around the corner for many \nworking families. While this bill did not provide the entire $600 \nmillion in emergency funds that many of my colleagues and I thought was \nnecessary, it did provide $300 million. This additional funding raises \nto $2.2 billion the amount of regular and emergency funding available \nto help families meet there energy needs. In my state of Wisconsin, \nthis account is crucial to helping the disadvantaged make it through \nthe long winter.\n  In addition, one of my top priorities this year has been to restore \nfull funding for the Commerce Department's Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership program, so I am especially pleased that we have been able \nto provide a total of $109 million for this vital program, a dramatic \nincrease above the fiscal year 2004 funding of $39 million and a $3 \nmillion increase above funding in fiscal year 2003. Wisconsin is one of \nthe most manufacturing-dependent States in the Nation, second only to \nIndiana, and this budget will be able to support the Wisconsin \nManufacturing Extension Partnership program and the Northwest Wisconsin \nManufacturing Outreach Center, the two MEP centers in my State. MEP \nprovides critical assistance to small- and medium-sized manufacturers \nthroughout the Nation. It is one of the only Federal programs which \nexists to help manufacturers maintain their technological edge and \nthus, retain jobs. Unfortunately, the fiscal year 2004 budget and the \nadministration's fiscal year 2005 budget request included deep cuts to \nthe program leading to the firing of staff and the closing of local \noffices around the country. While we were able to get the Commerce \nDepartment to reprogram some funding at the end of fiscal year 2004 to \nstave off further cuts, it was essential that we put this program back \non track for fiscal year 2005.\n\n  In addition, I am pleased we have added bipartisan legislation to the \nOmnibus that will extend the benefits of the Satellite Home Viewer \nImprovement Act for another five years. We needed to act quickly to \nextend some sections of the satellite law we passed in 1999 because \nthey were set to expire this year. To be sure, compromises were made to \nachieve this goal. But, we feel a deal was struck that is fair to all \nparties--consumers, satellite companies, and broadcasters alike.\n  Let me discuss how this bill will further spur competition between \ncable and satellite, which in turn will benefit consumers. Our bill \nwill allow satellite companies to retransmit ``significantly viewed'' \nstations into local markets on a royalty-free basis. Cable companies \nhave enjoyed this privilege for years, and it is time to extend this \nright to the satellite industry. By doing so, satellite companies will \nbe able to craft a local channel line-up more similar to what cable \ncurrently offers.\n  Furthermore, through working with my colleagues, particularly Senator \nHatch, we were able to assist low power TV stations, like Channel 41 in\n\n[[Page S11763]]\n\nMilwaukee, carry valuable local programming and sports broadcasts that \nother stations do not carry. Satellite television consumers in \nsoutheastern Wisconsin and around the country will benefit from more \nlocal programs and more choices. It represents a tremendous win for \nconsumers and local sports fans. Simply, we extended a statutory \nlicense to low power TV stations in the same way those stations receive \nthat privilege in the cable world. This is an important pro-consumer \nmeasure that we are able to successfully include in the Omnibus.\n  Finally, this bill includes funding for many important programs that \nwill improve the lives of people in Wisconsin. Projects that provide \njob training, health care and dental care to uninsured families, \nafterschool programs, mental health services, caregiver training, \ntransportation, crime prevention and economic development--all of these \nprograms will have a real benefit for families and communities in my \nState. I am grateful for the hard work of the committee in accomodating \nthese Wisconsin priorities.\n  As ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee, I would also like \nto make a few remarks about what is included in Division A of the bill, \nproviding fiscal year 2005 appropriations for Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies.\n  First of all, I want to congratulate Senator Bennett who has now \ncompleted his second year as chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee. \nIn the period he has served as our chairman, his grasp of the policies, \nprograms, and problems related to this subcommittee's jurisdiction has \nbeen outstanding. It has been a great pleasure for me to work with him, \nand I look forward to our continuing partnership next year.\n  Again this year the resources available to the Agriculture \nSubcommittee have witnessed a decrease from the previous year. Yet in \nspite of those constraints, Chairman Bennett was able to provide some \nimportant increases to benefit American consumers and those who live \nand work in our rural areas. This conference report includes more than \n$5 billion for the WIC program. This amount is significantly higher \nthan the fiscal year 2004 level or that of either the House or Senate \nbills. This appropriation will help meet caseload requirements for the \ncoming year in spite of higher than expected food costs and \nparticipation rates.\n  This conference report includes new funding for a number of plant and \nanimal disease problems including research for soybean rust, mad cow \ndisease, avian influenza and a number of other emerging issues. More \nthan $33 million is provided to establish a national animal \nidentification program, as is funding related to conservation, rural \ndevelopment, food and drug safety, and more.\n  However, I must mention concerns I have with this conference report. \nI am concerned about reductions in the rural water and wastewater \nprograms. Further, although the Public Law 480 title II program is \nfunded at near the Senate level, worsening conditions around the world \nand the administration's reluctance to use the Emerson Humanitarian \nTrust, worries me that international food assistance may fall short and \nour contributions to humanitarian relief around the world may go \nwanting.\n  I also feel it is important to mention a growing, and unfortunate, \npractice on which this subcommittee has had to rely again this year. In \norder to achieve the funding levels for discretionary programs that we \nhave in this conference report, serious reductions or rescissions in \nother programs had to be realized. This is not a wholly new occurrence. \nFor many years, this subcommittee has effected limitations on a number \nof mandatory programs, notably those funded through various farm bills, \nin order to meet discretionary targets. However, due to a strangling of \nresources provided to this subcommittee in discretionary allocations, \nreductions in mandatory programs are becoming more and more severe.\n  My grave fear is if discretionary constraints continue at the rate we \nhave seen the past couple of years, we will hit the limit on savings we \ncan achieve and there will be nothing left to rescind. If and when that \nhappens, the demands for carrying out farm programs, protecting \nAmerican consumers, ensuring food and drug safety, keeping our \nenvironment clean, providing basic services for rural families, and \nmeeting new challenges such as mad cow disease, soybean rust and all \nthe rest will not diminish and we will simply not be able to provide \nwhat is necessary. On that day, we, and all of America, will be \nstanding in the middle of a very tragic train wreck and we will all be \nasking each other how and why we let this happen. I hope that before \nthat day comes, we will be able once again to have the resources \nnecessary to meet the demands we were given the trust to overcome.\n  Having said that, I do want to praise the work of Chairman Bennett. \nWith the limitations I have just outlined, he has crafted a very \nbalanced bill that will serve America well. He has done an outstanding \njob with limited resources and we should all be very proud of him for \nthat.\n  I also want to recognize the majority staff who has worked so well \nwith mine on putting this conference report together. I would like to \nmention Fitzhugh Elder, Hunter Moorhead, and Dianne Preece. I \nespecially want to recognize the majority clerk, Pat Raymond, for her \noutstanding service, not just to his subcommittee, but to the Senate \noverall. I want to note that Pat will be leaving the Senate after the \nfirst of the year and we will all miss her and wish her well.\n  I would also like to recognize Galen Fountain, Jessica Arden, Bill \nSimpson, Tom Gonzales and Meagan McCarthy of the minority staff and \nPhil Karsting of my personal staff for all their hard work on this \nbill.\n  While I am pleased that the Omnibus appropriations bill includes many \nof my priorities, on balance, I cannot support it. First, this bill \nshortchanges too many of our nation's most important priorities. This \nNation's fiscal policy throughout the last several years has led to \nlarge and irresponsible deficits, and as a result, we are facing an \nappropriations bill that is unable to meet some of the most pressing \nneeds of our families and communities.\n  Finally, I cannot support this bill because the process by which it \nwas put together and rushed through the Senate has been unacceptable. \nIt is three thousand pages long and we have had only a matter of hours \nto review it. We have already learned about an egregious provision that \nwould infringe on the privacy of Americans' tax returns, and as we have \nmore time to review the bill, it is likely we will find more troubling \nprovisions. I hope that this unfortunate process will not be repeated \nin the future. People in Wisconsin and across the Nation expect a more \nserious effort from the Senate. I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nconference report.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I regrettably voted against the adoption, of \nthe conference report tonight. I say ``regrettably'' because I \nappreciate the efforts of Senator Stevens, Byrd, and others to fashion \nsound legislation for the country, including the State of Connecticut. \nI am grateful to them. I applaud their efforts. However, I felt \ncompelled to oppose this legislation because of the troubling way this \nbill was brought before this body and because of certain provisions \nabout which I held deep concerns.\n  A few hours before the vote tonight, we were handed a piece of \nlegislation 3,200 pages in length that combined nine appropriations \nbills worth over $380 billion. It is important to note that these \nappropriations bills did not follow the normal legislative process. \nInstead of being considered and voted on separately by the Senate and \nHouse and reconciled in a conference committee, they were combined into \nan existing conference report and sent to both the House and Senate \nwith limited time for debate and no chance of amending. Furthermore, \nthis omnibus bill was largely written under a shroud of secrecy--a \nshroud so thick that it became apparent this afternoon that not even \nthe Senate leadership or Senate Appropriations Committee chairman knew \nfully what was contained in this legislation.\n  Thanks to our colleague Kent Conrad and his staff this afternoon, we \nlearned of an extraordinary tax provision buried in the middle of this \n3-foot thick bill--a provision apparently unbeknownst to the majority \nthat launches an unprecedented assault on the personal privacy. This \nprovision allows\n\n[[Page S11764]]\n\ncertain Members of Congress or their designees--designees that could \ninclude anybody from staff members to private contractors--to request \nthe tax returns of any United States citizen without having to give any \nreason for requesting the returns and without having any limitations on \nhow to use those returns. Simply put, it is an unprecedented abuse of \ncongressional power and a frontal assault on our civil liberties.\n  I am told that the fact remains that this legislation contains a \nprovision that strikes at the heart of our nation's civil liberties. \nMoreover, that this provision will be repealed by the House and Senate \nbefore becoming law. While I am comforted by this move, I remain deeply \ntroubled that other damaging provisions such as the one above might \nremain in this bill.\n  A second issue over which I hold deep concerns is that this \nconference report essentially allows health care providers to ``gag'' \nmedical professionals and deny women from obtaining medically necessary \ninformation and services concerning reproductive health. This so-called \nFederal refusal clause would exempt health care providers from any \nexisting federal, state, or municipal law that ensures that women have \nlegal access to abortion services and reproductive health information. \nIt would also bar states and municipalities from enforcing their own \naccess laws without jeopardizing all of their federal funding for \nhealth and educational initiatives. While supporters of this provision \nclaim that it solely serves as a ``conscience clause'' that protects \nthe religious beliefs of certain health care providers, it is clear to \nme that this provision is yet another veiled attempt to undermine a \nwoman's constitutional right to choose.\n  I am encouraged that Senator Boxer has reached an agreement with the \nSenate leadership to introduce and consider a bill next year that will \nstrip this provision. As legislators, I believe that we should not work \nto uphold the rights and freedoms proscribed by the Constitution. We \nshould not work to stifle or remove them. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the constitutional rights of women as enshrined \nby Roe v. Wade. I urge them to support initiatives that properly and \neffectively make a woman's life and well-being a top priority.\n  Furthermore, I am concerned that this conference report fails to \ncontain several important measures that were previously approved by the \nHouse and Senate. One such measure prevents the Labor Department to, in \neffect, deny overtime pay to as many as 8 million workers across our \ncountry. While both the House and the Senate opposed this policy by \nbipartisan majorities, that opposition was ignored by Republican \nconferees. Many workers who now qualify for overtime pay would find \ntheir jobs reclassified as a managerial or professional position, thus \nmaking them ineligible for overtime pay if they work in excess of 40 \nhours.\n  This change is significant because overtime pay can provide as much \nas 25 percent of a worker's annual income. Instead of working toward \ncreating new jobs and helping working families and individuals, the \nlegislation creates yet another obstacle for millions of Americans to \nprovide for themselves and their families.\n  Second, this conference report fails to stop the outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs. The conference report that was before us tonight fails \nto reverse a Bush administration policy of allowing government \nfunctions to be outsourced to other countries--thereby causing \nthousands of job losses at home.\n  Finally, the conference report wholly underfunds important domestic \ninitiatives such as education and health. It shows once again the \ncurrent Administration's failure in guaranteeing the well-being of all \nAmericans.\n  I regretted voting against this bill tonight because it does provide \nseveral million dollars for important initiatives in my home state of \nConnecticut and across the Nation. However, in my view, it carries too \nmany negative provisions for me to support. I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues in rectifying the bill's shortcomings in the coming \nmonths and new session of Congress.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for passage of the bill, and I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back and all time \nhas been used.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to a provision \nincluded in this omnibus bill that has never been debated or considered \nby the Senate. It denies millions of women basic information about \ntheir constitutional rights and endangers women who are in desperate \nsituations in pregnancies caused by rape or incest or pregnancies that \nthreaten their health or their life. Again, this provision has never \nbeen considered or debated by the Senate, yet it is included in this \nappropriations bill.\n  Given the rules of the Senate, there is no way I can strike this \nprovision of the bill at this point. I could delay the passage of the \nbill, but I cannot strike this outrageous provision.\n  When the Senate returns to session in January, I will be introducing \nlegislation to repeal this so-called Weldon provision. I feel strongly \nthe Senate must debate, consider, and vote on this issue. It is too \nimportant to millions of American women to be slipped into an Omnibus \nappropriations bill. Therefore, I ask the majority and soon-to-be \nminority leaders to commit to bring before the Senate by April 30, \n2005, my bill to repeal the so-called Weldon amendment, with a minimum \nof 4 hours of debate and an up-or-down vote on my bill without \namendment. I ask the majority leader if he will comment on this?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer for allowing us to \nmove toward completion of the Omnibus appropriations bill today. I \ncommit to her that no later than April 30, 2005, the Senate will \nconsider her bill to repeal the so-called Weldon amendment regarding \nabortion conscience clauses that is included in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill. When we consider that bill, we will have no less \nthan 4 hours of debate equally divided on the bill, with Senator Boxer \ncontrolling half the time. There will be no amendment or other motions \nin order to the bill, and at the conclusion or yielding back of time \nthe Senate will conduct an up-or-down vote on the Boxer bill.\n  I further commit to the Senator from California that this debate and \nvote will not occur on a Monday or a Friday and that it will not occur \nduring the evening or a late night session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for making this \nagreement and allowing the Senate to complete its work this year. I \ncommit to the Senator from California that I will ensure the agreement \nthat is reached today will be upheld.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the two leaders and I urge the vote.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent. The \nSenator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell), the Senator from New Hampshire \n(Mr. Gregg), and the Senator from Indiana, (Mr. Lugar).\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), and \nthe Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the fact that the \nSatellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004 has \nbeen included in the Omnibus Appropriations conference report. The \nHouse is likely to pass the conference report later today. The fate of \nthe conference report is less certain here in the Senate, and I still \nhave not made up my mind how I will vote as I am still reviewing the \ntext of the bill. I am pleased, however, that the Satellite Home Viewer \nExtension and Reauthorization Act of 2004 has been included. This new \nlaw marks important progress for rural Americans by providing greater \naccess to more television options or these consumers, making more local \nTV channels available to them, encouraging more digital TV offerings, \nand providing head-to-head competition with cable TV.\n  I was pleased to sponsor the original Senate bill with Chairman \nHatch, and Senators DeWine and Kohl, which was introduced on January \n21, 2004. At our Judiciary Committee hearing on the bill we heard from \nthe President and CEO of Vermont Public Television, John King, who \ntestified about the benefits of local-into-local television to \nVermonters and the importance of getting both satellite carriers to \noffer it in Vermont. He also noted that all of the Vermont network \nstations should be offered statewide, including in Bennington and \nWindham counties. He testified that those counties receive local news \nfrom the Schenectady area and from the Boston TV market, respectively, \nnot from Vermont stations.\n  I can recall hearing from many Vermont families over the years about \nthis issue. In fact, in a letter dated February 20, 2004, I heard from \nalmost 20 Vermont State representatives and State senators about the \nimportance of getting satellite-delivered Vermont stations into \nBennington and Windham counties. Indeed, the Vermont General Assembly \nadopted in both houses a joint resolution urging that ``the Vermont \nCongressional delegation assist in assuring the availability of \nVermont-based television stations on all home satellite delivery \nsystems in the state.'' I am pleased to announce that this just got \ndone with the passage of this new law.\n  Once the President signs this bill, both satellite carriers, the Dish \nNetwork, also known as EchoStar, and DirecTV will be able to offer all \nVermont TV stations in all Vermont counties. The Dish Network has been \noffering Vermont TV stations over satellite for over 2 years, except in \nthose two counties, and DirecTV announced this month that they would \nbegin offering local TV service in Vermont.\n  Both of these national satellite companies will also be able to offer \nTV satellite service in analog--as they do now--and in digital after \nfull implementation of this new satellite law.\n  The Hatch-Leahy Satellite Home Viewer Extension Act of 2004 was \napproved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 17, 2004. All the \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee supported that bill.\n  When the bill was reported out of committee, I noted that the bill \ndoes far more than just protect satellite dish owners from losing \nsignals as had happened in 1997 and 1998. I pointed out that the new \nsatellite bill protects subscribers in every state, expands viewing \nchoices for most dish owners, promotes access to local programming, and \nincreases direct, head-to-head, competition between cable and satellite \nproviders.\n  Easily, this bill will benefit 21 million satellite television dish \nowners throughout the nation, and I am happy to note that around 90,000 \nVermonters receive satellite TV.\n  I was pleased to work on this bill not only with the Vermont \nCongressional delegation but also with my colleagues from New \nHampshire, Senator Sununu and Senator Gregg. We, along with Senator \nJeffords, introduced legislation to ensure that satellite dish owners \nin every county in each of our States would be able to receive signals, \nvia satellite, from our respective in-State television stations. While \nour two States represent a small television market as compared to some \nof the major population centers, this provision is nonetheless very \nimportant to residents in six of our collective counties--two in \nVermont and four in New Hampshire. I also coordinated these efforts \nwith Congressman Sanders and Congressman Bass of New Hampshire. Viewers \nin both States in those counties will simply choose whether they want \nto watch WMUR from Manchester, or watch WVNY or any of the other \nVermont stations. For the first time, these residents in both States \nwill be able to receive home State news and programming via satellite.\n  For too long, Bennington and Windham counties have not been able to \nreceive television news about what is happening in Vermont. Because of \nVermont's alpine topography, with many towns in the saddles of our \nmountains, thousands of Vermonters did not receive Vermont television \nstations over the air. This new provision solves that problem.\n  I have received input from all Vermont stations on this effort. I \nalso had my staff meet with representatives from all the Vermont \nstations to go over the details. I appreciate the input of Peter Martin \nof WCAX; John King and Ann Curran of Vermont Public Television; Bill \nSally of Fox, WFFF; Paul Sands of WPTZ and WNNE, NBC; Ted Teffner of \nWCAX; Eric Storck and Ken Kazabowski of WVNY, ABC. My staff also met \nwith representatives of Adelphia Cable, Vermont's largest cable \nprovider, and other providers.\n  As I mentioned on the Senate floor in September, this effort will \nalso allow additional programming via satellite through adoption of the \nso-called ``significantly viewed'' test now used for cable, but not for \nsatellite subscribers. Generally applied that test means if a family \nwere in an area in which most families in the past had received TV \nsignals using a regular rooftop antenna, then those families could be \noffered that same signal TV via cable. By having similar rules, \nsatellite carriers will be able to directly compete with cable \nproviders who already operate under the significantly viewed test. This \ngives home dish owners more choices of programming.\n  In 1997, we found a way to avoid cutoffs of satellite TV service to \nmillions of homes and to protect the local affiliate broadcast system. \nThe following year we forged an alliance behind a strong satellite bill \nto permit local stations to be offered by satellite, thus increasing \ncompetition between cable and satellite providers.\n  I want to thank Chairman Hatch, along with Senators Kohl and DeWine, \nfor providing such strong leadership in this effort. In 1998 and 1999 \nwe developed a major satellite law which transformed the industry by \nallowing local television stations to be carried by satellite and \nbeamed back down to the local communities served by those stations. \nThis marked the first time that thousands of TV owners were able to get \nthe full complement of local network stations. In 1997 we found a way \nto avoid cutoffs of satellite TV service to millions of homes and to \nprotect the local affiliate broadcast system. The following year we \nforged an alliance behind a strong satellite bill to permit local \nstations to be offered by satellite, thus increasing competition \nbetween cable and satellite providers.\n  We also worked with the Public Broadcasting System so they could \noffer a national feed as they transitioned to having their local \nprogramming beamed up to satellites and then beamed back down to much \nlarger audiences.\n  Because of those efforts, dish owners in Vermont and most other \nStates can\n\n[[Page S11766]]\n\nwatch their local stations instead of receiving signals from distant \nstations. Such a service allows television watchers to be more easily \nconnected to their communities as well as providing access to necessary \nemergency signals, news and broadcasts.\n  The good news is that this bill is great for every state in the \nnation. Consumers in every county in every state will be offered, over \ntime, more satellite TV choices. This effort is an example of how the \nCongress can work together on complex issues to benefit families all \nacross America.\n  Many Members had a hand in crafting this bill. Subcommittee Chairman \nDeWine, and his chief of staff, Pete Levitas, and David Bolling, and \nranking member Senator Kohl and his staff, Jeff Miller and Jon \nSchwantes, were very helpful in crafting the Committee bill.\n  In the other body, Chairman Sensenbrenner and subcommittee chairman \nLamar Smith did a tremendous job on the Judiciary copyright issues. \nThey worked with their Democratic colleagues including ranking member \nJohn Conyers and subcommittee ranking member Howard Berman to report \nout a strong bill.\n  The leaders of the Committee on Energy and Commerce worked on issues \nrelated to their jurisdiction and together with the Judiciary Committee \ndeveloped a combined bill for House floor action. That was a great idea \nand they proposed a seamless package. As I have stated several times \nbefore, H.R. 4518 represented a very careful balancing of interests and \nwas good for consumers, good for the affected industries, good for \ncopyright holders and good for rural America. Staff of Senate and House \nleadership helped facilitate the process of working out some of the \ndifferences between different versions of the bill.\n  Many staff worked diligently on this effort, including David Jones \nwith Senate Judiciary and David Whitney with House Judiciary, both of \nwhom were instrumental in crafting good solutions to complex problems.\n  Many House and Senate Commerce Committee staff pitched in and worked \ntogether to get this bill done. James Assey, Bill Bailey, Rachel Welch, \nGregg Rothschild, Alec French, Peter Filon, Sampak Garg, Neil Fried, \nMike Sullivan and Howard Waltzman are some of the House staff on both \nCommittees who worked hard to get the job done.\n  I know that my staff appreciated the helpful assistance provided by \nstaff of Speaker Hastert, Bill Koetzle; Majority Leader Frist, Libby \nJarvis; and Chairman Stevens, Christine Kurth and Lisa Sutherland, in \nthis difficult process.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my Judiciary counsel Ed Barron. As he did \nduring the last reauthorization, Ed tried to work with everyone \ninvolved to help build a consensus on all the issues. Ed did an \nextraordinary job as he has done on all the other major projects I have \nasked him to do over the last 18 years.\n  In the next Congress, I look forward to monitoring the implementation \nof this law and am ready to work with all involved in this process to \naddress any concerns that may arise.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to report on a tremendous \nstep forward for public safety, our economy, closing the digital \ndivide, and bringing next generation high definition television to \nrural America. The House and Senate today passed legislation that will \nfundamentally impact the future of television especially in rural \nAmerica. Today the U.S. Congress set aside entrenched special interest \ngroup wish lists and took a strong step forward toward making high \ndefinition digital television available in unserved areas.\n  The Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004 \nenjoyed broad bipartisan support and is now headed to the President's \ndesk. I applaud my colleagues from the Commerce and Judiciary \nCommittees, from both sides of the aisle, and from both Chambers. The \nleaders of these committees did not bow down to the furious lobbying of \nthose who have sought to slow down the digital transition and that \nattempted to gut the important pro-consumer digital white area \nprovisions designed to make available high definition programming to \nrural Americans. This legislation sends an unmistakable message that we \nare not going to allow a digital divide like we have for broadband to \noccur in the new world of digital television. With this legislation, \nconsumers who cannot receive digital television programming over the \nair, will now have a chance to receive it from satellite providers who \nare ready, willing and able to get high definition programming to \nunserved areas.\n  One of the most exciting benefits of this legislation, is that it \ncreates incentives and pressures to speed the return of this valuable \nanalog television spectrum. There are endless possibilities for \npowerful new innovations for consumers that will flourish when new \nunlicensed wireless spectrum is made available. Consumers will benefit \nfrom new devices and services we haven't even contemplated yet.\n  Public safety also needs to have access to this spectrum to ensure \nthey have the ability to communicate in dark stairwells and wet \nbasements. We know that the characteristics of this spectrum are such \nthat they can penetrate walls and travel over greater distances. The 9/\n11 Commission tells us that we need to make this spectrum available.\n  The bill also mandates that satellite providers phase out their use \nof two-dish markets, across the country in 18 months. Currently, \ncustomers in some markets need a second dish to receive some stations \nand since many customers choose not to receive a second dish, some \nstations are not seen. This legislation ends that practice.\n  Our work today, while a tremendous victory, is but the first step \nforward in what I believe history will mark as the turning point in the \nU.S. Congress recognizing that blindly clinging to the world of 1940's \nanalog television is only harming our economy, our most rural areas, \npublic safety and is stifling innovation. Today the Congress made an \naffirmative determination that all Americans deserve to have equal \naccess to digital television programming regardless of geographic \nlocation.\n  The purpose of this legislation is simple; to make sure consumers are \nnot denied digital television based on where they live or whether the \ndigital conversion has been completed in their area. People outside \nmajor market areas, like those in rural Nevada, should not be left \nbehind in the DTV revolution.\n  This legislation includes strong protections against abuse, and tough \npenalties to ensure satellite providers comply with a fair and \nequitable process by which all Americans can take part in the digital \ntransition in a realistic timeframe. Local broadcasters who have been \nunable to turn up a full-power digital signal due to circumstances \nbeyond their control will not be unfairly penalized.\n  With the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Congress \nestablished a timeline for catching up our Nation's television \nbroadcasting with rapidly changing technology. In fact, we gave \nbroadcasters a multi-billion dollar public asset in the form of free \nspectrum for digital television with the explicit understanding that \ntheir analog spectrum be returned by December 31, 2006. Unfortunately, \nyears of litigation, lobbying and foot dragging has made it likely that \nwe will miss this deadline. Next year the Congress will be considering \na new hard deadline for completion of this transition and it is my \nintention to work vigorously to ensure that these dates not be allowed \nto slip any longer than necessary.\n  Equally important will be ensuring that we do not forget about those \nconsumers for whom a new digital television set, cable or satellite \nreceiver or digital converter box does not fit in their near-term \nbuying plans. The Senate Commerce Committee has considered numerous \nproposals to ensure that these consumer's screens don't go dark when a \nhard deadline passes. Next year the Congress needs to decide on an \napproach to ensure that especially lower income consumers will be \nadequately accommodated. There are many good proposals on how to best \nensure we protect these consumers, and there is no doubt in my mind \nthat the tremendous proceeds of the spectrum auctions will give us the \nresources necessary to ensure a successful transition.\n  Our work also remains unfinished for cable operators who wish to \nprovide the same important services to rural Americans as will now be \navailable to satellite customers. Consumers stand\n\n[[Page S11767]]\n\nto benefit even further from competition in the multichannel video \nprogramming distribution marketplace if cable providers are afforded \nsome of the same opportunities we have made available to satellite. We \nhave to be careful not to tip the balance in favor of one industry over \nanother. This is why the bill includes a provision requiring the FCC to \nstudy and report back to Congress in nine months on the impact of \nretransmission consent and certain blackout rules on competition in the \nmultichannel video programming distribution market and, in particular, \non the ability of rural cable television systems to provide their \ncustomers with digital broadcast television programming.\n  Millions of people in rural areas subscribe to cable television \nservice, often from small cable operators. Once again, it is not our \nintent to create a competitive advantage for one technology over \nanother consumers should not be forced to choose between DBS and cable \nin order to receive digital broadcast television signals. I look \nforward to receiving the commission's report and I am confident the \ncommittee will give serious consideration to any recommendations for \nadditional legislative action contained therein.\n  This Congress sent a powerful message today that we understand the \nimportance of the digital transition, and the powerful benefits for \npublic safety, television viewers, innovation, public safety and our \neconomy. I fully expect the momentum of this victory will carry forward \ninto the next Congress where we can build on these great \naccomplishments for consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11767-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO H.R. 4818\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I congratulate the Senate Appropriations \nchairman, our President pro tempore, Ted Stevens. Since 1971, for 34 \nyears, Senator Stevens has served on the Appropriations Committee, and \nfor the last 8 years, or almost 8 years, he served as chairman of that \ncommittee, with a 1-year interruption in 2002 to be its ranking member.\n  Beginning with the new Congress in January, the chairmanship of the \ncommittee will pass to another Senator. So today the chairman has \nbrought to the floor the last appropriations bill under his \nchairmanship, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005.\n  It is only appropriate that this final bill was put together--and we \nall saw it play out over the last several hours, days, and weeks--with \nthe same hard work, the same focus, the same tenacity, and the same \nperseverance which has characterized his leadership of this committee \nover the last many years.\n  I do, on behalf of the Senate Republican caucus--indeed, the entire \nSenate--say, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for all you have done.\n  It would be a mistake, also, if as leader I did not recognize the \nextremely hard work of the chairman's staff under the superb leadership \nand guidance of the staff director, Jim Morhard. At the end of this \nCongress, Mr. Morhard will be leaving public service after over 26 \nyears, most of it spent right here in the Senate.\n  Jim, we thank you for your dedication and your service to Government, \nto this institution, and to the Appropriations Committee.\n  There have been a lot of long days and long nights over the last \nseveral weeks for staff, and some staff, particularly those on the \nEnergy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, have literally gone for \nover 48 hours straight without sleep to bring us to this point today \nand tonight where we have passed this legislation. I know I speak for \nall Senators on both sides of the aisle when I say thank you for your \nwork done under some very challenging and very difficult circumstances.\n  This has also been a challenging year for the budget and \nappropriations process. We were able, though, in spite of all those \nchallenges, to establish an enforceable $821.9 billion spending limit \nfor this year. The bill today, along with the other four appropriations \nbills enacted to date, have lived by that strict spending limit we \nestablished.\n  Total appropriations, excluding defense and natural disaster \nemergency spending, will increase 3.9 percent over last year with the \nenactment of the bill that we passed tonight.\n  More important, appropriations for nondefense, nonhomeland security \nspending will increase by less than 1.7 percent, and that is the \nsmallest growth in nondefense spending in this area of the Federal \nbudget in nearly a decade.\n  So, yes, this has been a very tough bill setting priorities and \nmaking difficult tradeoffs to stay within the spending limit, while at \nthe same time addressing the priority items, all of which is not easy, \nto say the least, but within the strict confines of this bill, it does \nprovide $19.5 billion for veterans medical care, $16.2 billion for \nNASA, $28.6 billion for the National Institutes of Health, and $57 \nbillion for the Department of Education, among other important, \nsignificant domestic programs.\n  The bill also provides nearly $3 billion in necessary funding to \naddress the pandemic of HIV/AIDS, and that is $700 million more than \nlast year. It also provides $400 million, actually over $400 million in \nhumanitarian and refugee assistance for Sudan and $1.5 billion for the \nMillennium Challenge Account.\n  Despite the tightness of this budget, Chairman Stevens and Senator \nByrd have brought a great bill before us today, and a great bill has \nbeen passed tonight. Yes, we know it does not please everyone; there is \nno way it possibly could. But it is the final product of this Congress \nthat has been agreed to and a product of which we can be quite proud.\n  I do appreciate the Senators' support for this bill, and it does \nbring to completion the fiscal year 2005 appropriations process. Thank \nyou, Chairman Stevens.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was reluctant to cast my vote against \nthis bill which has a lot of good things in it, and it is not as bad as \nsome bills that have come through, but I want to share some of my \nconcerns and thoughts tonight.\n  We have had charges for sometime that we have used accounting \ngimmicks to get around the budget caps or limits in the bill. This \nbill's gimmicks are not as bad as we have had in some years, but there \nare some here, and I think we ought to talk about them.\n  Our budget for the year was $821.919 billion for the discretionary \naccount. In order to comply with the budget resolution, this omnibus \nbill relies on roughly $1.6 billion in practices that many of us have \ndescribed as gimmicks. And there is an additional $400 million in \nspending that was designated as an emergency which is not subject to \nthe budget limitations. So it is basically $2 billion over what the \nbudget limit should be, unpaid for and funded by freezing the debt in \nreality.\n\n[[Page S11768]]\n\n  How did we get there? An $821 billion budget was the discretionary \nspending. The Senate insisted on $4 billion more in additional spending \nabove the budget resolution. While insisting that spending remain \nwithin the overall limit, the administration sought funding for certain \nPresidential priorities at higher levels than provided either by the \nHouse or the Senate. As a result, the omnibus bill pays for this \nadditional spending, I am pleased to say, with an across-the-board cut, \nacross all the accounts, of .8 percent, less than 1 percent, but it did \npay for most of that. It reduces the accounts in all bills and helps \nreduce the amount of debt that would be incurred by this spending bill. \nWhile we would prefer to live within our budget, this across-the-board \ncut is better than increased debt.\n  However, rather than paying for all of the increases with this \nacross-the-board cut, which we could have done by perhaps having a 1-\npercent reduction across the board, the bill includes a series of at \nleast four accounting maneuvers.\n  First, the omnibus bill includes an accounting shift regarding public \nhousing authorities, PHAs.\n  Currently, the Federal Government subsidizes the operating costs of \nPHAs. However, the PHAs are on different fiscal years and normally get \ntheir full annual allocation at the beginning of their fiscal year, \nOctober 1. The omnibus bill will include language requiring all PHAs to \nconvert to a calendar year budget, resulting in $1 billion in savings \nfor 2005. No cuts, nothing but a maneuvering of the calendar year \nbudget and that would save $1 billion. But it is not a saving, is it? \nThe effect of the provision is to defer costs into the future to allow \nfor additional spending now and spending that will likely be assumed \ninto the baseline of our spending, and the baseline of spending is very \nimportant.\n  I will take a moment to discuss why baseline is so important. When we \nincrease annual spending by $2 billion, that is a significant hit to \nthe taxpayer. It does not sound like a lot out of a $821 billion \nbudget. We have had worse years, I will admit, but still a significant \nhit.\n  Next year, when we begin the budget and appropriations season, that \n$2 billion will be assumed into the baseline, meaning to fund all the \nprograms at the previous year's level, we will need to spend another $2 \nbillion.\n  Second, the bill rescinds roughly $300 million in defense \nappropriations. It took $300 million from defense, raising the concern \nfor some that defense spending may be reduced in priority and we ought \nnot to take anything from defense we cannot fully justify, and I do not \nthink we need to in this time of war take anything from defense.\n  In addition, it is unclear such a rescission will result in true \nsavings. For instance, the fiscal year 2004 omnibus included a similar \n$1.8 billion rescission of defense and unused emergency spending from \npost-9/11 to help meet last year's budget resolution. That $1.8 billion \nwas later restored in the Department of Defense conference report and \nit was labeled an emergency. So what happened? It is pretty clear, is \nit not? What happened was that last year we used this reduction of \ndefense by $1.8 billion and later we declared it an emergency, which \nmeans it is not subject to the budget limitations of the budget, and we \nfunded it by increasing the debt. In other words, we went around the \nbudget limits, the budget caps, we agreed to.\n  Third, the bill relies on new data suggesting that receipts have \nincreased in the Crime Victims Fund by $283 million. However, CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, does not publish an updated economic \noutlook until January and thus to have access to such funds it would be \nnecessary to direct CBO to assume such revenues in its scorekeeping.\n  The committee has left the directed scorekeeping provision out of the \ntext due in part to past objections by some conservatives to such \nprovisions, and thus when a CBO score is finally produced, it will \nprobably result in the omnibus exceeding the budget resolution.\n  Finally, the omnibus will also include an extra $300 million for the \nLow-Income Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, another $300 million \nbeyond the regular appropriations, because of high energy prices. This \nwill be designated as an emergency and it will not be counted against \nthe budget resolution, even though past LIHEAP contingencies have been \npaid for within the budget parameters. So LIHEAP has been declared an \nemergency.\n  I do not think we need to be in a position of saying that simply an \nincrease in the energy prices justifies a $300 million increase in \nspending straight to the debt and violating our budget. In addition, \nthe bill provides an additional $100 million in emergency designations, \n$7 million for the Postal Service, and $93 million for Sudan.\n\n  If we measure our spending by maintaining the same rate of increase, \nwe will not only have to spend the $2 billion next year, but we can \nassume more than $2 billion on top just to maintain the rate of \nincreased baseline. So a $2 billion increase this year becomes a $4 \nbillion increase next year, or at least an increase in the debt. And \nthis is the way it works: We go over the budget this year by $2 \nbillion. Then next year, we have to have a budget that funds that same \n$2 billion, and if our habits continue the same and our appropriators \ncannot stay within the $821 billion or whatever our budget number is \nnext year, and it will be somewhat higher, then we will have another $2 \nbillion or maybe more through additional gimmicks next year, because I \ndo not think we have ever done an appropriations bill since I have been \nin the Senate that has been truly honest, without some gimmicks.\n  Now, I figured this out. If we did it just $2 billion--and, remember, \noften we have done worse than this bill and had more than $2 billion in \ngimmicks--then the next year there is another $2 billion plus the $2 \nbillion we raised up this year, and so it is $4 billion up, and the \nnext year it is $6 billion up, and next year it is $8 billion. Add \nthose to the amounts that have been tapped and hit the country with \ndeficit spending, in over 10 years I calculate it would be $132 \nbillion. So this $2 billion a year is not a one-time deal. It tends to \nbecome part of the baseline of Federal spending, and as a result of \nthat it grows exponentially over time. That is how we get out of \ncontrol.\n  Now, the way we reached a surplus in our budget account and \neliminated the deficit throughout the 1990s fundamentally was good \ncontrol of spending--not perfect but pretty good. Remember, this \nCongress shut down the whole Government for a while, trying to contain \nand cut spending. At any rate, over a period of time we did a pretty \ngood job of controlling spending. This year's budget is good on \ndiscretionary spending. It is less than a 1-percent increase. I am \nproud of the Senate for doing that. I am proud of President Bush for \nsupporting it. It was the right decision. We have done a pretty good \njob of staying with that. But I want to point out that just this $2 \nbillion excess can make a large difference in the total over a period \nof years.\n  If we would remain true to the limits we all agreed to in our budget, \nthe $821 billion, and we stayed flat at that, it would make a big \ndifference over time, a lot more than people think. If we had not had \nthis offset, which I salute our appropriators and the leadership in \nthis Senate for taking a .8-percent reduction across the board to fund \nmost of this, we would have been in lot worse shape. We got so close. \nMy concern is, why not go all the way? Why not be true to the budget we \nagreed to, the budget limits we had? If we had done that, I think we \ncould be more proud of our work today.\n  I conclude by expressing my concern about the budget and the need to \nstay absolutely true to it. If we will, it will make a huge difference \nover a period of years in our goal to substantially reduce the deficits \nthat are facing our country. Again, I want to say how much I appreciate \nthe leadership of Senator Frist, Assistant Majority Leader McConnell, \nand Senator Stevens for the work they have done on this bill. It is a \nvery difficult job.\n  We do not need to be doing this every year. My best judgment is that \nwe absolutely need to do a budget that is good for 2 years. We do not \nneed to be doing this every year. We could work more carefully on it, \nmore responsibly, and end up with a spending level we can agree to and \nnot have two opportunities to break it--there would only be one \nopportunity to break it--and I believe we can make real progress in \nmaintaining fiscal integrity in our Government by doing so.\n\n[[Page S11769]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I know it is late and there is nobody \nhere. Somehow or another, it seems like, when you have things that are \nmoving along and moving rather slowly, you have to regularly call them \nto the attention of the Senate.\n  I do not have anything but great praise for how we got here with this \nbill. Everybody is saying it could not be helped. Senator Reid and I \nunderstand. A piece of this bill is ours. We could never get it done \nuntil late in the session because it seemed as if nobody wanted to \nunderstand the problem we had. We couldn't do the things we were \nsupposed to do because there was a misunderstanding in the budget about \nhow to pay for things. So that was done.\n  The thing is, if Senators had before them tonight, before this bill, \na final vote on a measure that said we are going to do this every 2 \nyears instead of every 1 year, and we are going to do a budget \nresolution for 2 years, do you know what would have happened? It would \nhave passed with 75 votes because people around here understand we do \nnot have to do this every year. You can do it for 2 years, with 2-year \nbudgets and the right to have, in between those appropriations bills, \nthe special kind of special needs appropriations.\n  It certainly would not be like it is now. You have those now and you \nhave appropriations every year. You have the supplemental \nappropriations.\n  I took this minute to say someone, sometime--maybe before I leave \nhere--will do that. I actually believe the House is ready. They voted \non it. They didn't have the bill we would have, but we could go to \nconference. But I just want to use this last few minutes. Nobody is \naround and I ought to be out of here at home. I have some new \ngrandchildren at home and they can't watch me at this late hour because \nthey are too little, so I should be gone.\n  But it is good to have an example. Frankly, I think if we had 2-year \nappropriations, we wouldn't have this because I think the individual \nbills would be done, if you had, instead of every year, 2 years to do \nthem. I think we would have a lot of time for oversight and other \nthings we do not do. In fact, my memory is not as good as it was and I \ncan't tell you the percent, but a huge amount of the Senate's voting \ntime and floor time is used for just three things: budget, \nappropriations, and supplemental appropriations. That is a huge amount \nof the time. I don't know how we get all the other things done.\n  So if we could do it every 2 years, it seems to me we would all be \nthe better for it. We would be less apt to have this kind of thing \noccur with an omnibus, meaning overall, many--all put in one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, in a bit we will be wrapping up. There is a \nlot of business that is being tended to and it will probably be 30 \nminutes or so before we officially wrap up. I thought I would address \nseveral issues that have come to my attention over the last several \ndays and cover some of the events that have occurred earlier this week.\n  The first is an issue that leads from what we learned earlier this \nweek when the Department of Defense warned American military bases \nworldwide to cease officially sponsoring the Boy Scouts of America.\n  The Department issued its directive in response to a lawsuit filed by \nthe American Civil Liberties Union. The Illinois chapter of the ACLU \naccuses the U.S. Government of improperly supporting a group which \nadministers a religious oath. The ACLU's legal attack has forced the \nDefense Department to suspend its decades long tradition of supporting \nScouts and it may even prevent Scouts from celebrating their annual \njamborees on Defense installations. But it does not stop here.\n  There is fresh evidence that the ACLU intends to end all Federal \nsupport for the Boy Scouts of America. In their view, where there is \nGovernment, there cannot be faith. The separation of church and state \nis a bedrock principle of our Republic, and Americans are grateful that \nwe are free to worship as we choose without Government interference or \nfear of persecution. But to this legislator, the ACLU's continued \nattacks on the Boy Scouts is starting to become its own form of \npersecution.\n  The Boy Scouts of America is a congressionally chartered \norganization. It serves a patriotic, charitable, and educational \npurpose. Furthermore, its support by the Federal Government is outlined \nin U.S. law. I was a Boy Scout as a young boy in Nashville, TN. All \nthree of my sons, Harrison, Jonathan, and Bryan, have been Boy Scouts \nhere as we have lived in Washington, DC.\n  We have found, and it is generally accepted, that Boy Scouts and \nScouting is a noble tradition, an honorable tradition, that inculcates \nthe very best of our values. Since its founding in the early 20th \ncentury, scouting has served America's communities and families with \ndistinction and with honor. The Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts promote \ncharacter in leadership by instilling in our youth values such as \nhonor, duty, charity, integrity. These programs help prepare our young \npeople for the ethical and moral choices that they will face throughout \nour lives.\n  It is for these reasons that I introduced a bill called the Save Our \nScouts bill to reaffirm our longstanding commitment to the tradition of \nscouting. The legislation stipulates that no Federal law, including any \nrule, regulation, directive, instruction, or order shall be construed \nto limit any Federal agency from providing any form of support to the \nBoy Scouts of America or Girl Scouts of the United States of America or \nany organization chartered by the Boy Scouts of America or the Girl \nScouts of the United States of America.\n  Activities supported include holding meetings, jamborees, camporees, \nor other Scouting activities on Federal property, or hosting or \nsponsoring any official event of such organization.\n\n  I am disappointed that this bill did not pass by unanimous consent, \nbut I am hopeful that in the next Congress common sense will prevail \nand both Chambers will give their unanimous support to protecting the \nScouts.\n  Scouting has served generations of American boys and girls. It has \nearned its place in the hearts of millions of Americans who look back \nfondly, just as I do, on that special time of merit badges, hikes, \nfellowship, and service. I am confident that we will preserve this \nhonorable tradition for years and generations to come.\n\n\n               Individuals With Disabilities Act Of 2004\n\n  On a separate issue, late last night a very important bill called the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Act of 2004 passed and is now on its way \nto the President's desk for his signature. Several years ago, I had the \nopportunity in this body to chair what was then called the Subcommittee \non Individuals with Disabilities, and over that Congress, that 2-year \nperiod, spent a great deal of time focused on this particular \nlegislation called IDEA, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  I commend the Senators from New Hampshire and Massachusetts who have \ndone a tremendous job in their bipartisan work on this very important \nlegislation. There are more than 6.5 million children with disabilities \nwho are served through IDEA, along with more than 430,000 special \neducation teachers. The Individuals with Disabilities Act of 2004 \ncarefully addresses the needs of those disabled children and the \nschools they attend.\n  The bill refocuses Federal law on outcomes for disabled children, \nensuring that States focus on academic results, not process, while \nstill guaranteeing the rights of the child to be protected.\n\n[[Page S11770]]\n\n  Teachers are now burdened with hours of paperwork that take away from \nclassroom instruction. I have seen the paperwork requirement. Teachers \nhave shown me stacks of forms that are 6 inches, even a foot high, page \nafter page. They are required to complete these forms before they can \ntake care of the needs of those disabled students.\n  This bill enables those teachers to devote more of their time and \nmore of their energy to the classroom, and in turn their students \nbenefit from more of their undivided attention. The attention is on the \nstudents with disabilities rather than on paper.\n  The staff of Senators Gregg and Kennedy deserve great credit for \ntheir hard work and effort that made final passage of this conference \nreport possible. In particular, I recognize the tremendous work of \nstaff members Denzel McGuire and Connie Gardner for their commitment, \ntheir dedication and labor on behalf of disabled students.\n  As I mentioned, it was late last night that that bill passed, and it \nis on the way to the President, again a tremendous achievement for this \nbody. I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member on the success \nof this bill.\n\n\n                       Medical Modernization Act\n\n  Mr. President, because we will be leaving tonight and will not be \nhere over the course of the week, I want to address a bill called the \nMedicare Modernization Act. Next week is the 1-year anniversary of the \nSenate's historic passage of this act, the Medicare Modernization Act. \nSince we will not be here next week, I want to again just mention, on \nthis anniversary, a few days early, the historic significance of this \nbill.\n  First, the Medicare Modernization Act represents the most significant \nimprovement to the Medicare Program since its inception almost 40 years \nago. It also represents one of the great bipartisan achievements of the \n108th Congress. Because we acted, because this bill passed 1 year ago, \nseniors will gain access to more affordable prescription drugs, the \nmost powerful tool in American medicine today.\n  Up until passage of that bill, this powerful tool in American \nmedicine, prescription drugs, was not a part of the Medicare Program. \nThey were not covered under Medicare at all. To me, it made no sense. \nTo this Congress, it made no sense to deny affordable access to seniors \nto prescription drugs in this program if you are going to be promising \nit, if your obligation to them is true health care security.\n  Seniors and individuals with disabilities will enjoy better and more \ncost-effective care through disease management and chronic care \nmanagement because of this bill. They will have access to expanded \npreventive care, such as annual physical exams, because of this bill. \nThe overall quality of care will improve over time because Medicare \nwill begin, for the first time in the program, to measure and, indeed, \npay for quality performance.\n  We will also improve health care safety and efficiency through means \nsuch as electronic prescribing and other innovative reforms. We know \nthis whole process of electronic prescribing or e-prescriptions will \nhave a direct impact on reducing those unintended and unnecessary \nmedical errors. It will improve patients' safety for our seniors when \nthey receive their care.\n  Because we acted a year ago, seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities will soon enjoy true health security. I am pleased to say \nthat real help already is in place. The bill will not be fully \nimplemented for another year yet but already help is in place. Less \nthan 1 year after the Medicare bill became law, nearly 6 million \nseniors were already getting substantial savings on their prescription \ndrugs through that Medicare prescription drug discount card.\n  As an aside, if you are a senior and you are receiving prescription \ndrugs today, you are on prescription drugs today, and you do not have \nthat Medicare prescription drug discount card, please call 1-800-\nMEDICARE and talk to the Medicare representatives and ask them how you \ncan get that card because that card can give you immediate savings.\n  If you are a low-income senior, it is especially important because if \nyou sign up for that card before the end of December, you get an \nadditional $600 value on that card. I say an additional $600 value; \nthat is in addition to the discounts of 15 or 20 or 25 or even 30 \npercent that everyone gets on that Medicare discount card.\n  I have a couple of examples in my home State of Tennessee. Almeta \nChesney of Knoxville, TN, came to a drug card enrollment event I hosted \nin May. I had the opportunity to host several of these events across \nthe State to help educate our seniors as to the advantages of this \ncard. She enrolled in the prescription drug discount card program and \nis now saving over $230 every month. Before she had the card, before we \npassed the bill, she didn't have the card. She was having to pay an \nadditional $230 which she is not paying today. That is $230 in savings \nthat is in her pocket now, so she can save or invest or spend. Now, \n$230 a month is nearly $3,000 a year because of that prescription drug \ncard that she can get through Medicare, that she got through Medicare.\n\n  Mary Surber, 86 years old, also signed up for a card at an event I \nheld in October in Knoxville. She will save over $2,000 a year, a \nsavings of 87 percent of her annual drug bills. Again, this Medicare \nModernization Act in this first phase, where you can get that Medicare \ndrug discount card, has huge potential savings for seniors who are on \nprescription drugs.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act is helping younger Americans gain \naccess to more affordable health insurance coverage through portable \nand tax-free health savings accounts.\n  The health savings account, although we passed it in the Medicare \nbill, is available for people in this body, our colleagues. I do \nencourage my fellow Senators and other Federal employees to look at a \nhealth savings account. For the first time in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program, FEHBP, our health care program, you can have \nthat option of getting a health savings account. I look forward to \nlooking at it very closely, and I expect I will sign up for a health \nsavings account in the next couple of weeks, and I encourage others to \nlook at that.\n  The advantage of these health savings accounts--and, again, they are \nnew with the Medicare Modernization Act--is that they are portable. You \ncan take them with you. If you change jobs, the personal savings \naccount, health savings account, you can take it with you from job to \njob. If you don't use that savings account in 1 year, the good thing \nabout it is you can roll it over to the next year. So it has this \nrollover component. It has the savings component which grows tax free. \nThe interest actually grows, but you can put in money tax free and you \ncan take money out tax free.\n  So these health savings accounts are tremendous. They are already \ngiving younger Americans and others more control over their health care \nchoices and hard-earned dollars, health savings accounts, being a high \ndeductible policy coupled with this personal, portable health savings \naccount that did become rolled over.\n  All of this was in the Medicare Modernization Act that was all passed \nby this body in a bipartisan way over a year ago--almost a year ago. I \nam deeply thankful for the cooperation and the hard work and dedication \nof my colleagues in this body to overcome years of partisan gridlock. \nWe had hunkered down for years, having affordable access to seniors \nthrough Medicare, yet we never did it. It used to be just talk. But, \nindeed, a year ago we delivered that on the floor of the Senate. We \nfinally have offered seniors the security they need and the choices \nthey deserve.\n  I am very proud of our health care accomplishments, proud they \nprovide a platform to build on on which we can take our next steps to \nmaking health care more affordable and more available and more \ndependable for all Americans.\n  Although we are bringing, really, tonight--and we will come back on \nDecember 7 for a very short period--to a close the 108th Congress, I am \nvery excited about looking to that agenda in the 109th Congress on \nhealth care, where we address what bothers most Americans today, or \nwhat bothers most Americans, and that is the soaring cost of health \ncare.\n  That has a huge impact on the number of uninsured in this country, as \nwe look at issues such as medical liability, where in States such as \nFlorida and\n\n[[Page S11771]]\n\nOhio and Pennsylvania there is a medical liability crisis, a lawsuit \nabuse crisis which has a direct impact on raising the cost of health \ncare but, probably even more importantly, diminishing the access to \nhealth care in ways that are hurting people--hurting the quality of \ncare, hurting the access where moms or future moms are losing their \nobstetricians; where you have to worry, if you are driving through \nparts of Ohio or Florida that, if you have an accident, if you are so \nunfortunate to have an accident, that there might not be a trauma \nsurgeon on call.\n  Because of the impact these unnecessary frivolous lawsuits are \nhaving, it is driving physicians out of the practice of medicine, out \nof obstetrics. No longer can they afford to take a call at these trauma \ncenters.\n  We have a great foundation to build on as we address health savings \naccounts, health care security and prescription drugs for seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities. In that bill, we open the door to paying \nfor performance and paying for quality of ownership of health care \naccounts, of stressing chronic disease management, managing for \nillnesses such as diabetes and hypertension, of being able to look at \nhealth care in an integrated way of pulling all the little stovepipes \ntogether in a way to the benefit of individual patients.\n  There has been real progress in the past, and I look forward to a \nreally exciting future as we go forward to address this new agenda in \nhealth care that focuses on the individual patient, focusing on \nconsumer-driven medicines, focusing on provider-friendly health care \nthat is patient-centered and that is the model of the future, the model \nthat we will continue to work toward.\n\n\n                                 Sudan\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the fourth issue I want to mention is an \nissue that even before the last recess--I remember on the night before \nclosing the Senate down we had a period of time similar to this before \nthe final business and the final what we call wrapup was brought to the \nfloor--I was talking about this very same issue. I was talking about a \nsimilar type of issue a year ago, and I am going to bring it back to \nthe floor right now because it is an issue that is close to my heart. \nIt is an issue that affects me in profound ways. It is an issue that I \ndon't have the answer to yet, and no one does, but it is an issue that \nby continually focusing a shining light on it, by educating others, we \ncan change the course of humanity in this part of the world. This part \nof the world is the Sudan in Africa.\n  This week the Sudan Government agreed once more to make peace with \nits southern region. Civil war has gone on for about 23 years. About 5 \nmillion people have been displaced from homes. Over 2 million people \nhave died in this civil war which has now gone on for about a quarter \nof a century.\n  I have spent a little time in Sudan. I was there in August a couple \nof weeks before the Republican Convention, and I was there about 10 \nmonths or 11 months ago as well. I was there the year before that and \nthe year before that and the year before that. So the Sudan is close to \nmy heart.\n  While it is encouraging news that we are much closer to peace and the \ninternational community is hopeful, we still can't overlook a crisis. \nAgain, this is a north-south civil war on which we are making real \nprogress. But in the whole western part of this huge vast country of \nSudan is a region called Darfur. This Darfur region that is about the \nsize of France is a region that is in crisis.\n\n  For 22 months, the Sudanese Government has waged war against the \npeople of the Darfur region. Despite two United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions, pressure from the international community and \nneighboring countries, the government of Khartoum continues its \ngenocidal campaign. Last week Khartoum ostensibly agreed to halt \nattacks, but within hours of their agreement Sudanese police raided a \ncamp in southern Darfur destroying homes and driving out civilians.\n  Tens of thousands of innocent victims have died as a result of \ngovernment-sponsored violence, and 1.8 million more have been displaced \nfrom this Darfur region. Entire villages have been burned to the \nground. Women have been raped and children have been abducted and \nexecuted. Special United Nations envoy Jan Pronk warns that Darfur is \non the brink of anarchy.\n  We cannot stand by as the people of Darfur suffer. We cannot allow \nanother Rwanda. They are calling out to us. They are pleading for our \nhelp. We have a responsibility to act.\n  In about mid-August, I visited a refugee camp called Touloum in the \ncountry of Chad. The country of Chad is just to the west of Sudan and \njust to the west of this Darfur region, which is in the western aspect \nof Sudan. Touloum is several hours northeast from the capital \nN'Djamena.\n  I met with refugees and community leaders in this refugee camp. What \nI saw and what I have heard in Touloum in this camp was truly \nappalling. Thousands of refugees were housed in dust-covered tents. \nMany more lived in makeshift shelters of gathered wood and plastic \nsheathing. Some of the itinerant refugees just moving into the camp and \nwaiting to get into the camp had simple sticks with either clothes or \nsheets or rugs, pulled together and slept there for days waiting to get \ninto the refugee camp.\n  I remember the moms and many children running around, some way or \nanother. The children are fairly malnourished and having been on the \nroad for a period of time walking through the bush, what we call \ncachectic in medicine but skinny and clearly no muscle tissue at all \nand sunken faces but still smiling, still playing, and still \nfashioning, with a piece of balled up cloth, playing soccer.\n  There was a lot of dust there. The rainy season had not quite yet \nhit.\n  I had the opportunity to speak with a gentleman named Asman Adam \nAbdallah. In Darfur, he had been a man of prominence, an officer of his \ntribe, a government official. He was from a village called Jemeza just \nnorth of the regional capital of El Fasher.\n  During the attack on his village, he became separated from his \nfamily. That tends to be the rule. He didn't know if his family was \nstill alive. He didn't know how he would be able to go back to find \nthem.\n  He told me their story--recounting that he watched 15 people of his \nvillage killed one by one by one by one. It had taken him about 18 days \nto reach the safety of this refugee camp called Touloum.\n  Sudanese Government planes bombarded Asman and his fellow survivors \nas they trekked first to the Tine, which is a town on the Sudanese-\nChadian border.\n  Another refugee in that Touloum camp described how during a raid on \nher village several soldiers grabbed a baby to check and look at what \nthe sex, what the gender of that child was. The soldiers began arguing \nback and forth as to whether to kill that little baby boy. She \noverheard one soldier remarking but ``he is so young.'' It appeared \nthat the soldiers were under orders to kill all male children.\n  I heard of a mentally disabled 15-year-old boy being thrown into a \nburning house and an old paralyzed man burned alive in his hut. I heard \nstories of women raped in front of their own children.\n  I asked one refugee in Touloum what would it take for him to go home. \nHe said to me: I will go if you come with me and stay with me.\n  The Janjaweed attacks described to me were disturbingly similar. The \nJanjaweed are preceded by aerial attacks by Government planes flying \noverhead.\n  In some cases, soldiers in government uniforms participate on the \nground and they made references, according to these witnesses and the \nvillagers whom we talked to, references to orders from Khartoum. \nSurvivors tell of racial slurs being probed at them as the Janjaweed \nswept through their villages, killed the men, killed the boys, and \nrazed the homes.\n  The dictatorship in Khartoum claims it has no control over the \nJanjaweed, but I believe otherwise. I believe if they were sincere in \ntheir efforts to make peace, peace indeed would be at hand. The direct \nline between the Government of Sudan, the Janjaweed, and the raping, \nthe pillaging and murder is so direct that I am convinced, with an \norder from the top, the crisis would stop. It would immediately end.\n  The regime in Khartoum, however, has cynically concluded it can \nsurvive a moderate amount of diplomatic pressure and continue the \ngenocide. I refer,\n\n[[Page S11772]]\n\nagain, to this to be ``genocide.'' Indeed, it was in the Senate that, \nthrough a resolution which was unanimously accepted, we called it \ngenocide. That is what it is.\n  Khartoum seems to believe it can ignore the mostly rhetorical \npressure that has been brought to bear by the international community. \nThat, unfortunately, has been what the international community has \ndone. The light has been shone on the tragedy that has occurred there, \nbut the response from the international community has not yet been as \nstrong or as bold as it must be.\n  Khartoum believes the threat of a Chinese veto at the United Nations \nSecurity Council will protect it from more serious sanctions. We have \nto prove them wrong.\n  About 7 years ago I first went into Sudan. Osama bin Laden left Sudan \nabout 1996 and shortly thereafter I had the opportunity to first go \ninto the Sudan as part of a medical mission team. I have been able to \nvisit the Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and now Chad, the countries surrounding \nSudan, as part of this medical mission work. A little hospital called \nLui in southern Sudan that I visited this August now sees about 40,000 \npatients a year. There is still no running water there, and there is \nstill no electricity. There is a generator, but there is still no \nvillagewide electricity. It is in the southern region of Sudan.\n  The first few times we flew into that area, there was no hospital, or \nthe hospital had been locked up, with landmines all around, for about \n18 years, and we could not operate in the little hospital. That has \nbeen closed down for almost two decades. So the first operations were \nperformed in a little schoolhouse. I remember vividly driving up and \nthey said, this is where you will be operating. It was clearly a little \nschoolhouse because you walked into the room we were operating in the \nnext day and there was a big chalkboard there. There was a chalkboard \non the opposing wall, literally. Within 24 hours we did those first \noperations.\n  After a couple of years operating in the schoolhouse, the landmines \nwere taken out. It was demined. The old hospital was demined. Today, as \nI said, from the first few patients, almost 40,000 patients were seen \nlast year, with thousands of operations performed, still under \nprimitive conditions.\n  Once you have a health care entity or a doctor-patient relationship \nor surgery being performed, all of a sudden trust is reestablished. And \nalthough there was no village there at the time because people had been \ndisplaced from their homes and driven back into the surrounding hills, \nonce that doctor-patient relationship began, soon thereafter a little \ncommercial activity started and people would come and camp outside the \nfacility. Then the next year I would go back and instead of having one \nlittle cart there selling tobacco or maize, there would be five or six. \nThe next year there would be 30. Now there is a huge market. Now there \nis a church that has opened and a school that has opened. It has become \na village now with people coming from hundreds of miles around to this, \nstill, only full-service hospital or clinic in southern Sudan.\n\n  In the southern Sudan, this region of Lui, I also had the opportunity \nto go up to the Nuba mountains, which was an interesting first trip for \nme because the Nuba mountains had been closed for a period of time to \nall aid. There was no United Nations aid coming in because the \nGovernment at that time--again, this was 6 or 7 years ago--said it was \ntoo dangerous and they would not let relief agencies go in. I had the \nopportunity to go in. The fact I could get in--at the time I was a U.S. \nSenator but predominantly traveling as a medical missionary--it was \nsafe enough for us, so aid could go in and aid is going in from around \nthe world to that part of the world.\n  I had the opportunity to go to Bapong, a town in the upper west. I \nremember flying into Bapong and we treated a patient right off the \nfield we landed in. Somebody brought a patient there. I remember \nvividly the patient would have died, if we had not come in, because of \na huge abscess, infection, in his thigh. I remember it so vividly. By \nthat very simple procedure, very, very simple procedure, this man's \nlife was saved. In fact, as a surgeon, it was a very easy procedure, \nbut there was a medic--we called him a medic; a medicine man--no formal \ntraining, who was responsible for the villagers. Because of \nsuperstition and because he had never done it, he did not know how far \nhe could actually cut with the knife and the patient still be able to \nlive. By grabbing his hand and my hand wrapped around his hand, it gave \nhim confidence to go a little bit deeper. When we went a little bit \ndeeper, the infection was released. I remember the joy in his face \nbecause he realized that action, indeed, had in essence saved this \npatient's life.\n  In Bapong, I was told by regional leaders that the government was \ndeliberately targeting civilians and denying them basic medical needs. \nTen days after my visit, government forces attacked Bapong and killed \n2,000 people.\n  It is long past time for the Sudanese Government to cease and desist \nactivities that have resulted in civil war and punishment. Countless \ninnocent people have died. Now the crisis is risking--I hope it does \nnot occur--but there is a risk of it spilling over into neighboring \ncountries.\n  This fall, the Senate and House unanimously passed resolutions \npressing for the immediate suspension of Sudan's membership on the \nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights. All 535 legislators, 100 in \nthis body and 435 in the House of Representatives, agreed that Sudan's \nmembership on a commission to protect human rights is a travesty, a \ncruel trick at the same time that such oppression and death is going on \nin the Darfur region. It defies all decency that a nation that is \nactively engaged in genocide against its own people could occupy a \nposition of honor and authority on a commission in the United Nations \ndevoted to human rights. It does not make sense. It is wrong.\n  I applaud the President and Secretary Colin Powell for their effort \nto bring accountability to the Khartoum Government. This administration \nhas shown immense leadership in addressing the crisis in Darfur. The \nUnited States is providing over 80 percent of the supplies flowing to \nDarfur in eastern Chad. It is something that we as a Nation should be \nproud of, we are proud of.\n  Since February of 2003, we, this body, our Government, have provided \n$218 million for Sudan. The Senate foreign operations bill provides \n$611 million more for fiscal year 2005 and an additional $75 million \nfor African Union peacekeeping activities.\n  In September, Secretary Powell came before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and unflinchingly declared the situation in Darfur \nto be government-sponsored genocide.\n  Last month, the President authorized the use of three C-130 transport \nplanes to convey 3,300 Rwandan and Nigerian peacekeeping troops into \nDarfur. We have much to be proud of, but there is much more to do.\n  The United Nations Security Council is concluding its 2-day meeting \nin Nairobi, Kenya, right now. During this week's meeting, council \nmembers discussed all sorts of approaches, mainly carrot-and-stick \napproaches, to bringing Khartoum into compliance with those \ninternational human rights standards.\n  U.N. Ambassador Jack Danforth, a former colleague of ours from this \nbody, has worked hard to press the U.N. to take bold and concrete \naction. I support him with every fiber in my body for this critical \nwork, for this difficult work, for this challenging work.\n  As you can tell, I am deeply committed to the future of the Sudanese \npeople. I will be back there on a regular basis. What I learn, I do \nbring back to this floor. And whether it is translating it into our \nSudan Peace Act of years ago, or into our observations and declaration \nof genocide in the Darfur region, or increasing aid to that part of the \nworld to facilitate peace, or to support the tremendous leadership and \ntremendous work of Ambassador Danforth, we must be there as a nation. \nAnd we will be there as a Senate.\n  The plight of the Sudanese people calls out to all freedom-loving \nnations, not just to the United States. So I encourage other nations to \nlook, to observe, but then to act, and to assist or work side by side \nwith the United States of America as we address these challenges.\n  As a Senator speaking on this floor, as a physician, as a doctor, as \na human\n\n[[Page S11773]]\n\nbeing who cherishes life, I believe it is our duty to answer that call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11773-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CLEAN WATER\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am going to mention one final topic as we \nwait for the final wrapup business to be concluded. It is a topic that \nis related to the topic I just discussed because it centers on the \ncontinent of Africa. It focuses on a different issue, but an issue that \nhas real global consequence.\n  I traveled to Africa last year with our colleagues from this body, \nSenator Warner, Senator DeWine, Senator Enzi, Senator Alexander, and \nSenator Coleman. We visited a project to bring clean water to people. \nThis was down in the southern part of Africa in Mozambique. The project \nis to get clean water to the village of Tshalala, Mozambique.\n  This particular project is funded by a wonderful organization whose \nleadership I admire tremendously, supported by generous people all over \nthis country, indeed, around the world, the group called Living Water \nInternational.\n  Now, this was out in the bush. It was out in a very rural area. The \nproject was located in a neighborhood that was small. It was a very \ndusty, very poor neighborhood. But that neighborhood had clean water, \nand it came from a simple well with a hand pump. We all pumped from \nthis well. It functioned easily. It became the whole centerpiece, of \ncourse, and the real focus for that entire community.\n  Access to clean water is a women's issue. It is a public health \nissue. It is a sanitation issue. But I started by saying it is a \nwomen's issue because it is the women in Africa--all over the continent \nin Africa, in Mozambique and in Tshalala--who, before having a well, \nwould be the ones who would walk for, not just minutes, but hours in \norder to get water for their family. But women in that part of Tshalala \ndid not have to walk miles with jugs of water to provide for their \nfamilies. Instead, the well supplied their households with clean \ndrinking and bathing water.\n  What Living Water International does is very simple. It teaches \nresidents to drill wells. It trains them in sanitation and equips them \nwith the tools and knowledge to maintain water equipment.\n  The pump we saw in Tshalala cost, in American dollars, about $2,800. \nIt improves the standard of living. It spares many of the women that \nbackbreaking labor. It saves them time and allows them to be with their \nchildren. This well saves the lives of dozens of villagers.\n  From a public health standpoint, from a sanitary standpoint, it saves \nlives. It is exactly the sort of resource that is lacking in much of \nthe world. Clean water ranks high among the world's health problems. \nThe statistics are staggering. They should alarm any person of \nconscience.\n  What are they? According to the World Health Organization, over 1.8 \nmillion people die each year as a result of diarrheal disease. Almost \nall of it is caused by waterborne illness--1.8 million people.\n  Over 40 percent of the world's population, most of it in undeveloped \nregions of Africa and Asia, live without access to clean water. Without \nintervention, the problem could get much worse. In the next 50 years, 3 \nbillion people will join the human family. Most will live in areas that \nlack clean water.\n  Economies in the poorest regions of the world will be unable to \ndevelop unless good water systems are in place. Agriculture alone \nconsumes anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of available water supplies. \nManufacturing, likewise, is nearly impossible without clean water.\n  Just as important, unsafe water poses a clear security threat. Water \nbasins do not follow national borders, and conflict over them will \nescalate as safe water becomes even scarcer. These conflicts may come \nto threaten our own national security.\n  Modest, pragmatic, clean water projects that yield real measurable \nbenefits will make things better. While we would like to build First \nWorld water systems everywhere, we obviously have to acknowledge limits \nof time and resources.\n  Over the last several decades, the United States, the United Nations, \nJapan, and dozens of other nations and organizations have worked to \nbring the world clean water. Despite sincere efforts, we have not made \nenough progress. There is much more to be done. Access to clean water \nhas even declined in some parts of the world.\n  Our experiences in Africa showed us the magnitude of the problem we \nface. They offer four important lessons about how we can improve access \nto clean water, to safe water, to healthy water around the globe.\n  First, any strategy must involve the entire community that it serves.\n  Local businesses, nonprofits, and individuals should own, maintain, \nand improve the water sources that serve them. Without adequate local \nsupport and local expertise, water systems will fall apart.\n  We should also promote cost-sharing with water users to create a \nsense of ownership. At the Tshalala well, for example, community \nmembers contribute 5 percent of the total cost toward maintenance.\n  Second, the U.S. and other developed nations must mobilize both \npublic and private resources to confront this problem.\n  This may require legislative action. A strategy should leverage \nresources to increase our projects' scale and avoid duplication of \neffort. Private organizations can provide a vast reserve of \nhumanitarian and hydrological expertise. We should work to build \ncoalitions of governments, international organizations, water \nutilities, and other private enterprises, foundations, scientific \ninstitutions, and NGOs.\n  Third, education should play a key role in any strategy.\n  Simple hand washing, for example, prevents disease transmission. But \na single set of dirty hands can contaminate an entire water source. \nThis aspect is going to take more than simple outreach. Real hygiene \nimprovements will happen only if people have access to adequate, \nreliable, convenient water resources.\n  Fourth, where appropriate, clean water should rank high among our \nhealth aid priorities.\n  The developed world spends billions on health aid. Health care \nprofessionals have long understood the strong connection between clean \nwater, basic sanitation, and good health.\n  Last year, USAID spent less than $325 million for international \ndrinking water supply and sanitation. Less than $20 million of this \namount went to Africa--the very region that has the most severe water \ncrisis. Clearly, these are inadequate sums.\n  Our large and worthy investment in the battle against HIV/AIDS in \nAfrica and around the world cannot succeed without clean water; they \nare interrelated. And neither can our vision for a safer, healthier, \nand more prosperous world.\n  The people of the world need clean water to live. They deserve it. \nWith our help and firm commitment, they can get it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11773-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to applaud \nPresident Bush on his nomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice for Secretary \nof State. She is an outstanding choice, and the American people are \nfortunate to have a public servant of her talent and intellect.\n  During her tenure as National Security Advisor, Dr. Rice has been a \nsteady and trusted confidant to the President. In her role of crafting \npolicy and helping guide decision making, she has demonstrated \nextraordinary skill. But this should come as no surprise.\n\n[[Page S11774]]\n\nDr. Rice is a woman of remarkable accomplishments. Throughout her life, \nshe has applied her razor sharp mind and steely determination to reach \nthe highest peaks of achievement.\n  Dr. Rice was born in 1954 in Birmingham, AL. By the age of 3 she was \nalready a piano prodigy playing hymnals for her family. By age 5, she \nwas playing beside her mother on the church organ bench.\n  At 19, Condoleezza earned her bachelors degree in political science \ncum laude, Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Denver and a year \nlater, her Master's from Notre Dame. And at the young age of 26, having \nearned her Ph.D., Dr. Rice became an assistant professor at Stanford \nUniversity.\n  A decade later, Dr. Rice was elevated to the post of Provost, \nessentially the chief operating officer of the University.\n  From 1989 to 1991, Dr. Rice served the first Bush administration as \nDirector, and then senior Director, of Soviet and East European Affairs \nat the National Security Council.\n  During this time, Dr. Rice brought her considerable expertise in \nEastern European affairs to the administration's handling of the \ncollapse of the Berlin Wall, Germany's reunification, and the \ntransition of the Soviet Union to the Russian Federation. This, \ncombined with her years of foreign policy experience, particularly in \nthe post 9/11 context, make her distinctly qualified to lead the \nDepartment of State.\n  As the President said in his announcement, we are a Nation at war. As \nSecretary of State, Dr. Rice will have the responsibility of advancing \ndemocracy and freedom across the globe, not only to protect us from \nattack, but to fulfill America's unique moral purpose.\n  Outlaw regimes must be confronted. Dangerous weapons proliferation \nmust be stopped. Terrorist organizations must be destroyed. Dr. Rice \nhas both the ability and experience, from fighting the Cold War to the \nWar on Terror, to meet these daunting challenges.\n  Dr. Rice possesses a rare combination of management and \nadministrative experience, public policy expertise, high academic \nscholarship, and not least importantly, a graciousness that will serve \nAmerica's interests well. In these difficult and challenging times, \nAmerica needs a leader of her caliber.\n  Dr. Rice has said that growing up, her father John, and her mother, \nAngelena, taught her that in a country where racial segregation and Jim \nCrow were an ugly fact of life, she had to be twice as good to get \nahead. I think it is fair to say that she has surpassed this high \ncharge.\n  Dr. Rice is an author, classically trained pianist, ice skater, and \ntennis player. She speaks Russian fluently and is an avid fan of \nfootball. We are grateful that she has set aside, at least for the \nmoment, her ambition to become Commissioner of the National Football \nLeague.\n  A woman of deep faith in God, liberty, and freedom, Condoleezza Rice \nwill protect and serve our national interests. I should also note that \nDr. Rice would be the first African American woman to serve as \nSecretary of State.\n  I urge the Senate to give Dr. Rice their strong support. I hope and \nexpect to see her confirmed swiftly so she can begin addressing the \nurgent threats and challenges that face our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11774-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RALPH BOLING\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. \nRalph Boling, a fine Kentuckian who passed away at the age of 76 on \nSeptember 27, 2004.\n  Mr. Boling, a native of Hancock County, KY, dedicated his life to \nserving others. His service began with a stint in the U.S. Army. After \nprotecting his country, he returned to his beloved Hancock County and \nserved as an auctioneer, an oil-well driller, the Hancock County road \nforeman, and the superintendent of the Hawesville Water Works.\n  In 1970, Mr. Boling was elected sheriff of Hancock County. He served \nuntil 1973, was reelected to a second term in 1978, and served until \n1981. By taking this post, Mr. Boling was continuing a family \ntradition: Both his father, Claude, and his mother, Leva, had \npreviously served as Hancock County sheriff. President Ronald Reagan \nthen appointed Mr. Boling to serve as the United States Marshal for the \nwestern Kentucky district, a post he held for 12 years.\n  Mr. Boling resigned as a U.S. Marshal to run for judge-executive of \nHancock County. On November 2, 1993, he defeated the two-term incumbent \nwith over 58 percent of the vote; he carried each of the county's eight \nprecincts as well as absentee ballots. During his 5-year tenure, Mr. \nBoling worked tirelessly with people across party lines to put the \ncommunity first. He successfully closed the county's landfill and \npushed for the creation of the county's career center.

He was a member of Hancock Lodge No. 115 and served various \npositions in the organization. He was a member of the Fraternal Order \nof Police and was active within the Blackford Baptist Church. And one \nof his greatest passions was rooting for my alma mater, the University \nof Louisville basketball team.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to joining me in paying tribute to the life \nof Mr. Ralph Boling.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Tony \nCruise, the morning voice of WHAS radio in my hometown of Louisville, \nKY. His love of Louisville and his perseverance and dedication to WHAS \nis something to be commended. Tony and his family moved to Louisville \nin 1969. As a child, he fell in love with the city and the voices he \nheard on the local radio. While most members of the media community \nlong for the ``big time'' of New York or Los Angeles, Tony's dream, \nsince he was a young man, was to be the morning anchor for WHAS, home \nof such Kentucky radio giants as Van Vance and Wayne Perkey.\n  Tony received his first radio job at WWKY in Winchester as the \nSaturday afternoon disc jockey in 1980. His career almost ended after \nhis first show. Fortunately for future WHAS listeners, Tony was a quick \nlearner. He graduated from Eastern Kentucky University with a \nbachelor's degree in mass communications in 1982.\n  In 1992, there was a position available at WHAS. Tony wanted this \nposition so badly that he waited outside the station for station \nmanager Skip Essick to head home, so he could lobby for the position. \nHis persistence paid off, when that October, Tony was hired. He hosted \n``Sports Talk,'' a call-in show that mainly focused on the interstate \nfeud of athletic prowess between my alma mater, the University of \nLouisville, and the University of Kentucky.\n  In May of this year, Tony realized his lifelong dream, when he was \nnamed the newest morning show host at WHAS. Unlike many radio \npersonalities these days who love to offend, Tony is a decent, honest \nman who opens his heart to his listeners every morning. No wonder he is \nwelcome in so many Kentucky homes, including mine.\n  Tony is a friend of mine and I have been privileged to be a guest on \nhis show. It is a terrific program. The Louisville community agrees, as \nsome 120,000 people tune in to ``The Cruise-man'' as he is known, every \nweek. I enjoy and commend him for his excellent work.\n  I ask all my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Mr. Tony \nCruise for his outstanding contributions to the Louisville community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11774-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11774-S11775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES PATTERSON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nupstanding and generous member of the Louisville, KY, community, Mr. \nJames Patterson.\n  Born and raised in Louisville, Jim, as his friends call him, has \nalways loved two things: his hometown, and baseball. He attended the \nUniversity of\n\n[[Page S11775]]\n\nLouisville, also my alma mater, where he starred on the Cardinal \nbaseball team and graduated in 1955 with a degree in marketing.\n  After graduating, Jim served a stint as a Captain in the United \nStates Air Force and eventually returned to Louisville, which is also \nmy hometown, where he embarked on a very successful business career as \na restaurateur. Quite frankly, if you have ever eaten in Louisville, \nchances are you ate in one of Jim's restaurants. In 1959, he became a \nfranchisee of Jerry's Restaurant. Ten years later he founded the Long \nJohn Silver's seafood restaurant chain. Under Jim's leadership, Long \nJohn Silver's rose to number one in the country, and today is the \nlargest seafood restaurant chain in the world.\n  Jim helped found Chi-Chi's Mexican Restaurant, Rally's Hamburgers, \nand Western Restaurants. He has also founded the companies AmeriCall \nServices, Resource America and First Phone, worked with Gulfstream \nPetroleum, and currently owns Pattco LLC, a privately held investment \nvehicle.\n  Jim has always believed in sharing his success with the city he \nloves. In 1998, he founded School Choice Scholarships, a privately \nfunded program that helps low-income families pay tuition for their \nelementary-aged children to attend private schools. School Choice \nScholarships provide assistance for 650 Louisville youths, 250 of whom \nowe their scholarships to Jim personally.\n  Jim has finally combined his two loves, Louisville and baseball, by \ndonating a very generous sum to enable the University of Louisville to \nbegin construction on a new, $10-million baseball stadium, which broke \nground this October 7. In their gratitude, the university has named the \nfacility the Jim Patterson Stadium.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in paying tribute \nto Jim Patterson for his passion, kindness, and charity. He is a \nvaluable member of the Louisville community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11775-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JAMES C. RUSSELL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nKentucky's barons of bourbon, Master Distiller James ``Jimmy'' C. \nRussell. This year marks Jimmy's 50th year of service at the Wild \nTurkey Bourbon Distillery in Lawrenceburg, KY. Jimmy is so beloved at \nWild Turkey, they named one of their finest products after him in \n2000--the 10-year-old Russell's Reserve. I recently toured the Wild \nTurkey Bourbon Distillery, where Jimmy showed me the bourbon-making \nprocess personally. The bourbon distillery tradition in Kentucky dates \nback to 1789, and has been handed down through generations of \nKentuckians. Bourbon is truly a Kentucky product--named, in fact, for \nBourbon County, Kentucky. Ninety percent of all bourbon worldwide is \nmade in the Bluegrass State, and one of the most famous brands is Wild \nTurkey.\n  Jimmy was born and raised just 5 miles from the Wild Turkey \ndistillery, and both his grandfather and father worked there. Jimmy \nentered the family business in 1954 when he got his first job at the \nLawrenceburg distillery. He mastered the craft under Mr. Bill Hughes, \nWild Turkey's second Master Distiller, and Mr. Ernest W. Ripy Jr., the \nson of one of the original owners of Wild Turkey.\n  Jimmy is especially proud that the family tradition will continue, as \nhis son, Eddie, has worked at the Wild Turkey distillery for the past \ntwenty years.\n  Jimmy has become a legend in the distilled-spirits community over the \nlast five decades. He is a director of the Kentucky Distillers \nAssociation, and spends time as a goodwill ambassador for Wild Turkey \nBourbon. Throughout the Wild Turkey Bourbon Distillery, he is known as \na ``master distillers' master distiller.''\n  Jimmy is a respected figure in his hometown of Lawrenceburg. He is a \ndeacon at his local church and a supporter of Anderson County High \nSchool athletics. He also adores his wife of fifty years, Joretta, and \ntheir rose garden.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing Mr. \nJames C. Russell, Master Distiller, and his 50 years of loyal service \nto the Wild Turkey Bourbon Distillery and the Lawrenceburg, KY, \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11775-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the House has voted to \npass the Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement Act, the \nCREATE Act of 2004, sending this important and needed legislation to \nthe White House for the President's signature. This past March, I \njoined with Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl, and Senator Feingold \nintroducing the CREATE Act, which will provide a needed remedy to one \naspect of our Nation's patent laws.\n  In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act, which encouraged private \nentities and not-for-profits such as universities to form collaborative \npartnerships that aid innovation. Prior to the enactment of this law, \nuniversities were issued fewer than 250 patents each year. Thanks to \nthe Bayh-Dole Act, the number of patents universities have been issued \nin more recent years has surpassed 2,000--adding billions of dollars \nannually to the U.S. economy.\n  The CREATE Act corrects a provision in the Bayh-Dole Act which, when \nread literally, runs counter to the intent of that legislation. In \n1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled, \nin Oddzon Products, Inc. v. Just Toys, Inc., that non-public \ninformation may in certain cases be considered ``prior art''--a \nstandard which generally prevents an inventor from obtaining a patent. \nThe Oddzon ruling was certainly sound law, but it was not sound public \npolicy, and as a result some collaborative teams have been unable to \nreceive patents for their work. As a consequence, there is a deterrent \nfrom forming this type of partnership, which has proved so beneficial \nto universities, the private sector, the American worker, and the U.S. \neconomy.\n  Recognizing Congress' intended purpose in passing the Bayh-Dole Act, \nthe Federal Circuit invited Congress to better conform the language of \nthe act to the intent of the legislation. The CREATE Act does exactly \nthat by ensuring that non-public information is not considered ``prior \nart'' when the information is used in a collaborative partnership under \nthe Bayh-Dole Act. The bill that the House passed today also includes \nstrict evidentiary burdens to ensure that the legislation is tailored \nnarrowly so as only to achieve this goal that--although narrow--is \nvitally important.\n  I also wish to draw attention to Senator Hatch's statement of June \n25, 2004, in which he explained some of the more complex issues \nsurrounding the CREATE Act. I agree entirely with his comments, which I \nwill prove useful for those seeking a background understanding of this \nlegislation.\n  Again, I thank the House for moving to pass this legislation as the \n108th Congress drew to a close, and I would also like to thank in \nparticular Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl, Senator Feingold, Senator \nGrassley, and Senator Schumer for their hard work in gaining this \nbill's passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11775-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Corporal Jarrod L.

Only 2 weeks after his graduation from Shenandoah High \nSchool, Maher became a marine. Corporal Maher is survived by his father \nand mother, Kevin and Jacque Maher, as well as numerous siblings.\n  Jarrod Maher will be missed by a great many people. His service and \nsacrifice represent Iowa at its best. In describing him, his father, \nKevin Maher said, ``He loved being a Marine, but he also loved coming \nhome. He loved the farm. He loved to help.'' In honor of Jarrod's \nspirit of selflessness, I ask my colleagues in the Senate and my fellow \nAmericans to join me in paying respect to Marine Cpl Jarrod Maher.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11776-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11776]]\n              INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I express my support for the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act conference report that passed the \nSenate yesterday. It is not a perfect bill, but I believe it represents \na fair balance of the concerns of schools and parents of children with \ndisabilities. Above all, it upholds the rights of all children with \ndisabilities to a free, appropriate education in our public schools. It \npromises them access to a high quality education to help them succeed \nand live productive lives. And it includes strong monitoring and \nenforcement provisions to ensure that that promise is kept.\n  The bill includes several improvements over current law that will \nhelp secure the rights of children with disabilities and uphold the \nrights of parents advocating for their children. First, it holds \nschools accountable for educating disabled students by giving the \nSecretary of Education the tools to monitor how well States and schools \nare complying with the law and sanctioning those that fail to serve \ndisabled students. It provides flexibility and resources for early \nintervention and preschool services for younger children, and promotes \ntransition services for older students in order to prepare for their \npost-school years. It preserves the Individualized Education Programs \nto ensure that parents have quarterly reports of their child's progress \nand short-term objectives for those with the most severe disabilities. \nIt provides for more teacher training and strengthens teacher quality \nrequirements so that students are taught by highly qualified teachers. \nIt also adds options for parents and schools to work together to \nresolve disputes, but preserves the right to due process if a school is \nout of compliance.\n  At the same time, this bill also responds to many of the concerns \nraised by schools and teachers. It provides relief from unnecessary and \nburdensome paperwork so that teachers can focus their attention on \neducational services. It provides more opportunities to resolve \nconflicts and disagreements other than through costly and acrimonious \nlitigation. And it provides more resources for professional development \nso teachers are equipped to deal with the often complex but critical \nneeds of students with disabilities.\n  This bill also addresses the serious issue of discipline--an issue \nthat has caused many concerns over the years by both education \nofficials and parents of children with disabilities. The bill includes \na bipartisan compromise that clarifies and strengthens discipline \nprovisions so that schools can remove children who pose a serious \ndanger to themselves or others to an alternative setting, while \nensuring that those children continue to receive services. At the same \ntime, this compromise protects the rights of disabled children in \ndisciplinary action by preserving the manifestation determination so \nthat children are not punished for behavior caused by their disability, \nand continuing services if a child is placed in an alternative setting. \nI know that some parents are worried about these revised discipline \nprovisions and would prefer current law. I agree that we must continue \nto monitor these provisions carefully to ensure they are implemented \nfairly and with the best interests of disabled children in mind.\n  Despite these positive features, I am very disappointed that this \nbill does not move us any closer to fully funding IDEA. When IDEA was \nfirst enacted in 1975, Congress made a commitment to fund 40 percent of \nthe costs, in recognition of the added expenses schools would incur in \nserving disabled students. Today, the Federal Government is funding \nIDEA at the highest levels since it was created--but sadly, that \nfunding only covers approximately 19 percent of the costs. I have \ncosponsored and supported legislation that would require mandatory full \nfunding for IDEA, and as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I \nwill continue to fight for full funding of IDEA. It is past time for \nthe Federal Government to live up to its obligations.\n  The conference report is not a perfect bill. Clearly, there are \nprovisions that will trouble both sides--both the educational community \nand the families of disabled children. But on balance, I think the bill \nrepresents a real compromise and has great potential to lead to \nimproved educational services for children with disabilities. It \nattempts to create a balanced approach that recognizes the challenges \nfaced by teachers and schools, while still ensuring that all children \nwith disabilities have access to the highest quality education. I will \ncontinue to work to fully fund its provisions so that the promises it \nmakes will become a reality. This bill is worthy of the Senate's \nsupport and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11776-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11776-S11789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BOEING 767 TANKER LEASE\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke on the Senate floor \nregarding the investigation into the Air Force proposal to acquire \nBoeing 767 aerial refueling tankers.

Paul Wolfowitz,\n     Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Wolfowitz: I commend the Secretary of \n     Defense and yourself for the prompt actions you have taken \n     regarding the Air Force's tanker aircraft program, in light \n     of recent extraordinary personnel actions taken by the Boeing \n     Company. Your decision to require a ``pause'' in the \n     execution of any contracts to lease and purchase tanker \n     aircraft is a prudent management step.\n       Further, I concur in your judgment to task the Department \n     of Defense Inspector General, DOD-IG, to conduct an \n     independent assessment. However, I believe that the DOD-IG \n     assessment should go further than the review described ion \n     your letter of December 1, 2003. The DOD-IG inquiry should \n     pursue the trail of evidence wherever it leads, in accordance \n     with standard IG procedures. This inquiry should examine the \n     actions of all members of the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of the Air Force, both military and civilian, top \n     to bottom, who participated in structuring and negotiating \n     the proposed tanker lease contract which was submitted to the \n     Congress in July 2003.\n       Your recent actions clearly indicate that there are many \n     outstanding questions that must be answered before proceeding \n     with this program. I expect that you will consult further \n     with the Congress as you receive the report of the DOD-IG and \n     that no actions will be taken with respect to the lease and \n     purchase of KC-767 tanker aircraft until the Congress has had \n     an opportunity to review the DOD-IG report. Ultimately, this \n     program, as restructured, must be executed in a manner that \n     is fully consistent with Section 135 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-136).\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 19, 2004.\n     Hon. Donald H. Rumsfeld,\n     Secretary of Defense,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: On December 2, 2003, Chairman Warner \n     wrote to Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz to request that the \n     Department of Defense Inspector General (DOD IG) conduct a \n     thorough investigation of the KC-767A tanker aircraft \n     program. According to Chairman Warner's letter ``this inquiry \n     should examine the actions of all members of the Department \n     of Defense (DOD) and the Department of the Air Force, both \n     military and civilian, top to bottom, who participated in \n     structuring and negotiating the proposed tanker lease \n     contract which was submitted to the Congress in July 2003.'' \n     A copy of that letter is attached.\n       It was our understanding that the requested DOD IG review \n     would assess not only individual responsibility for any \n     allegations of criminal violations of law; but, equally \n     important, individual accountability for management decisions \n     and executive oversight. In essence, the Senate Committee on \n     Armed Services, in order to conduct its necessary legislative \n     oversight of the Department of Defense, needs to know what \n     happened, who was accountable and what actions must be taken \n     to prevent this situation from happening again.\n       It is astonishing to us that one individual could have so \n     freely perpetrated, for such an extended period, this \n     unprecedented series of fraudulent decisions and other \n     actions that were not in the best interest of the Department \n     of Defense.\n       We recently found out that no such managerial \n     accountability review has been undertaken by the DOD IG. \n     Rather, the DOD IG limited his review to determining whether \n     there was evidence to press criminal charges. We are deeply \n     concerned by this development. Given the Chairman's letter, \n     why was a decision made not to do this work?\n       Congressional oversight of the proposed contract to lease \n     100 KC-767A tanker aircraft, a contract which is now \n     prohibited by section 133 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, uncovered the most \n     significant defense procurement scandal since the Ill Wind \n     bribery and fraud\n\n[[Page S11777]]\n\n     cases of the 1980s. It is imperative that the Department take \n     actions to hold those responsible accountable. Otherwise, the \n     fallout from this Air Force procurement scandal will have \n     disastrous effects on the integrity of the acquisition \n     system.\n       In our view, an assessment of accountability should include \n     a review of all members of the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of the Air Force, both military and civilian, who \n     participated in structuring and negotiating the proposed \n     tanker lease contract. Most importantly, this should include \n     Secretary of the Air Force Jim Roche, and Assistant Secretary \n     of the Air Force Marvin Sambur. We reiterate the Committee's \n     request that the DOD IG immediately initiate such an \n     accountability review.\n       Again, we do not understand how one individual could have \n     amassed so much power that she was able to perpetuate such \n     fraud against the federal government and other actions that \n     were not in the best interest of the Department of Defense. \n     Where was the oversight? Where were the checks and balances? \n     At a minimum, the acquisition chain of the Air Force, and \n     perhaps DOD, was woefully inadequate. The fact that no \n     Departmental review of these questions has been conducted \n     raises significant accountability and oversight questions \n     that go far beyond this one case. We trust you will endeavor \n     to rectify the situation and hold those who are responsible \n     accountable.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin, \n       Ranking Member.\n     John McCain,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     John Warner,\n       Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 19, 2004.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, the Department soon will \n     complete the analysis of alternatives (AoA) for \n     recapitalization of the KC-135 tanker aircraft fleet, and \n     that portion of a broader mobility capability study (MCS) \n     related to aerial refueling. Based upon the recommendations \n     of the Defense Science Board, I accelerated, to November of \n     this year, the schedule for completion of these initiatives. \n     The AoA and MCS will be critical to our development of a plan \n     to recapitalize the tanker fleet, and to provide adequate \n     aerial-refueling capabilities for military aircraft over the \n     long term.\n       In structuring the AoA and MCS, we recognized that we \n     should base the recapitalization of the fleet on a thorough \n     and careful assessment of the ways in which we might perform \n     the aerial-refueling mission. To ensure that we consider all \n     viable solutions, the AoA addresses a wide range of \n     alternatives, from the retention and re-engineering of KC-\n     135E aircraft to the development of a new military tanker \n     aircraft.\n       Let me be clear: After we have selected an appropriate \n     alternative, we intend to require competition. No matter \n     which alternative we choose, leasing is not an option without \n     new congressional authority.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul Wolfowitz.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Defense News, Nov. 3, 2003]\n\n                            Full Disclosure\n\n       In March, Defense News published a commentary by Adm. \n     Archie Clemins, former commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific \n     Fleet. In it, he advocated a U.S. Air Force plan to lease 100 \n     planes from Boeing Co., which would modify the 767s for the \n     Air Force's aerial refueling mission. That a Navy man would \n     back an Air Force program is what made it intriguing.\n       What we didn't know at the time was that Clemins did not \n     write the piece. Nor did he think on his own to write it. \n     Nor, for that matter, did he even think to send it to Navy \n     Times, a sister publication, without prompting.\n       In truth, a Boeing representative came up with the idea, \n     asked Clemins to write it, and provided a writer to help get \n     the job done. Boeing also suggested where he ought to send it \n     and provided him the e-mail address.\n       Clemins says he was not paid for the article and stands by \n     what it says. We believe that.\n       But he acknowledged that prior to writing the article, he \n     had done some paid consulting work for Boeing, and that he \n     has since developed a more formal consulting arrangement with \n     the company. He said he made no effort to ``pull the wool \n     over anyone's eyes.''\n       In publishing the piece, regardless of who actually wrote \n     it, we provided a forum for the free flow of ideas. That is \n     the purpose of our Commentary pages.\n       But we failed to do some things we should have done. We \n     should have asked Clemins if he had a financial relationship \n     with the program or the contractor. We should have asked if \n     he had, in fact, written the article himself. And we should \n     have weighed his answers in our thinking, because that \n     information is essential to the context of his article.\n       Had we known those things, we might still have published \n     his opinion. But we would have included the other writer's \n     name and noted Clemins' relationship with Boeing among his \n     credentials at the end of the article. As it was, we merely \n     noted that he was the former commander of the Pacific Fleet--\n     true, but not the whole story.\n       Full disclosure is what we're after. Here, we fell short. \n     We will work hard to ensure this doesn't happen again.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Seattle Times, Nov. 18, 2004]\n\n           Lockheed Allegations Focus on Boeing's Chief Exec\n\n       Lockheed Martin has introduced evidence in a civil lawsuit \n     that allegedly demonstrates Boeing Chief Executive Harry \n     Stonecipher knew former Air Force acquisitions officer \n     Darleen Druyun gave Boeing preferential treatment in the \n     award of billions of dollars of Defense Department contracts \n     before she joined the company last year.\n       Additionally, Lockheed introduced evidence it says shows \n     Stonecipher and James Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing's \n     Integrated Defense Systems unit, attended a September 1998 \n     meeting with Druyun and Air Force Col. Richard McKinney in \n     which Boeing allegedly received details of a confidential \n     Lockheed proposal to provide rocket launches to the Air \n     Force.\n       Druyun received a nine-month prison sentence last month for \n     holding job talks with Boeing while still overseeing Boeing \n     business at the Air Force. She further admitted to awarding \n     more than $5 billion of Defense Department contracts to \n     Boeing in exchange for jobs for her daughter, her son-in-law \n     and herself.\n       Boeing and Stonecipher have been adamant that if Druyun \n     showed the company any favoritism, Boeing was not aware of \n     it.\n       ``The statements Ms. Druyun made in her sentencing papers \n     came as a total surprise,'' Boeing said last month.\n       However, Lockheed said in a court filing last week that it \n     has ``an e-mail written by Mr. Stonecipher admitting that \n     Darleen Druyun had favored Boeing in the past.''\n       It is not clear from the filing when the e-mail was \n     written. The e-mail itself was placed under seal by the \n     court.\n       Lockheed and Boeing officials could not be reached for \n     comment.\n       Lockheed is pursuing a civil racketeering lawsuit against \n     Boeing in Orlando, Fla., that accuses Boeing of using 40,000 \n     pages of stolen Lockheed documents to gain an unfair \n     advantage in a multibillion-dollar competition to provide \n     satellite launches to the Air Force.\n       Druyun was not tied to that case originally. But after her \n     guilty plea last month, Lockheed sought Boeing e-mails and \n     other documents showing contacts between Boeing and Druyun \n     concerning both the rocket competition and several other \n     contracts she awarded to Boeing rather than Lockheed.\n       In October 1998, the Air Force awarded 19 launches to \n     Boeing and seven to Lockheed.\n       The Air Force cited Boeing's lower price-per-launch as a \n     major reason for giving Boeing so many launches.\n       Lockheed said in last week's court filing that handwritten \n     notes of the September, 1998 meeting between Stonecipher, \n     Albaugh, Druyun, McKinney and other Air Force officials \n     suggest Boeing also received unfair treatment in the award of \n     those launches by receiving confidential Lockheed pricing \n     data.\n       ``The fact that high-level Boeing officials discussed their \n     proposal strategy and Lockheed Martin's pricing with Ms. \n     Druyun shortly before the final (rocket) proposal submission \n     is damning,'' Lockheed said.\n       The meeting notes, taken by David Schweikle, project \n     manager for Boeing's Delta IV rocket program, were, like the \n     Stonecipher e-mail, placed under seal.\n       U.S. Magistrate Judge Karla Spaulding last week agreed to \n     let Lockheed lawyers question a Boeing representative about \n     communications with Druyun on six contract competitions, \n     including the rocket-launch contract.\n       ``It may lead to admissible evidence about whether Boeing \n     had improperly acquired proprietary information of Lockheed \n     and others that it discussed with Druyun,'' the judge wrote.\n       Boeing lawyers objected to the judge's order, and a hearing \n     was set for next month to resolve the objections.\n       The Boeing attorneys, in court filings, said Lockheed's \n     request for information on Druyun is too broad, has nothing \n     to do with the case and is an attempt by Lockheed Martin to \n     concoct new complaints against Boeing.\n\n\n                Chief weapons buyer for Air Force quits\n\n       WASHINGTON--The Air Force's chief weapons buyer said \n     yesterday he is resigning to help clear the way for \n     promotions bottled up in Congress over a stalled $23.5 \n     billion plan to acquire Boeing 767 tanker aircraft.\n       Marvin Sambur said he had resigned as assistant Air Force \n     secretary for acquisition effective Jan. 20, or sooner should \n     President Bush's next choice for the job be confirmed before \n     then.\n       ``It's becoming pretty apparent that if I stayed it would \n     be very difficult for the Air Force to have anybody \n     confirmed,'' Sambur said in a telephone interview.\n       On Tuesday, Air Force Secretary James Roche resigned in a \n     move aides said was also designed to free up nominations of \n     officers whose Senate confirmations were held up by Armed \n     Services Committee member John McCain, R-Ariz.\n       McCain had blocked a range of promotions over the Air Force \n     proposal to acquire 100 Boeing 767 aerial tankers, which he \n     slammed as a government handout to Boeing.\n       Sambur was once the boss of Darleen Druyun, who admitted \n     improperly steering billions of dollars of Air Force \n     contracts to Boeing before joining the company as a\n\n[[Page S11778]]\n\n     $250,000-a-year vice president in January 2003.\n       A former president and chief executive of ITT Defense, \n     Sambur oversees the Air Force's $37 billion procurement \n     budget.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 3, 2003]\n\n                      John McCain's Flying Circus\n\n       No one denies that the U.S. Air Force needs more refueling \n     tankers. The only questions are how and when to get them. \n     Senator John McCain calls the Pentagon's answer, a leasing \n     arrangement with Boeing, an unsavory example of the modern \n     ``military-industrial complex,'' a mistaken argument he will \n     no doubt pursue today at hearings before his Commerce \n     Committee. It's hard to overestimate the importance of these \n     flying gas stations. Long-range bombers make it to their \n     targets only because they can refuel in the air. It was our \n     tankers that enabled coalition aircraft to circle high above \n     Iraq's battlefields for hours, providing ground troops with \n     the capability to call in immediate, precision air strikes on \n     emerging targets. ``Our tanker force is what makes us a \n     global power'' is the way the Air Force chief of staff, \n     General John Jumper, puts it.\n       Yet for all that power, America's tanker fleet is in sad \n     shape because the tankers are simply too old to keep flying. \n     The Pentagon is hoping to remedy this quickly by leasing the \n     tankers from Boeing, and three of the four relevant \n     committees in Congress have given their approval to the \n     contract. The fourth--the Senate Armed Services Committee--\n     will hold hearings tomorrow. Senator McCain's Commerce \n     hearings today are his way of trying to preempt approval by \n     running up his own Jolly Roger.\n       Let's hope he doesn't draw the fight out too long. The \n     average tanker is now more than 43 years old. During a visit \n     last year to Oklahoma's Tinker Air Base, then-Air Force \n     Secretary James Roche realized the urgency of the problem \n     when he peeled back the skin of a tanker being refurbished \n     and found the metal underneath disintegrating.\n       Age isn't the only problem. Not only will the new Boeing \n     767s be able to refuel all planes in the military's \n     inventory--unlike the existing KC 135E's--they carry up to \n     20% more fuel and three times the cargo. And the leasing \n     arrangement used to get them to the Air Force is similar to \n     the way foreign militaries buy planes, selecting off-the-\n     shelf technology and then signing a contract for rapid \n     delivery. This is how Israel and Singapore get the latest F-\n     16s five years before the U.S. Air Force.\n       We're as opposed to sweetheart deals as anyone. But it \n     seems to have escaped Senator McCain's notice that Boeing's \n     main competitor here, the European consortium that produces \n     Airbus, virtually defines corporate welfare. And so far as we \n     can tell, the e-mails between Boeing, the Pentagon and the \n     Air Force released by his committee last week seem to show \n     only that Boeing was lobbying hard for a multibillion-dollar \n     deal (surprise!) and that cost was a big concern.\n       In short, the real issue the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee needs to zero in on here isn't just overall \n     lifetime cost but value for money. The Air Force needs \n     tankers now, and the leasing arrangement was deemed the way \n     to get tankers into its hands most expeditiously, not least \n     because it bypasses procurement procedures that could stretch \n     out a buying decision for years.\n       Senator McCain and other critics like to talk about what he \n     says are the billions more that a leasing deal will cost over \n     buying these birds outright. Leaving aside the huge dispute \n     over the price tag, let's hope the Armed Services Committee \n     considers the costs our military might incur by not getting \n     these tankers as soon as possible.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            USAF e-mails on Boeing 767 Tanker Lease Proposal\n\n\n                       Originator, Date, Subject\n\n       Roche, August 07, 2002, FW: Crosby Finds a Home at EADS; \n     Bodie, Sept 04, 2002, Re: Fw: Defense Week Daily Update: \n     EADS: Our Tanker Offer Cost Less Than Boeing's; Druyun, Sept \n     05, 2002, Our friend; Hodges, June 20, 2003, FW: KC-767 \n     ``Savings'' for comment & Courtesy Copy of Memo; Wynne, June \n     23, 2003, Tankers; Weaver, May 7, 2003, 767 Lease; Druyun, \n     Oct 9, 2002, Tanker Leasing; Calbis, Nov 7, 2001, CBO has \n     questions about your scoring of the tankers; Roche, Friday, \n     November 28, 2003, RE: Tankers; Roche, August 8, 2002, Re: \n     hello?\n       Albaugh, Wednesday, September 18, 2002 8:03 PM, RE: Marvin \n     Sambur; Ellis, Tuesday, December 17, 2002 9:36 PM, notes from \n     jim Albaugh's meetings; Albaugh, Monday, June 23, 2003 3:00 \n     PM, FW: Roche mtg 23 Jun 03; Wynne, Tuesday, July 08, 2003, \n     Re: 767 and DepSecDef; Roche, Wednesday, April 16, 2003, RE: \n     Tankers; Roche, Nov 19, 2002, 767 Lease; Roche, Monday, \n     December 17, 2001 7:24pm, Re: 767 Leasing; Jumper, Tuesday, \n     February 25, 2003 8:58pm, Re: Offsets for tanker lease; \n     Wynne, Wednesday, June 25, 2003, RE: OSD(C) AND 767 LEASE; \n     Lemkin, June 25, 2003, OSD(C) and 767 Lease.\n       Roche, Tuesday, July 08, 2003 9:44 pm, Re: Footnote; Roche, \n     Tuesday, July 08, 2003, Lease; Roche, Wednesday, September \n     03, 2003, Re: Ken Kreig ltr; Wynne, Wednesday, July 09, 2003, \n     RE: FW: Footnote; Cleveland, 15 May 2003, 1913, Re: Interview \n     at NG; Jumper, June 22, 2002, RE: CNBC Interview--Tanker \n     Recapitalization; Sambur, June 17, 2003, FW: USAF Green \n     Aircraft Pricing; Sambur, October 10, 2002, RE: Tanker \n     Leasing; Essex, August 03, 2002, FW: Potential OMB Problems \n     with 767 Lease; Sambur, October 21, 2002, 767 meeting with \n     OMB.\n       Sambur, September 11, 2002, 767 Tanker justification; \n     Sambur, July 25, 2003, Re: SASC Tanker Lease Hearing; Sambur, \n     November 19, 2003, FW: Tankers; Zakheim, November 25, 2002, \n     RE: KC-767 Lease Delay; Wynne, July 08, 2003, RE: Footnote; \n     Walker, August 21, 2003, Re: Revised OMB Circular A-11; \n     Sambur, November 21, 2003, FW: 767 Update; Walker, Nov. 26, \n     2002, More Updates from GC; Wynne, June 24, 2003, Meeting; \n     Wynne, July 17, 2003, Good Luck.\n       Wynne, November 01, 2003, RE: Two Issues--Tankers and Ship \n     Funding; Burkhardt & Associates, May 3, 2002, WSJ; Roche, May \n     14, 2002, RE: Call from Boeing; Bodie, April 25, 2002, RE: US \n     News; Roche, December 13, 2001, Fw: 767 lease; Roche, \n     December 13, 2001, RE: Several items; Roche, March 30, 2002, \n     RE: Tanker story; Custer, March 30, 2002, NDAA; Jumper, April \n     9, 2002, RE: Tanker Article; Roche, April 28, 2003, RE:.\n       Bodie, January 2, 2002, RE: Dear Bob; Aldridge, May 16, \n     2003, RE: Boeing; Roche, May 13, 2001, RE: 767 lease; Bodie, \n     Friday, June 21, 2002 11:26 AM, RE: CNBC Interview--Tanker \n     Recapitalization; Druyun, Wednesday, October 09, 2002 8:17 \n     AM, OSD BRIEF TO LEASING WORK GROUP; Wynne, Tuesday, Jul 08, \n     2003, Re: FW: Footnote; Sambur, Tuesday, July 08, 2003 9:58 \n     PM, Fw: Tanker Leasing Report to the Congress; Sambur, \n     Tuesday, August 26, 2003 7:59 AM, $2B Issue with PA \n     Aldridge, Monday, November, 04, 2002 1:22 PM, Tankers and B-\n     52's; Spruill, Tuesday, November 12, 2002 9:22 PM, RE: Tanker \n     Leasing.\n                                  ____\n\n       Some of the following records are transcriptions made by \n     Senate staff of original documents provided by the Department \n     of Defense.\n\n            USAF e-mails on Boeing 767 Tanker Lease Proposal\n\n     From: James Roche\n     To: William Bodie\n     Date: August 07, 2002\n     Subject: FW: Crosby Finds a Home at EADS\n\n       Well, well.

Mike, I won't sign a letter that makes the \n     case that we shouldn't lease the planes. Ken Krieg's memo \n     attached is a cheap shot, and I'm sure has already been \n     delivered to the enemies of the lease on the Hill. It was a \n     process foul. And Ken needs to be made aware of that BY YOU!\n       I can't control the corporate staff on acquisition issues. \n     Mike, this is their way of asserting dominance over you. I \n     know this sounds wild, but animals are animals. Pete had \n     beaten them down. Now, they are taking you on. I'm sorry. \n     Expecting professional behavior from them is something I gave \n     up on a while back. Among other things, they are about to \n     cause us to embarrass SecDef, who having approved the lease, \n     will now have to explain why his staff is destroying the case \n     for it. I'll do whatever I can to help you, Mike, but it's \n     your job to get the corporate staff under control. If not \n     now, then they will overrun you whenever you ``don't behave'' \n     according to their desires. This is the same game they have \n     played for years. They and OMB are trying to set the Air \n     Force up to be destroyed by Sen McCain WITH OSD AND OMB \n     ARGUMENTS.

I sat in for you \n     at the SecDef staff meeting last Tuesday. As we went around \n     the table, Joe Schmitz (IG) mentioned the Boeing dismissal of \n     Sears and Druyun. The SecDef then asked if in light of that \n     should we take a second look at her involvement in any tanker \n     lease related matters in order to deflect possible criticism \n     from the SASC and unfavorable publicity. I said I thought \n     that was a good idea, and that we (the Air Force) would do \n     so. No further discussion on the subject occurred at the \n     staff meeting. After the staff meeting I scheduled short \n     separate meetings with Marv Sambur and Mary Walker for \n     Tuesday afternoon following my return from a meeting at CIA. \n     When I returned, I learned that Marv could not meet with me \n     at the scheduled time because he was in Mike Wynne's office \n     discussing Darlene's involvement with tankers. I then met \n     with Mary and asked her to think through the Darlene \n     situation, plus another matter regarding proper packaging of \n     material on the AFA situation that Schmitz had said was \n     required to be delivered to the SASC. Late Tuesday afternoon \n     I then talked to Marv Sambur and got his assurance that a \n     thorough review of the Darlene situation had been completed \n     and that there was no way Darlene had any influence on our \n     current plan for tankers. Furthermore, Marv said that a \n     letter had been prepared for the DepSecDef to send over to \n     the SASC indicating same, and notifying them of our intent to \n     proceed. At that point, I thought the issue was resolved. On \n     Wednesday morning I read the Wash Post article quoting Sec \n     Rumsfeld as saying he had asked his staff to do a review of \n     the tanker deal. I sent Marv and e-mail offering any help I \n     could provide, and he responded with thanks, but it was clear \n     that this situation had once again gotten out of control. I \n     am sorry to report the news to you, but felt you needed the \n     whole story as it unfolded.\n           Best Regards,\n                                                             Pete.\n\n     From: Wynne, Michael Mr. OSD-ATL\n     To: Roche, James Dr. SAF/OS\n     Date: Tuesday, July 08, 2003\n     Subj: Re: 767 and DepSecDef\n\n       Jim: I am hoping this is about unity of command. \n     Negotiations with OMB are down to a footnote.

I \n     suggest that you begin to probe whether there's sufficient \n     funding to start a multi-year late in FY04 and in earnest in \n     FY05. Not that we are done yet, IDA may surface changes that \n     make it acceptable, but some of the arguments that were \n     tabled make the case for tanker re-cap compelling.\n       If I had some spare change hanging around, I'd give another \n     supplier enough money to make a proposal for this as well. \n     I'm not saying to buy anything other than a proposal.

I now hear that your staff is telling \n     us that you are weakening. Please don't. Here is some food \n     for thought:\n       (1) Regardless of OMB, the deal is a good one for the \n     taxpayer.\n       (2) Every time we come forward with something good for the \n     taxpayer, the bureaucrats (including yours) feel that they \n     have to fight it (job security?)\n       (3) To delay for two years to do an AOA is simply silly. It \n     just means two more years of wasted repair costs on the E \n     models; a waste of taxpayers' money to some beltway bandit; \n     more bureaucratic delays by PA and an end which is \n     predictable.\n       (4) Since neither ships, trucks, or tiny planes can serve \n     as tankers, we will be looking at big planes. Guess what?\n       We're already there. We will waste money and have nothing \n     to show for it.\n       (5) Hey, we can extend the life of the E's and re-engine \n     them! We'll that doesn't pass Grant's lieutenant's test: it \n     means we will be flying 80 year old planes in a few years!!!! \n     Average age is now between 42 and 44 years. Re-engining won't \n     solve the inherent catalytic corrosion problem. More waste of \n     money.\n       (6) Gee, why didn't we for 50 or 60 or 70 year old Air \n     Force Ones? How many of our bureaucrats fly in such old \n     planes? I'm getting used to some in their late 40s, but I'm \n     not so picky! But, why don't we make the Navy sail 60 year \n     old destroyers? Or submarines? Because it's dumb.\n       (7) If we wait, there may not be a 767 line! Hey, can we \n     covert used ones. Here we go again. We can waste money with \n     half measurers that are penny wise and pound foolish. Why not \n     do the same for ships? OK, so we'll be forced to buy French \n     airplanes.\n       (8) To kill this idea in OSD is proof that there may be \n     words like ``acquisition reform,'' but they are hollow. The \n     bureaucrats want to keep doing things the same old way, \n     adding little value but lots of costs.\n       I can only keep my sanity by remembering Andy's advice to \n     me years ago: ``there are limits to the stupidity any one man \n     can prevent.''

Aldridge may deny he's been weakening, \n     but the smoke signals are thick. Aldridge interviewed with \n     Anne Marie yesterday, and although he wouldn't comment on \n     specifics of any deal and was keeping an open mind, he \n     indicated that in general terms he would have concerns about \n     leasing when/if buying was cheaper. That doesn't jibe with \n     his previous support for the lease from a NPV/cash flow \n     management perspective. In addition, the spores seem to be \n     pushing a ``what's the rush?'' line: buying is cheaper (we \n     ``exaggerate'' the purchase cost of a green 767), therefore \n     better; such a large expenditure requires more ``rigorous \n     analysis'' than the back-of-the-envelope assertions by the \n     AF, hence an AOA; the AF hasn't POM'ed for the lease, so how \n     serious can we be? There is no ``urgent'' need, because the \n     AF is starting to retire the E's next year even without an \n     immediate replacement, so why can't we be more deliberative? \n     Boeing will still be there, making airplanes, so what's the \n     rush? Anyway, Airbus could make planes with enough American \n     content if need be. I rebutted all these arguments with \n     Jaymie (as you did with Pete), but we might be in the `power' \n     phase with OSD on this issue.

To provide an additional measure of \n     certainty would set a new standard for the Boeing company \n     that we prefer not to set. All elements of this deal are very \n     visible and this would not be good for our other markets. Our \n     best customers have understood the Most Favored Customer \n     clause because some of them have seen these in the past but \n     these have been forward looking with no commitment to \n     historical pricing.\n       Second, we believe Boeing providing additional commitments \n     has little or no additional political benefit. I believe that \n     if the USAF attempted to stand behind a Boeing statement that \n     our enemies would unjustly attack Boeing's credibility.\n       Therefore, my proposed solution is for the USAF to stand \n     behind the facts which I see as:\n       The USAF is confident we have received a most competitive \n     price on the basic 767 aircraft. The USAF has ensured this \n     through multiple means:\n       (1) We obtained confidential information directly from a \n     major airline that validates we obtained a very competitive \n     price from a historical position,\n       (2) We obtained a Most Favored Customer clause that \n     protects the USAF on a going forward basis since it requires \n     Boeing to refund the USAF should they ever sell a 767 for \n     less than what the USAF paid, and\n       (3) The USAF has capped Boeing's earnings to ensure the \n     maximum profits they could\n\n[[Page S11784]]\n\n     make are in line with DoD profit guidelines, insuring the \n     USAF would benefit in the future should cost come in lower \n     than predicted. Should cost be higher, Boeing bares the risk.\n       With this firm, fixed price contract and Boeing responsible \n     for all development costs, we believe this agreement is \n     unprecedented in its protection for the taxpayer, and insure \n     not only have we received the best pricing possible, but we \n     will continue to obtain the best pricing from Boeing in the \n     future.\n           Regards,\n                                                              Bob.\n\n     From: Marvin Sambur SAF/AQ\n     To: Darleen Druyun SAF/AQ; James Roche SAF/OS\n     Date: October 10, 2002\n     Subj: RE: Tanker Leasing\n\n       Jamie Durnan stopped me this morning to tell me that OMB \n     ``will fight us to the death on the lease.'' I asked why and \n     he told me that they do not believe our numbers and their \n     analysis shows that it is better to purchase. (At the leasing \n     meeting the OMB number was about $50M favorable to purchase \n     out of about $18B fly away cost.) I told him that we admit \n     that the deal is probably a push but if we buy according to \n     the same funding stream as leasing, we only get 6 tankers by \n     2009 versus 67 by leasing. The quicker delivery acts as an \n     insurance policy against the unknown effects of aging and \n     accelerating usage. He thought that was a compelling \n     argument.\n                                                             Marv.\n\n     From: Bill Essex SAF/AQQ\n     To: Marvin Sambur SAF/AQ\n     Date: August 03, 2002\n     Subj: FW: Potential OMB Problems with 767 Lease\n\n       Sir: Our take on the OMB letter to Sen. McCain is below. \n     Mr. Daniels went out of his way to slam 767 lease even though \n     he does not really know much about it yet. Looks like an \n     interesting fight shaping up.\n           VR,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n     From: Marvin Sambur\n     To: James Roche\n     Date: October 21, 2002\n     Subj: 767 meeting with OMB\n\n       Boss: We spent three hours with Robin this AM going over \n     the issues they highlighted for discussion and additional \n     data. These topics were: Requirements justification, price of \n     the green a/c, why our proposal meets the requirements of an \n     operating lease and a better understanding of the legal \n     ramifications of a Special Purpose Entity that would hold \n     title to the tanker a/c. She was quite upset when she learned \n     from the introductions that Boeing was present to answer any \n     questions. When we saw her ``angst'' we told her they would \n     leave or we could have an executive session with government \n     only participants. She told us the damage was done and did \n     not take up the options we outlined to her. We invited Boeing \n     in to respond to questions she and her staff had and frankly \n     they were very helpful in filling in some details and adding \n     credibility. This was not a negotiation meeting and Boeing \n     was only to provide answers on the pricing. I expect she will \n     express to you her anger over Boeings presence.\n       Robin and her staff asked for additional data which we are \n     preparing to send over in the following read: What would the \n     AF budget look like per FY to purchase the same number of \n     aircraft being built and delivered under the lease? (The \n     insurance argument of getting the lease tankers 5 years \n     earlier with about the same net present value resonated with \n     her. In addition, the point that Boeing will stop producing \n     the 767 and if we delay, the price will rise considerable was \n     also a strong argument to her.) However, they believe our \n     price for the green a/c is too high and have asked for other \n     large airline purchases, config and what the discount was \n     from the list price. Apparently her staff made a bunch of \n     phone calls and claim their number is lower than ours but she \n     is the first to admit that she does not know the real \n     validity behind them. We need to give them the maintenance \n     costs of the 135s vs. The proposed 767 tankers. She will want \n     a separate session on tanker termination liability issues. I \n     believe we probably talked passed each other on this and I \n     have directed my staff to prepare very clear charts on this \n     to set the record straight. He also wants a copy of the draft \n     contract T's and C's. In addition, she directed we rerun the \n     numbers using a 6 years OMB discount rate in addition to the \n     15 year period. We have this and will give to them to OMB.\n       I expect she will call you. We firmly believe the \n     contractors attendance at the meeting was very helpful but \n     she will probably blast us for it. We will keep you posted on \n     our progress.\n\n     From: Marvin Sambur\n     To: James Roche\n     Date: September 11, 2002\n     Subj: 767 Tanker justification\n\n       Boss: I kicked off the effort to establish a ``need'' \n     justification for the tankers. Hope to have a conceptual \n     framework ready by the end of the week.\n       Spoke to Robin after the meeting to tell her that the \n     economic justification is not a slam dunk for either position \n     (purchase or lease.)

Where is the USAF money to fund \n     this lease?\n\n     From: Marvin Sambur\n     To: Pete Aldridge; Dov Zakheim\n     Date: November 22, 2003\n     Subj: KC-767 Lease Delay\n\n       Pete and Dov: I understand the suggestion we delay the KC-\n     767 lease two years has come up again at high levels within \n     OSD (though this time without necessarily paying to re-engine \n     KC-135Es) in order to do a format AoA. As a follow-up to my \n     recent e-mail on this subject:\n       A formal AoA will cost money, delay the program two years, \n     and still come up with the same answer we have today. There \n     are only a few aircraft that can serve as tankers, they are \n     already in production, and so analyzing their respective \n     capabilities and costs won't take long--in fact, it's already \n     been done and the results passed to OSD. What's left to \n     study?\n       For the last 45 days, OSD has had enough data to support a \n     decision analysis--all they really need is the A-11/A-94 \n     model we provided to determine that the deal is a good one.\n       A complete contract is not required for OSD to analyze the \n     lease; contracts are written to match the programs approved \n     and justified through analysis; our A-11/A-94 model is the \n     primary analytical tool upon which we are building our \n     contract; if OSD analyzes the model (which we believe they \n     have not done), they will be analyzing the proposed program.\n       If restarted negotiations in 2005 resulted in a real price \n     increase of just 5%, we will have to drop one aircraft per \n     year to live within our budget. This will add further cost \n     and stretch-out the KC-135 recapitalization effort two more \n     years in addition to the two-year late start.\n       A 5% price increase due to loss of negotiation leverage \n     will add more than $700M to the cost of the first 100 KC-\n     767s.\n       Bottom line: the penalty for delaying the lease we've \n     negotiated today could be substantial even without the added \n     burden of paying for maintaining KC-135Es. Please keep in \n     mind that the low-cost deal we have today is the result of \n     negotiating with a manufacturer suffering the impacts of an \n     industry-wide downturn. That downturn is not expected to \n     continue for another two years. As the facts show, our \n     negotiating team got a better deal on these 767s than a major \n     airline did with theirs with a 20-yr exclusive contract--we \n     likely won't do as well when the industry recovers. How, \n     then, would we explain this two-year delay to Congress?\n                                                             Marv.\n\n     From: Michael Wynne\n     To: Marvin Sambur\n     Date: July 08, 2003\n     Subj: RE: Footnote\n\n       Marv: At long last, this is the best that I could get--\n     relegating the non-available comparison to a footnote.

Among other things, the revised A-11 adds new \n     guidelines for distinguishing between operating leases, \n     capital lease the KC-767s requires that it be an operating \n     lease based on the definition provided by OMB ``at the time \n     of the lease.'' The statute does not state whether ``at the \n     time of the lease'' means when the lease is signed or when it \n     was first submitted to OMB for review, so it is possible that \n     the revised A-11 could apply to the KC-767 transaction. We \n     immediately engaged with OMB on this issue, and as of this \n     afternoon OMB has verbally agreed to the following: OMB will \n     issue a clarifying letter stating that the revised A-11 \n     applies only to transactions approved by OMB after July 25, \n     2003. At our request, OMB will then issue a letter addressed \n     to you stating that OMB approved the Air Force KC-767 \n     transaction prior to July 25, 2003, and therefore the revised \n     A-11 does not apply. OMB plans to issue the clarification \n     early next week and the letter to the Air Force by the end of \n     next week. If there is any change to this plan, we will let \n     you know.\n\n     From: Marvin Sambur\n     To: James Roche\n     Date: November 21, 2003\n     Subj: FW:767 Update\n\n       FYI.\n\n     From: Ty Hughes\n     TO: Marvin Sambur\n     CC: Scott Custer, Mary Walker, Daniel Ramos, Ted Bowlds\n     Date: Nov 21, 2003\n     Subj: 767 Update\n\n       Dr. Sambur: OMB General Counsel called DoD GC this \n     afternoon and asked for a legislative proposal to address the \n     obligation of funds for the tanker. OMB also asked what the \n     Air Force can with respect to obligation of funds if there is \n     no new legislation.\n       DoD has prepared language that would allow obligation of \n     funds upon delivery of the aircraft. The draft language would \n     solve the problem. It should go over this evening. OMB is \n     considering offering the language for inclusion in the \n     Omnibus Appropriations Act.\n       Without legislation, the DoD fiscal lawyer is still of the \n     view that the Air Force must obligate all of the funds for \n     purchase when the aircraft are ordered. We have scheduled \n     meeting for 0900 on Monday with the DoD lawyers to discuss \n     this.\n                                                        Ty Hughes.\n\n     From: Mary Walker\n     To: James Roche\n     CC: John Jumper, Peter Teets, William Bodie, Janet Therlanos\n     Date: Nov. 26, 2002\n     Subj: More Updates from GC\n\n       Boss: Welcome back! (With the thought you are reading this \n     after Thanksgiving . . .) Since I won't be here when you get \n     in on Monday the 2nd (I'll be on my way to give a speech at \n     the USAFE JAG conference . . .), I wanted you to have my long \n     list of accumulated updates so you can be current with the \n     issues we are working that are of known or suspected \n     importance to you. Don Fox will be covering for me until I \n     get back on Dec. 6th. This will fill you in.\n       767 Tanker Lease (legal issues):\n       While most of the lease terms have been agreed upon, a \n     number of terms have been elevated to SAF. The most important \n     ones include the following:\n       (1) A very significant issue just surfaced and may require \n     us to obtain additional legislation. Boeing representatives \n     told us the investors need assurance that the Air Force will \n     not terminate the lease agreement while the aircraft are \n     under the 3-year construction. We are concerned about the \n     fiscal consequences of such an assurance since 40+ aircraft \n     may be in various stages of construction at any one time. We \n     are analyzing this issue under the limited statutory guidance \n     for this program and past precedent, which is also limited \n     because leasing of major systems has been so rare. FI we are \n     unable to resolve this issue with the staff in DoD GC, we may \n     need to seek another provision in law to provide adequate \n     authority to meet our needs.\n       (2) Boeing wants a clause advising the government of the \n     tax treatment it wants reflected in the transaction. We have \n     told them that the tax treatment is a matter between Boeing \n     and the IRS, not the Air Force.\n\n[[Page S11786]]\n\n     Boeing is considering whether to seek a Revenue Ruling or \n     informal advice form the IRS. If they decide to go that \n     route, we may want to ask the IRS to expedite consideration \n     of their request.\n       (3) The bond rating agency wants the government to agree \n     not to initiate a bankruptcy petition against the lessor \n     until one year and a day after the final lease payment. While \n     we understand this is a standard provision in commercial \n     aircraft lease, DOJ, not the Air Force, decides when to file \n     documents (such as bankruptcy petitions). We will ask Boeing \n     to discuss this matter with the bond rating agency to see if \n     they can make an exception for a government lessee or lese \n     tailor the clause in a way that would not bind DOJ. If not, \n     we will work the issue with Justice.\n       (4) Boeing also wants indemnification under Public Law 85-\n     804 for ``unusually hazardous risks.'' You approved such \n     indemnification in the case of the 737 lease. However, \n     Boeing's request is now broader and the company seeks \n     indemnification for the lender and officers of the various \n     entities involved. The Air Force has not provided such broad \n     indemnification in the past. We are currently reviewing \n     whether we have the legal authority to do this and then there \n     is the policy issue of whether this is something we want to \n     consider. We also are working on the definition of unusually \n     hazardous risk in this case.\n\n     From: Michael Wynne\n     To: James Roche\n     Date: June 24, 2003\n     Subj: Meeting\n\n       Jim: Thanks for hosting on Tankers--flavor just right, but \n     I may need to borrow that reverse flak jacket yet.\n           Best,\n                                                             Mike.\n\n     From: Michael Wynne\n     To: James Roche\n     Date: July 17, 2003\n     Subj: Good Luck\n\n       Jim: I wanted to say again congrats to get to the next \n     phase fight on Tankers, likely less than the fight so far. \n     Good Luck as well on the nom and confirm process.

Here's the short \n     outside the beltway reaction. (If you want the long version, \n     give me a call)--\n       (1) Why the secrecy of your Wall street advisors? I think \n     you got lousy legal advice on that memo. (If the article is \n     accurate and you're using Wall Street advisors). You're the \n     client. I can't envision a circumstance under which whoever \n     is structuring this deal for you wants the fact that their \n     doing so is kept quiet. It's red meat to Congress to tell \n     them they can't know something.\n       (2) Claiming confidentiality is like claiming executive \n     privilege. Even if it's correct in a narrow technical sense \n     (and I'm not at all convinced it is) it only hurts you--\n     larger public case. You can't defeat the claims that you're \n     not disclosing something (by implication--something bad) (esp \n     from someone as visible as McCain) without real information. \n     I'd distribute a one page memo saying the per plane cost of \n     the lease will not be greater than x and have x be less than \n     the last lease Boeing did for some commercial entity--or that \n     x is y dollars less than the cost of a new tanker.\n\n     From: James Roche\n     To: Dr. Marvin Sambur\n     Sent: May 14, 2002\n     Subject: RE: Call from Boeing\n\n       I love Ya, Big Guy.

Had the Congress chosen instead to provide mulityear \n     procurement authority the NPV could favor purchase by up to \n     $1.9 billion. While this information affords a measure of \n     clarity in an equitable comparison of terms and NPV, it is \n     provided with the understanding that multiyear procurement \n     authority was not available and therefore not a viable option \n     for the Administration's analytical consideration.\n\n     From: Sambur Marvin Dr SAF/AQ\n     Sent: Tuesday, July 08, 2003 9:58 PM\n     To: Roche James Dr SAF/AQ\n     Subject: Fw: Tanker Leasing Report to the Congress\n\n       Boss.

As you \n     may recall Mr. Wynne told us that the AF should consider this \n     new money.

Further, decisions on FY08 actions can be \n     addressed in 2006. Finally, as an operating lease, we would \n     need some indication from Congress that they intend for us to \n     buy these aircraft for a buy-down scenario to become a \n     reality. The report did not commit us to the path, but \n     rather, committed the Department of Defense to exploring \n     options like these in the future if it becomes necessary, The \n     $2B excursion was one such option. We expect AF/XP to bring \n     this issue to your attention. We have already been working \n     with their actions to provide background, and to indicate \n     that this appears to be an initiative from PA, not from OSD \n     as a whole, or from AT\n           V/R,\n                                         Paul M.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues on \npassage of S. 2154, Dru's Law. After last year's abduction of Dru \nSjodin in North Dakota, Senator Dorgan introduced this bill to address \na problem with our sex offender registry. The problem is simple, yet \ngreat: There is no public national sex offender registry. Each State \nmaintains its own registry of sex offenders, but there is no national \ndatabase for the public to search.\n  I was pleased to support this legislation when it was referred to the \nJudiciary Committee and was happy to work with Senator Dorgan to \nimprove the language of the final bill. Dru's law directs the Attorney \nGeneral to make available to the public, via the Internet, a national \nregistry of sex offenders. It also requires each State to provide \ntimely notice to the State's attorney general of the impending release \nof a high-risk sex offender; and upon such notification, the State's \nattorney general is required to consider whether to institute a civil \ncommitment proceeding. States must intensively monitor for at least 1 \nyear any high-risk sex offender who has not been civilly committed and \nhas been unconditionally released from incarceration.\n  I want to thank my colleague Senator Dorgan for his dedication to \nthis legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11789-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11789-S11790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SENATE FAILS NATIVE AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that Congress will soon \ncomplete it's work on the remaining fiscal year 2005 Appropriations \nmeasures. While this bill is not perfect, it represents an important \nand sincere effort to work in a bipartisan effort to fund the nations \ngoals and priorities.\n  I am, nonetheless, sincerely disappointed that extensive \nauthorization language regarding the Small Business Administration was \ninappropriately inserted into this important bill. The inclusion of \nthis language is a deliberate and deceptive effort to circumvent the \nlegislative process. It prevents honest and important debate about \nimportant issues that face this Nation, and ultimately it characterizes \nan enormous failure on behalf of the bill's authors.\n  A quality SBA reauthorization bill could stand on it's merits. The \nbill's authors would come to the floor and deliberate these matters \nopenly. We would have an honest discussion about how to best serve the \nentrepreneurial interests of our country. We would pursue a full and \ncomplete review of these matters by all Members, and we would seek to \nenhance and improve the bill in every way we could.\n  Unfortunately, this bill is terribly lacking. So the sponsors have \nchosen to hide it in this Omnibus Appropriations bill and walk away \nfrom their responsibility to the entrepreneurs of America.\n  This is a shameful perversion of the legislative process. However, \nthese matters will become law, not because Congress has debated and \npassed this bill on behalf of the American people, but because it was \nattached to a bill funding nearly every spending program that exists in \nthe country.\n  The plight of the first-Americans and reservation communities is \namong the most glaring and disappointing omissions to this SBA \nreauthorization legislation. These communities remain among the most \ndisadvantaged and disenfranchised in the nation. They face significant \nbarriers to investment capital, technical assistance, and related \nentrepreneurial opportunities.\n  The concerns of Native Americans are not addressed in this \nlegislation. Their opportunities will not be enhanced in this \nlegislation. There will\n\n[[Page S11790]]\n\nbe no debate or discussion about initiatives to bring prosperity to \ntheir communities. In fact, any reference to Native American and tribal \nconcerns is utterly lacking.\n  This is a disturbing oversight, it is a tremendous failure, and I \ncould not be more disheartened on behalf of those who continue work to \novercome the serious challenges they face in bringing prosperity to \ntheir communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11790-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11790-S11793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BILL CLINTON--A PLACE IN HISTORY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, many of us had the opportunity to be in \nLittle Rock, AR, yesterday for the opening of former President Bill \nClinton's Presidential Library. It was an extraordinary and very moving \nceremony, and all of us who were there will always remember it.\n  That evening, to conclude such an extraordinary day, ABC News \nbroadcast a special edition of its popular television program, \n``Primetime Live,'' an hour-long interview of President Clinton by \nPeter Jennings about the President's new library, his years in office, \nand his plans for the future.\n  I believe all my colleagues will be interested in the interview, and \nI ask unanimous consent that a transcript may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Primetime Live--A Place in History, ABC News, November 18, 2004\n\n       PETER JENNINGS: Tonight, America's 42nd president. His \n     library, his legacy and his future. ``A Place in History.''\n       Hello, everyone. I'm Peter Jennings. And this is the very \n     modern edge of Bill Clinton's Presidential Library, on the \n     banks of the Arkansas River. We are here this week for a \n     first tour of the library. And a conversation with Mr. \n     Clinton about his presidency and about his future. The \n     building is, well, appropriately dramatic, for a man whose \n     presidency was dramatic and divisive, and full of \n     accomplishment.\n       CHELSEA CLINTON, DAUGHTER: I hereby present to you and the \n     American people, the keys to the William Jefferson Clinton \n     Foundation Center and Library. Thank you.\n       PETER JENNINGS: President Clinton calls this place on the \n     banks of the Arkansas River, a bridge to the 21st century. It \n     is the largest and most expensive Presidential library. This \n     week, Little Rock is crowded with people who are attracted by \n     the Clinton magic.\n       LOCAL RESIDENT, FEMALE: He's a uniter. And I just love him.\n       LOCAL RESIDENT, MALE: He's a credit to Arkansas, as well as \n     a credit to the nation.\n       PETER JENNINGS: With all the Democrats there, it has the \n     slight feel of a political convention. The people there from \n     Washington and Hollywood, and Arkansas, of course. In a \n     Little Rock concert hall, one of the President's friends \n     celebrates.\n       ARETHA FRANKLIN, SINGER: He seems to have the goodwill and \n     interest of all the people.\n       PETER JENNINGS: His recent heart surgery notwithstanding, \n     Mr. Clinton had several events to go to in the last few days. \n     The swearing in of public service volunteers at Little Rock \n     Central High School. And today, the dedication.\n       EMCEE, MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the \n     United States, former Presidents William Jefferson Clinton, \n     Jimmy Carter, and George Walker Herbert Bush.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER: Bill Clinton brought \n     insight, wisdom and determination to bear on the issues that \n     he addressed.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: Through his \n     indefatigable determination, not only did he lift himself and \n     his family up, he also went on to touch the lives of millions \n     of people around the world, as President of the United \n     States, giving them hope.\n       PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: The William J. Clinton \n     Presidential Library is a gift to the future by a man who \n     always believed in the future. And today, we thank him for \n     loving and serving America.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Bill Clinton has been planning his \n     Presidential library ever since he was in the White House. At \n     the beginning of September, for a few days before his heart \n     surgery, well, he might have missed the opening.\n       Is it true that if the prospect of death is suddenly more \n     apparent, that your attitude towards life changes?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: I think it's changed mine. \n     But not in the way it does some people. Apparently most \n     people have a period of depression. Perhaps because it's the \n     first time they've ever confronted their own mortality. But \n     since my father died before I was born, and I've been living \n     with death all my life, I have never viewed it with the \n     morbid fear some people do. On the other hand, if you dodge a \n     bullet like I did--and, you know, I was about to leave on a \n     21-day, 6-nation tour of Asia, to help my foundation and \n     promote my book. I think I'd probably have had a heart \n     attack. Might well have died. When that happens, you have to \n     ask yourself, ``Well, you got a little extra time here. What \n     are you going to do with it?'' And so, today, when I take \n     these hourly walks that are part of my recovery, you know, \n     when I walk past 40 trees, I can probably tell you what color \n     30 of them were. You know, I find birds that I used to miss. \n     I'm more alive to just the pace of daily life than I used to \n     be. And I'm very grateful for things that are easy to take \n     for granted.\n       PETER JENNINGS: First of all, has it turned out how you \n     wanted it to turn out?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Yes. By and large, it has.\n       PETER JENNINGS: You clearly love it.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: I do. You know, I worked really \n     hard on this. I literally approved every word.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Down the center of the library are eight \n     dramatic panels, each one a time line for a year of his \n     presidency. And on the back, interactive computer screens \n     that allow visitors to call up videos of important moments, \n     documents on policy, even the President's schedule, for every \n     day of his eight years in office. On the outer walls, 18 \n     separate alcoves. Each one devoted to a different theme that \n     defined his presidency. There is a huge amount of \n     interactivity.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Huge. A lot of it. Thousands and \n     thousands of things that people can pull up. But here, this \n     is how we dealt with the major religious, racial, ethnic \n     conflicts of our time. This is Northern Ireland.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Middle East.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: This is the Middle East and what \n     happened there. There're some artifacts there.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Former Yugoslavia.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: These are the Balkans. Bosnia and \n     Kosovo. And a letter to a person--I know how much you cared \n     about this. That's a letter I got from--you remember her? The \n     young girl that wrote the book.\n       PETER JENNINGS: I do. These are all leaders with whom you \n     worked.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: That's right.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Who was the toughest to negotiate with?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Oh, I don't know. All these guys \n     were my friends, you know.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Well, what does that mean, they were your \n     friends?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, I mean, they were my \n     friends. I liked them personally. And I felt that we were \n     always working for the same ends, even when we disagreed.\n       PETER JENNINGS: What was it like? For example, Boris \n     Yeltsin didn't speak English.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: No.\n       PETER JENNINGS: And did you simply become accustomed after \n     a while to having that third voice, the interpreter between \n     you?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: We had a wonderful interpreter, \n     who was there most of the time. An American. And I got to \n     know his Russian interpreter. And they became like a member \n     of our relationship. It's funny. You just learn to deal with \n     it. Yeltsin, I thought, had extraordinary strengths. \n     Everybody knows he had some weaknesses. But he was completely \n     committed to democracy. Completely against Communism. And \n     completely committed to having positive relationships with \n     the West.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Somebody told me the other day, sir--I was \n     in Ramallah for Arafat's funeral. This is a slightly \n     embarrassing question, perhaps. Somebody told me that when \n     you and he and Barak were meeting in those final days, he'd \n     asked you that if things didn't go well, that you not blame \n     him publicly.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: At Camp David in June, he asked \n     me that. And I said I won't, because we still have six months \n     to go. Let me tell you what happened. The reason that I put \n     in so much effort, and the reason I got so angry about this, \n     because we were also at the same time trying to end North \n     Korea's missile program, is that I personally asked Arafat \n     again, six weeks before I left office. I said, now, you just \n     tell me, I'm going to put a deal out here. It's going to be \n     really hard for Israel. And if you accept it, then we can say \n     that's the basis of a peace that we'll either finish by the \n     time I leave, or right after. I said, do you intend to get a \n     deal before I leave office? I said, `cause otherwise, you \n     gotta let me go to North Korea and Asia. `Cause I only have \n     six weeks left and I can't do both. It was the only time he \n     ever cried in my presence. He said, you have to do it. He \n     said, if we don't make peace now, after all the trouble that \n     you've taken and all the things we've done together, it'll be \n     another five years and countless deaths before we make peace. \n     So, I took him at his word. I stayed. I got the deal. I think \n     he intended to do it. But for whatever reason, he didn't.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Nelson Mandela.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: He's wonderful. And you know, his \n     image is as the world's saint. The truth is, he's a saintly \n     man but he's also a very tough and shrewd politician. And a \n     very, very loyal friend. He is a ferociously loyal friend. \n     And he was fabulous to me the whole time I was there. And he \n     was a great President. But these are just people from around \n     the world that I had good relationships with, that I think \n     are fascinating and that I admired. Of course, Rabin and \n     Hussein I just love. I loved Rabin as much as I ever loved \n     another man. I had\n\n[[Page S11791]]\n\n     an unusual relationship with him. And I never met anybody \n     like him.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Can I ask you a couple questions about \n     Iraq? You said at one point, I'm not precisely sure when, \n     that Iraq will do pretty well when Saddam Hussein is gone. \n     Want to revise that at all?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, I think that even I \n     underestimated the level of opposition, at least given the \n     troop strength we had there. You know, my position on the \n     Iraq war was different from almost everybody else's that I've \n     heard talking. And I supported giving the President the \n     authority to take action against Saddam Hussein, if he did \n     not cooperate with the UN inspectors or if he was found to \n     have had weapons of mass destruction he wouldn't give up. I \n     did believe that the Administration made a mistake going to \n     war when they did. And that's what alienated the world. And \n     most Americans still haven't focused on this.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Iraq does not look good at the moment. Do \n     you think the United States could lose there?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Oh, I suppose we could. But I \n     don't think we will. I don't think we will. I think that the \n     President's re-election gives him an opportunity, first of \n     all, to ask for and get more help from other countries. \n     Senator Kerry made a suggestion, in the campaign, that I \n     think he should consider. He should consider going to the \n     Congress and asking for the authority and the budget to \n     increase the size of the Army, even if we have to pay a \n     little more to recruit them. And between getting more help \n     and sending more troops, to try to shore up more places. I \n     think, ironically, we'll be able to get our troops out \n     quicker if, in the short run, we have more there.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Is there some code among ex-Presidents, \n     about what you say about the current President, as an ex or \n     former President? Are you constrained about what you can say?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, I think there has been. But \n     I think there are reasons for that. We've all made our own \n     mistakes and then we've all been told that we were finished \n     and full of mistakes when we weren't. So, I think we're just \n     a little reluctant to do that. You know, my job is not the \n     same thing as yours, for example. Your job is to question \n     what Presidents do, and whether it will work. Former \n     Presidents, our job, I think, is to try to make America and \n     the world a better place.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Walking through this two-story hall, it is \n     clear, as in all Presidential libraries, that this is the \n     life and times of the President, presented as he most wants \n     to be remembered. In his words and on his terms.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: This is about the new threats, \n     21st century threats. So, this is what we did on weapons of \n     mass destruction, and the work we did around the world to try \n     to secure the stocks of weapons of mass destruction. And this \n     is what we did on nonproliferation, modernizing the military \n     and getting new weapons there. And this is a section on \n     terror.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Why did you put the ten most-wanted poster \n     in here of Bin Laden? You've been taking flak on bin Laden.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Yeah, but not from anybody who \n     knows the facts. I mean, to be fair, most of it was highly \n     political. If you look at the 9/11 Commission's report about \n     what we did and how we prepared for, we had 9/11-style \n     threats for the millennium. And the extent of preparations \n     and the work we did. The number of terrorists we brought to \n     justice. The 20 al Qaeda cells we broke up. If you look at \n     all that and the fact that we apparently came closer to \n     getting Bin Laden than anybody has since, even though they \n     have a lot more options, military options that we had. I wish \n     that I had gotten him.\n       PETER JENNINGS: There are stories around, as you know, that \n     the Sudan offered him to you, not once, not twice, but three \n     times. Any truth to that?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: That's not true. It's not true, \n     and I've done everything I could to run that down. It is \n     simply not true. They were always playing a double-game, the \n     Sudanese. The guy running Sudan was in business with Bin \n     Laden. And we did try to get him out of there because, at the \n     time, Sudan was worse than Afghanistan as a harbor for \n     terrorists. But they never offered him to us. At least I \n     can't find it in any document, talking to any person. The \n     first time I heard that, I went to an extraordinary amount of \n     trouble to find out if it was true, and I urged the 9/11 \n     Commission to try to find out if it was true. I just don't \n     believe it's true.\n       PETER JENNINGS: This library has been a labor of love for \n     President Clinton. He was involved in every detail. Hours \n     before it opened, he was still telling the architect, James \n     Polshek, and the designers, a little corrections he wanted \n     made here and there.\n       Did you fuss a lot?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: A lot.\n       PETER JENNINGS: I mean, when it was over, did they think \n     you'd been a pain in the neck?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: I think so. They now say I was a \n     perfect client. But Polshek said I was the only guy he ever \n     had who would go away for three or four months and come back, \n     and if he changed one line on the drawing, I would know. And \n     I said, well, you know, I care about this. I want it to work.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Why did you want this here, in this \n     particular place, on this bank of the river?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, first of all, I wanted it \n     to come home to Arkansas because these people made me \n     President. And I wanted it here. I wanted it to be in the \n     heartland, in the middle of the country, where people don't \n     have access to things like this, so they could learn about \n     their government, how it works, what the decisions were. And \n     I wanted it on this river because I love this river. It was a \n     big part of my childhood. I first swam in this river, 40 \n     years ago or more.\n       PETER JENNINGS: You're saying that your soul is still in \n     Arkansas, even though you live in New York?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, a lot of me is still here \n     and always will be. And I will come home a lot. I'll be here \n     a lot.\n       PETER JENNINGS: There is an apartment and an office for him \n     on the top floor. This is the largest of all 12 Presidential \n     libraries. And at $165 million, certainly the most expensive. \n     Mr. Clinton has visited many of the other libraries. His \n     architects have studied them all.\n       JAMES POLSHEK, CLINTON LIBRARY ARCHITECT: Each Presidential \n     library takes on certain characteristics of the President. So \n     that Johnson's is very imperial. Kennedy's is elegant. \n     Reagan's is folksy. You know, and Bush gets the word hokey. \n     Clinton's is very progressive, very forward-looking.\n       PETER JENNINGS: The President refers to the architecture \n     here as like a bridge to the 21st century. Which was, you'll \n     remember, his theme in office. Like other libraries, it has \n     millions of documents available to historians and thousands \n     of presidential gifts and other mementoes for us all to see. \n     Every library seems to have some sports equipment. And \n     invariably there are Presidential vehicles. Mr. Clinton has a \n     Presidential limo right inside the front door. John F. \n     Kennedy's library has his sailboat. George Bush's library has \n     a fighter bomber, similar to the one he flew in World War II. \n     The Reagan library has the Boeing 707 Mr. Reagan used as Air \n     Force One. Presidents love it, of course, when people visit. \n     President Johnson had a novel way of suggesting to football \n     fans at the nearby University of Texas that they come on \n     over.\n       MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: Johnson had \n     ordained that an announcement be made at half time saying, \n     anybody who wants to use the bathroom or get some cool water \n     can get it at the Johnson Library across the street. \n     Thousands of people flowed through the front doors. And by \n     the end of 1971, the Johnson Library was just about the best-\n     attended presidential library in the United States.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Presidents save a vast amount of material. \n     Right down to the White House menus. Who knows what will turn \n     out to be significant?\n       MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Only last year in the Truman Library, \n     someone came across what looks like sort of a junky desk \n     diary. They found a number of pages in which Harry Truman had \n     recorded in his own hand diary entries day by day in 1947. \n     Had that thing been thrown out, we would have lost it.\n       PETER JENNINGS: The Clinton Library ultimately houses 630 \n     tons of Mr. Clinton's past. Mr. Clinton is so enthusiastic \n     about his library, we suspect he will be giving tours. \n     President Truman, who spent six days a week sometimes at his \n     library, often gave tours.\n       JAMES POLSHEK: That would surprise me if he didn't. You \n     know, he loves to give tours. And he would give tours in the \n     White House frequently to anybody who would come along.\n       PETER JENNINGS: As soon as the President arrived, we \n     started off in his favorite room.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: This is an exact replica of the \n     Oval Office, with replicas of the paintings I had there, the \n     sculpture I had there. And these are actually books I had in \n     the Oval Office.\n       PETER JENNINGS: I heard that yesterday you were in here \n     fiddling with the desk.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Yes. Well, I was trying to make \n     sure these are all my things. These are Robert Berke's \n     sculptures that he gave me of Harry Truman and FDR.\n       PETER JENNINGS: I got the feeling that at this pace our \n     tour might have lasted for several weeks. Obvious question \n     here is, how nostalgic are you?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Oh, it makes me happy being in \n     here. That's a globe that Hillary and Chelsea gave me. That \n     pot was given to me by King Hussein.\n       PETER JENNINGS: That staff?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: It's a Moroccan Berber stick, \n     given to me by Hillary.\n       PETER JENNINGS: It was time to move on.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Here are some of the interesting \n     things . . .\n       PETER JENNINGS: That people gave you?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Yes. This is Lance Armstrong's \n     bike. He gave me one of his speed bikes, as you see, and a \n     jersey and a helmet after he won the Tour de France.\n       This guy makes cowboy boots for all the Presidents.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Are some of the presents that a President \n     gets really tacky?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Yes. Some are. We got a few of \n     them up here that\n\n[[Page S11792]]\n\n     are of some question. There's kind of a little cartoon-like \n     thing. There's a great picture of Hillary and me as James and \n     Dolly Madison.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Not very flattering, sir.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: No. As I said, I didn't look very \n     good in those tights. There's my dog, Buddy. These are some \n     of my saxophones. I had saxophones that I was given from \n     Germany, from France, from China, from Japan. You see, here's \n     some of the compelling art here we got.\n       PETER JENNINGS: As we said, Presidents hold on to \n     everything.\n       This Presidential library is a revealing testament, both to \n     your style and your character. What are some of the \n     misconceptions you're trying to clarify?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, the biggest one I think, is \n     kind of much bigger than me. And that is, I think politics. \n     There's more and more of an attempt to turn every political \n     race into an identity race. You know, do you identify with \n     this candidate or that? Does he share your values? Is he on \n     your team or on the other team? What I wanted to show people \n     here is that leaders make choices. And those choices, if \n     implemented as policies, have consequences, positive or \n     negative. They're people, and they also make mistakes, and I \n     made my fair share of them. But I also believe that no one \n     could fairly come into this library and read this stuff and \n     look at these exhibits and hear these other people talk about \n     the work they did and the feelings they had, people around \n     the world and people here at home, without believing that \n     this matters a lot. That these choices matter. People are \n     affected in ways that are quite profound by the decisions \n     that our leaders make.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Now in the entire library, this is--I'm not \n     sure I'm using the right word. But this is the most militant \n     alcove.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: You think it is?\n       PETER JENNINGS: I do. I do. This is about your struggle \n     with the Republicans and others. Why don't you just tell us \n     why you did this?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: What I'm trying to show here is \n     this whole, long litany of things, where the ideological \n     fights, in my opinion, went too far. Spending $70 million on \n     Whitewater, which was a land deal I lost money on, that no \n     one disputed. One of the great political con jobs in the \n     history of the American Republic that they could get that \n     much money spent. And then, we go to the impeachment. We had \n     800 Constitutional scholars who said there was no basis for \n     impeachment. Gingrich, privately, acknowledged they shouldn't \n     impeach me. They did it because they wanted to put a black \n     mark on me in history.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Do you think they did put a black mark on \n     your presidency that is indelible?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: No. I mean, it's there. But I \n     think the more time goes on, the more people will see it for \n     exactly what it was. Doesn't mean I didn't make a terrible \n     personal mistake. But I certainly paid for that. But what \n     they did was legally and constitutionally wrong, and it was \n     done for political reasons. The overwhelming majority of \n     Republican and Democratic legal and Constitutional scholars \n     agree. And I think in history, it will all come out just \n     fine. I've always believed that. I think things come out in \n     the wash. But, you know, people are always being written and \n     rewritten in history.\n       PETER JENNINGS: You love history, sir. Rate yourself as a \n     President.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: I'm not going to do that. \n     Anything I say is wrong. It's a lose/lose deal. My wife's in \n     public service. I'm still trying to do things as a former \n     President. And I have no business being the judge of my own \n     presidency right now.\n       PETER JENNINGS: But at the end of the President's term, \n     historians did feel free to judge. Fifty-eight historians, as \n     I think you may know, did this for C-SPAN. And they were all \n     across the political spectrum. And they came out, in general \n     terms, that you were 21st. And on public persuasion and \n     economic management, they gave you a fifth. Pretty good.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Pretty good.\n       PETER JENNINGS: They gave you a 41st on moral authority.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: They're wrong about that.\n       PETER JENNINGS: After Nixon.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: They're wrong about that. You \n     know why they're wrong about that? They're wrong about it.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Why, sir?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Because we had $100 million spent \n     against us on all these inspections. One person in my \n     Administration was convicted of doing something that violated \n     his job responsibilities while we were in the White House. \n     Twenty-nine in the Reagan/Bush years. I'll bet those \n     historians didn't even know that. They have no idea what I \n     was subject to and what a lot of people supported. No other \n     President ever had to endure someone like Ken Starr indicting \n     innocent people because they wouldn't lie, in a systematic \n     way. No one ever had to try to save people from ethnic \n     cleansing in the Balkans and the people in Haiti from a \n     military dictator who was murdering them. And all of the \n     other problems I dealt with, while every day, an entire \n     apparatus was devoted to destroying him. And still, not any \n     example of where I ever disgraced this country, publicly. I \n     made a terrible personal mistake. But I paid for it. Many \n     times over. And in spite of it all, you don't have any \n     example where I ever lied to the American people about my \n     job, where I ever let the American people down. And I had \n     more support from the world, and world leaders and people \n     around the world, when I quit than when I started. And I will \n     go to my grave being at peace about it. And I don't really \n     care what they think.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Oh, yes, you do, sir. Excuse me, Mr. \n     President, I can feel it across the room. You feel it very \n     deeply.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: No, I care. You don't want to go \n     here, Peter. You don't want to go here. Not after what you \n     people did and the way you, your network, what you did with \n     Kenneth Starr. The way your people repeated every, little \n     sleazy thing he leaked. No one has any idea what that's like. \n     That's where I failed. You want to know where I failed? I \n     really let it hurt me. I thought I lived in a country where \n     people believed in the Constitution, the rule of law, freedom \n     of speech. You never had to live in a time when people you \n     knew and cared about were being indicted, carted off to jail, \n     bankrupted, ruined, because they were Democrats and because \n     they would not lie. So, I think we showed a lot of moral \n     fiber to stand up to that, to stand up to these constant \n     investigations, to this constant bodyguard of lies, this \n     avalanche that was thrown at all of us. And, yes, I failed \n     once. And I sure paid for it. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for \n     the American people. And I'm sorry for the embarrassment. But \n     they ought to think about how the rest of the world reacted \n     to it. When I got a standing ovation at the United Nations \n     from the whole world, the American networks were showing my \n     grand jury testimony. Those were decisions you made, not me. \n     I personally believe that the standing ovation I got from the \n     whole world at the United Nations, which was unprecedented \n     for an American President, showed not only support for me, \n     but opposition to the madness that had taken hold of American \n     politics.\n       PETER JENNINGS: I think somewhere you say that it was \n     Nelson Mandela who taught you about forgiveness?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Yes. He was unbelievable. When I \n     was going through all this, he was really mad. You know, he \n     came to the White House and defended me, and said the \n     Congress should leave me alone. And he gave a blistering \n     defense in the White House, the day before Gingrich gave him \n     the Congressional gold medal.\n       NELSON MANDELA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA: We have \n     often said that our morality does not allow us to desert our \n     friends.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: I said, how did you ever let go \n     of your hatred? I said, didn't you hate those people, even \n     when they let you go? He said, ``Briefly, I did. But when I \n     was walking out of my compound for the last time, I said to \n     myself, they've had you 27 years. If you hate them when you \n     get through that door, they will still have you.'' He said, \n     ``I wanted to be free. And so I let it go.'' And then he \n     looked at me, and he grabbed my arm and he said, ``So should \n     you.''\n       PETER JENNINGS: This Presidential library is a reminder of \n     how much is behind you. Make you feel old a bit?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Oh, a little bit. But like I \n     said, I'm very optimistic. I'm always thinking about the \n     future. And I've got, you know, this huge agenda with my \n     foundation. I like the life I had but I don't dwell on it. \n     You know, some days I feel like being President is something \n     that just finished yesterday, and it's all just real and \n     alive to me. Some days it seems like 100 years ago. I wanted \n     to give this gift to America, of this library, and tell the \n     story about how we moved into the 21st century, and how it \n     changed the way we lived and related to the rest of the \n     world. But now, I want to focus the rest of my life on what \n     I'm going to do tomorrow and on the work of my foundation and \n     whether we can save a couple million people from dying from \n     AIDS. Whether we can bring economic opportunity to people who \n     aren't part of this global economy. I believe in global \n     trade. But half the people are left out of this system. And \n     that's why there's so much anti-globalization. I believe in \n     racial and religious reconciliation. There's still a lot of \n     people who haven't done it. So, I've got a lot of work to do \n     here.\n       PETER JENNINGS: You're 58 years old, and you had two terms. \n     And like a world-class athlete, you're suddenly yanked off \n     the mound. Somebody compared it to pulling Sandy Koufax out \n     of a baseball game.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Yeah. I'm sorry he quit when he \n     did too.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Doesn't it feel like that at times?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: It did. But, you know, sometimes \n     it's a blessing. Sometimes it's a blessing to go out on top. \n     You know, I had a, I don't know, 62, 63 percent approval \n     rating. The country was in great shape. There have been many \n     times since then that I wish I had been able to help the \n     American people and the world with problems that come across \n     the President's desk.\n       PETER JENNINGS: John Quincy Adams said there was nothing so \n     pathetic in life as an ex-President. That's no longer true, I \n     gather.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: No. And it certainly wasn't true \n     of him. What he meant was, you didn't want to sit around and \n     pontificate about the way things used to\n\n[[Page S11793]]\n\n     be and pine away about not being President. And he didn't \n     spend the rest of his life whining about the fact that he \n     didn't get re- elected. He just went to work. Jimmy Carter \n     did the same thing. He said, okay, what did I care about as \n     President where I can still have an impact? What are the \n     needs of the world? What can I do that won't be done if I \n     don't do it? And he went out there and did it. And, you know, \n     I admire that. I mean, that's what we're all supposed to do. \n     When you've been President, you have received the greatest \n     gift, if you love public service, that anyone could ever get. \n     So, I just feel like you owe it the rest of your life to try \n     to give it back.\n       PETER JENNINGS: What do you want to do, most of all?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Just what I'm doing. I want to be \n     a servant. I'm going to obviously, over time, broaden the \n     sphere of my foundation work. We are working with five \n     African countries, virtually the whole Caribbean, India, \n     China. Money shouldn't determine who lives and who dies from \n     AIDS. That's what I'd like to do now because I think there \n     are more lives on the line. And I believe we can do more to \n     have people feel better about America and about the West, by \n     helping keep people alive.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Why did you choose AIDS?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: It's the most maddening of all \n     problems. That's why. One in four people will die of AIDS, \n     TB, malaria and infection. AIDS is 100 percent preventable. \n     There's medicine that prevents mother to child transmission \n     for pregnant women. There's medicine that for most healthy \n     people, can turn it from a death sentence into chronic \n     illness. And yet, there's 6.2 million people who desperately \n     need the medicine. Over 40 million people infected. It's \n     madness. So, this is something where I just figure the \n     system's broken. And this is something a former President \n     ought to do. Just go in there and try to put it together. And \n     that's what I'm doing.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Bill Clinton is hugely popular in other \n     parts of the world. Often regarded by countries as an \n     honorary citizen and treated like a rock star. He has that \n     particular touch with people in all walks of life. We also \n     talked for a minute or two, about potential new leadership at \n     home.\n       PETER JENNINGS: If Senator Clinton runs for the presidency, \n     will you be her chief political adviser?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Oh, I don't know. First, I don't \n     know if she's going to run. I think she wants to run for re-\n     election. I have no idea if she's gonna run for president.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Really?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: If she did, I would do whatever \n     she asks me to do. You know, I think of all the people I've \n     ever known in public life, she has the best combination of \n     mind and heart, of management skills and compassion. I think \n     she's very tough-minded. She has strengths I don't have. And \n     I think she's learned a lot from me over the years about the \n     things that I was good at that she needed to get better at. \n     But, you know, she's got a mind of her own and she's going to \n     make up her own mind in due course. I have no idea what she's \n     going to do.\n       PETER JENNINGS: This has been a very tiring time for the \n     President. After we saw him, everyone wanted to know how was \n     his recovery going.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: As far as I know I'm doing well. \n     I'm walking an hour a day. Up hills, vigorously. I still get \n     tired easily. I haven't recovered my stamina. But everybody \n     who's done this says I will.\n       PETER JENNINGS: No interview with President Clinton is \n     complete without a little bit of trivia. You were, after all, \n     the pop culture President. So, I'd be grateful if you'd give \n     me maybe one-liners on the following subjects. The last movie \n     you saw.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: ``Ray.'' It's unbelievable. I \n     knew Ray Charles and I talked to him a couple weeks before he \n     died. I liked him very much. And I love music, as you know. \n     It's a fabulous movie.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Your favorite singer now.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: I like Tony Bennett. I like Bono. \n     I like Barbara Streisand. I like Judy Collins. I like Sheryl \n     Crow. I love Aretha Franklin.\n       PETER JENNINGS: The Presidential perk you most miss.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Working in the Oval Office. It's \n     the best work space on earth.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Your favorite food now.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Turkey or vegetarian chili.\n       PETER JENNINGS: And the one you most miss?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Steak.\n       PETER JENNINGS: The country you'd like to live in, if it \n     were not here.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Probably Ireland.\n       PETER JENNINGS: You want to be a mystery writer at some \n     point in your life, I gather?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: I'd like to write one book that \n     was kind of frivolous. A Dylan mystery.\n       PETER JENNINGS: So, write the first line of the mystery \n     novel.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: The President's aide was found \n     dead on a street in Southeast Washington from unnatural \n     causes.\n       PETER JENNINGS: And the very last one. A living person, not \n     already encountered, who you'd most like to meet?\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Someone I have never met? I would \n     like to meet the new President of Kenya. Because he abolished \n     school fees for poor children and a million extra children \n     showed up at school. I think that that's something that's \n     likely to affect more lives positively than almost anything \n     any other political leader will do this year.\n       PETER JENNINGS: Thank you, sir.\n       FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11793-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11793-S11794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 108TH CONGRESS AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the 108th Congress draws to a close, \nit is time to reflect on a number of opportunities to support working \nfamilies that this Congress missed.\n  American workers are the backbone of our economy. They have built \nthis country, brick by brick and industry by industry. Too many of them \nhave seen their factories closed and their jobs shipped overseas due to \nbad tax policy and dismal trade agreements. As the Senate meets today, \nfamilies around our country are struggling to make ends meet in a \nsluggish economy. This Congress has missed opportunity after \nopportunity to support these families.\n  As consumer and health care prices continue to rise and families must \nmake difficult decisions about what to buy and what to go without, the \n108th Congress will adjourn without even considering an increase in the \nFederal minimum wage. Congress last voted to increase the minimum wage \n8 years ago, to the current level of $5.15. The Congressional Research \nService notes that the Federal minimum wage would have had to have been \nraised to $8.49 in February of this year to equal the purchasing power \nthat it had in February of 1968. Increases in the minimum wage have not \nkept up with inflation or with rising consumer prices, and workers \nearning minimum wage are struggling to make ends meet, often working \ntwo or more jobs. And many of these jobs do not provide basic benefits \nsuch as health insurance and paid sick leave. To that end, I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of legislation introduced by the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) that would require certain employers to \nprovide paid sick leave benefits, and I look forward to continuing to \nsupport this and other legislation to support working families when the \n109th Congress convenes next year.\n  This Congress did little to help workers who are scraping by and who, \ntoo often, have to choose between their jobs and their families. And \nfor those laid-off workers who have been unable to find family-\nsupporting employment in these tough economic times, this Congress has \ndone even less.\n  For the second year in a row, Members of Congress will go home for \nthe holidays without acting on legislation to extend the Temporary \nExtended Unemployment Compensation Program. Many unemployed workers who \nare actively seeking employment have simply been unable to find jobs, \nand are relying on unemployment benefits and related programs to \nsupport themselves and their families. I regret that, despite the \nsupport of a bipartisan majority in the Senate for extending these \nimportant benefits, a minority of members have used Senate budget rules \nto block passage of this important extension. And I am stunned that, \ndespite bipartisan support for extending these important benefits in \nboth the Senate and the House, Congress will adjourn for the year \nwithout sending an extension to the President.\n  In addition, this Congress has built upon the regrettable record of \nthe 107th Congress with respect to undermining basic worker \nprotections. Members of the House and of the Senate have gone on record \na total of six times in opposition to the Bush administration's \novertime rule. This rule, which will rob millions of hard-working \nAmericans of the overtime pay that they deserve, went into effect on \nAugust 23, despite bipartisan opposition in Congress. And for the third \ntime, the administration has saved this ill-conceived rule by issuing a \nveto threat against legislation containing a provision to block that \nrule. I commend the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin) for his leadership \non this issue, and I will continue to support efforts to roll back the \nharmful provisions of this rule.\n\n[[Page S11794]]\n\n  This Congress also missed a number of opportunities to ensure that \ngood-paying jobs stay in this country. The bill that was recently \nenacted in response to a World Trade Organization ruling against the \nforeign sales corporation and extraterritorial income provisions in our \ntax code presented Congress with an opportunity to restructure our tax \ncode in a way that supports domestic manufacturers and their employees. \nSadly, while the measure did provide some help to domestic \nmanufacturers, the bill that was signed into law missed this \nopportunity in many respects. Congress should act at the next \nopportunity to close down the tax provisions in this law that actually \nprovide incentives for corporations to move facilities overseas.\n\n  I was also disappointed that the final Omnibus bill that the Senate \nis expected to take up soon did not include provisions approved by the \nSenate responding to the disturbing trend of the outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs. These provisions would have prohibited Federal funding \nfrom being used to support the outsourcing of goods and services \ncontracts that are entered into by the Federal Government, or by the \nStates if those contracts are being supported by Federal dollars. With \nthis bill, Congress could have supported American workers by ensuring \nthat taxpayer money is not used to encourage companies to relocate \nAmerican jobs. Because of the deletion of this outsourcing provision, \nwe missed an opportunity for the Federal Government to set a strong \nexample of buying its goods and services from American companies that \nuse American workers.\n  All told, the 108th Congress provided little support, and too much \nharm, to working families, and the examples that I have cited are just \nthe tip of the iceberg of missed opportunities in this area. Congress \ncan and should do more to ensure that workers and their families have a \ndecent standard of living, including access to affordable health care, \nchild care, and housing. We should also do more to strengthen job \ntraining and education, including expanding access to higher education.\n  I fervently hope that the 109th Congress will reject the antiworker \ntone of the past two Congresses and will make every effort to support \nthe working men and women and their families who we have been elected \nto represent. I intend to continue to work hard to ensure that their \nvoices are heard here in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11794-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11794-S11795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL WILD HERITAGE ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Northern California \nCoastal Wild Heritage Act has been included in the Senate amendment to \nH.R. 620. I, along with my colleague from California, Senator \nFeinstein, are the sponsors of the Senate companion measure, S. 738. I \nwould like to thank Senator Domenici, the Chairman of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, and Senator Bingaman, the Ranking \nDemocratic Member, for working with us to achieve passage of this very \nimportant legislation. I would like to enter into a colloquy with \nSenators Feinstein, Domenici and Bingaman to clarify our intent behind \nsome of the wilderness management provisions in the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The first issue I would like to address concerns \nhorsepacking into wilderness. I want to make sure horsepackers can keep \nusing these wilderness areas. I recognize that the wilderness areas \ncreated by this act are currently enjoyed by hikers, people on \nhorseback, hunters and anglers. In addition, many visitors are serviced \nby commercial outfitters using horses as pack animals. I believe \nhorsepacking is an important use of wilderness, and I know it is a use \nthat was well established in wilderness prior to the passage of the \nWilderness Act in 1964. Unlike some other units of the National \nWilderness Preservation System, the areas designated by this act are \nnot heavily used by horses at this time. While fully recognizing the \nresponsibilities of the land managers to monitor visitor use and \nrespond appropriately to any resource damage that may result from \noveruse, I believe that current levels of horsepacking use in these \nareas are consistent with wilderness designation. Do my colleagues \nagree?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I fully concur, and I thank my colleague for raising this \nissue. I would like to ask the chairman and ranking Democratic member \nwhether they share our view that the designation of these areas as \nwilderness does not preclude their continued use by horsepackers, \nsubject to the agency's management discretion to protect area \nresources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator from California.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I likewise agree.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are all in agreement on this issue.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In working through the bill, the Forest Service \nstressed a need to develop a plan to restore the late successional \nreserve LSR forest of the Sanhedrin wilderness area. We agreed that \nwilderness designation could be fully compatible with such restoration \ntreatments.\n  I agree with the Forest Service observation that this area has been \naltered by human influences, including the suppression of natural \nburning. As the Forest Service develops its plan in accordance with \nthis act and with the goal of LSR restoration, I believe the old growth \ncharacteristics of the LSR are a primary value of the wilderness. I \nalso believe that the Forest Service can achieve its goal of LSR \nrestoration in accordance with this act and the Forest Service manual \ndirection on wilderness. The relevant portion of the manual, FSM \n2323.35a states:\n\n       Manipulation of Wildlife Habitat. The objective of all \n     projects must be to perpetuate the wilderness resource; \n     projects must be necessary to sustain a primary value of a \n     given wilderness or to perpetuate a federally listed \n     threatened or endangered species. To qualify for approval by \n     the Chief, habitat manipulation projects must satisfy the \n     following criteria:\n       The condition needing change is a result of abnormal human \n     influence.\n       The project can be accomplished with assurance that there \n     will be no serious or lasting damage to wilderness values.\n       There is reasonable assurances that the project will \n     accomplish the desired objectives.\n\n  Do my colleagues share my views that treatments to promote old growth \nin the Sanhedrin LSR are fully consistent with this act?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the senior Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree as well.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I, too, share this understanding of the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Some people have voiced concerns about hunting and \nfishing in wilderness areas. I want to make perfectly clear that \nnothing in this bill alters the fact that the State of California \nretains jurisdiction of wildlife management in these wilderness areas \nwhich includes the issuance of hunting and fishing licenses.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I fully concur.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I likewise agree.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We all seem to be in agreement on this issue as well.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to raise one other issue. Since the \nenactment of the King Range Act in 1970, property owners Linda Smith \nFranklin and Mary Smith Etter have been granted access to their land by \nthe Bureau of Land Management via the Smith-Etter Road. This \nlegislation has designated the Smith-Etter Road as providing access to \nprivate property owners and their invitees. It is my understanding that \nnothing in this act should in any way alter the access currently \ngranted to Franklin and Etter under existing policies. I believe that \nFranklin and Etter should continue to receive the access that they \ncurrently enjoy.\n  On the subject of fire suppression in this same area, I note that \nthis act provides the land management agencies with the necessary \nflexibility to conduct fire suppression activities to protect human \nlife and property. For example, in the King Range Honeydew fire in \n2003, which resulted in 14,000 acres of fire damage in the King Range \nConservation Area, the Bureau of Land Management authorized a fire \ntruck and a 3-member crew to be stationed at the bottom of Telegraph \nRidge, within a four mile range of the Franklin property in order to \nallow easy, quick access to the Franklin property in the event that \nfire suppression activities were warranted. As a result, firefighters \nwere able to fend off the fire and prevent damage to the Franklin \nproperty. It is my understanding that nothing in this Act would prevent \nBLM from continuing this practice when so warranted by fire danger.\n  Do my colleagues share my understanding of these access and fire \nsuppression issues in the King Range?\n\n[[Page S11795]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do, and I thank my colleague from California for her \nwork on this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I likewise share this understanding of how the bill \nshould be implemented.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I agree as well.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11795-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GILA RIVER WATER SETTLEMENT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with Congress having passed S 437, I make a \ncommitment to the San Carlos Apache Tribe to work next year to help \nattain and have enacted a fair Gila River water settlement for the \ntribe.\n  The Gila River runs through the tribe's reservation.

The tribe deserves a \nfair settlement of its water rights claims to that river and I want my \ncolleagues and others to know that I am absolutely committed to \nachieving that.\n  I had hoped to have been able to bring to the Senate legislation that \nwould include a Gila River water settlement for this tribe. \nUnfortunately, we were unable to do that. The tribe is working toward a \nsettlement with a number of groups that use the Gila River. I hope that \nthe tribe, the United States, and the local non-Indian water users will \nbe able to settle the tribe's water rights claims in the coming year. \nIn connection with that effort, I want to send a strong message to the \nsettlement negotiators: I expect everyone to negotiate in good-faith \ntoward a fair settlement.\n  I encourage all parties, including the San Carlos Apaches, to engage \nearnestly and vigorously to complete a Gila River water settlement as \nsoon as possible. I will then work with both the Senators from New \nMexico and my Senate colleagues to see that such an agreement is \nratified through legislation next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11795-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTELLIGENCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, earlier today, we were led to believe \nthat we had an agreement with House conferees to pass a bill that will \nreform our intelligence community and make America safer from the \nthreat of terrorism. Now we find out that House Republicans have killed \nthe bill.\n  This morning, I was one of 11 Senate conferees--6 Republicans, 5 \nDemocrats--who signed the conference report to the Intelligence Reform \nbill.\n  Remember: the conference report is to a bill the Senate passed 96-2. \nThe bill the Senate passed, in turn, was based on the recommendations \nof a unanimous 9/11 Commission--5 Republicans, 5 Democrats.\n  Now, we find out that House Republican conferees have rejected the \nconference report. They have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.\n  From what I gather, the problem is not with House Intelligence \nCommittee Chairman Hoekstra, who has been leading the conference \ncommittee.\n  What these House Republican conferees have done is a slap in the face \nof the Senate, the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, and the 9/11 families \nwho have worked so hard to make something positive happen in the wake \nof a horrific national tragedy.\n  New Jersey lost 700 of its citizens on 9/11; I have to wonder if \nthese House Republican conferees would be behaving differently if they \nwent through what we in New Jersey went through.\n  I have been in the U.S. Senate for 20 years now. I have been involved \nin my share of conference committees. In all those years, I don't \nbelieve I have ever seen a little cabal of Members act more \nunreasonably. These House Republican conferees have killed a bill that \n16 of 21 conferees have voted for. Talk about obstructionism.\n  The fact of the matter is that the conference report we were poised \nto adopt today is a far cry from the 9/11 Commission recommendations \nand the bill the Senate passed so overwhelmingly. But there is enough \nin the conference report to merit going forward. It creates a National \nDirector of Intelligence with real budget authority; it creates a \nNational Counter-Terrorism Center; it bolsters border and \ntransportation security. And it has some provisions to safeguard our \ncivil liberties.\n  It is time for truth-telling here. House Republicans and the Bush \nadministration have been opposed to this bill from the start. And now \nthey have gotten their way.\n  I think it is incumbent for the President and for the House \nRepublican conferees who have killed this bill to sit down in person \nwith the 9/11 families, look them in the eye, and tell them that the \nstatus quo--that doing nothing--is better than passing a bill so many \npeople worked so long and hard to get.\n  We are told that we won't adjourn sine die today; that we will come \nback on December 6 to give the conferees more time to reach an \nagreement.\n  The House Republican conferees are absolutely intransigent. It is \nhard for me to believe that we will be any more successful in the next \nfew weeks than we have been in the past several weeks. I hope I am \nwrong, but given the President's complete lack of leadership on this \nmatter, it is hard for me to be optimistic.\n  I have to say I think what has happened is totally contrary to the \nprinciples of our democracy, as we turn the power of the people over to \na couple of bullies who refused to accept a virtually unanimous vote of \nthe U.S. Senate, the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and the \nwill of the largest share of the American people as expressed by their \nelected representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11795-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11795-S11796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TAX ISSUES OUTSIDE THE FINANCE COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I listen to the debate tonight about \nSection 222, which invades the privacy rights of taxpayers, I would \nlike to point out an important lesson in all of this.\n  The lesson is that tax measures should be left to the tax writing \ncommittees. Only the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee \nhave the jurisdiction and the technical expertise to write our Nation's \ntax laws. And tax laws are technical. As Section 222 in this bill \nshows, one had better know what they are doing when they write a tax \nprovision. They had better understand the history of the measure and \nall of its ramifications. In the Finance Committee, we use great care \nin drafting our tax provisions, and we do it in an open manner. All \nmembers can see what we are doing and have a chance to understand why \nwe are doing it, and to comment on it. But frequently the Finance \nCommittee has to go through a rite of scrubbing appropriations bills to \nremove poorly conceived and poorly drafted tax provisions that try to \nsneak in at the dark of night. It is not just appropriations bill where \nthis occurs. It happens on many other bills as well. Often, these \nprovisions have been rejected by the Finance Committees as bad policy, \nonly to turn up in an unseen attack on our committee's jurisdiction. As \nthe bill shows tonight, it is not necessarily Members that do this. It \nis sometimes staff who add an idea. This allows staff to bypass the \nscrutiny of the entire Finance Committee; 21 senior Members of the \nSenate are deprived of their right to pass judgment on a tax measure. \nLet me give some examples of what we have had to fend off lately. Last \nweek, we had to defeat an appropriations proposal that would have cut \noff funding for Federal agencies that help the IRS obtain information \nabout Americans investing in foreign countries.\n  That measure would have undercut U.S. tax law enforcement and damaged \nour initiatives to combat tax shelters. It would have damaged our \ninternational competitiveness and undermined our Nation's efforts to \ncombat money-laundering and terrorist financing.\n  I am confident that the proponents of this measure never knew about \nits broader ramifications. But that is what happens when tax proposals \nevade the scrutiny of the Finance Committee.\n  Here is another example. Recently, the Armed Services Committee \nsought to create a charity for assisting servicemen and their families. \nOn its face, this is certainly a good cause that we can all \nsupport.Unfortunately, the statutory language drafted by the Armed \nServices Committee had very serious flaws and was unworkable under the \nTax Code. It was only after significant time and energy by the Finance \nCommittee, exerted after the fact, that we fixed something that \nshouldn't have been broken in the first place. If Members will learn to \nwork with the Finance Committee, instead of bypassing it, we can \nusually achieve the results they seek.\n\n[[Page S11796]]\n\n  Here is an example. The House Appropriations Committee tried to \nexpand the definition of census areas for determining eligibility for a \ncertain tax program. This provision was not agreed to by the Senate \nAppropriators. The provision was later passed in the JOBS bill. This \nhighlights that we try in good faith to work with Members who will work \nwith the committee. So let me send a very clear message. The \ncontroversy around this appropriations bill should serve as a warning \nto all who would bypass the jurisdiction and expertise of the \ncongressional tax writing committees. We work to defeat stealth tax \nmeasures not just to protect our committee's jurisdiction, but to \nprotect the American people from bad ideas.\n  In the Senate it is the Finance Committee, and only the Finance \nCommittee, that has the experience, expertise, and seasoned resources \nto process tax laws for our Nation.\n  Members and staff should remember today's events the next time they \nare approached to insert a ``harmless'' tax measure into an unrelated \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11796-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                              REED IRVINE\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the life of \na noted conservative journalist, media critic, and a leading authority \non media bias, Reed Irvine. Reed Irvine passed on November 16, 2004, \nand is known as the man who founded the organization Accuracy in Media. \nHe leaves a legacy of fighting a left-leaning media and was a long-time \ncritic of the big three networks at a time when only three network \nnightly news shows dominated the distribution of information to the \npublic.\n  Reed Irvine was born in Salt Lake City, UT, the son of William J. and \nEdna May Irvine. He graduated from the University of Utah at the age of \n19 in 1942, having been elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He enlisted in the \nNavy and was selected to take a crash program in the Japanese language, \nemerging as an interpreter-translator with a commission in the U.S. \nMarine Corps. He participated in the campaign of Saipan, Tinian, \nOkinawa as an intelligence officer with the 2nd Marine Division, and \nserved in the occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1948.\n  After the war, Mr. Irvine was an economist, Fulbright scholar and \nformer Federal Reserve official. He joined the Federal Reserve Board in \n1951 as an economist in the Far East Section of the Division of \nInternational Finance. Mr. Irvine wrote extensively about the free \nmarket and advocated sound monetary and fiscal policy.\n  He founded Accuracy in Media in 1969 and its sister organization, \nAccuracy in Academia, in 1985. Mr. Irvine pioneered the concept of a \ncitizens' media watchdog organization that criticized the errors and \nomissions of the mainstream press, buying ads to publicize serious \nerrors and buying stock in media companies to enable Accuracy in Media \nrepresentatives to attend their annual meetings to discuss its \ncomplaints with the chairman. Irvine was tenacious in his quest for the \nfull truth in media.\n  Mr. Irvine is survived by his wife of 56 years, Kay Araki Irvine, his \nson and three grandchildren. Reed Irvine will be remembered as being at \nthe forefront of the conservative movement's attack on media bias and \nhas left us four books that study the bias of the media.\n\n  In 1969, when Reed Irvine began his crusade, most Americans trusted \nthe mainstream media. Americans received the biased news coverage and \nbelieved it. Today, the liberal bias in media, Hollywood, and academia \nis widely accepted as a fact of life.\n  Some day, I hope that the mainstream media will lose its leftwing \nbias. I hope for the day when academia will focus all its attention on \nscholarship and leave the liberal indoctrination for the pundits. But, \nI do not expect those days to come very soon. However, thanks in large \npart to the life's work of Reed Irvine and the movement he helped \nlaunch, Americans have now accepted media bias as a fact of life. The \nAmerican Society of Newspapers published a study in 1999 that showed 78 \npercent of Americans believe there is a bias in the media.\n  I believe this understanding by the American public promotes a more \ninformed democracy. People watch the news with a critical eye. Students \nquestion their professors. Americans are seeking out talk radio, \nalternative media. The Internet is flourishing.\n  Thanks to dedicated watchdogs such as Reed Irvine, the American \npeople now see through the bias in the media. Dan Rather's ludicrous \nreporting on President Bush's National Guard service was debunked in no \ntime on the Internet and talk radio. A liberal bias that was once \nlamented by conservatives and ignored by the public has now become a \nrunning joke among conservatives and an accepted fact in the minds of \nAmericans. People, who once powerlessly accepted the news however they \ncould get it, are now voting with their remote controls.\n  When President Bush delivered his acceptance speech at the Republican \nNational Convention this year, 7.3 million people saw it on Fox. \nMeanwhile, 5.9 million watched on NBC, 5.1 million on ABC, 5 million on \nCBS, 2.7 million on CNN and 1.7 million on MSNBC, according to Nielsen \nMedia Research. Fox also beat the broadcast networks throughout the \nrest of the Republican Convention coverage--this, despite the fact that \nABC, CBS, and NBC are available in about 110 million homes, while Fox \nis carried in about 85 million. Reed Irvine's message has been \nreceived, and the people are fighting back.\n  News is now reported in countless ways, 24 hours a day, and the \nAmerican people are deciding for themselves what it all means. For this \nnew coverage we can thank the Fox News channel, and the countless talk \nshow hosts, magazines, Internet sites, and organizations. However, I \nthink the most important gift that has been given to our country is the \ncritical eye of the American public. A voting public that watches the \nnews with a critical eye is one that cannot be easily manipulated. A \ncollege student who asks his professor tough questions will end up \nbetter educated and ready for the world.\n  For this wonderful gift, we owe a special thanks to Reed \nIrvine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11796-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11796-S11797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. SAM BILLISON\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to mark the passing \nof Dr. Sam Billison, a recipient of a Congressional Silver Medal, who \ndied earlier this week. He was a great American.\n  In 2001, the President of the United States awarded Congressional \nGold and Silver Medals to Sam and his fellow Navajo Code Talkers. Of \nall the honors Congress can bestow, these Medals are often considered \nthe most distinguished, expressing the gratitude of the Congress and \nthe entire nation.\n  With this award, the Code Talkers joined the ranks of an exclusive \ngroup of people--Robert Kennedy, Harry Truman, General H. Norman \nSchwarzkopf, Nelson Mandela, General Colin Powell, and President \nReagan, to name a few.\n  As with many other recipients, Sam and his fellow WWII Code Talkers \nwere recognized for valor, for their contributions to the national \ngood, for their defense of freedom and democracy. However, unlike the \nothers, they set several precedents, not the least of which that they \nwere the first Native American Indians to receive Congressional Gold \nMedals.\n  This is especially poignant when one realizes the cultural context in \nwhich Sam and his fellow Navajo were raised. Subjected to alienation in \ntheir own homeland, discouraged from speaking their own language, this \ngroup of Native Americans rose above adversity, voluntarily came \nforward to develop the most significant and successful military code of \nthe time saving countless American lives, and then honored their oath \nof secrecy by stepping back into the obscurity from which they came.\n  Many of these marines have finally come forward to be appropriately \nrecognized and honored, but many took their secret to the grave. I am \nhappy that in the twilight of Sam's life, he was able to see Congress \nfinally mark that place in history so long overdue the Navajo Code \nTalkers.\n  We, as a nation, are but a product of those who have come before us--\ntheir accomplishments, their contributions, and their sacrifice in the \nstruggle for freedom and democracy. We must never forget that our \nsociety is made possible only through the sacrifice and hard work of \nthousands of American men and women.\n\n[[Page S11797]]\n\n  Sam Billison, Navajo Code Talker, was one of an elite group of \nveterans, and yet he was more. He was a teacher, a school principal and \na superintendent, helping educate thousands of young people, and \nsetting an example for all to follow. In all sense of the word, he was \na true American hero. He shall be dearly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11797-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO SENIOR AIRMAN NICHOLAS P. SEMONELLE, THE UNITED STATES AIR \n                        FORCE AIRMAN OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nUnited States Air Force Airman of the Year for 2004, Senior Airman \nNicholas P. Semonelle from Enterprise, Alabama.\n  Senior Airman Semonelle's recognition stems from his unique act of \ncourage and bravery. On January 18, 2003, Senior Airman Semonelle was \nfaced with a dangerous situation. Senior Airman Semonelle observed \nsmoke from a nearby house that had caught fire and immediately called \n911. Upon learning from a 14-year-old babysitter that three children \nwere trapped inside, Semonelle immediately broke through a window and \nentered the burning structure to try to find the children. Despite the \nsmoke and heat, Senior Airman Semonelle searched room to room locating \na 7-year-old boy and evacuating him from the building. Without \nhesitation and regard for his own personal safety, he again risked his \nlife to go back inside the home, now ablaze and filled with smoke, to \nlocate and carry out a second child, a 3-year-old girl. Senior Airman \nSemonelle began a third rescue attempt of an 18-month-old baby girl \nstill trapped in the now engulfed structure. Despite repeated attempts, \nthe little girl could not be found. Emergency rescue personnel arrived \nto find the structure engulfed in flames, and were unable to locate the \nthird child who did not survive. Senior Airman Semonelle, his brother-\nin-law who had helped with the rescues, and the two lucky children \neventually collapsed on the ground in front of the house, exhausted and \ncoughing from smoke inhalation.\n  Senior Airman Semonelle's quick action to enter the burning home and \nrescue those inside resulted in saving the lives of two children. His \ndisregard for his own personal safety to save others is an act of \nbravery that warrants our gratitude. I commend this 1996 Elba High \nSchool graduate for his service to our country and for his bravery. He \ncontinues to distinguish himself, serving our country overseas in his \nassignment to the United States Air Force 435th Logistics Readiness \nSquadron at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. He is truly deserving of the \nrecognition that the United States Air Force and the United Services \nOrganization have bestowed on him as Airman of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11797-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAT RAYMOND\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, Pat Raymond prefers to be the \nperson behind the person. She prefers to work behind the scenes, and as \nI can attest, late at nights, weekends, and holidays. For 30 years she \nhas served the Senate faithfully, professionally, tirelessly, and as a \nstalwart advocate. But today I would like to put Pat front and center \nand thank her for her service to me and to the Senate.\n  For the past 2 years, Pat has worked as the clerk of the agriculture \nappropriations subcommittee that I chair. I have benefited from her \ninstitutional knowledge, her counsel, and her judgment. Because of \nconsecutive reductions in the budget of the United States Department of \nAgriculture the last 2 years have been very challenging, but Pat has \nbeen up to the task. In 2003, even though the allocation to the \nsubcommittee was nearly $1 billion below the prior years enacted level, \nwe produced a bill that the Senate approved with only one dissenting \nvote. Pat has developed strong working relationships not only with the \nstaff of Senator Kohl, the subcommittee ranking member, but also with \nthe staffs of Representatives Bonilla and Kaptur, the House agriculture \nappropriations chairman and ranking member. These relationships have \nenabled the agriculture appropriations subcommittees of both chambers \nto work together and overcome the challenges posed by being required to \ndo more with less.\n  After 30 years of service Pat will retire at the end of this \nCongress. I thank her for her dedication, for her hard work, and for a \njob well done. More than that, I wish her well, as she travels to \nFlorida for a well deserved rest. But I know that ``rest'' won't last \nlong--Pat is too young, too vigorous, and has too much to contribute \nnot to get involved in something important right from the \nstart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11797-3", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN HONOR OF SUPERVISOR REX BLOOMFIELD\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my honor to speak in \nrecognition of Supervisor Rex Bloomfield, a strong advocate for the \npreservation of open space, improvement of county services, and \nbalanced planning for the future of Placer County.\n  Rex Bloomfield has dedicated the last 12 years as Supervisor to \nimproving his community and Placer County. His many accomplishments are \ntestament to his strong leadership and devotion to public service. By \ncreating the Placer Legacy Program he has helped to preserve thousands \nof acres of open space and agricultural lands in Placer County. \nCommitted to the fight for clean air, he initiated the Sacramento Ozone \nSummit and worked hard to adopt regional policies to reduce smog, for \nwhich he received the American Lung Association's regional award for \noutstanding leadership. Supervisor Bloomfield established Placer \nCounty's first redevelopment area to help fund community projects, such \nas the Squaw Valley Community Park. Throughout his three terms in \noffice he has made many improvements to his district. Four parks were \nbuilt, miles of new trails for recreation were constructed, a new \nlibrary was built with two others expanded, fire safe councils and fire \nfuels reduction programs were created, Sheriff substations in outlying \nareas were added, emergency personnel were provided more safety \nequipment and medical supplies, and a computerized emergency telephone \nsystem to warn residents of pending danger was established.\n  Rex Bloomfield has not only committed himself to the betterment of \nPlacer County as supervisor, but also as a teacher and involved member \nof the community. His teaching career has spanned 31 years. He is \ncurrently teaching fifth grade at Alta Vista School in Auburn. He has \nbeen a board member with the Sierra Economic Development District, \nSierra Planning Organization, Foothill Airport Land Use Commission, \nPlacer County Air Pollution Control District, Placer County Flood \nControl and Water Conservation District, Colfax Veterans Memorial Hall \nBoard, and Foresthill Veterans Memorial Hall Board.\n  I commend Rex for dedicating his life to his family and his \ncommunity. His accomplishments have touched the lives of many, and his \nimpact on his community and Placer County will be long remembered. I \nextend my sincere best wishes for his continued health, happiness, and \ngood work. Rex Bloomfield is a distinguished member of the community, \nand it is with great pleasure that I recognize him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11797-4", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11797-S11798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TAXATION OF FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION MITIGATION \n                                 GRANTS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in these final days of \nthe 108th Congress, I would like to call attention to an issue of great \nconsequence to the people of Florida and to other States that recently \nhave been victimized by natural disasters.\n  This year, four hurricanes wrought a path of damage and destruction \nacross Florida and other areas. The U.S. Congress was quick to provide \nFederal relief for victims of the storms, and we are grateful for this. \nYet a June Internal Revenue Service ruling determines that this \nassistance ought to be taxed.\n  This means that if a homeowner accepts a $25,000 Federal grant to \nelevate their flood prone home, the grant would be included in their \ntaxable income. This unexpected tax liability could be financially \ndevastating to a retiree living on a fixed income after already having \nfaced the costs of hurricane cleanup. It also creates a strong \ndisincentive for homeowners to participate in Federal mitigation \nprograms,\n\n[[Page S11798]]\n\nincreasing the risk of damage and expense in future disasters. The IRS \npolicy runs counter to good public policy and common sense.\n  Senator Kit Bond and Representative Mark Foley have introduced S. \n2886 and H.R. 5206, respectively, identical bills that would fix this \nproblem by exempting mitigation grants from being included as taxable \nincome. These bills have drawn support from both sides of the aisle and \na large number of the Florida Congressional delegation. I am \ndisappointed that we will not have an opportunity to pass these bills \nbefore Congress adjourns. If we fail to act early on in the 109th \nCongress, come April, some homeowners could be in for a rude awakening \nin the form of a higher tax bill from the IRS.\n  To help ease the minds of Floridians and other Americans living in \ndisaster prone areas of the country, I joined Senator Landrieu in \nsending a letter to Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and Ranking \nMember Baucus asking them to direct the Treasury and the IRS to delay \nimplementing this policy until Congress has the opportunity to act.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to find a \nsolution to this problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11798-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WOOL TRUST FUND\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I make note of a technical \nerror in the drafting of the Wool Trust Fund, which was included in \nH.R.1047, the ``Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of \n2004.'' Section 4002, entitled ``Extension and Modification of Duty \nSuspension on Wool Products, Wool Research Fund, Wool Duty Refunds,'' \nextends the current Wool Trust Fund through December 31, 2007. The \npurpose of this provision is to extend the current program, as well as \nto provide grants to textile mills, for an additional 2 years beyond \nthe current date of expiration, which is December 31, 2005. This fact \nis reflected in the conference report of H.R. 1047, in which the \nconferees observe that the House recedes to the Senate proposal ``so \nthat all programs are extended by two years beyond the current date of \nexpiration of the current programs.'' In other words, all provisions--\nincluding all programs and all tariff reductions--are to be in effect \nthrough 2007.\n  Unfortunately, a drafting error occurs in section 4002(a)(5), \nentitled ``Fabrics of Combed Wool,'' and mistakenly terminates the \nextension of duty reductions, for the goods identified in that \nsubsection, at the end of 2006, rather than 2007. This error is clearly \nand patently inconsistent with the expressed intention of the conferees \nto extend the program through 2007.\n  I urge the Members of the 109th Congress to correct this technical \nerror, in order to allow the program to operate as clearly and \nexpressly intended by the 108th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11798-2", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests to concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5370.

A bill to improve funeral home, cemetery, and crematory \ninspection systems, to establish consumer protections relating to \nfuneral service contracts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Death \nCare Inspection and Disclosure Act of 2004, a bill which I believe will \ngo a long way in restoring the trust that Americans place in the \nfuneral and death care industries.\n  None of us like to think about death and dying. It is a painful and \nuncomfortable subject, and most Americans, understandably, choose not \nto confront matters related to the death of a loved one until the death \nactually occurs. And when a loved one does pass on, we turn to our \nfriends and family to grieve. Certainly, the last thing anyone wants to \ndo at such a painful time is to spend hours or days negotiating or \nshopping for a funeral, casket, or other goods and services. Instead, \nwe leave most of these arrangements in the hands of funeral service \nproviders, turning to them to ensure that our loved ones are cared for \nand treated with respect and dignity after their passing.\n  We place a great deal of trust in funeral service providers. A \nfuneral, after all, represents one of the largest purchases many \nconsumers will ever make, just behind a home, college education, and a \ncar. However, unlike these transactions, the purchase of funeral \nservices is most often done under intense emotional duress, with very \nlittle time to spare, and without the benefit of the type of consumer \ninformation generally available when making such a large purchase. As a \nresult, we trust funeral service providers to give us fair prices, to \nrepresent goods and services accurately, and to not take advantage of \nus during our moments of greatest grief and vulnerability.\n  For the most part, this trust is well deserved. I have no doubt, that \nthe majority of individuals working in the funeral industry are good \nmen and women who practice their profession with the honor and gravity \nit demands. However, recent revelations of abuses in the industry have \nshown us that not all members of the death care industry are honest and \nupstanding. We all remember hearing recently of the discovery of over \n200 bodies strewn in the woods near a crematorium in Noble, GA. There \nis also evidence of desecration of graves and remains at cemeteries in \nFlorida, California, Hawaii, and my own State of Connecticut. These \nincidents, as well as developments in the funeral industry as a whole, \ncompel us to reexamine the regulatory structure we currently have in \nplace for this industry.\n  Currently, the death care industry is regulated by a patchwork of \nstate and local laws. These regulations may have been sufficient years \nago, but the character of the industry has changed substantially since \nmany of these laws were passed. The industry has become surprisingly \nlarge and diverse. The death care industry generates annual revenues of \nover $15 billion and employs over 104,000 Americans. The 1990's saw the \nrise of multi-state ``consolidators'' who purchased local funeral homes \nacross the country. Even for small local firms, the business has become \nincreasingly complex. As more and more Americans travel and live in \nplaces far from where they were born, the industry has become one that \nfrequently does business across state and county lines.\n  There have also been changes in Americans' cultural expectations of \nfuneral services. For example, the percentage of cremations has risen \nfrom 5 percent in the 1970's to 25 percent today. However, only 12 \nStates have substantive laws which cover cremation. In fact, in the \ncase in Georgia I mentioned earlier, the crematorium in question was \nstatutorily exempt from inspection, allowing the abuses to continue \nundiscovered.\n  The only significant federal regulation of the industry exists in the \nFederal Trade Commission's Funeral Rule, promulgated nearly 20 years \nago. Again, this rule has not kept up with the nature of the industry. \nPerhaps most importantly, the rule does not cover numerous sectors of \nthe industry such as cemeteries, crematories, and casket makers. It \nalso does not effectively regulate prepaid funeral contracts, which \nhave become an increasingly popular option in recent years.\n  In 2002, I chaired a hearing of the Subcommittee on Children and \nFamilies in which we examined developments in the industry and how they \nhave impacted American families. Since that hearing, I have worked with \nboth consumer and industry groups to craft legislation to protect \nAmericans from potential abuse by funeral service providers. The \nFederal Death Care Inspection and Disclosure Act of 2004 would provide \nFederal funding to allow States to hire and train inspectors and give \nconsumers the right to legal action against those who violate \nregulatory standards. In order to be eligible for funding, states would \nhave to adhere to standards which are outlined in the legislation. The \nact would also codify and strengthen the existing FTC regulations \ngoverning licensing and\n\n[[Page S11801]]\n\nregistration, record-keeping, inspection, resolution of consumer \ncomplaints, and enforcement of state laws in the industry. It would \nclarify regulations to prevent deceptive trade practices in the \nindustry and ensure that consumers can make informed decisions as they \nmake funeral arrangements. Finally, the FTC rules would be expanded to \ncover all segments of the death care industry.\n  I am aware that as we are in the closing days of this Congress, we \nwill not have the opportunity to pass this legislation this year. \nHowever, I would like to take this opportunity to raise this issue with \nmy colleagues today, and I hope that we will be able to move on this \nissue when we reconvene for the 109th Congress. It is my firm belief \nthat this bill will help both consumers and industry. Consumers will \nhave the peace of mind knowing that they are being treated fairly \nduring their time of grief and distress, while the industry will \nbenefit from regaining the high level of consumer confidence and trust \nthat it has traditionally enjoyed.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me by supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 3024. A bill to establish the National Center for Transportation \nSolutions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Center for \nTransportation Solutions Act of 2004.\n  I am deeply troubled that the Federal Government is not doing enough \nto address important national and regional transportation issues from a \nsystemic perspective. There is too little research being devoted to \nprofound questions that have a long-term impact on the future viability \nof our nation's transportation network. Such questions may include: How \nwell is our transportation system responding to the global economy? How \ncan transportation meet the needs of greater environmental \nsustainability? How can people become more involved in transportation \nplanning in their communities? What transportation technologies will be \nimportant in the future? Are there more effective ways to finance \nimprovements to our transportation infrastructure? What will be the \ndemand for various modes of transportation in the future? How well do \nthe various modes of transportation interact? Is there a better way to \nreduce transportation accidents and enhance safety?\n  In fact, the Federal Government does not adequately invest in finding \nanswers to these and other important questions. The United States \nDepartment of Transportation spends approximately 1.5 percent of its \nbudget on research. This amount is insufficient when compared to the \n2.8 percent spent by the Department of Agriculture, 4.8 percent by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, 8.1 percent by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and 14.9 percent spent by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Much of that 1.5 percent spent by the Department of Transportation is \nfocused on short-term, highly applied research activities, such as the \nperformance of varieties of asphalt in different climates. Too few \nresources, however, are devoted to research in finding solutions to our \nmost intractable long-term transportation problems.\n  The consequences of this lack of foresight are significant. As Dennis \nChristiansen, Deputy Director of the Texas Transportation Institute, \ntestified before the House Subcommittee on Highway, Transit, and \nPipelines last year: ``In the private sector, failure to innovate may \nmean one goes out of business. In the public sector, failure to \ninnovate may simply mean that we do things less efficiently and at a \nhigher cost.'' In addition, the American Public Transportation \nAssociation commented at the same hearing that ``without research and \ntraining, innovation withers and American jobs are lost offshore.''\n  The lack of adequate investments in long-term transportation \nresearch, however, is not the only concern. The Nation's transportation \nresearch and technology programs are highly decentralized as well. \nThere are state and federal transportation agencies, universities, \ncontractors, and material suppliers all participating in transportation \nresearch activities. While this decentralization has its benefits in \nthat the same broad array of institutions that are conducting the \nresearch are involved in its implementation, it also has its drawbacks. \nIt poses challenges to effective priority-setting, and can lead to \nunnecessary duplication, results that are not transferable, and \nsignificant research gaps.\n  The legislation that I am introducing will address these important \nissues by establishing a Center for Transportation Solutions as an \nindependent agency in the executive branch of the government. Its \npurpose will be to develop and encourage the execution of a long-term \nnational policy for the promotion of research and development related \nto multimodal transportation.\n  The Center is modeled after the National Science Foundation. It will \nbe under the leadership of a Director appointed by the President and a \nBoard composed of sixteen individuals with expertise in transportation \nresearch and policy. Like the National Science Foundation, the Center \nwill be organized into a series of research divisions on such issues as \nsafety, the environment, infrastructure, intermodal connections, and \ntransportation economics and financial policy. Regional Centers for \nTransportation Solutions will also be established to investigate these \nimportant issues from a regional perspective.\n  The new Center will not supplant existing transportation research \nactivities but supplement them. It will award competitive, merit-based \ngrants to academic, public, and private research institutions to \nsupport long-term strategic transportation objectives. According to the \nTransportation Research Board, ``competition for funds and merit review \nof proposals are the best ways of ensuring the maximum return on \ninvestment of research funding and addressing strategic national \ntransportation system goals.'' Sadly, much of the funding that is \ndesignated for transportation research today is earmarked for specific \nprojects or research institutions without open competition.\n  Finally, the Center will facilitate the interchange of transportation \nresearch data among interested parties, work closely with the United \nStates Department of Transportation in setting research priorities, and \ncoordinate its scientific research programs with public and private \nresearch groups.\n  This legislation is a work in progress. In the coming months, I \nintend to further refine it for reintroduction in the 109th Congress. \nNevertheless, the bill embodies an important goal namely, the need for \nincreased resources and strategic planning devoted to tackling the \nnation's long-term transportation needs.\n  I realize that the 108th Congress is nearing completion. I am also \naware that the Senate and the House of Representatives will likely \nrevisit the reauthorization of surface transportation programs soon \nafter the 109th Congress convenes in 2005. That legislation would be \nthe perfect opportunity for Congress to look farther into the future--\neven beyond the traditional six-year scope of the surface \ntransportation bill--and begin to make the investments necessary for \nsolving our nation's most difficult transportation problems. After all, \nif we can devote resources to finding a cure for cancer and other life-\nthreatening illnesses, shouldn't we do the same and find a cure for \ntraffic congestion?\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Ensign)\n  S. 3026.

A subpoena \n     or order may be authorized by the special committee or by the \n     chairman with the agreement of the ranking member, and may be \n     issued by the chairman or any other member of the special \n     committee designated by the chairman, and may be served by \n     any person designated by the chairman or the authorized \n     member anywhere within or outside of the borders of the \n     United States to the full extent permitted by law. The \n     chairman, or any other member of the special committee, is \n     authorized to administer oaths to any witnesses appearing \n     before the special committee. If a return on a subpoena or \n     order for the production of documentary or physical evidence \n     is incomplete or accompanied by an objection, the chairman \n     (in consultation with the ranking member) may convene a \n     meeting or hearing to determine the adequacy of the return \n     and to rule on the objection. At a meeting or hearing on such \n     a return, one member of the special committee shall \n     constitute a quorum. The special committee shall not initiate \n     procedures leading to civil or criminal enforcement of a \n     subpoena unless the person or entity to whom the subpoena is \n     directed refuses to produce the required documentary or \n     physical evidence after having been ordered and directed to \n     do so.\n       (2) Compensation authority.--To employ and fix the \n     compensation of such clerical, investigatory, legal, \n     technical, and other assistants as the special committee, or \n     the chairman or the ranking member, considers necessary or \n     appropriate.\n       (3) Meetings.--To sit and act at any time or place during \n     sessions, recesses, and adjournment periods of the Senate.\n       (4) Hearings.--To hold hearings, take testimony under oath, \n     and receive documentary or physical evidence relating to the \n     matters and questions it is authorized to investigate or \n     study. Unless the chairman and the ranking member otherwise \n     agree, the questioning of a witness or a panel of witnesses \n     at a hearing shall be limited to one initial 30-minute turn \n     each for the chairman and the ranking member, or their \n     designees, including majority and minority staff, and \n     thereafter to 10-minute turns by each member of the special \n     committee if 5 or more members are present, and to 15-minute \n     turns by each member of the special committee if fewer than 5 \n     members are present. A member may be permitted further \n     questions of the witness or panel of witnesses, either by \n     using time that another member then present at the hearing \n     has yielded for that purpose during the yielding member's \n     turn, or by using time allotted after all members have been \n     given an opportunity to question the witness or panel of \n     witnesses. At all times, unless the chairman and the ranking \n     member otherwise agree, the questioning shall alternate back \n     and forth between members of the majority party and members \n     of the minority party. In their discretion, the chairman and \n     the ranking member, respectively, may designate majority or \n     minority staff to question a witness or a panel of witnesses \n     at a hearing during time yielded by a member of the \n     chairman's or the ranking member's party then present at the \n     hearing for his or her turn.\n       (5) Testimony of witnesses.--To require by subpoena or \n     order the attendance, as a witness before the special \n     committee or at a deposition, of any person who may have \n     knowledge or information concerning any of the matters that \n     the special committee is authorized to investigate and study.\n       (6) Immunity.--To grant a witness immunity under sections \n     6002 and 6005 of title 18, United States Code, provided that \n     the independent counsel has not informed the special \n     committee in writing that immunizing the witness would \n     interfere with the ability of the independent counsel \n     successfully to prosecute criminal violations. Not later than \n     10 days before the special committee seeks a Federal court \n     order for a grant of immunity by the special committee, the \n     Senate Legal Counsel shall cause to be delivered to the \n     independent counsel a written request asking the independent \n     counsel promptly to inform the special committee in writing \n     if, in the judgment of the independent counsel, the grant of \n     immunity would interfere with the ability of the independent \n     counsel successfully to prosecute criminal violations. The \n     Senate Legal Counsel's written request of the independent \n     counsel required by this paragraph shall be in addition to \n     all notice requirements set forth in sections 6002 and 6005 \n     of title 18, United States Code.\n       (7) Depositions.--To take depositions and other testimony \n     under oath anywhere within the United States, to issue orders \n     that require witnesses to answer written interrogatories \n     under oath, and to make application for the issuance of \n     letters rogatory. All depositions shall be conducted jointly \n     by majority and minority staff of the special committee. A \n     witness at a deposition shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by a member of the special committee or an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths, and a \n     complete transcription or electronic recording of the \n     deposition shall be made. Questions shall be propounded first \n     by majority staff of the special committee and then by \n     minority staff of the special committee. Any subsequent round \n     of questioning shall proceed in the same order. Objections by \n     the witness as to the form of questions shall be noted for \n     the record. If a witness objects to a question and refuses to \n     answer on the basis of relevance or privilege, the special \n     committee staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at \n     that time or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling on the \n     objection from the chairman.

WINTERS (RET.) DURING WORLD WAR II, AND COMMENDING HIM FOR \n        LEADERSHIP AND VALOR IN LEADING THE MEN OF EASY COMPANY\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM submitted the following resolution: which was submitted \nand read:\n\n                              S. Res. 481\n\n       Whereas historians have written that World War II began on \n     September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany, without a declaration \n     of war, invaded Poland; and following Poland's surrender, the \n     Nazis quickly moved to invade and occupy Denmark, Norway, \n     Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium;\n       Whereas following the Japanese sneak attack on the United \n     States at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on December 7, 1941, the \n     United States declared war on Japan and entered the conflict \n     on the side of freedom and democracy;\n       Whereas when the fate of the free world was in jeopardy as \n     a direct result of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime's desire \n     for world conquest, the ``greatest generation ever'' took up \n     the task of ridding the world of Nazi and Fascist regimes;\n       Whereas in 1944 the military forces of the United States, \n     the United Kingdom, and Canada landed at 5 beaches (Utah \n     Beach, Omaha Beach, Gold Beach, Juno Beach, and Sword Beach) \n     in Normandy, France with the goal of liberating Europe from \n     the Nazi forces;\n       Whereas according to military historians, in preparation \n     for the amphibious invasion at Normandy, Allied planes \n     pounded the Nazi defenders and dropped thousands of \n     paratroopers behind German lines the night before the \n     seaborne landings;\n\n[[Page S11805]]\n\n       Whereas Major Richard D. Winters (Ret.), a native of \n     Lancaster, Pennsylvania and a graduate of Franklin & Marshall \n     College, served the United States honorably and with great \n     distinction as 1st Lieutenant, Company E, 2nd Battalion, \n     506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division;\n       Whereas landing at the town of Ste. Mere-Eglise on June 6, \n     1944, Lieutenant Winters took command of ``Easy Company'' \n     following the death of the company commander in the airborne \n     drop, and received orders to destroy a four-gun battery of \n     German 105mm howitzers at a French farmhouse named ``Brecourt \n     Manor'', 3 kilometers from Ste. Marie-du-Mont;\n       Whereas Lieutenant Winters, with only 12 men, proceeded to \n     assault this enemy battery which was directing heavy fire \n     against the 4th Infantry Division as they landed on Utah \n     Beach;\n       Whereas against great odds, and through extraordinary \n     bravery, Lieutenant Winters and his men were able to overcome \n     a platoon of 50 elite German soldiers guarding the battery;\n       Whereas Lieutenant Winters personally led the attack and \n     repeatedly exposed himself directly to enemy fire while \n     performing his military duties;\n       Whereas this gallant action by Lieutenant Winters and his \n     men, 4 of whom gave their lives, and 2 of whom were wounded, \n     saved countless lives among the soldiers of the 4th Infantry \n     Division; and\n       Whereas Lieutenant Richard D. Winters received the \n     Distinguished Service Cross in recognition of his outstanding \n     military service and achievement during the Normandy \n     campaign: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) salutes the accomplishments of Lieutenant Richard D. \n     Winters and the men of ``Easy Company'' for their actions to \n     ensure control over Utah Beach at Normandy;\n       (2) commends the heroism and bravery shown by Lieutenant \n     Richard D. Winters in the face of death and severe hardship \n     to accomplish his mission and save the lives of Allied Forces \n     landing at Utah Beach;\n       (3) acknowledges the historical achievements of Lieutenant \n     Richard D. Winters and the men of ``Easy Company'' in \n     assuring the success of the Allied Normandy campaign, begun \n     on June 6, 1944; and\n       (4) expresses its gratitude for the selfless service of \n     Lieutenant Richard D. Winters, the men of ``Easy Company,'' \n     and all veterans who served in World War II in restoring \n     freedom to the world and for defeating the elements of evil \n     and oppression.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 482--CONGRATULATING THE BOSTON RED SOX ON WINNING THE \n                           2004 WORLD SERIES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. Chafee) submitted the following \nresolution; which was submitted and read:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Marine Debris Research \n     Prevention and Reduction Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The oceans, which comprise nearly three quarters of the \n     Earth's surface, are an important source of food and provide \n     a wealth of other natural products that are important to the \n     economy of the United States and the world.\n       (2) Ocean and coastal areas are regions of remarkably high \n     biological productivity, are of considerable importance for a \n     variety of recreational and commercial activities, and \n     provide a vital means of transportation.\n       (3) Ocean and coastal resources are limited and susceptible \n     to change as a direct and indirect result of human \n     activities, and such changes can impact the ability of the \n     ocean to provide the benefits upon which the Nation depends.\n       (4) Marine debris, including plastics, derelict fishing \n     gear, and a wide variety of other objects, has a harmful and \n     persistent effect on marine flora and fauna and can have \n     adverse impacts on human health.\n       (5) Marine debris is also a hazard to navigation, putting \n     mariners and rescuers, their vessels, and consequently the \n     marine environment at risk, and can cause economic loss due \n     to entanglement of vessel systems.\n       (6) Modern plastic materials persist for decades in the \n     marine environment and therefore pose the greatest potential \n     for long-term damage to the marine environment.\n       (7) Insufficient knowledge and data on the source, \n     movement, and effects of plastics and other marine debris in \n     marine ecosystems has hampered efforts to develop effective \n     approaches for addressing marine debris.\n       (8) Lack of resources, inadequate attention to this issue, \n     and poor coordination at the Federal level has undermined the \n     development and implementation of a Federal program to \n     address marine debris, both domestically and internationally.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish programs within the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration and the United States Coast Guard \n     to help identify, determine sources of, assess, reduce, and \n     prevent marine debris and its adverse impacts on the marine \n     environment and navigation safety, in coordination with other \n     Federal and non-Federal entities;\n       (2) to re-establish the Inter-agency Marine Debris \n     Coordinating Committee to ensure a coordinated government \n     response across Federal agencies;\n       (3) to develop a Federal information clearinghouse to \n     enable researchers to study the sources, scale and impact of \n     marine debris more efficiently; and\n       (4) to take appropriate action in the international \n     community to prevent marine debris and reduce concentrations \n     of existing debris on a global scale.\n\n     SEC. 3. NOAA MARINE DEBRIS PREVENTION AND REMOVAL PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--There is established, within \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a Marine \n     Debris Prevention and Removal Program to reduce and prevent \n     the occurrence and adverse impacts of marine debris on the \n     marine environment and navigation safety.\n       (b) Program Components.--Through the Marine Debris \n     Prevention and Removal Program, the Under Secretary for \n     Oceans and Atmosphere (Under Secretary) shall carry out the \n     following activities:\n       (1) Mapping, identification, impact assessment, removal, \n     and prevention.--The Under Secretary shall, in consultation \n     with relevant Federal agencies, undertake marine debris \n     mapping, identification, impact assessment, prevention, \n     and removal efforts, with a focus on marine debris posing \n     a threat to living marine resources (particularly \n     endangered or protected species) and navigation safety, \n     including--\n       (A) the establishment of a process, building on existing \n     information sources maintained by Federal agencies such as \n     the Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast Guard, for \n     cataloguing and maintaining an inventory of marine debris and \n     its impacts found in the United States navigable waters and \n     the United States exclusive economic zone, including \n     location, material, size, age, and origin, and impacts on \n     habitat, living marine resources, human health, and \n     navigation safety;\n       (B) measures to identify the origin, location, and \n     projected movement of marine debris within the United States \n     navigable waters, the United States exclusive economic zone, \n     and the high seas, including the use of oceanographic, \n     atmospheric, satellite, and remote sensing data; and\n       (C) development and implementation of strategies, methods, \n     priorities, and a plan for preventing and removing marine \n     debris from United States navigable waters and within\n\n[[Page S11812]]\n\n     the United States exclusive economic zone, including \n     development of local or regional protocols for removal of \n     derelict fishing gear.\n       (2) Reducing and preventing loss of gear.--The Under \n     Secretary shall improve efforts and actively seek to prevent \n     and reduce fishing gear losses, as well as to reduce adverse \n     impacts of such gear on living marine resources and \n     navigation safety, including--\n       (A) research and development of alternatives to gear posing \n     threats to the marine environment, and methods for marking \n     gear used in specific fisheries to enhance the tracking, \n     recovery, and identification of lost and discarded gear; and\n       (B) development of voluntary or mandatory measures to \n     reduce the loss and discard of fishing gear, and to aid its \n     recovery, such as incentive programs, reporting loss and \n     recovery of gear, observer programs, toll-free reporting \n     hotlines, computer-based notification forms, and providing \n     adequate and free disposal recepticals at ports.\n       (3) Outreach.--The Under Secretary shall undertake outreach \n     and education of the public and other stakeholders, such as \n     the fishing industry, fishing gear manufacturers, and other \n     marine-dependent industries, on sources of marine debris, \n     threats associated with marine debris and approaches to \n     identify, determine sources of, assess, reduce, and prevent \n     marine debris and its adverse impacts on the marine \n     environment and navigational safety.

Mr. President, the nomination of Keith Starrett of \nMississippi is strongly supported by Senator Lott and Senator Cochran. \nJudge Starrett is nominated to a vacancy on the Southern District of \nMississippi created when the President ignored the Senate's withholding \nof its consent and unilaterally appointed Judge Charles Pickering to \nthe Fifth Circuit.\n  With this nomination, President Bush forfeited another opportunity to\n\n[[Page S11828]]\n\nbe a uniter and to draw the country together. I understand the concerns \nof so many African-American organizations and lawyers who continue to \nask the President to begin to achieve some diversity on that bench by \nthe nomination and appointment of a qualified African American. The \nMagnolia Bar Association, a primarily African-American bar association \nin Mississippi, has written the Senate in connection with this \nnomination. The Magnolia Bar's president, Crystal Wise Martin, \nexpresses the group's strong opposition to proceeding with Judge \nStarrett's nomination, not only because it is so late in the session \nbut also because, as she writes: ``[I]t fails to remedy the egregious \nproblem concerning the lack of diversity on Mississippi's federal \nbench.'' She points out that Mississippi has the highest percentage of \nAfrican Americans of any State, but that Mississippi has had only one \nAfrican-American Federal judge. She explains that the Magnolia Bar and \nthe National Bar Association have both made direct requests to the \nPresident that he appoint an African American to fill this important \nvacancy.\n  During the consideration of Charles Pickering's nomination, reports \nwere that Republicans were indicating that they would advocate for an \nAfrican-American nominee if some African Americans would support Judge \nPickering's elevation to a higher court. The administration has chosen \nnot to fulfill those hopes by proceeding with a qualified African-\nAmerican nominee for this important judgeship.\n  This President has shown where his priorities are by nominating more \nlawyers affiliated with the Federalist Society than qualified African \nAmericans, Hispanics and Asian Americans combined.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter from the Magnolia \nBar Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Magnolia Bar\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                                   Jackson, MS, September 6, 2004.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Dirksen Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Dirksen \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: Founded in 1955 by less than \n     ten black lawyers with several purposes including advancing \n     the science of jurisprudence and promoting reform in the law, \n     the Magnolia Bar Association can now boast that it has more \n     than four hundred African-American and white members who \n     practice across Mississippi and many states throughout \n     America. Our members are engaged in every form of practice \n     just as other members of the Mississippi Bar. We are \n     prosecutors, criminal defense attorneys, plaintiff attorneys, \n     defense attorneys, and we are administrative lawyers. Our \n     ranks also include attorneys who specialize in domestic \n     relations and commercial litigation. Simply put, we do it \n     all. We practice in state, federal and tribal courts. The \n     Magnolia Bar is represented on every court in Mississippi \n     except the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. We are proud of \n     what we do, and we are committed to our profession. I, \n     Crystal Wise Martin, am indeed honored to serve as its \n     president.\n       We are strongly opposed to the Senate's consideration of \n     the nomination of Keith Starrett to the Southern District of \n     Mississippi so late in this Administration's term. We \n     understand there is a longstanding and well-respected \n     practice of the Senate Judiciary Committee to withhold \n     consideration of controversial federal judicial nominations \n     by the fall of an election year. We see no reason to deviate \n     from this tradition in the case of the Starrett nomination.\n       The Starrett nomination is particularly untimely. President \n     Bush only nominated Keith Starrett on July 7 of this year, to \n     fill the seat vacated by Charles Pickering upon his recess \n     appointment to the Fifth Circuit. Consideration of the \n     nomination at this point in an election year is simply \n     inappropriate. In Mississippi, absentee voting in the \n     Presidential election begins on September 20. Holding a \n     hearing on the nomination just twelve days before \n     Mississippians can cast their Presidential votes is simply \n     too late. Moreover, it is doubtful that Mr. Starrett could \n     even proceed through the Judiciary Committee before the \n     voting begins.\n       We know of no federal judicial nomination in recent history \n     in which the nomination was made so late in a Presidential \n     term and yet still received a hearing before the Judiciary \n     Committee in the fall of an election year. In the last \n     presidential election year of 2000, there were no hearings \n     whatsoever held in the fall. For example, when President \n     Clinton nominated Ricardo Morado to the district court in \n     Texas on May 11, 2000, Senators objected to the nomination as \n     occurring too late in an election year. Mr. Morado never \n     received a hearing.\n       Additionally, we strongly object to the Starrett nomination \n     because it fails to remedy the egregious problem concerning \n     the lack of diversity on Mississippi's federal bench. \n     Mississippi has the highest percentage of African Americans \n     of any state in the country. Yet Mississippi has had only one \n     African American federal judge--ever. Judge Henry Wingate, \n     who holds this distinction, was appointed nearly twenty years \n     ago.\n       Earlier this year, the Magnolia Bar Association made a \n     direct plea to President Bush to rectify this lack of \n     diversity. In a letter dated February 2, we urge President \n     Bush to appoint an African American to the Southern District \n     of Mississippi. We wrote that the ``appointment of an African \n     American . . . is long overdue.'' We set forth the history of \n     the lack of appointments, and concluded there was a \n     ``compelling case'' for the appointment. We noted the \n     existence of hundreds of African American lawyers in the \n     State and the representation we have been able to achieve on \n     our State and local bench. We offered to consult with the \n     President about the numerous candidates who exist for a \n     federal court position. The National Bar Association, the \n     nationwide organization of African American lawyers, made a \n     similar request this year, directed specifically to the \n     vacancy in the Southern District of Mississippi.\n       Moreover many members of the African American community in \n     Mississippi were led to believe that an African American \n     would receive the nomination to fill Judge Charles \n     Pickering's district court seat. Judge Pickering's \n     supporters, including but not limited to his son, \n     Representative Chip Pickering, were express about their \n     intentions to bring about the nomination of an African \n     American should Judge Pickering be elevated. These \n     representations are well documented in the press. The \n     Washington Post reported that ``Chip Pickering confirmed that \n     he has also been telling prominent African Americans in the \n     state that if his father is promoted to the appeals court, \n     his replacement on the district court will likely be an \n     [African American nominee].'' (``Judge's Fate Could Turn on \n     1994 Case,'' Washington Post, May 27, 1993). The Clarion-\n     Ledger from Jackson, Mississippi referred to Congressman \n     Pickering's representations in an article entitled, \n     ``Pickering Vows to Push Diversity.'' (Clarion-Ledger, May \n     28, 2003).\n       President Bush has refused to heed our requests. Despite \n     having four opportunities, he has not nominated one African \n     American to the federal bench in Mississippi. During his \n     term, President Bush has nominated three persons to the \n     federal district court in Mississippi and one person from \n     Mississippi to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. None are \n     African American. We deplore this Administration's record on \n     diversity in judicial appointments in Mississippi.\n       The failure to diversify Mississippi's federal bench is \n     just one example of the lack of diversity in this \n     Administration's judicial appointments generally. In four \n     years, President Bush has appointed only 11 African Americans \n     to district court seats anywhere in the country. These 11 \n     appointments constitute only less than seven percent of the \n     total of 162 district court appointments. This stands in \n     stark contrast to the record of President Bush's predecessor. \n     In his first term, President Clinton appointed 33 African \n     Americans out of 170 district court appointments, or almost \n     twenty percent. In his second term, President Clinton \n     appointed 20 African Americans out of 137 district court \n     appointments, or fourteen percent. The Magnolia Bar \n     Association strongly believes we should be advancing in \n     African American representation on the federal bench, not \n     retreating.\n       For all of these reasons, we urge you to refrain from \n     considering the Starett nomination at this late date. Thank \n     you.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                              Crystal Wise Martin,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                      Nomination of David Nahmias\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after months of stonewalling by this \nadministration, we are still trying to uncover the truth about the \nabuse of prisoners in U.S. custody overseas. I have long said that \nsomewhere in the upper reaches of the executive branch a process was \nset in motion that rolled forward until it produced this scandal. To \ndate, senior administration officials have avoided any accountability \nfor these atrocities.\n  The Senate is today including the nomination of David Nahmias to \nserve as a U.S. Attorney in Georgia in a final package of confirmations \nfor this Congress. Mr. Nahmias has held senior positions at the \nDepartment of Justice where he worked on the legal underpinnings of the \nPresident's war against terror. The overbroad assertions of executive \npower have been rejected by the Supreme Court and other Federal courts.\n  In speeches, he has unequivocally supported the President's authority \nas Commander in Chief to designate and detain suspected terrorists, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S11829]]\n\nAmerican citizens, as enemy combatants without judicial review by an \narticle III court. In the case of the American citizens detained as \nenemy combatants, argued that there was no reason for judicial review \nof their detentions because they, ``received the absolute ultimate \nexecutive branch process,'' because the ``President of the United \nStates, operating as the Commander-in-Chief, personally reviewed their \ncases, and personally designated them as enemy combatants.'' The \nSupreme Court strongly rejected this position this year and held that \nthe detainees in Guantanamo Bay and U.S. citizens being held as enemy \ncombatants have the right to challenge their detentions in Federal \ncourts.\n  I asked Mr. Nahmias questions about his views on the rights of enemy \ncombatants, his role in investigating, approving, or otherwise \nreviewing rules, procedures, or guidelines involving the interrogation \nof individuals held in the custody of the U.S. Government or an agent \nof the U.S. Government, and his role in the prosecution of domestic \nterrorism cases. His original answers were largely non-responsive. I \nsent him further questions to clarify his record and views.\n  I remain troubled by Mr. Nahmias' answers and uncertain of the extent \nof his involvement in these matters. During Mr. Nahmias' tenure at the \nDepartment, it produced a legal memorandum redefining torture to allow \nall sorts of brutal treatment--such as mock burial alive, simulated \ndrowning, electrocution, tearing off of fingernails, and other such \nbarbaric treatment--so long as the pain caused is not akin to organ \nfailure, and concluding that, as commander in chief in the war against \nterror, the President and federal agents are not constrained by anti-\nterror laws. Since they came to light, these positions have been \nabandoned by the White House counsel and the administration.\n  The American people deserve public officials who are fair and will \nuphold the law. No one is entitled to a high-ranking presidential \nappointment entrusted with making decisions that affect the lives and \nfutures of millions of Americans. Our freedoms are the fruit of too \nmuch sacrifice to give appointments to people who will not fairly \ninterpret the Constitution, enforce Federal protections, and follow \nprevious court rulings on which Americans rely in their daily lives. If \nthere were a separate vote on this nomination, I would oppose it.\n\n\n                    nomination of christopher boyko\n\n  Mr. President, today the Senate voted on the nomination of Judge \nChristopher Boyko for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for \nthe Northern District of Ohio. He is strongly supported by both of his \nhome-State Senators.\n  The Senate has already confirmed four of President Bush's district \ncourt nominees and two of his circuit court nominees from Ohio, \nincluding some who were problematic. Deborah Cook, now on the Sixth \nCircuit, is a staunch Republican and Federalist Society member who was \none of the Ohio Supreme Court's most prolific and activist dissenters \nin favor of corporate interests. She was promoted by the Senators from \nOhio and was confirmed last year. Another Sixth Circuit confirmation, \nJeffrey Sutton, is an active Federalist Society member and one of the \nmost controversial of President Bush's nominees confirmed. Prior to his \nconfirmation to a lifetime appointment on the Nation's second highest \ncourt, Judge Sutton sought out opportunities to attack Federal civil \nrights laws and limit Congress' ability to protect individual rights. \nHe received enough ``negative'' votes for a potential filibuster, but \nhe was not blocked on the floor. The Senate also confirmed four Ohio \ndistrict court nominees for President Bush, many of whom were active \nmembers of the Republican party in Ohio and whose records were somewhat \ntroubling.\n  We moved forward with those nominations even though two of President \nClinton's nominees to Ohio, Kent Markus and Steve Bell, were blocked by \nRepublicans. Neither received a hearing or a vote. Mr. Markus was \nnominated to the Sixth Circuit in February 2000, but was told it was \njust too late. Steven Bell was nominated in August 1999 to the district \ncourt in Ohio and waited for more than a year without receiving a \nhearing. The double standards that the Republican majority has adopted \nobviously depend upon the occupant of the White House.\n  In 1996, when a Democratic President was seeking re-election, the \nRepublican-controlled Senate held only one hearing to consider one \ndistrict court nominee after the August recess, and then never allowed \nthat nominee to have a Committee or Senate vote. Indeed, that nominee, \nJudge Ann Aiken of Oregon, was obstructed so severely by the Republican \nmajority that she was not confirmed to her position until nearly a year \nand a half later.\n  In September 2000, when the vacancy rate on the Federal courts was \naround 7 percent, Republicans refused to proceed with hearings on \nnominees so late in the presidential election year. After the August \nrecess work on judicial nominations came to a halt. Although there were \nover 30 nominees pending, after July 25, 2000, no more judicial \nnominees were scheduled for hearings or considered by the committee. \nThis year, with the vacancy rate at around 3 percent, less than half \nwhat it was in 2000, we expedited consideration of nominees by a \nRepublican President.\n  In both 1996 and 2000, not a single individual nominated after July \n21 was confirmed to the Federal courts--even for seats that were \nalready vacant. When Kent Markus of Ohio was nominated in February 2000 \nto the Sixth Circuit, he was told by Republicans that it was just too \nlate. Judge Boyko was nominated on July 22, 2004 to fill a district \ncourt seat that will not even be vacant until December 31, 2004.\n  That said, I note that since 1996, Judge Boyko has served on the \nCourt of Common Pleas for Cuyahoga County. Unlike many of this \nPresident's nominees, Judge Boyko has a reputation for fairness. He is \nbeing confirmed today for a future vacancy. I congratulate him and his \nfamily on his confirmation.\n\n\n                      nomination of keith starrett\n\n  Mr LOTT. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has approved \nJudge Keith Starrett's nomination today to be a U.S. District Court \nJudge for the Southern District of Mississippi. I was pleased when the \nPresident nominated Judge Starrett to be a U.S. District Court Judge \nbecause he is one of the most experienced and respected trial court \njudges in the Mississippi State court system. I know that his lovely \nwife Barbara and his entire family are very proud of Judge Starrett as \nhe marks this important milestone in his career and prepares to serve \nour state and nation in this new role.\n  Judge Starrett is a bright light in the Mississippi legal community. \nHe holds an undergraduate degree from Mississippi State University and \na J.D. degree from the University of Mississippi School of Law. \nAdditionally, as a sitting trial court judge he has completed a number \nof courses at the National Judicial College which have added to the \nknowledge base which he will bring to the federal bench.\n  Judge Starrett engaged in the general practice of law for 17 years in \nPike County and also served as an Assistant District Attorney, gaining \nbroad experience in the law that such practice areas provide. He was \nappointed to a vacant State circuit court judgeship in 1992, and he was \nelected to continue in this position in 1994, 1998, and 2002. During \nhis 12 years on the bench, Judge Starrett has earned a strong \nreputation as a fair and outstanding trial judge presiding over both \ncivil and criminal cases.\n  One of Judge Starrett's most important accomplishments in his \njudicial career is the leadership he provided in establishing the first \nfelony level drug court in Mississippi in his State judicial district. \nThis court was used as a model for the creation of other drug courts in \nthe State. Judge Starrett's expertise and involvement in this area has \nbeen a key driving force as Mississippi works to implement a drug court \nsystem for the entire State, and he has written and spoken extensively \non this topic. These special courts are better able to address the \nissues of justice and rehabilitation for those charged with crimes \ninvolving drugs, and I commend Judge Starrett for the groundbreaking \nwork he has done in this area.\n  Judge Starrett has also found time to serve his community and \nprofession in many other ways. He helped to found\n\n[[Page S11830]]\n\nMission Pike County, a racial and denominational reconciliation \norganization and Southwest Mississippi Child Protection, a child \nadvocacy group in Lincoln and Pike Counties. He is a leader in his \nchurch and the legal community in Mississippi, and he has been \nrecognized with awards such as the 2003 Judicial Excellence Award given \nby the Mississippi Bar Association.\n  It is no surprise that the American Bar Association's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously found Judge Keith \nStarrett to be Well-Qualified to serve as a U.S. District Court Judge. \nThe vacant seat which Judge Starrett has been confirmed to fill has \nbeen designated a judicial emergency, and I am pleased that the Senate \nhas acted to prevent justice from being delayed any further for the \nparties whose cases are pending in the Southern District of \nMississippi. I congratulate Judge Starrett on his confirmation, and I \nlook forward to his serving as a federal judge for many years to come.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during the past 4 years, the Senate has \nconfirmed more than 200 of President Bush's choices for the only \nlifetime jobs in our system of government. Including the judicial \nnominees scheduled to be confirmed today, Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Senate have confirmed 204 circuit, district and trade court \nnominees in the past four years. That is more Federal judges than were \nconfirmed for President Reagan during his first term, more than in \nPresident George H.W. Bush's presidency, and more than in either of \nPresident Clinton's terms. The first 100 were confirmed in the 17 \nmonths of Democratic Senate leadership. In the other 31 months, \nRepublicans have led the Senate to confirm another 104.\n  With this historic number of confirmations, we are at the lowest \nnumber of vacant seats on the Federal courts in 16 years. There are \nmore Federal judges serving today than at any time in American history. \nWith today's confirmations, there will be only 26 empty seats on the \nFederal courts. If retirements and confirmations were to continue at \nthe current pace, President Bush would be poised to name more than 400 \nlifetime judges on the Federal bench, which contains 879 judges. That \nwould mean he would have appointed more judges than any President in \nour history.\n  Democrats in the Senate have taken as bipartisan approach as possible \nwhile still preserving the Senate's independence to act as a check \nagainst extreme or unfit appointments to these lifetime positions. Some \nof the nominees this President nominated to appellate courts have been \namong the most controversial ever proposed. A handful of them, those \nwith records that do not demonstrate that they will be fair judges who \nwill fully enforce our constitutional rights have been denied the \nconsent of the Senate. The Federal courts should not become the arm of \nthe Republican Party or the Democratic Party. To preserve the \nindependence of the judiciary, the Senate has served its time honored \nroll as a check on the presidential appointment power. The Constitution \nsays advice and consent, not rubber stamp.\n  Ours has been a good record of both cooperation and independence by \nthe Senate. Even with this historic level of bipartisan cooperation and \ndespite the high number of divisive nominees this President has sent to \nthe Senate, partisans continue to claim that nothing short of 100 \npercent approval is acceptable. No President has seen 100 percent of \nhis judicial nominees approved. Not even George Washington got all of \nhis appointments confirmed. Shortly after the Judiciary Committee was \ncreated, nominees of President James Madison were defeated in the \nCommittee. More recently Republicans defeated the nominations of more \nthan 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees and more than 200 of \nhis executive branch nominees in Senate committees.\n  President Bush refused to address the unfair way President Clinton's \nnominees were treated by Senate Republicans through anonymous holds and \nother tactics. Objection from even one Republican Senator was allowed \nto defeat President Clinton's judicial nominees. Republicans worked to \npreserve vacancies in the Clinton years, especially vacancies on the \ncircuit courts like the 6th Circuit and the D.C. Circuit. Two dozen \ncircuit court nominees and more than 40 district court nominees were \ndenied Senate votes of any kind. They are now exploiting their success. \nUnfortunately, President Bush decided in his first term to seek \nconfrontation and politicization of the process rather than consensus. \nThere were opportunities to find common ground that were squandered.\n  During the Clinton administration, leading Republicans claimed that \nas many as 100 vacant seats in the Federal courts did not create any \ncrisis. Some even boasted that they allowed too many judges to be \nconfirmed. There was a dramatic shift when a Republican moved into the \nWhite House when suddenly any number of vacancies became a crisis to \nthem. The rules and Senate procedures Republicans used to stall \nPresident Clinton's nominees were no longer acceptable to them and were \njettisoned with a Republican in the White House.\n  When I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Committee \nwas reorganized back in July 2001, we inherited 110 vacant seats in the \nfederal courts. During my 17 months as chairman, we evaluated the \nPresident's nominees, and confirmed 100 judges. That represented a \ntremendous effort in that short time, especially amid the dramatic \ncrises facing our nation in the wake of the September I 1 attacks and \nthe anthrax attacks directed at Senate Democrats. Rather than adopt \nRepublican methods by which they blocked scores of mainstream nominees \nby President Clinton, we made the process fairer and more open while \npreserving the longstanding rules and precedents of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Senate.\n  Over 17 months, we proceeded to give hearings to 103 of President \nBush's judicial nominees, some of whom proved to be quite controversial \nand divisive, even though the President had promised the American \npeople that he was a ``uniter not a divider.'' The President's \ncontroversial nominations divided us by politicizing the federal \ncourts. They included nominees with records of extremism and in an \neffort to stack the courts unfairly.\n  In this the 108th Congress, Republicans assumed Senate leadership and \nproceeded to bend, break or reinterpret the rules and precedents in \ntheir efforts to ram through the Senate every nominee and turn the \nSenate into a rubber stamp for lifetime appointments.\n  It was in the face of these partisan actions that the only option \nleft to the Senate to protect the independence and fairness of the \ncourts was extended debate. Democrats acted sparingly to withhold \nconsent from the most extreme choices of this President and the most \negregious partisan acts of Senate Republicans. I will not restate the \nspecific concerns with each of those nominees. Those reasons are stated \npublicly in the Record during debate by many Senators. Unlike \nRepublican obstruction which took place most often in secret and \nwithout open and honest debate, when we oppose a nominee we said so and \nexplained why in public.\n  Republicans have held hearings for 120 judicial nominees in the past \n2 years, including hearings for 33 circuit court nominees. Republicans \ndoubled the pace they were willing to maintain from 1997 through 2000 \nwhen it took them 4 years to hold hearings for 33 of President \nClinton's circuit court nominees, despite the fact that President \nBush's nominees have been much more controversial.\n  Two weeks after the session began in January 2003, Republicans \ninsisted on holding a hearing for three controversial circuit court \nnominees on a single panel. This hearing was noticed in less than the \ntime required under the rules and in spite of a bipartisan written \nagreement that had been adhered to since 1987 that only one \ncontroversial judicial nominee would be scheduled at a time. Over the \nobjections of several Members of the Judiciary Committee, that hearing \nproceeded on the nominations of Jeffrey Sutton, Deborah Cook, and John \nRoberts to three circuit courts that had been held hostage by \nRepublicans during President Clinton's second term.\n  The day after that unprecedented hearing in violation of the \nThurmond-Biden guideline, Republicans forced a vote on the nomination \nof Miguel Estrada, even though he had failed to answer the questions of \nmany members of the Committee and the White House\n\n[[Page S11831]]\n\nhad refused to honor past precedent for information sharing. Republican \npartisans then took to calling Senate Democrats anti-Hispanic. Such \nfalse claims marked a new low. Despite the efforts of some, like \nSenator Bennett of Utah, to reach a compromise to allow the Senate to \nreview the work of the nominee, the White House refused. No reasonable \nemployer would hire someone who refused to answer basic questions or \nprovide needed documents. Republicans demanded the Senate proceed with \nregard to a lifetime appointment without such information.\n  Republicans began to list judicial nominees for committee \nconsideration even before they had answered the written questions of \nSenators, let alone answered them responsively. With President Clinton, \nRepublicans refused to list a judicial nominee for a committee vote for \nweeks and often months and sometimes forever. Suddenly, with a \nRepublican in the White House, Republicans decided that Senators did \nnot really need their questions answered before scheduling a vote. \nRepublican effort to limit the time and quality of the review of these \nlifetime appointees was disappointing and wrong. Editorial cartoons \nnoted that the Committee was becoming nothing more than a rubber stamp \nat a conveyor belt factory for judges. This approach undermined advice \nand consent.\n  In the final Judiciary Committee meeting in February, Republicans \nbroke another longstanding rule of the Judiciary Committee, rule IV, \nwhich had been respected for nearly a quarter of a century. Rule IV \nrequires a member of the minority of the Judiciary Committee to consent \nto end debate in order to force a vote on a nomination or any other \nmatter. Without consent, Republicans called debate at an end. The claim \nthat the Senate Parliamentarian approved this reading of the rule was \nundercut when the Parliamentarian advised that his position was that he \nhad no authority to enforce committee rules. The committee that should \nrespect the rule of law chose instead to do away with any rule or \nprecedent Republicans found inconvenient.\n  In March, Republicans began claiming that filibusters of nominees \nwere ``unprecedented'' and argued that it was unconstitutional to deny \na nominee a vote. These claims were another reversal from the party \nthat had blocked votes on more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees and more than 200 of his executive nominees through a variety \nof procedures. Republicans not only ignored their own recent history in \nwhich they unsuccessfully filibustered the nominations of Judge \nRosemary Barkett and Judge H. Lee Sarokin, and successfully \nfilibustered the nominations of Dr. Henry Foster and Sam Brown, they \nsought to rewrite the history of the filibuster of the nomination of \nAbe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Senate's \ncloture rule is a departure not from majority rule but from the \nunanimous consent that has been essential to the character of the \nSenate. Now that they are in the majority, Republicans have no use for \nrules protecting the minority or for the historic role of the Senate.\n  Republicans turned their practices upside down when the very people \nwho insisted on recognition of their prerogatives as home State \nSenators with regard to judicial nominees chose with a Republican in \nthe White House to disregard the lack of home State Senator support and \nproceed with hearings and Committee consideration of the nominations of \nCarolyn Kuhl, Janice Rogers Brown, Henry Saad, Richard Griffin, David \nMcKeague, and Susan Nielson.\n  Requiring home State Senator support can and often has led to \nconsultation and cooperation between the Senate and the White House. \nThis White House and Senate Republicans who insisted on it without \nexception during the Clinton years, dispensed with it when it became \ninconvenient to their goal of stacking the courts and moving them \nsharply in one direction. To do so, they proceeded in the face of \nopposition from both home State Senators.\n  When Republicans were being asked to considering the, nominations of \na Democratic President, one negative blue slip from just one home State \nSenator was enough to doom a nomination and prevent a hearing on that \nnomination. This included all nominations, including those to the \ncircuit courts. How else to explain the failure to schedule hearings \nfor such qualified and noncontroversial nominees such as James Beatty \nand James Wynn, African American nominees from North Carolina? What \nother reason could plausibly be found for what happened to the \nnominations of Enrique Moreno and Jorge Rangel--both Latino, both \nHarvard graduates, both highly rated by the ABA, both denied hearings \nin the Judiciary Committee? Republicans used to excuse their refusal to \nproceed on President Clinton's nominees because of the absence of home \nState Senator support. Indeed, in those days, so long as a Republican \nSenator had an objection, it appeared to be honored, whether that was \nSenator Helms objecting to an African American nominee from Virginia or \nSenator Gorton objecting to nominees from California.\n  Republicans continued to hold hearings on controversial judicial \nnominees following the party nominating conventions and with the \nPresidential election just weeks away. Whether they acknowledge it as \nthe Thurmond Rule, or something else, it is a well established practice \nthat in Presidential election years there comes a point when judicial \nconfirmation hearings are not continued without agreement. Republicans \nused to insist that absent the consent of the minority, we await the \nresults of the election and the inauguration of a new President before \nmoving additional nominees. Republicans lived by this precedent when \nthey ran this Committee in 1996 and later, in 2000. In 1996, when a \nDemocratic President was seeking re-election, the Republican-controlled \ncommittee held only one hearing to consider one district court nominee \nafter the August recess, and then never allowed that nominee to have a \ncommittee vote. In 2000, the Republican-controlled committee followed \nthe Thurmond Rule to the letter. After the August recess work on \njudicial nominations came to a halt. Although there were over 30 \nnominees pending, after July 25 2000, no more judicial nominees were \nscheduled for hearings or considered by the committee.\n  Republicans have gone so far as to reverse their practice with \nPresident Clinton by holding hearings for nominees for positions in the \ncourts that would not even become vacancies until after the \nPresidential election. As with everything else, there appears to be one \nrule for Democrats and no rules or precedents for Republicans.\n  Little did we know that through most of the time, Republican staff \nhad been stealing Democratic computer files and using them for partisan \npurposes. When The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times wrote \nthat they were furnished internal documents, the investigation began. \nThe Capitol Police seized the Judiciary computer hard drives and \nservers and the Senate Sergeant at Arms began an internal \ninvestigation. Staff of the Republican leader and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee resigned and confirmed their involvement. This \nyear, the Sergeant at Arms reported that thousands of files had been \nstolen over a period of years and found that this partisan spying and \nstealing may have violated numerous criminal laws. It is a shameful \nchapter in the history of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate. A \nFederal criminal investigation is ongoing into this matter, and I look \nforward to the Justice Department completing that inquiry in the coming \nyear.\n  The President took the unprecedented steps of renominating \ncontroversial nominees on whom the Judiciary Committee had withheld \nconsent and then recess appointed controversial nominees on whom the \nSenate had withheld its consent. This President has utilized the \nconstitutional recess appointment power as an end-run around the \nConstitution's advice and consent requirement. This undermines the \nSenate's institutional role as a check on unfit or unfair nominees to \nour independent court system. Just as Senate Republicans viewed \nlongstanding rules and precedent as inconvenient, the President treated \nthe Constitution's requirement of Senate consent as an inconvenience \nand an opportunity for partisan political gain. The President went so \nfar as to try to steal a circuit seat from one State and over objection \nto award it to another by\n\n[[Page S11832]]\n\nnominating a Virginian to fill a traditional Maryland vacancy on the \nFourth Circuit.\n  Most regrettably as well, the White House fanned the flames and \nrefused to tamp down hateful and unfounded claims that amounted to \nreligious McCarthyism. Senate Democrats refused to be cowed by \nRepublican's false charges that they were anti-Hispanic, anti-African \nAmerican, anti-Christian, antiwoman or antiman. We were none of these \nthings. The fact of the matter is that Democrats were antijudicial \nzealot, period. Democrats stood up for the independence of the Federal \ncourts and fair, nonpartisan judges for the American people.\n  These past 2 years we have witnessed the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand the Senate break with longstanding precedent and Senate tradition. \nWith the Senate and the White House under control of the same political \nparty we have witnessed rule after rule broken or misinterpreted away. \nThe Framer's of the Constitution warned against the dangers of such \nfactionalism, undermining the structural separations of power. \nRepublicans in the Senate have failed to defend the institutional role \nof this branch as a check on the President in the area of nominations. \nIt weakens our Constitution to have such collusion and forfeits the \nstrength and protections of our separation of powers that was designed \nto protect all Americans.\n  From the way that home State Senators are treated to the way hearings \nare scheduled, to the way the Committee questionnaire was altered \nunilaterally, to the way our Committee's historic protection of the \nminority by Committee Rule IV has been violated, to the theft of \ncomputer files, Republicans destroyed virtually every rule, precedent, \ncustom and courtesy that used to help create and enforce cooperation \nand civility in the confirmation process. Their approach to our rules \nand precedents follows their own partisan version of the golden rule, \nwhich is that ``he with the gold, rules.'' It is as if those currently \nin power believe that they are above our constitutional checks and \nbalances and that they can reinterpret any treaty, law, rule, custom or \npractice they do not like or they find inconvenient.\n\n  Some of these interpretations are so contrary to well-established \nunderstandings that it is like we have fallen down the rabbit hole in \nAlice in Wonderland. I am reminded that the imperious Queen of Hearts \nrebuked Alice for having insufficient imagination to believe \ncontradictory things, saying that some days she had believed six \nimpossible things before breakfast. I have seen things I thought \nimpossible on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate, things \nimpossible to square with the past practices of Committee and the \nhistory of the Senate.\n  Under our Constitution, the Senate has a vital role in the selection \nof our judiciary. The brilliant design of our Founders established that \nthe first two branches of government would work together to equip the \nthird branch to serve as an independent arbiter of justice. The \nstructure of our Constitution and our own Senate rules of self-\ngovernance are designed to protect minority rights and to encourage \nconsensus. Despite the razor-thin margin of recent elections, \nRepublicans are not acting in a measured way but in complete disregard \nfor the traditions of bipartisanship that are the hallmark of the \nSenate. Theirs is a practice of might makes right is wrong. One of the \ngreat strengths of the Senate is its role as a continuing body with \ncontinuing rules that have, until the 108th Congress, been respected \nand followed under either Democratic leadership or Republican control. \nOur rules must not change to give whoever is in the majority the power \nto jerry rig whatever result is desired.\n  As the Rev. Martin Luther King wrote in his famous Letter from a \nBirmingham Jail, ``Let us consider a more concrete example of just and \nunjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority \ngroup compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on \nitself. This is difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is \na code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is \nwilling to follow itself. This is sameness made legal.''\n  Fair process is a fundamental component of the American system of \nlaw. If we cannot have a fair process in these halls or in our courts, \nhow will the resulting decisions be viewed? If the rule of law is to \nmean anything it must mean that it applies to all equally.\n  No man and no party should be above the law. That has been one of the \nstrengths of our democracy. Our country was born in reaction to the \nautocracy and corruption of King George, and we must not forget our \nroots as a nation of both law and liberty. The best guarantee of \nliberty is the rule of law, meaning that the decisions of government \nare not arbitrary and that rules are not discretionary or enforced to \nhelp one side and then ignored to aid another. James Madison, one of \nthe Framers of our Constitution, warned in Federalist No. 47 of the \nvery danger that has threatened our great nation during the 108th \nCongress, a threat to our freedoms from within: ``[The] accumulation of \nall powers legislative, executive and judiciary in the same hands . . . \nmay justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.''\n  The American people deserve better governance than we have seen with \nthe destruction of rule after rule by a majority willing to sacrifice \nthe power and precedents of the Senate. Our freedoms as Americans are \nthe fruit of too much sacrifice to have the rules ignored in the United \nStates Senate by partisans colluding with the White House to try to \nappoint unfit loyalists to courts who have been chosen with the hope \nthat they will re-interpret our great precedents and overturn the very \nlaws that have protected our most fundamental rights as Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/11/20/senate-section/article/S11832-1", "month": "11", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 481\n\n       Whereas historians have written that World War II began on \n     September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany, without a declaration \n     of war, invaded Poland; and following Poland's surrender, the \n     Nazis quickly moved to invade and occupy Denmark, Norway, \n     Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium;\n       Whereas following the Japanese sneak attack on the United \n     States at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on December 7, 1941, the \n     United States declared war on Japan and entered the conflict \n     on the side of freedom and democracy;\n       Whereas when the fate of the free world was in jeopardy as \n     a direct result of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime's desire \n     for world conquest, the ``greatest generation ever'' took up \n     the task of ridding the world of Nazi and Fascist regimes;\n       Whereas in 1944 the military forces of the United States, \n     the United Kingdom, and Canada landed at 5 beaches (Utah \n     Beach, Omaha Beach, Gold Beach, Juno Beach, and Sword Beach) \n     in Normandy, France with the goal of liberating Europe from \n     the Nazi forces;\n       Whereas according to military historians, in preparation \n     for the amphibious invasion at Normandy, Allied planes \n     pounded the Nazi defenders and dropped thousands of \n     paratroopers behind German lines the night before the \n     seaborne landings;\n       Whereas Major Richard D. Winters (Ret.), a native of \n     Lancaster, Pennsylvania and a graduate of Franklin & Marshall \n     College, served the United States honorably and with great \n     distinction as 1st Lieutenant, Company E, 2nd Battalion, \n     506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division;\n       Whereas landing at the town of Ste. Mere-Eglise on June 6, \n     1944, Lieutenant Winters took command of ``Easy Company'' \n     following the death of the company commander in the airborne \n     drop, and received orders to destroy a four-gun battery of \n     German 105mm howitzers at a French farmhouse named ``Brecourt \n     Manor'', 3 kilometers from Ste. Marie-du-Mont;\n       Whereas Lieutenant Winters, with only 12 men, proceeded to \n     assault this enemy battery which was directing heavy fire \n     against the 4th Infantry Division as they landed on Utah \n     Beach;\n       Whereas against great odds, and through extraordinary \n     bravery, Lieutenant Winters and his men were able to overcome \n     a platoon of 50 elite German soldiers guarding the battery;\n       Whereas Lieutenant Winters personally led the attack and \n     repeatedly exposed himself directly to enemy fire while \n     performing his military duties;\n       Whereas this gallant action by Lieutenant Winters and his \n     men, 4 of whom gave their lives, and 2 of whom were wounded, \n     saved countless lives among the soldiers of the 4th Infantry \n     Division; and\n       Whereas Lieutenant Richard D.

Winters and the men of ``Easy Company'' in \n     assuring the success of the Allied Normandy campaign, begun \n     on June 6, 1944; and\n       (4) expresses its gratitude for the selfless service of \n     Lieutenant Richard D.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 482, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Kennedy, Reed, Kerry, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 482) congratulating the Boston Red \n     Sox on winning the 2004 World Series.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a long awaited--long, long, long \nawaited--privilege to have this opportunity on the Senate floor this \nmorning to do something that no Member has been able to do for 86 \nyears--congratulate the Boston Red Sox on winning-the World Series.\n  Red Sox nation is still celebrating.\n  What a year for sports in Boston, first the New England Patriots win \nthe Super Bowl in football and now the Boston Red Sox are the World \nChampions in baseball. This feat of the same city winning both the \nSuper Bowl and the World Series in the same year is also rare. It last \nhappened in 1979, when the Pittsburgh Steelers won the Super Bowl and \nthe Pittsburgh Pirates won the World Series. Boston truly is the city \nof champions. My only regret is that we didn't also manage to win the \nNational Championship this year in the other famed contact sport--\nAmerican politics.\n  But my purpose now is to urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution praising the victory of the Red Sox. That victory was \ncelebrated not only in Boston but in the entire Nation, since Red Sox \nnation has fans in all 50 States. Fans across the Nation traveled to \nBoston on October 30 to be part of the 3 million fans who persevered \nthrough cold and wet weather to honor the team that they grew up \nwatching and be part of the dramatic victory parade.\n  The Curse of the Bambino, as it was called, was finally lifted after \n86 long years, and we had a World Series victory to celebrate at long \nlast. It was far from an easy victory, but the Sox met the challenges \nwith their never-give-up attitude. They came back from a three games to \nnone deficit and won four straight games to defeat the Yankees and won \nthe American League Pennant, 4 games to 3. The magical ride continued \nthrough the World Series that followed, and the Red Sox won another \nfour straight games to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals and won the \nvictory that has escaped us since 1918. And in doing so, winning eight \nstraight playoff games, the Red Sox set a separate major league \nbaseball record as well.\n  So I welcome this opportunity to salute each of these gifted and \ndedicated athletes as the modern Red Sox heroes, they are--Mark \nBellhorn, Orlando Cabrera, Johnny Damon, Alan Embree, Keith Foulke, \nDerek Lowe, Pedro Martinez, Kevin Millar, Bill Mueller, Trot Nixon, \nDavid Ortiz, Manny Ramirez, Dave Roberts, Curt Schilling, Jason \nVaritek, and Tim Wakefield.\n  Red Sox Manager Terry Francona deserves immense credit for guiding \nthe team to this new height, and inspiring all the players to rise to \nthe challenges when the going seemed bleakest against the Yankees in \nthe playoffs last month. They remind me of one of the famous slogans of \nthe Army Air\n\n[[Page S11836]]\n\nCorps in World War II--``The difficult we do immediately--the \nimpossible takes a little longer.''\n  I also congratulate, the president and CEO of the Red Sox, Larry \nLucchino, and the team's general manager, Theo Epstein, who were \nindispensable in building this team of champions.\n  The owners of the Red Sox, John Henry and Tom Werner, never wavered \nfrom their goal of ending the curse and winning the World Series.\n  My grandfather, John Fitzgerald was Ma or of Boston when Fenway Park \nfirst opened in April, 1914, and it was easy to see how much he loved \nthe team in all the years when I was growing up. I am sure he is \nsmiling down now on this year's team as well, and I am delighted that \nmy own grandchildren could savor this year's victory.\n  For the amazing feat the Boston Red Sox accomplished this year, we \nare eternally grateful. And this resolution is a way of expressing the \ngratitude of fans in Boston and across the country for this \nextraordinary achievement.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Microenterprise Results and \n     Accountability Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       Congress finds and declares the following:\n       (1) Congress has demonstrated its support for \n     microenterprise development assistance programs through the \n     enactment of two comprehensive microenterprise laws:\n       (A) The Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 \n     (title I of Public Law 106-309; 114 Stat. 1082).\n       (B) Public Law 108-31 (an Act entitled ``An Act to amend \n     the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 and the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase assistance for the \n     poorest people in developing countries under microenterprise \n     assistance program under those Acts, and for other \n     purposes'', approved June 17, 2003).\n       (2) The report on the effectiveness of the United States \n     Agency for International Development's microfinance program, \n     prepared by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, rated \n     the Agency in the top tier of the 17 donors in this field.\n       (3) The Comptroller General, in a report dated November \n     2003, found that the United States Agency for International \n     Development has met some, but not all, of the key objectives \n     of such microenterprise development assistance programs.\n       (4) The Comptroller General's report found, among other \n     things, the following:\n       (A) Microenterprise development assistance generally can \n     help alleviate some impacts of poverty, improve income levels \n     and quality of life for borrowers and provide poor \n     individuals, workers, and their families with an important \n     coping mechanism.\n       (B) Microenterprise development assistance programs of the \n     United States Agency for International Development have \n     encouraged women's participation in microfinance projects \n     and, according to data of the Agency, women have comprised \n     two-thirds or more of the micro-loan clients in Agency-funded \n     microenterprise projects since 1997.\n       (5)(A) The Comptroller General's report recommends that the \n     Administrator of the\n\n[[Page S11837]]\n\n     United States Agency for International Development review the \n     Agency's ``microenterprise results reporting'' system with \n     the goal of ensuring that its annual reporting is complete \n     and accurate.\n       (B) Specifically, the Administrator should review and \n     reconsider the methodologies used for the collection, \n     analysis, and reporting of data on annual spending targets, \n     outreach to the very poor, sustainability of microfinance \n     institutions, and the contribution of Agency's funding to the \n     institutions it supports.\n\n     SEC. 3. MICROENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.\n\n        Chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2166 et seq.) is amended by inserting after title \n     V the following new title:\n\n           ``TITLE VI--MICROENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE\n\n     ``SEC. 251. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       ``Congress finds and declares the following:\n       ``(1) Access to financial services and the development of \n     microenterprise are vital factors in the stable growth of \n     developing countries and in the development of free, open, \n     and equitable international economic systems.\n       ``(2) It is therefore in the best interest of the United \n     States to facilitate access to financial services and assist \n     the development of microenterprise in developing countries.\n       ``(3) Access to financial services and the development of \n     microenterprises can be supported by programs providing \n     credit, savings, training, technical assistance, business \n     development services, and other financial services.\n       ``(4) Given the relatively high percentage of populations \n     living in rural areas of developing countries, and the \n     combined high incidence of poverty in rural areas and growing \n     income inequality between rural and urban markets, \n     microenterprise programs should target both rural and urban \n     poor.\n       ``(5) Microenterprise programs have been successful and \n     should continue to empower vulnerable women in the developing \n     world.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3028, which was introduced \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3028) to amend the Controlled Substances Import \n     and Export Act to provide authority for the Attorney General \n     to authorize the export of controlled substances from the \n     United States to another country for subsequent export from \n     that country to a second country, if certain conditions and \n     safeguards are satisfied.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce with my colleague, \nSenator Biden, the Controlled Substances Export Reform Act of 2004. \nThis bill would make a minor, but long overdue, change to the \nControlled Substances Act to reflect the reality of commerce in the \n21st Century and to protect high-paying American jobs, while \nmaintaining strong safeguards on exports.\n  Before I discuss this bill, I want to thank Senator Biden for working \nwith me on this important legislation. Senator Biden has long been \nrecognized as a national leader on drug-related measures, and we have a \nhistory of working together on a bipartisan basis to enact sensible \nreforms in this area, as evidenced by the recent enactment of our \nsteroid precursor bill. I respect his thoughtful collaboration, and I \nthank him for his work on the proposal we are introducing today.\n  In sum, this proposed legislation will amend the Controlled \nSubstances Act of 1970 providing greater parity for U.S. manufacturers, \nwho wish to export their products while retaining full DEA authority \nover U.S. exports.\n  Current law places severe restrictions on exports of certain drug \nproducts from the United States. The Controlled Substances Export \nReform Act proposes to amend that law to correct one small, but onerous \nprovision that is unnecessarily threatening American jobs. This change \nis entirely consistent with the long-established regulatory scheme \npursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n  At present U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are permitted to export \nmost controlled substances only to the immediate country where the \nproducts will be consumed. Shipments to centralized sites for further \ndistribution across national boundaries are prohibited. This contrasts \nwith the freedom of pharmaceutical manufacturers throughout the rest of \nthe world to readily move approved medical products among and between \ninternational drug control treaty countries without limitation or \nrestriction.\n  The unique prohibitions imposed on domestic manufacturers \ndisadvantage U.S. businesses by requiring smaller, more frequent and \ncostly shipments to each country of use without any demonstrable \nbenefit to public health or safety. By imposing significant logistical \nchallenges and financial burdens on U.S. companies, the law creates a \nstrong incentive for domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers to move \nproduction operations overseas, threatening high-wage American jobs.\n  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 permits U.S. manufacturers of \nSchedule I and II substances and\n\n[[Page S11841]]\n\nSchedule III and IV narcotics to export their products from U.S. \nmanufacturing sites only to the receiving country where the drug will \nbe used. The law prohibits export of these products if the drugs are to \nbe distributed outside the country to which they are initially sent. \nThe effect of this restriction is to prevent American businesses from \nusing cost-effective, centralized foreign distribution facilities. In \naddition, under the current regime, unexpected cross-border demands or \nsurges in patient needs cannot be met. Likewise, complex and time-\nsensitive export licensing procedures prevent the shipment of \npharmaceuticals on a real time basis.\n  European drug manufacturers face no such constraints. They are able \nto freely move their exported products from one nation to another while \ncomplying with host country laws. This is entirely consistent with the \nscheme of regulation imposed by international drug control treaties. \nOnly the United States imposes the additional limitation of prohibiting \nthe further transfer of controlled substances.\n  Thus, while a French or British company can ship its products to a \ncentral warehouse in Germany for subsequent distribution across the \nEuropean Union, an American company must incur the added costs of \nshipping its products separately to each individual country.\n  The Controlled Substances Export Reform Act would correct this \nimbalance and permit the highly regulated transshipment of exported \npharmaceuticals placing American businesses on an equal footing with \nthe rest of the world. Importantly, however, DEA's authority to control \nU.S. exports would not be diminished.\n  The legislation authorizes the Attorney General, or his designee, the \nDEA, to permit the re-export of Schedule I and II substances and \nSchedule III and IV narcotics to countries that are parties to the \nSingle Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the Convention on Psychotropic \nSubstances under tightly controlled circumstances: First, each country \nis required to have an established system of controls deemed adequate \nby the DEA. Next, only permit or license holders in those countries may \nreceive regulated products. Third, re-exports are limited to one single \ncross-border transfer. Then the DEA must be satisfied by substantial \nevidence that the exported substance will be used to meet an actual \nmedical, scientific or other legitimate need, and that the second \ncountry of receipt will hold or issue appropriate import licenses or \npermits. Fifth, in addition, the exporter must notify the DEA in \nwriting within 30 days of a re-export. And finally, an export permit \nmust have been issued by the DEA.\n  These safeguards are rigorous but fair, and represent a much-needed \nmodernization of the law. The current restrictions on U.S. \npharmaceutical exports have remained essentially unchanged for more \nthan thirty years. In that time, the global economy has changed \ndramatically. For those among us who express concerns about the \noutsourcing of American jobs and the competitiveness of U.S. companies, \nthis modest change represents an opportunity to address such problems \nhead-on.\n  The Controlled Substance Act's limitation on U.S. pharmaceutical \nexports imposes unique, unnecessary, and significant logistical and \nfinancial burdens on American businesses. The effect of this outdated \npolicy is to create a strong incentive for domestic pharmaceutical \ncompanies to move production overseas, threatening American jobs and \neliminating DEA jurisdiction over the manufacture and shipment of their \nproducts. The Controlled Substances Export Reform Act removes this \nunwarranted barrier to U.S. manufacturers' use of cost-effective \ndistribution techniques while retaining full DEA control of U.S. \nexports and re-exports. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join \nSenator Biden and myself in support of this bill.\n\n\n                              section 1003\n\n  I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Delaware's work on this \nlegislation and am pleased to join with him in correcting this small, \nbut important provision of law.\n  Section 1003 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act \ncurrently permits U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers to export schedule \nI and II drugs and schedule III and IV narcotics only to the exact \ncountry where the products will be used. While American companies are \nprohibited from using centralized foreign distribution facilities, our \ninternational competitors face no similar restrictions and can freely \nship medicines for cross-border distribution between all international \ndrug control treaty countries.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Isn't it true that the disadvantage to U.S. businesses of \nrequiring smaller, more frequent shipments to each country of use is \nsubstantial? When a foreign entity seeks to import a schedule I or II \ndrug, or a schedule III or IV narcotic from the United States, they \nmust first secure an import permit that is shared with the U.S. \nmanufacturer and DEA. Our companies then have 60 days in which to \nobtain independent safety and quality testing on each separate product \nbatch to be shipped. Upon completion of that testing, the manufacturer \nsubmits a highly detailed export permit application for DEA's approval. \nIf DEA fails to issue the permit within 60 days, the entire process \nmust be restarted. Because independent testing is expensive and the \nexport process is highly paper intensive, it is not unusual for \ncompanies to struggle against the 60-day deadline only to have to begin \nagain. Unfortunately, while we engage in this burdensome process, \npatients suffer without their drugs and foreign physicians seek out \nsubstitutes to unreliable U.S. supplies.\n  This process was put in place long before the adoption of our \ninternational drug control treaties and the anti-diversion protections \nthey provide. It is now outdated and unnecessary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, the Senator is correct. In addition to the burden \nimposed on U.S. manufacturing exporters, the advent of the European \nUnion has created a situation that places our foreign distributors in \nviolation of European law. Member countries of the EU are considered \nborderless in terms of trade. Products introduced into the European \nUnion are required to be available for transport and shipment among and \nbetween all member countries under their law. However, because we don't \nrecognize the European Union as a single entity and cross-border \ntransfers are prohibited, our distributors are placed in the position \nof violating European law in being forced to deny inter-country \ndistribution of U.S. drugs.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. While the Controlled Substances Act restrictions made \nsense when they were adopted over 30 years ago, would you agree that \nchanges in the way international pharmaceutical markets work, and in \nthe way controlled substances are tracked, and have since rendered the \nrequirements unnecessary? Our legislation was developed in cooperation \nwith the Drug Enforcement Administration to ensure that all necessary \nanti-diversion controls remain.\n  Under our bill, each country is required to have an established \nsystem of controls deemed adequate by the DEA. Only DEA permit or \nlicense holders in those countries may receive regulated products. Re-\nexports are limited to one single cross-border transfer. The DEA must \nbe satisfied by substantial evidence that the exported substance will \nbe used to meet an actual medical, scientific or other legitimate need \nand that the second country of receipt will hold or issue appropriate \nimport licenses or permits. The exporter must notify the DEA in writing \nwithin 30 days of a re-export, and an export permit must have been \nissued by the DEA.\n  The legislation specifically retains the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration's authority to deny a request to export or re-export a \ncontrolled substance. A company seeking to export a drug for subsequent \ntransfer must provide the DEA with exhaustive information on both the \ncountry of initial export and the countries to which the controlled \nsubstances would ultimately be destined. In addition, DEA must be \nprovided follow-up notification of any cross border shipment within 30 \ndays of that transfer. The U.S. Government will know where all drugs \nare being shipped and for what purpose. Without that information, U.S. \npharmaceuticals will never leave our soil.\n\n[[Page S11842]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. That it is correct. The purpose and intent of this \nlegislation is to place U.S. pharmaceutical companies on equal footing \nwith their international competitors. Moreover, this change is entirely \nconsistent with the long-established regulatory scheme pursuant to the \nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Eliminating the need for multiple, \nsmall shipments and the associated wasteful, small batch testing, will \nsave U.S. companies nearly 80 percent over current export distribution \ncosts, savings that will result in more American jobs and stronger \ninternational markets for U.S. products.\n  As the Senator noted, the bill has been crafted with the assistance \nof the Drug Enforcement Administration to ensure all necessary controls \nwill remain in place while creating a level playing field for American \nbusiness. It is simply a commonsense update to an outdated law, and I \nurge its passage.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements regarding this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3028) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
