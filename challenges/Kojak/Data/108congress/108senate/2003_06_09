Mr. President, this morning there will be an hour of \nmorning business for Senators to give statements and introduce \nlegislation. At 1 p.m. today, the Senate will resume consideration of \nS. 14, the Energy bill. Chairman Domenici will be here and available \nfor Members to come to the floor today and to offer their amendments.\n  Last week, in addition to finishing action on the child tax credit \nand the Defense authorization bill, we were able to make progress on \nthe Energy bill. The Senate worked its will on a number of amendments \nrelating to ethanol. We conducted six rollcall votes on that issue last \nweek, and I thank all Members in the energy debate last week and look \nforward to their continued participation over the course of this week. \nWe will continue to move forward on this important legislation to \nproduce a national energy policy which our Nation so badly needs.\n  To this end, we will continue to have discussions with the other side \nof the aisle in an effort to reach an agreement on the remaining \namendments to the Energy bill. We would like to finish consideration of \nthe bill this week, so it is my hope that we will have a filing \ndeadline for amendments to allow the chairman and the ranking member to \nwork through an amendment list. Again, we are working with the chairman \nand ranking member and our colleagues to produce such a list.\n  As a reminder, there will be a rollcall vote today beginning at 5:45. \nThat vote will be on the confirmation of the nomination of Michael \nChertoff to be a United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit.\n  For the remainder of the week, Chairman Domenici will continue to \nprocess amendments on the Energy bill. In addition, we are working on \nan agreement for the FAA reauthorization bill. This week, we will be \nlooking for the appropriate window to consider that reauthorization of \nthe Federal Aviation Administration.\n  Also, we will continue to work toward consent agreements on the State \nDepartment authorization bill as well as the bioshield bill so that \nthey can be placed on the Senate's schedule as well.\n  This week, we will likely--almost certainly--consider a bill on which \nSenator McConnell has been working related to Burma and proposed \nsanctions.\n  Finally with respect to the schedule, I would remind my colleagues \nthat on Monday of next week--that is, 7 days from today--the Senate \nwill begin consideration of a Medicare improvement and prescription \ndrug bill. Members should expect busy sessions during both this week \nand the 2 following weeks; that is, the total of the coming 3 weeks \nprior to the next scheduled adjournment.\n  We have had a very productive session thus far. I do want to thank \nall Members for their hard work and cooperation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may, briefly, our leader announced to \nthe assembled Democrats last Thursday that we were not going to ask for \na filing deadline on amendments but we would request from our folks a \nfinite list of amendments so that we could get a list of the amendments \npeople wished to offer. We were confident the Democrats were going to \noffer amendments that would be relevant to the bill. I am not sure what \nthat term means--but anyway, in keeping with the Energy bill. So we can \nwork, then, with those who have offered amendments.\n\n  I have spoken to both managers of the bill. Toward the end of last \nweek, we had a little problem in that our side had an amendment to \noffer and some of our Senators were not here; Senator Domenici wanted \nto offer an amendment and some of his Senators were not here. I hope \nthis week we can just move forward with the amendments. Senator \nDomenici has an amendment\n\n[[Page S7512]]\n\ndealing with Indians he wants to offer right away. We hope that can be \ndone. He knows there is going to be a second-degree amendment offered \nto that. That will take several hours.\n  I think we are moving down the road on this most important energy \nlegislation. Once we get the amendments, we can better advise the \nmajority leader and Senator Daschle as to how long we estimate it will \ntake. We have acknowledged, in our assembled meetings of Democrats, \nthat we appreciate your allowing the Senate to work its will, and not, \nas has been done in the past on more occasions than we would like to \nacknowledge, just filing cloture. You have indicated you are not going \nto do that until you believe it is necessary, and I don't think it is \nnecessary, at this stage.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the assistant \nDemocratic leader. We are in discussions. The real objective is to have \na list of amendments so we can have the definition to both gather \nsupport on both sides of the aisle and to really give a focus so we can \nestablish a roadmap by which we can adequately debate, adequately amend \nthis bill appropriately so. That is the purpose. Again, we are working \non both sides of the aisle, with the two managers of the bill to that \nend.\n  Mr. President, I want to very briefly comment on the last 2 weeks. As \nwe start each week--at least as I start each week, I can't help but \ncome in early Monday morning and look at where we have been and project \nwhere we are going. As I laid out the schedule, where we are going is \npretty clear, in terms of how we will spend the next 3 weeks on the \nfloor of the Senate. I hope the clarity and the specific plan that I \nlay out--recognizing it can be modified at any time and should be \nmodified according to circumstances that arise over the course of the \nday, but I hope that outlook, that vision of where we are going, that \nagenda setting, does facilitate the overall action, debate, and \namendment process of this body.\n  It also gives me the opportunity to look back over the last 2 weeks. \nIndeed, as I look back over the last 2 weeks, we made huge progress, I \nbelieve, especially for America's taxpayers. That 2003 jobs and growth \nbill passed by Republicans in the Senate, signed by President Bush, \nwill provide an average of $1,786 in tax relief for over 45 million \nmarried couples. Forty million families with children will see their \ntaxes lowered by over $1,549.\n  Six million single mothers will receive an average tax cut of over \n$550. Twelve million elderly taxpayers will receive an average tax cut \nof $1,401. Meanwhile, 3 million individuals and families will be taken \noff the tax rolls completely.\n  Indeed, that is progress. That is action. That is delivery for the \nAmerican people. Republicans in the House and Senate worked hard to \nprovide this substantial tax relief for America's working families. \nIndeed, we have delivered.\n  Democrats spent a lot of time talking about tax relief for minimum-\nwage families. But it was the Republicans who took action and got tax \nrelief done. Thanks to Republicans, the Senate now has provided tax \nrelief for families at all income levels, including middle-class \nfamilies in which both parents work. Working families will now have \nextra money in their budgets to pay the bills, to purchase clothes, to \nput food on the table, and maybe even take a family road trip.\n  Last week, we passed a second tax bill that provides additional tax \nrelief for families with children. This bill included some important \ntax reforms as well. This second family tax relief bill in 2 weeks \ncreates a uniform definition of a child. Instead of five confusing and \neven seemingly conflicting and separate definitions, the Tax Code has \nbeen simplified to make it easier for folks to fill out the forms and \nget the tax relief to which they are entitled.\n  Tax simplification has been a longstanding goal of Republicans. \nExpect more efforts on the part of Republicans to make the Tax Code \nmore understandable and less burdensome for America's tax filers.\n  That family tax relief bill will also accelerate the currently \nscheduled increase in the refundability of the child tax credit, and it \nwill phase in the elimination of a marriage penalty that is built into \nthat current formulation of the credit. These fixes will allow the \nchild tax credit to benefit more middle-income families.\n  Together, just in the last 2 weeks, the 2003 jobs and growth package \ncoupled with the family tax relief bill provide the third largest tax \nrelief in the history of the United States. These actions have helped \nlift consumer confidence.\n  Interest rates and inflation remain low. Credit conditions have \nimproved as long-term interest rates have fallen to their lowest levels \nsince the 1950s. Families are rebalancing their debt from short-term \nconsumer credit to longer term credit such as mortgages--a wise and \nprudent move. We are seeing declines in energy prices.\n  We have a lot of reasons to be optimistic. Economic growth increased \n1.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, up slightly from 1.4 \npercent in the last quarter of this year. Many economists expect \ncontinued growth in the current quarter. Consensus forecasts expect \ngrowth to approach 3.7 percent by the final quarter of this year.\n  I say this in a very optimistic vein as we look to the future. Yet \nthere are some clouds. We heard last week the unemployment rate has \nrisen to levels last seen in the economic upturn of 1994. This suggests \nthe growth in the economy over the last few years has been in large \npart due to rapid productivity gains.\n  In addition, since 1999, the rising cost of health benefits has \nexceeded the growth in wages and salaries. As a result, health care \ncosts are driving up the cost of hiring and employing workers. In other \nwords, good jobs are becoming more expensive--another important reason \nwe need to strengthen Medicare, to save and preserve and strengthen and \nindeed modernize Medicare and add prescription drug coverage the right \nway, not just giving new benefits without consideration that we have an \nobligation to make sure whatever we promise can be sustained, not just \nin the short term and in the midterm but in the long term.\n\n  We need to look at all the ways we can expand the economy, and in \nturn increase the supply of good jobs for America's workers.\n  If we look to the last 2 weeks and project over the next 3 weeks as \nwe have addressed tax relief and tax reform, a sound sustainable energy \npolicy as well as strengthening and improving Medicare and adding a \nprescription drug benefit, I think the American people and our \ncolleagues will agree we are moving America forward by doing business \nin a sound and productive way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7512-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-100]                         \n\n \n[Page S7512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-100]                         \n\n\n[Page S7512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-100]                         \n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will talk a little bit about the pending \nbusiness that will be before us at 1 o'clock. That, of course, is the \nEnergy Bill.\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\n  I am pleased we are now in our second week of consideration of the \nEnergy Bill. I must say we are also in our second year of consideration \nof an energy bill. We did this last year. We talked about it for a \ncouple of weeks on the floor and finally came up with a bill. We went \nto conference committee and were actually unable to put something \ntogether.\n  I continue to believe one of the most important things for this \ncountry at this time is to have a policy on energy, a policy that \nbegins to describe a little more completely where we think we need to \nbe in terms of the future, what we have to do to achieve that vision of \nwhere we need to be, and I think to remind ourselves that we are so \ninvolved with energy. Whether it is in your business, whether it is in \nyour family, whether it is in defense, whether it is in the economy, \nenergy has something to do with everything we do.\n  We have let ourselves get into a position where we are 60 percent \ndependent on foreign oil, much of which comes from that part of the \nworld that is certainly in turmoil much of the time. So that is a real \nsecurity problem for us, and an economic problem as well.\n  Right now, we find people talking about a shortage of natural gas, to \nbe used largely for air-conditioning when it warms up in the summer. \nThat is among the kinds of things that really do have an impact on our \nlives which we could do something about.\n  Again, one of the aspects of energy, which I think is true of most \nany part of our lives, is that things change, and they change \nsubstantially. This is particularly true in energy, and we have to make \nchanges to accommodate the differences that occur.\n  With regard to natural gas, for example, we are using much more \nnatural gas domestically than we did in the past. For one thing, where \nwe had traditionally used coal in the generation of electricity, 97 \npercent of the generators, in the last several years, have been gas \nfired. Well, maybe that is all right, but we are not properly prepared \nto do that.\n  Right now our biggest source of natural gas is in the West, the area \nI come from, in the mountain region, and Wyoming particularly. That is \nour largest source of natural gas for the future. But our problem is we \ndid not expect that, and we have not had the proper delivery system to \nmove that gas from where it is available to the marketplace. Now we do \nnot have the capacity to move the amount of gas we have available, so \nif there is a shortage, it is not going to be a shortage of the \nresource; it is going to be a shortage of our ability to have an \ninfrastructure to move the gas where it needs to go.\n  There are other types of energy in the very same position. I \nmentioned electricity. There was a time when electric utilities \ngenerated and distributed their resource in the same area. If you were \nserved by a particular company, that company generated the electricity \nand distributed it to your business or to your home, and those two \nthings went right together. Now we have come to a situation where much \nof the generation is done by what is called a market generator who does \nnot do distributing but sells it wholesale to the distributor.\n  So what does that require? Obviously, it requires the transmission \ncapacity to move that energy to where the markets are. And we have not \nbeen prepared to do that. So we find ourselves in an unusual situation.\n  In the area of electricity, we also find ourselves at a time when we \nneed to have a little different structure to be able to regulate this \nenergy.\n  Again, as I said before, when the distribution and generation was in \none place, the State public utility commissions could handle all of \nthose things. Now it moves quite often across State lines, so that the \nStates have less involvement in the movement of the electricity. So we \nneed to develop what are called RTOs, regional transportation \norganizations, which include a number of States. There would be one in \nthe West, for example, that probably would include 10 or 11 States, so \nthere are joint efforts to be able to control the movement of the \nenergy as it goes among the States and not each State competing with \none another to cross State lines. There is a change in the way we do \nthings. But we have not kept up with that change in terms of the way we \nregulate or prepare for that movement.\n  There is a great controversy within the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, where FERC has moved in to do more of that regulation. \nStates do not like that particularly. They would like to do it closer \nto home. I agree with that, but we have to have the structure to do \nthat.\n  Obviously, there are other things that are equally as important, such \nas the idea that we find alternative sources of energy and are able to \nput them into a situation where they are competitive economically with \nthe old sources we have always had. It takes a lot of investment, \nincentive, and research to be able to put those things together. \nTherefore, we need to have a policy that moves us in the direction of \nwind energy, or whatever it may be.\n  One of the real opportunities the President has talked about and we \nought to be doing something about is converting coal, for example, to \nhydrogen so that it can be much cleaner for its use, so that it can be \nmore easily moved about for its use, and it could even be used in \nautomobiles, if we could find a way to do that. It takes research and \nincentive and money to do that. So alternatives are also important.\n  Along with that, of course, there is a provision for research, so \nthat we can find new ways to do things, so we can find a way to have \nmore conservation and be able to use energy with more of a thought \ntoward conservation. We can do that, but we have not really set those \ngoals for ourselves.\n  Then, of course, finally, one of the things that is most important is \nthe idea of having increased domestic production. We have a great deal \nof fossil fuel resources in this country. Coal is the largest one. Coal \nis available to us, but the production of coal is in two or three areas \nof the country generally, so we have to find a way to produce that \ncoal, move it to the market, and then have it in a way that is \nprotective of the environment. We can do that as well. It takes more \nresearch. We have to do something with cleaner air. We know we can do \nthose things, but we have not done them as well as we might.\n  So there is a great deal we can do in terms of increasing production. \nFifty percent of my State, for example, is owned by the Federal \nGovernment. Under much of that land are energy resources--coal, gas, \nand oil--and we need to continue to find better ways to produce those \nresources and, at the same time, protect the environment. We can do \nthat. I am not suggesting we produce on every bit of land. Some should \nbe set aside for single uses, such as wilderness. But these are all \nproblems with which we need to deal.\n  I guess I will continue to emphasize that this bill is not just \nsomething that is dealing with today's issues but, rather, an effort to \nhave a vision in the future of where we need to be, to be able to fill \nour needs and help our economy, create jobs, and have the living \nconditions we all desire. That means, of course, the availability of \nsubstantial amounts of energy.\n\n  So I hope we can move forward. I know there are different ideas about \nhow you do it and different notions, depending upon where you live in \ndifferent parts of the country--whether you are in a city or in a rural \narea and those kinds of things. But we need to come up with the kind of \npolicy that is good for the country. We really pretty much have done \nthis.\n  We worked hard in committee, and we came up with a committee plan. \nThe House has a plan. There are some differences, of course, between \nthe two, but that is what our committees are for, to bring together the \nHouse and the Senate versions on various issues and come together with \nthe one that will be acceptable to the Congress and, in this case, also \nacceptable to the administration.\n  The President and the Vice President, of course, have been very \nsupportive of an energy policy, and they continue to be. They have had \nsome ideas that have all been put into the plan or talked about in the \nplan.\n  So we are off on it again this afternoon. We will be doing some \nthings on nuclear power. It is interesting, again, to talk about what \nnuclear could be in the future. Right now, most people don't realize \nhow much nuclear power is being generated. In some States, 30 percent \nof the power is nuclear. It is\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\nprobably the cleanest way to produce electricity, although there are \nsome problems. One is the waste that comes from nuclear use. We can \nresolve some of those issues.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can move in that direction. I want to \ncontinue to work at it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nChair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7514-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-103]                         \n\n \n[Page S7514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-103]                         \n\n\n[Page S7514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-103]                         \n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALFRED LERNER\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to and \nrecognize the accomplishments of a great man and a great leader--Alfred \n``Al'' Learner. Mr. Learner passed away on October 23, 2002, at the age \nof 69, following a courageous battle against cancer. He left behind a \nlasting legacy of hard work and remarkable generosity. Al gave so much \nof himself. He never hesitated to share his good fortune with his \nfellow citizens, particularly those who were most in need.\n  Al Learner was a man who not only believed strongly in the American \ndream, he also lived it. He was born the son of Russian immigrants in \nBrooklyn, NY, in 1933. He graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School \nin 1951 and received a B.A. from Columbia College in 1955. After \ncollege, in the early 1960s, he took a job with the Broyhill Furniture \nCompany as a salesman. His work for Broyhill took him from New York to \nBaltimore and ultimately to his home in Cleveland.\n  With him on this journey--with him, always by his side--was his best \nfriend, his partner, his wife, Norma. Al and Norma were high school \nsweethearts, and they were inseparable. Together they shared 43 years \nof marriage, and together they raised their two children, Randy and \nNancy. Al and Norma's commitment to each other and their children was a \nstrong one. They were both well known for attending every school \nfunction and every afterschool game their children were involved in, \nsetting their professional lives aside to spend time with their family.\n  When Al was not spending time with his family, he was working \ntirelessly in his beloved community. Al's numerous professional \naccomplishments included his service as chairman and chief executive \nofficer of MBNA Corporation, chairman and owner of the Cleveland \nBrowns, and trustee of Columbia University, Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, and New York Presbyterian Hospital.\n\n  I was particularly struck by something Al once noted about his \nsuccess. This is what he said:\n\n       This is the only country in the world [where] that would be \n     possible. The only country in the world for a guy like me \n     with nothing--no background, no sport, no connections, \n     nothing to help me, and no talent. It wasn't that I was a \n     great violin player or a great something. Where a guy like me \n     could just sort of figure it out every day and at some point \n     wake up and say: ``You did pretty good.''\n\n  Indeed, Al Lerner did pretty well. His accomplishments, both in terms \nof his personal success as well as his ability to lend a helping hand \nto his fellow citizens and community members, are clear indications of \nhis success and his compassion and, yes, his humanity.\n  Al Lerner led by example. He served his country as a Marine Corps \nofficer and a pilot from 1955 through 1957 and later continued his \nservice by becoming a director of the Marine Corps Law Enforcement \nFoundation.\n  His service to our country did not end with his departure from the \nArmed Forces. Al was known in particular for his extremely generous \ncontributions to local and national charities, including a contribution \nof $10 million in 1993 to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in \nCleveland, OH, a donation of $16 million to support construction of the \nLerner Research Institute, and a donation of $100 million to the \nCleveland Clinic, one of the largest donations to academic medicine in \nthe history of our Nation.\n  His humility and his dedication to fellow citizens is nowhere better \nevidenced than in the quiet contributions he worked to provide for \nfamilies of victims of the tragic September 11, 2001, terrorist \nattacks.\n  He helped raise funds, through his affiliation with the MBNA \nCorporation and the Cleveland Browns, for the Cleveland Browns Hero \nFund to aid families from the New York City Fire and Police Departments \nwho suffered the loss of a parent.\n  Al continued his service to the country following the September 11 \nattacks by serving as one of 15 members of the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board, advising President Bush on the quality and \nadequacy of intelligence collection to improve the security of our \nhomeland.\n  Al Lerner was an American patriot, a patriot with a purpose and one \nwho succeeded remarkably in achieving what he set out to accomplish. By \nembracing the American dream and dedicating himself to sharing with his \nfellow citizens the good fortune that resulted from his pursuit of it, \nAl truly distinguished himself as an outstanding American, and \ncertainly one worthy of the respect of the Senate.\n  As I think about Al's life, I am reminded of the strong bond he \nshared with his wife Norma. They were such good friends and were really \npartners in life, working side-by-side, together, to raise their family \nand to help their community. I was quite touched at Al's funeral when \nNorma, a very strong and courageous woman, spoke about her life with \nAl. I remember her saying:\n\n       [Al] took us from where we were to beyond where we even \n     would have dreamed we are now. . . . He had an unwavering \n     commitment to helping others and he was the most generous man \n     I've ever known. There was always someone he wanted to help, \n     whether they were sick, financially troubled or just needed a \n     good friend.\n\n  That was Al Lerner.\n  I extend my thoughts and prayers to the entire Lerner family--\nespecially Norma, Randy and Nancy--and to the families, friends, and \ncommunity members who worked with Al and the organizations he \nsupported. As Sir Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we \n     give.\n\n  Few men have adhered more closely to this wise adage than Alfred \nLerner.\n  I am very pleased that last week the Senate passed a resolution that \nmy friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator George Voinovich, and I \nintroduced that recognizes Al Lerner's life, achievements, and \ncontributions. This commemorative resolution is the least we can do in \nthe Senate, on behalf of the entire Nation, to honor a man who \ndedicated his life to honoring his fellow Americans. I thank Al for all \nhis contributions to our State and Nation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. In my capacity as a Senator from Alaska, I \nask unanimous consent the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7514-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-104]                         \n\n \n[Page S7514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-104]                         \n\n\n[Page S7514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-104]                         \n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Chair, in his capacity as \nthe Senator from Tennessee, suggests the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of Senator Dorgan. I \nunderstand he will shortly, at his disposal, offer some amendments with \nreference to hydrogen; is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And the occupant of the Chair will be finished at 2 \no'clock and will manage the bill for a while for us during the time he \nis discussing his, and we will perhaps speak in opposition. In any \nevent, the Senator from New Mexico will also do that. I may be gone for \njust a while. I have a statement with reference to some of the support \nthat has been forthcoming over the weekend that I want to read into the \nrecord so Senators are aware of where the various groups in our country \nare with reference to the amendment to strike the loan guarantees that \nare pending under the bill, S. 14. I will do that and then I will yield \nthe floor. It won't take me very long.\n  I am grateful that so broad a coalition of interest groups has been \nwilling to send letters supporting the nuclear loan guarantee \nprovisions in the Energy bill. I do not intend today to go into detail \nanalyzing the relevance and significance of these loan guarantees and \nwhat I see as the fallacious nature of the arguments against them but \nmerely to state the broad support at this point for the proposal.\n  No one is surprised that provisions in this bill are strongly \nsupported by the utilities and groups such as the Nuclear Energy \nInstitute, but today on my desk I found letters from unions, academics, \nand broad groups from industry. To some extent, that was a surprise. I \ngreatly appreciate their support and want to spend a few moments going \nover their reasons for supporting this measure, which I consider to be \nso important for our country. One is a letter from John Duetch.\n\n  I don't think I have to explain to the Senate who John Deutch is. In \nterms of physics, energy, and nuclear energy matters, he is a ranking \nexpert. He is perhaps the James Schlesinger of the Democratic Party. \nHis letter is accompanied by a Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, well known in academic circles, named Ernie Munis. For \nthose who are not familiar, he served as the head of the nuclear part \nof the Department of Energy during the Democratic administrations \npreceding the Republicans during the last 12 years.\n  Munis joins Dr. Deutch and they concurrently chair an MIT-sponsored \nstudy on the future of nuclear power.\n  I note the presence of the junior Senator from New Mexico and \nminority manager. All I have done so far is talk about some support, \nand the letter I am alluding to he is aware of.\n  I met with Drs. Deutch and Munis last week and asked for their views \non the nuclear loan guarantee provisions in the bill. Their letter \nreads:\n\n       We believe such assistance is important and justified, and \n     that action taken now will influence future investment \n     decisions on nuclear power generation.\n\n  In fact, they propose what some would consider to be an even more \ndirect subsidy for new nuclear powerplants. Their letter explains:\n\n       The mechanism [they] propose for this assistance is a \n     production tax credit of 1.7 cents per kilowatt hour up to a \n     total of $200 million per 1000 megawatt plant.\n\n  We did not do that in the bill. We had contemplated it at various \ntimes during the evolution of the legislation and thought for different \nreasons that the loan guarantee might be preferable. We now have a \nletter that says either of the two would be good, and for the first \ntime two very powerful people say both would be good for our country.\n  I received letters today from the AFL-CIO, and I am most grateful for \ntheir support because I know it is not always easy for groups to \nsupport matters that pertain to nuclear power. I believe, as we have \nbeen saying for a number of days, nuclear power has arrived. The \nquestion is, How will it come on the scene so that America and the \nworld can find out, once again, what it is all about.\n  I do know without a doubt that if a bill is going to be good for the \nAmerican economy by creating jobs at home, the AFL-CIO will back it. I \nam grateful they are doing so today.\n  One of the letters from the Building and Construction Trades \nDepartment of the AFL-CIO says:\n\n       The fifteen unions comprising the Building and Construction \n     Department consider nuclear power an integral, emission-free \n     component in a broad array of national energy choices. And, \n     not unlike the current state of Federal transportation and \n     water systems, our domestic energy infrastructure is in need \n     of a serious upgrade and American workers are in dire need of \n     the jobs created.\n       The construction of these new plants will create \n     significant employment opportunities for our highly skilled \n     members. The construction of just one new nuclear power plant \n     would stimulate the economy by creating between 2,000 and \n     3,000 family wage construction jobs. And, maintaining and \n     operating that plant would create an additional 1,000-1,500 \n     permanent, full-time, high paying jobs.\n\n  The other letter I received was from the Metal Trades Department. It \nreads in part:\n\n       On behalf of the AFL-CIO Metal Trade Department, I urge you \n     to support provisions in the pending energy policy \n     legislation that would enable the construction of new nuclear \n     power plants in the U.S.\n       America's power demands are growing exponentially. A \n     rational and effective energy policy depends upon a diverse \n     mix of fuels and technologies, including nuclear fuel. The \n     health of the nation's economy will require the construction \n     of new nuclear facilities to ensure adequate power resources.\n       Loan guarantees for new nuclear power plants are a critical \n     element of the energy legislation. We urge you to support \n     them.\n\n  Letters will be forthcoming and will be circulated to Senators. I \ncould not have said it better myself had I been preparing a speech. \nRather than the numerous ad lib comments I made heretofore, I could not \nhave said better what has been said by those who write in behalf of the \nworking men and women who need good jobs and who have great skills that \ncan put together these needed facilities. The Chamber of Commerce sent \none of its key vote alerts about the Wyden-Sununu amendment. The \nChamber is straightforward:\n\n       Our Nation's economic vitality and energy security rely \n     upon the ability to utilize a diverse array of fuels and \n     technology to generate electricity. Nuclear energy plays a \n     vital role in assuring this diversity, producing some twenty \n     percent of the country's electricity. Resources for research \n     and development of energy sources ranging from clean coal and \n     geothermal to wind and even fusion are provided by S. 14. To \n     eliminate support for any of these sources would be near-\n     sighted and risk energy stability in the years to come, \n     perhaps leading to devastating economic effects.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urges you to vote against the \n     Wyden-Sununu amendment to S. 14.\n\n  Mr. President, the National Electro-Industry Manufacturing \nAssociation issued a press release today that certainly sums up my \nposition and, hopefully, the position of many in the Senate. In the \npress release they say:\n\n       The reliability and security of our nation's energy supply \n     requires us to have a diverse energy portfolio, including \n     nuclear power.\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\n     Votes against incentives, particularly loan guarantees, are a \n     vote against reliable, low cost, stable, and environmentally \n     friendly energy supplies. It is also a vote against jobs and \n     a stronger economy.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set the \npending amendment aside so that I might be able to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 865\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Reid, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 865.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require that the hydrogen commercialization plan of the \n  Department of Energy include a description of activities to support \n             certain hydrogen technology deployment goals)\n\n       On page 296, line 21, before ``Not'' insert ``(a) In \n     General.--''.\n       On page 297, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (b) Contents.--The plan shall describe the activities of \n     the Department of Energy, including a research, development, \n     demonstration, and commercial application program for \n     developing technologies, to support--\n       (1) the production and deployment of--\n       (A) 100,000 hydrogen-fueled fuel cell vehicles in the \n     United States by 2010; and\n       (B) 2,500,000 hydrogen-fueled fuel cell vehicles in the \n     United States by 2020 and annually thereafter; and\n       (2) the integration of hydrogen activities with associated \n     technical targets and timetables for the development of \n     technologies to provide for the sale of hydrogen at a \n     sufficient number of fueling stations in the United States by \n     2010 and 2020.\n       (c) Progress Review.--The Secretary shall include in each \n     annual budget submission a review of the progress toward \n     meeting the targets under subsection (b).\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offered this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Cantwell, Lieberman, Akaka, Clinton, Kerry, Nelson \nof Florida, Schumer, Harkin, Dodd, Reid, Lautenberg, and Kennedy.\n  I am offering a piece of legislation the Senate has previously passed \nand endorsed in the consideration of the Energy Bill last year. Let me \nspend a few moments talking about the amendment specifically.\n  Very simply, this amendment is one that tries to establish some \ntargets and timetables with respect to moving toward a hydrogen \neconomy, which is something the President talked about doing. Targets \nand timetables, what I mean by that is we cannot enforce targets and \ntimetables that are absolute, but we can as a Senate think big and \ndecide to see if we can establish some targets and goals for the \nmovement toward a hydrogen economy with fuel cells for our economics.\n  I will describe why I think we ought to do this and why this is an \nimportant amendment. I will harken back to the Apollo program. On May \n25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced our Nation was \nestablishing a goal of sending a man to the Moon and having a safe \nreturn from the Moon. He said we will have a man walk on the Moon by \nthe end of the decade. That was 1961. In 1969, Neil Armstrong and then \nBuzz Aldrin stepped on the Moon.\n  The Apollo project was an enormous undertaking. The NASA annual \nbudget increased from $500 million in 1960 to $5.2 billion in 1965. It \nrepresented 5.3 percent of the Federal budget in 1965. Think about \nthat. In today's terms, that would be $115 billion. NASA engaged \nprivate industry, university research, and academia in a massive way. \nContractor employees increased by a factor of 10, to 376,000 people, in \n1965. When President Kennedy said in 1961 it was his vision to have a \nman walk on the Moon by the end of the decade, there was no \ntechnological capability to do so at that moment, no guarantee it could \nbe done. The Soviets had an advantage in space flight. They had put up \na satellite called Sputnik. We were eager to see if we could not \novercome that advantage. During the height of the cold war, that Soviet \nadvantage was of great concern to us. The technological barriers were \nvery significant. The expense was daunting. Yet, on July 20, 1969, Neil \nArmstrong stepped down off of that lunar lander and stood on the \nsurface of the Moon; Buzz Aldrin followed him. I recall they actually \npantomimed a golf game and jumped around on the surface of the Moon. In \na decade, the President said let's set a goal and reach that goal.\n  I will talk about another goal, another big idea, one that we ought \nto establish now for this country and for its future. That is the goal \nof deciding, as President Bush has suggested, that we move toward a \nhydrogen economy and fuel cells for our vehicles. I will describe why I \nthink that is important.\n  This chart says what the President is telling us:\n\n       America's energy security is threatened by our dependence \n     on foreign oil. America imports 55 percent of the oil it \n     consumes. That is expected to grow to 68 percent by 2025.\n\n  Again quoting the President:\n\n       Nearly all of our cars and trucks run on gasoline, and they \n     are the main reason America imports so much oil. Two-thirds \n     of the 20 million barrels of oil Americans use each day is \n     used for transportation; fuel cell vehicles offer the best \n     hope of dramatically reducing our dependence on foreign \n     oil.\n\n  That is from President Bush, and I fully agree with that statement.\n  This graph shows what is happening with respect to consumption and \ndomestic supply of oil. We are importing 55 percent of our oil at the \nmoment, much of it from very troubled parts of the world, and that is \nexpected to grow to 68 percent. The American economy is and will be \nheld hostage by our ability to find oil and import it from outside of \nour country's borders. Should that be difficult for this country? \nShould it cause all of us great concern? The clear answer to that is \nyes. That is a very serious problem.\n  Here is another chart. This is a list of the countries that are \nsupplying our oil. Our top supplier is Saudi Arabia. Almost one-third \nof our oil, incidentally, comes from the Middle East. Iraq has been our \nfifth largest; it is the sixth largest supplier on this chart. Also \nlisted are Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela, and Angola. And when you look at \nthe amount of energy we are importing from that part of the world, it \nis a very serious problem.\n  Some want this energy debate to be a debate about two issues. If it \nis only those two issues, we lose. They are: Should we drill in ANWR? \nHow about doing something on CAFE standards? Well, if this is only \nabout ANWR and CAFE standards, then we lose. We need to pole-vault over \nthose issues. Yes, we can address them, but it seems to me if we don't \npole-vault over to new ground and deal with these issues in a much \ndifferent way, every 25 years we will come back and debate energy and \nwe will be debating exactly the same issues: where next do we drill? \nHow much more efficient can we make a carburetor, through which we run \ngasoline, much of it imported from overseas?\n  If our strategy for energy for this country's future is simply \ndigging and drilling, then it is a strategy I call ``yesterday \nforever.'' It doesn't really change very much. Every 25 years, we can \nredebate the issue of how dependent we are and how dangerous it is for \nus to be that dependent on foreign sources of energy. I would like to \nsee a different debate, one that says let's break out of this cycle. \nWhen I say digging and drilling is yesterday forever, I don't think we \nshould not dig and drill. We will, we can, and we should. We will \nalways use fossil fuels. Using our coal resources in an environmentally \nacceptable way with clean coal technology makes great sense to me. \nUsing our domestic sources of energy and natural gas--especially oil \nand natural gas--makes sense to me. We will dig and drill.\n  But if that is our energy strategy, we really have not moved the ball \nforward at all. So the question is, what more can we do? The President \nsuggested in his State of the Union Address that we ought to chart a \ndifferent course.\n  I introduced legislation prior to the President's State of the Union \nAddress saying let's move to a different kind of technology, a \ndifferent kind of energy economy; let's move to a hydrogen economy \nusing fuel cells.\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\n  First of all, using fuel cells and hydrogen is twice as efficient in \ngetting power to a wheel as using the internal combustion engine. \nSecond, when we use hydrogen fuel cells in automobiles or vehicles, we \nare sending water vapor out the tailpipe. What a wonderful thing for \nour economy. We double the efficiency of the energy source, and then we \neliminate the pollution out the tailpipe. We double the efficiency \nusing hydrogen, which is a ubiquitous source of energy--it is \neverywhere--and then we decrease air pollution by putting water vapor \nout the tailpipe of a vehicle. That makes great sense to me.\n  I introduced legislation. It is called the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Act of \n2003. I compliment President Bush for proposing in his State of the \nUnion Address that we move in this direction. I have said it is not \nsmall or insignificant for a Republican President to say let's do this. \nIt was a rather small thing in terms of his proposal to fund it. It was \nnot a bold approach. It was a rather timid approach. But that should \nnot detract from the fact that this administration put itself on the \nline to say: Let's move in this direction.\n  The President proposed $1.2 billion in 5 years. Only slightly more \nthan half was new money. It appeared to me some of it came at the \nexpense of other important areas of conservation and renewable energy.\n  Having said all that, in the Energy Committee we came very close to \ntripling that amount of money. We bring to the floor of the Senate \nlegislation that substantially improves the initiative dealing with \nhydrogen fuel cells. I think that is a significant step forward, one \nthat I appreciate.\n  What is missing is, in addition to the legislation I introduced, \nwhich actually calls for $6.5 billion in 10 years--so more money--and \nalso pilot projects, Federal purchase programs, tax credits, and so \non--what is missing is targets and timetables. If we are going to do \nthis program, let's set out targets and timetables. I am not suggesting \nthey can be ironclad. They cannot.\n  If we are going to make this a big proposal, a bold proposal in the \nspirit of an Apollo project saying let's do this, let's make a \ndifference, let's do this, let's decide that 25 years from now we will \nnot have a debate about how much gasoline we are running through the \ncarburetors of America's vehicles because we found a way to take \nhydrogen from water, use it as an energy supply, and through fuel cells \nuse it to power America's vehicle fleet, we can do that.\n  Many of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, on the Energy \nCommittee have been supportive of this proposal. There is nothing \npartisan about this at all. As I said, it was in President Bush's State \nof the Union Address. It comes in legislation I have introduced. It \ncomes in initiatives my colleagues have talked about and introduced as \nwell. The question is, How do we make progress by establishing some big \nand bold goals?\n  This legislation I have introduced, taking one piece of the Hydrogen \nFuel Cell Act of 2003, tries to establish some way points. When I \nlearned to fly airplanes many years ago, they taught me, with modern \ninstrumentation, that I can create way points for my airplane. When you \nget up in the air, you program into the computers on the plane the way \npoints to which you want to fly. It is a fictitious point 300 or 400 \nmiles away, but once you establish that way point with your \ninstruments, you fly to the way point. When you reach that way point, \nthen you take a new course to the next way point.\n\n  My point is, we need way points--targets, and timetables--to transfer \nto some new hydrogen fuel cell economy. If we do not, we will not get \nthere. If we do not, as President Kennedy said, put a man on the Moon \nby the end of the decade, if we do not today make the equivalent of \nthat commitment in deciding how and where we are going to head with \nthis hydrogen fuel cell economy, we are not going to get there. We just \nwill not.\n  Let me show some examples of what is happening in hydrogen fuel \ncells. General Motors Hy-wire fuel cell concept car unveiled in August \n2002. Some say there are no such things as fuel cells. Of course there \nare. I have driven a fuel cell car that drove from California to the \neast coast, across this country.\n  Are they commercially available now? No, they are not. Are they \nhorribly expensive? Yes. But we are in the design stage and the \nresearch and development stage to make hydrogen fuel cell vehicles \naffordable.\n  This is the Nissan Xterra fueled by compressed hydrogen tested on \nCalifornia public roads in 2001.\n  This is the Ford Focus fuel cell vehicle. Production is ready for \nprototype, autumn 2002.\n  This is a hydrogen fueling station by Powertech Labs.\n  This is a picture of a DaimlerChrysler fuel cell bus introduced in \nGermany in 1997. I have actually ridden in a fuel cell bus running on \nthe streets of this country.\n  The point is, we can do this. Is this easy to do? No, it is not, not \nat all. What do you have to do to convert to a hydrogen fuel cell \neconomy for our vehicle fleet? Notice, I am not talking about \nstationary power centers. That also exists as the capability with \nrespect to hydrogen and fuel cells, stationary engines, and so on.\n  I am talking about the vehicle fleet because a substantial increase \nin the demand for oil comes from our vehicles. I do not have a chart to \nshow that. It is quite clear that unless we do something, especially \nabout our vehicle fleet, we will, 25, 50, and 100 years from now, still \nbe debating on the floor of the Senate how much additional gasoline we \nrun through America's carburetors.\n  What do you have to do to switch? A bold plan means we are going to \nchange our entire infrastructure. We have production. How are we going \nto produce hydrogen? There are a lot of ways to produce hydrogen. We \ncan use electrolysis to separate oxygen and hydrogen in water and store \nthe hydrogen and use it in fuel cells.\n  Let me give another example. We can put up a wind charger, the new \nhighly efficient wind turbine, a 1-megawatt wind turbine, and take the \nenergy from the air. We can use that energy for electrolysis to \nseparate the oxygen and hydrogen in water and store the hydrogen for \nuse in fuel cells.\n  There are so many ways and different approaches to use hydrogen. We \nhave production issues: How do we produce hydrogen? From what source? \nBut it is ubiquitous; it is all over. That is not an insurmountable \nproblem. How do you produce hydrogen? How do you transport it? How do \nyou store it? How do you make it available at the infrastructure, at \nservice stations across the country for a vehicle fleet?\n\n  Those are issues we ought to be dealing with and will deal with and \nthe administration will deal with at the Department of Energy.\n  What I say very simply in this amendment--and it has taken me a long \ntime to get to the point, but I wanted to make a presentation on why I \nthink this is very important for our country--I say let's establish, as \nPresident Kennedy did, a goal. Let's have 100,000 hydrogen fuel cell \nvehicles on our roads by 2010, 7 years from now. Let's have 2.5 million \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicles on our roads by 2020. Let's set some goals. \nLet's set some way points and say: Here is what we strive to do; here \nis what we aspire to do as a country.\n  If we do not set goals, I guarantee we will never reach the potential \nthat exists for us to convert our vehicle fleet to hydrogen fuel cell \nfleets and to relieve ourselves of the danger that exists having so \nmuch of our energy coming from outside our borders.\n  If we wake up tomorrow morning, God forbid, and terrorists have \ninterrupted the supply of oil to this country--and, yes, that could \nhappen--this country's economy will be flat on its back. It will be \nflat on its back because we rely, to the tune of 55 percent, on oil \nfrom sources outside this country and much of it from very troubled \nparts of the world. That is going to go to 68 percent, and we ought not \nlet it.\n  If in this Chamber we spend weeks and wrestle and debate energy \npolicy and come out with an energy policy that says what we need to do \nis just produce more and somehow we will end up just fine, we have done \nnothing for America's future.\n  We have done nothing for America's future. An Energy bill that makes \nsense to me has four parts. One is, yes, let's produce more. Let's \nincent more production of fossil fuels, absolutely. I do not support, \nfor example, drilling of the ANWR region, one of our most pristine and \ndelicate areas. I do not think\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\nwe need to do that. But let's produce more. There are thoughtful ways \nto produce more. I happen to believe we ought to be able to produce \nmuch more in the Gulf of Mexico in an environmentally sensitive way. \nLet's conserve more. We waste a huge amount of energy. Production and \nconservation, that is two parts.\n  The third is efficiency. Everything we use almost every day, in every \nway, with all of our appliances could, should, and will be more \nefficient if we pay attention to and provide incentives for \nefficiencies.\n  Finally, and importantly, is the area of a renewable and limitless \nsource of energy, and that includes ethanol, biodiesel, and many \nothers, but most importantly it includes this proposal: Hydrogen and \nfuel cells can be our future. It can make this country more secure. It \ncan remove from this country's neck the yoke of having over half of its \noil coming from troubled parts of the world. In a very substantial way \nit can do what President Kennedy did in establishing new goals in space \ntravel for our country. It can inspire our country to be able to \ncontrol our own destiny with respect to energy.\n  I close as I began by saying that President Bush was absolutely \ncorrect in the State of the Union Address, and it is not a small thing \nfor this President to say let's move in this direction. I am putting my \nadministration in support of this direction, this movement. That is not \na small thing. It is a big deal.\n  I have said his proposal is more timid than I thought it should be. I \ndo not mean substantial criticism by that. What I mean by that is I \nthink to do this it has to be big and bold. Especially it has to set \ntimetables and targets.\n  The Senate committee has nearly tripled the amount of money the \nPresident has proposed. That is a significant start, in my judgment. We \ncould even do more in the authorization bill with the type that I have \nsuggested. This amendment I have offered today is not that \nauthorization bill. It is simple. It says while we have made \nsignificant strides in the Energy Committee on this subject, and now \nthat we have a Republican President, many Democrats and Republicans in \nCongress believe we ought to move in this direction, so let us be bold \nenough to set some timetables and targets.\n  As I indicated, the Senate has already passed this legislation last \nyear, and I hope the Senate would embrace it once again and pass these \ntargets and timetables.\n  One final point: These targets and timetables simply say the \nDepartment of Energy shall report to us on how they establish the \nstrategies to reach these targets. We cannot impose our will in the \nsense that we cannot tell an Energy Department they must reach these \ntargets. We do not have the capability of doing that. The technology \ndoes not exist to get from here to there. But we can ask the Department \nof Energy to provide for us the strategies by which they could meet \nthese targets, and that is what our amendment asks. My hope is this \nwill be unanimously supported by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I begin by complimenting the Senator \nfrom South Dakota on the work he has done on fuel cell hydrogen over \nthe years, and also compliment others on the other side of the aisle--I \nsee the ranking member of the committee, Senator Bingaman from New \nMexico. For at least a dozen years, this Congress, and particularly \nthis Senate, has been interested in the hydrogen fuel cell technology. \nThe Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from New Mexico are the \nones who have pushed that the hardest.\n  What we have now is some consensus, at least in our committee, and I \nhope in the Senate at large, on the importance of this bold proposal. I \nwill take a moment to put in perspective what the committee has done.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I intended to complete my comments by complimenting \nSenator Alexander and others on the committee who have taken a position \nI think provides some leadership in this area. I did not mention those \nin the committee who, when we marked up these issues, played a \nsignificant role in the hydrogen title. I intended to do that at the \nend of my remarks. So I thank the Senator for allowing me to do that.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator for his comments, but the bottom \nline is the process by which this committee worked on the hydrogen fuel \ncell proposal, which is title 8 of the Energy bill, which was a good \nprocess for those who would like to see how two parties in an evenly \ndivided Senate can take an issue and come to some consensus and narrow \nthe differences. It was a pretty good process. What is remaining are \nthe two issues of which the Senator from North Dakota spoke.\n  One is more money and two is more mandates, which he now has \nsuggested are targets, if I understand correctly, rather than mandates. \nAm I correct in that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield further?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is nothing in here that would be a mandate. These \nare establishment of targets by asking the Department of Energy to \nprovide Congress with their strategies on how to reach them. I have \nspecifically not imposed mandates. I am simply asking them to develop \nstrategies and to report those strategies to the Congress.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. So that narrows the differences \nconsiderably.\n  Having acknowledged the good work done on the other side, I will also \nacknowledge the good work the President did. Only a President of \nwhatever party can put something on the agenda the way a President can, \nand so it was exciting to all of us who cared about this issue and \nabout the goals, which are to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and \nto clean the air, which is what this does, to see President Bush, in \nhis State of the Union Address, make a bold proposal to direct the \nSecretary of Energy to explore the possibility of a hydrogen economy \nand to develop the next generation of technology that would include \nhydrogen.\n  What we are really talking about, as the Senator from North Dakota \nexplained, is a completely new way of thinking and living our lives. I \nnoticed the other day in our local newspaper in Tennessee there was a \npicture of a filling station in Iceland that opened. Iceland has a \nhydrogen filling station. The buses that operate in Iceland back up to \nthat hydrogen filling station and instead of putting gasoline in their \ntanks, they put in hydrogen. They drive around on the hydrogen, and \ninstead of emitting some carbon-based pollutant into the air, they emit \nonly water, which is the product of that process.\n\n  It takes a little while for someone who has not thought about this \nmuch, as I was at one time, to get one's mind around this, but we are \nbasically taking the internal combustion engine and putting it to the \nside and putting in a new process that reduces electricity, runs the \ncar and, as the Senator said, the only emission is water. So there is \nan enormous advantage on two matters that concern us greatly: One is \nreduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil, and we are in the middle \nof a process right now where we have been reminded about what a \nchallenge that is to our national security. Some estimates are that by \nthe year 2035 or 2040 we would have 11 million barrels per day less of \nreliance on our need for oil if we had a hydrogen economy. No one can \nknow for certain what those numbers are, but all of us know it is a big \nchange and a big number.\n  Of course, the second aspect is clean air. This week, and for the \nnext few weeks, we will be talking about ways to clean the air. The \nmost interesting, and difficult sometimes, arguments we have that come \nbefore our committee and the country are those that intersect with \nenergy and the environment. Here is a nice intersection between energy \nand the environment because if we are emitting only water, then the \nparts of our economy, and especially the transportation parts that use \nhydrogen-based cars instead of the internal combustion engine, will \nmake a remarkable difference in not just our clean air but our standard \nof living because our lack of clean air and our difficulty with finding \nways to clean the air is a limit on our ability to grow our economy. So \nthis is a very important topic and all of us recognize it as such.\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\n  Now let me start with the President's proposal, to put this in \nperspective, including the Senator's amendment. The President's \nproposal authorizes the Department of Energy, including our National \nLaboratories, to spend about $1.3 billion over the next 5 years in \nresearch and development in the following areas: research on hydrogen-\npowered engines, and research on the production of hydrogen.\n\n  We have to make the stuff. It can come from many places. It can come \nfrom fossil fuels. It can come from renewable resources, a major part \nof the discussion in the Energy bill last week. It can come from \nnuclear energy, which is a major part of the discussion in the Energy \nbill this week. At a nuclear power plant one might be able to produce \nsome of the hydrogen that would clean the air. And it can come from \nnatural gas, which is the easiest way, arguably, to get it today. But \nwith the recent spikes in the price of natural gas, we can see the \ndifficulty relying on one form of energy too greatly.\n  The President's proposal would fund additional research on \ntransportation and delivery of hydrogen via pipelines and fueling \nstations. Iceland has a hydrogen fueling station. We do not have any in \nthe United States. We have a few hundred miles of hydrogen pipeline. \nImagine a different America where, instead of backing your car or truck \nup every block--sometimes more often than one block--to a station where \nyou get gasoline, you back it up or drive into a place where you fill \nup with hydrogen. That is a big change in our infrastructure. This \nresearch would help figure out how better to do that.\n  Also, we need additional fuel cell research. The Senator mentioned \nsome of the obstacles that exist to this wonderful vision. One of the \ndifficulties is we need to find new ways to produce hydrogen, which I \nmentioned. Another is we need to find a little cheaper way of building \na hydrogen car. The Senator and I drove the same one, I believe a Ford, \naround the block. I believe that car costs a couple million per unit to \nmake right now. In other words, the early models are extremely \nexpensive.\n  We need to find safe ways to store hydrogen. We need to meet the \nchallenge of this infrastructure.\n  We have great obstacles to overcome. But in this United States of \nAmerica, if anything defines our national ethic, it is that anything is \npossible. We are ready to leap ahead and go after this. The President \nrecommended we put $1.3 billion behind it, and that was step 1 in this \nsession. Then the committee sat down and began to recognize the \nsuggestions made by those who had gone before. Instead of the $1.3 \nbillion recommendation the President made, we took those \nrecommendations, reduced some of them to what we thought were a \nmanageable number, and still more than doubled the amount of money we \nrecommend to the full Senate that we authorize--nearly $3 billion \ntotal. As the Senator from North Dakota said, nearly triple the amount \nof money. So in addition to the President's $1.3 billion proposal, we \nhave about $1.6 billion more for other ideas brought into the bill by \npeople other than the President, from the Senate and the other side.\n  We have a hydrogen vehicle demonstration program for the Government \nand nonprofit agencies; a stationery fuel cell demonstration program \nfor use in residential and commercial buildings; a hydrogen car and \nfuel cell demonstration program in three national parks. That is a \nterrific idea. I would like to see one in the Great Smoky Mountains, \nour most polluted national park today. Many people think of Yellowstone \nas receiving the most visitors; but only 3 million people visit \nYellowstone while 10 million go to the Great Smoky Mountains. The Great \nSmokies is polluted, particularly because of the cars and coal plants.\n  An idea for which I commend the Senator is providing for the \nestablishment of a university education degree curriculum designed to \nhelp our workforce move into a hydrogen economy, with centers of \nexcellence in our great research universities to help realize this \nshared vision. In the United States, we have the world's only great \nresearch universities. They are our secret weapon. We need to fund them \nand the research and technology better. That is a sure way to move \ntoward this goal.\n  This bill before the Senate today is a combination of ideas from both \nparties, from the President and from the Legislature. The amounts we \nincluded, taking ideas from the other side to the bill, actually cost \nmore than the proposal from the President--nearly $3 billion.\n  That brings us to the point of the amendment. Is it enough money? Do \nwe need targets? I will respond to that in this way. The President \nmentioned the Apollo. That is vivid in our minds. I remember as \nEducation Secretary I tried to think, using that Apollo objective, \nwhich sticks in our minds to say, can we have in 10 or 20 years the \nbest schools in the world? Nothing is quite like that Apollo mission. \nIt is always hard to make an analogy, but the President has the same \ndream that we have here. The dream is that we have an America less \ndependent on foreign oil, an America that has cleaner air, something \nthat increases our national security and our health and well-being.\n  However, there are other parts to that dream than just the hydrogen \ncar. There is, if we are talking about energy, the need to revive our \nnuclear energy. Japan was decimated by an atomic bomb, and they are \nrelying primarily on nuclear energy. And France is relying primarily on \nnuclear energy. It has been since the 1970s that we started a new \nnuclear power reactor in this country. So this bill, in addition to \nhydrogen, is to help stimulate our nuclear energy.\n  We need not just stimulate nuclear and hydrogen; we need to find a \nway to burn coal in a cleaner way. We make half our electricity from \ncoal, but it pollutes the air more than we can tolerate. So we need \ncoal gasification, as an example. This bill encourages that. The \nSenator from North Dakota mentioned wind turbines in North Dakota. They \nare part of the dream as well. Natural gas is part of the dream. Its \nprice went up, so we need to explore more and we need pipelines to get \nthat gas to the places it needs to go. This bill encourages that. We \nneed more new oil that is not dependent on some other country. We have \ntried--although we do not always agree in this body on where to drill--\nto do that.\n  So the dream of clean air and less dependence on foreign oil has many \nparts, including the hydrogen vision the President outlined in his \naddress, so that a child born today can have a choice in this \ngeneration of driving a car fueled by a fuel cell hydrogen engine.\n  The Apollo dream is not exactly the same. We have a dream, but this \nis only a part of the dream.\n  As far as the amount of money is concerned, I suppose one could \nalways argue about the amount of money. We considered that very \ncarefully in the committee. We nearly tripled the amount of money the \nPresident requested. We took into account virtually all of the \nsuggestions by the Senator and others on the other side, which is why \nthis bill came to the floor from the committee, because we had such a \nconsensus. For a new technology which, while bold, is still unproven, \nwe believe this is a generous amount of support in a bill that is \nbalanced across a broad number of sources of new and improved energy.\n  That brings me to the targets and the timetables. I appreciate the \nSenator moving from mandates to targets and timetables. That is a step \nforward. However, I prefer we not make, if I may say with respect, wild \nguesses about how this unproven technology might work, but that we join \nas we have in this bill to find a variety of ways to stimulate and not \nfool ourselves into thinking we are going to get to this point or that \npoint in any particular year.\n  President Kennedy said let's go to the Moon, and he said by when he \nhoped to go, but he didn't say fly this kind of airplane, or use this \nkind of rocket, or get a third of the way there by 1963. He said, Let \nus go there.\n  So let us go toward a day when we have cleaner air and when we have \nless dependence on foreign oil because of a variety of steps, one of \nthe most impressive of which is the vision of a hydrogen fuel cell car. \nBut let us not try to make a wild guess just about when that will come, \nin what year. I believe one of the greatest underutilized powers of \nthis body is the oversight power. Really, the Senate, the Congress, has \ntwo great functions: One is to spend\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\nmoney, and one is to oversee how that money is spent. There is nothing \nto keep us from that. In fact, as chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, \nI would want to make it part of my responsibility to regularly ask the \nSecretary of Energy to come forward with his plan, about what progress \nhe is making, and suggest to him faster progress, and to ask him what \ntimetables seem reasonable.\n  There is another aspect to this, too. The Government is not going to \ninvent the hydrogen car. No one has suggested the Government will. We \nare just providing some free commercial researching. But we should \nleave it to the market to make the greatest progress in determining \nwhat timetables will work, what targets make sense, what research will \nfinally work, and what the customers will buy.\n  I had an opportunity within the last couple of weeks to talk with the \nchief executive of Nissan, Mr. Ghosn, who has had a remarkable record. \nIn 1999, Nissan had a $19 billion debt and was headed down. Today, it \nhas no debt. It is headed up. I asked him about the hydrogen car \nbecause some of my scientist friends had been throwing a little cold \nwater on the idea, saying some of us in the Senate were coming up with \na pipedream that might never work. Here is what the head of Nissan \nsaid, and he said this publicly: Nissan is spending $800 million in the \nnext 7 years on research just on fuel cell hydrogen cars. He wants to \nbe, and has publicly stated that Nissan intends to be, not just a \nleader but the leader in that area. In other words, they are putting \nmoney there, real dollars. They are making that kind of investment of \nprestige and dollars.\n  Toyota and Honda, industry sources tell me, are spending at least \nthat much of their own money. And the General Motors president has said \nto me he takes this seriously as well.\n  So the President's focus on the hydrogen car has done one good thing. \nIt has taken the work that has been done in this body in the last 10 or \n12 years on hydrogen and put it in this bill in the form of $1.6 \nbillion. It has taken the President's own proposals of research--that \nis another $1.3 billion. But the real value is the President's \nproposal, and our agreement on this, if we do agree, will put this up \nfront, create a national commitment, the kind of commitment we had when \nwe went to the Moon. That is right. It is that kind of national \ncommitment. But let us realize that when we went to the Moon, we went \nin reasonable steps and this plan for cleaner air and for less \ndependence on foreign oil has many parts, including other forms of \nenergies, and the timetables and the targets are best left to the \nmarketplace.\n  So I rise to say this represents great progress by the committee. I \ncommend, again, the Senator for his leadership. I urge that we not \nsupport an amendment creating wild guesses and artificial targets and \ntimetables, but move forward and let the marketplace help us make \nsensible judgments about that, using our oversight role as Senators to \nmake sure the program stays on course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly in favor of the \namendment by the Senator from North Dakota and give the reasons I \nbelieve this is a meritorious amendment that would strengthen the bill.\n  First, I think everyone needs to understand the amendment is an \namendment that just sets targets. It really says that the plan--this is \nthe plan the administration is going to come up with to spend this $1.3 \nbillion, I believe it is--\n\n     shall describe the activities of the Department of Energy, \n     including a research, development, demonstration, and \n     commercial application program for developing technologies to \n     support--\n\nand then it goes on to set these targets to support:\n\n     the production and deployment of . . . 100,000 hydrogen-\n     fueled fuel cell vehicles by 2010; and . . . 2.5 million \n     hydrogen-fueled fuel cell vehicles by 2020 . . .\n\n  As I say, this is an amendment that sets some targets. They are not \nmandates; they are targets. I think they add greatly to the bill. \nUnfortunately, the Senator from Tennessee, as chair of the Energy \nSubcommittee in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, does have \nthe primary responsibility for the oversight of a lot of this activity. \nI would see this amendment, frankly, by the Senator from North Dakota \nas a way to give him more ability to perform that oversight.\n  Frankly, the only oversight target in the bill right now is you could \ncall in the various officials from the Department of Energy and ask \nthem whether in fact they are spending the money we have authorized to \nbe spent. That is not a very effective kind of oversight. I am sure \nthey would tell us they are spending the money.\n  The real question is, Are they achieving something with the \nexpenditure of those funds? I believe this amendment tries to put in \nplace some targets for what we would like to see them achieve. Clearly \nthose are not hard-and-fast targets and they will change over time, but \nthey do give us some benchmarks against which we can measure progress. \nI think that is very useful.\n  The Senator from Tennessee made the point that, in his view, his \npreference would be to leave it to the market as to how quickly these \ntechnologies develop. Clearly the private sector is going to determine \nto a very great extent how quickly these technologies become \ncommercialized and how well they develop. But this legislation is \nauthorizing the expenditure of Federal funds. It is entirely \nappropriate that we specify what we want to see as results coming out \nof the expenditure of those funds. To me it is not incumbent upon us to \nleave that kind of decision to the market. The market will have a major \nrole, major voice, major determination as to what actually comes to \nmarket and what actually is commercialized and how quickly. But in the \nexpenditure of taxpayer dollars it is our job to set out there what we \nwould like to see achieved. If we determine after a few years that \nthose targets are not realistic, we can always change them. Congress is \nin session every year. But this gives us something to shoot at. I think \nit is a major step in the right direction.\n  The Department, under the legislation we are considering, would \ninvest $171 million in the current fiscal year, $272 million next \nfiscal year, $1.7 billion over the next 5 years--I said earlier $1.3 \nbillion. I gather it is $1.7 billion. In my view, it is entirely \nappropriate that we look at trying to achieve some particular targets \nso we can then go back to our constituents and say this is what this \nmoney is going for and this is how we are making progress.\n  I do want to say, just before I yield the floor here, that this has \nbeen a very good, bipartisan effort. The Senator from North Dakota has \nbeen a long-time leader in trying to get more attention to the use of \nhydrogen in meeting our future energy needs. The Senator from Tennessee \nis certainly a strong proponent of this and has demonstrated that in \nour debates this year.\n  I know there are others on our committee who have taken a very major \nrole: Senator Akaka, as well, of course, and others before him. So I \nthink this is a very good part of the bill. I think this amendment by \nSenator Dorgan will strengthen it even more.\n  I hope very much we can see it adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, because the Senate in the last Congress \npassed an Energy bill which included targets and timetables, I think it \nwould be considered a retreat if for some reason or another we this \nyear objected to targets and timetables that were included in this \nEnergy bill. In the past Congress, with the President supporting fuel \ncells and a hydrogen economy, I don't think we ought to be retreating \non these kinds of issues.\n  The Senator from Tennessee said there are two parts. There are many \nparts of the bill. He is right about that. There is the part of the \nlegislation that deals with that which we have always done. We have \nalways been concerned about production of fossil fuels. So we have, of \ncourse, portions of the bill to deal with that. We have conservation \nissues and renewable energy issues. Those have always been in the bill.\n  But this piece is a different part--a part that is different and \nunusual. This part deals with something that is new, big and bold. It \nis why the President\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\nput it in his State of the Union Address. That is why he had a special \nrollout of his proposal down at the Building Museum with hundreds of \npeople present. Virtually every industry leader with respect to \nhydrogen and fuel cells in the country came to town. Why did the \nPresident emphasize that? Because this is a different part. This is not \nsome unusual part of the energy debate. It is the big, new, and bold \npart of that debate.\n  I have used the term ``Apollo project.'' That perhaps could have used \nor I could have used ``the Manhattan project,'' or something that would \ndenote a project by which a country aspires to achieve something. A \ncountry aspires to establish goals, and it reaches those goals. A \nstrategy that says, let us spend this money and, by the way, let us \nknow if anything comes of it, is, in my judgment, not much of a \nstrategy.\n  I am a big believer in understanding that things happen that you make \nhappen--not that you let happen. If you have a problem and resources, \nyou have two choices: Let us move this money out and see what we let \nhappen with it, as opposed to deciding what we are going to make \nhappen. There is a very big difference.\n  My colleague from Tennessee used the term ``wild guesses'' several \ntimes. Let me just tell you that Nissan, Toyota, Honda, \nDaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors are not engaged in wild \nguesses. None of them is engaged in wild guesses. They are making \nsubstantial investments in fuel cell vehicles believing that we are \nmoving toward a hydrogen fuel cell economy--not wild guesses at all.\n  Incidentally, I think my colleagues would, if they checked with most \nof these organizations I have mentioned and others in the industry, \nfind that they very much support us being bold and establishing these \ntargets and timetables. Why? Because they know that a country that \nestablishes targets and timetables in pursuit of a policy is a country \nthat is going to be fostering new development through research, and \nopportunities through research in the private sector as well. I just \nthink it is really important for us to do this.\n  All of us come from different kinds of hometowns. I come from a small \none with about 300 people. I am guessing, probably like every hometown, \nwe had two or three people who every day went down to the bar and \nplayed Pinochle all day long. That was their social life. They just \nstayed there all day long and played Pinochle. They most likely in \ntheir conversations opposed almost everything new that was going on in \nthe community: ``It won't work, can't work; shouldn't do it.'' They \njust played Pinochle and criticized anyone who was making things happen \nin the community.\n\n  The President has said we ought to do this. There are going to be \ndoubters outside of this Chamber and doubters in the country who don't \nwant us to move in this direction who say it can't work, it won't \nhappen, or this is not our future. But they are wrong. President Bush \nis right. They are wrong.\n  This country will best serve its future, in my judgment, if we decide \nthat we are going to do this with the President and with the Congress; \nwe are going to do this and make it happen. Should we just say, well, \nexcept that there are other alternatives and no such picking and \nchoosing?\n  If President Kennedy had said, let us not pick a goal to go to the \nMoon, maybe it ought to be Mars, but if we decided the Moon, let us not \ndecide it had to be in this decade because the technology doesn't \nexist, let us say we are going to one planet and the Moon maybe \nsomeday, we probably would have never gotten past Cape Canaveral. We \nprobably would have never gotten off the launch pad.\n  He established for this country a very bold vision. The Manhattan \nproject was a very different project. It was the same thing: We are \ngoing to do this. We are going to marshal all of the resources and try \nto make this happen.\n  My amendment is much more timid than that. I do not suggest we can \nstrap a mandate on this country and a burden on the Department of \nEnergy, or the private sector for that matter, that says we have to \nmeet these goals, timetables, and targets. That is not what I am \nsaying. I am saying, in the pursuit of this money, that we are going to \nspend several billions of dollars, let us ask the Energy Department in \ntheir plan to describe their activities in pursuit of this goal which \nsays we aspire to have 100,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the \nUnited States by 2001 and 2.5 million by 2010. Maybe it can't be \nreached; I don't know. It is certainly not a wild guess; it is just \ndeciding that we ought to as a country establish some goals.\n  Once again, I think there is a big difference between letting things \nhappen and making things happen. We have the capability, it seems to \nme, with this President and this Congress--and with the private sector \nvery engaged with an aggressive aim, which my colleague from Tennessee \ndescribed a while ago--to do some really remarkable things in this \narea. I think they will be enhanced by establishing these targets and \ntimetables.\n  I really see no downside at all. I sometimes can see in legislation \nor amendments that are introduced that there is an upside and a \ndownside. What if it succeeds or fails? For the life of me, I cannot \nsee the downside of Congress establishing in this legislation some \ntargets and timetables that put us on a path to a new, bold, and \naggressive energy policy that will do all of the things my colleague \nfrom Tennessee described and all the things I described which are good \nfor this country--substantially limiting our dependence on foreign oil, \nwhich provides much greater economic and energy security for this \ncountry, and dramatically improving air quality in America. Instead of \nputting pollutants out of the tailpipe, you are putting water vapor out \nof the tailpipe.\n\n  There are so many things that make sense with respect to this \nproposal. Much of the proposal that is in the Energy bill makes great \nsense. I support it. I wish it were a bit bolder than it is. \nNonetheless, it is substantially better than what was sent to us in the \nPresident's budget. I compliment my colleague from Tennessee and my \ncolleague from New Mexico and others on that score. But I still believe \nwe will do this country a favor and improve this legislation as it \nleaves the Senate by including timetables and targets which were in the \nlegislation in the last Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota and I \nagree on so much about this subject that I am not going to extend this \ndiscussion very much further for fear of dredging up something that we \nmight disagree on because we don't have many differences here.\n  If I may briefly comment, I was listening to the Senator's discussion \nof that bar in North Dakota. When I was growing up in the mountains of \nTennessee, Blount County was a dry county, we didn't have bars, but we \nhad Byrne Drugstore, which is where all that same kind of discussion \nmust have occurred.\n  I was just thinking. Talking about the suggested timetables, the \nSenator suggested that, for example, we have in here a timetable of \n100,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the United States by 2010. I was \nwondering what they would say in Byrne Drugstore if I went back to it \nand said I just became a Senator, and I drove a new hydrogen fuel cell \ncar around the block which emits water out the tailpipe and doesn't \nburn any gasoline. The car costs $2 million a car to make. I got so \nexcited about it I went over to the Senate and I voted to say we ought \nto have 100,000 of those in the United States by 2010 and 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion of them by 2020.\n\n  I think they would say to me: Well, Lamar, I think you got carried \naway a little bit. At 2 million times 100,000, how do you know what the \ncost of that car is going to be in 2010? I might say: Well, I may not \nhave really meant that. We meet every year, and we can change that next \nyear if we want to.\n  They might say to me: Why did you put it in there in the first place \nif you didn't know that much about what you were talking about? The \nidea sounds exciting, but why would you guess how you would take a $2 \nmillion car and make sure it made any sense at all to target that we \nhave 100,000 of them in the United States by 2010? What ability does \nthe U.S. Government have to wave a magic wand and make sure that \nhappens?\n  I was then thinking, too, about all the automobile companies both the\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\nSenator and I talked about. Now, they are hot on this. I mentioned Mr. \nGhosn at Nissan. He wanted to make sure I knew he intended not just to \nbe a player in the fuel cell hydrogen car, he intends to be ``the'' \nplayer, and he is going to spend $800 million of his company's dollars \non research in this far out idea that probably will not be commercially \nviable--none of us believe--for 15, 20, or 25 years.\n  That is a big step. But I really doubt Mr. Ghosn went to his board or \nthe chairman of General Motors went to his board or the chairman of \nFord went to his board and said: I want you to authorize that we \nrequire that our company make a certain number of these cars by a \ncertain year. I think they would say: You are not being entirely \nrealistic. You have gotten a little carried away.\n  So I want to show great respect for the Senator's goals, his hard \nwork, and his energy. We agree on 95 percent of this. But I think to \nadopt those kinds of targets and timetables--to use a gentler word--\nmight be misleading at the very least because I don't think that is the \nway to go about it.\n  Let's encourage it in any way we can--and we tried to do that here--\nand then let's have oversight on a regular basis. Then, if the \ntechnology is proven enough that it makes sense for us to be a little \nmore specific, well, maybe we can take it up then. But if I went into \nthe Byrne Drugstore in Blount County, and said, ``I have just driven a \n$2 million car around the block and then went over and voted we ought \nto have 100,000 of them by a particular year,'' I think they would \nthink I had gotten a little carried away with my good idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I shall not carry this much further either \nbecause there is much we agree on. But let me just say to the folks at \nthe Byrne Drugstore, a drugstore I have not had the pleasure of \nvisiting, my guess is, at Byrne Drugstore, if you told the folks \nsitting around the cracker barrel there--if they have a cracker \nbarrel--in talking about life that we are going to give $2 billion plus \nto the Department of Energy, and we would just like them to use it as \nbest they can, we really have not told them what we aspire to have \nhappen in terms of goals or timetables and, what do you think of that, \nmy guess is they would say: They are going to send their great-\ngrandchildren back to you to say, ``We have not reached any conclusions \nyet.''\n  My guess is, the folks at Byrne Drug, just as the folks playing \npinochle in my hometown's little bar, would probably say: If you are \ngoing to give the folks over there in that big bureaucracy some money, \nyou might ought to give them a plan in terms of what you might want to \naccomplish with that money because they will find a way to spend it if \nyou don't give them some sort of plan. They will tell you the money is \nall gone, but they really don't have a product yet.\n  There are plenty of examples, of course, of that. But my own view is, \nif we are going to give the Department of Energy money--and we must \nbecause, as the Senator from Tennessee knows, we cannot convert to a \nhydrogen-based fuel cell economy without public policy support. You \nhave to, after all, have a complete infrastructure change in this \ncountry, so that in the future, if we are driving mostly hydrogen fuel \ncell cars, you are not pulling up to a pump that pumps regular \ngasoline, you are pulling up to a pump that pumps hydrogen fuel.\n  The question is, as I indicated before, where do we produce the \nhydrogen? How do we transport the hydrogen? How do we store the \nhydrogen? What is the infrastructure for dispensing the hydrogen at \nfuel stations across the country? All of that is important. And all of \nthat is a function of public policy. The private sector cannot by \nitself do that. That is why the public sector lays the groundwork for \nit. It is like building the roads. We don't have General Motors \nbuilding roads in this country. We build roads, and they build cars \nwhich you drive on the roads.\n  We create the public policy by which we will move toward a hydrogen \nfuel cell policy. It is what the President believes we ought to do. It \nis what I believe we ought to do. The Senator from Tennessee and the \nSenator from New Mexico believe we ought to do that. So as we do that, \nthe question is: In pursuit of public policy, when we provide the \nDepartment of Energy with $3 billion plus, should we say to them: \n``Here is $3 billion plus. You folks--you good men and women at the \nDepartment of Energy--use it as best you can, and try to give us some \nidea of what you might accomplish with it'' or should we say to these \npeople in the large, vast bureaucracy here: ``Here is $3 billion plus, \nand what we want you to do is the following. Our goal, our aspiration, \nwhat we strive to achieve for the country is the following''? I think \nthat is a much better approach because, I guarantee you, we will \nprovide that $3.3 billion, and at the end that money will be spent.\n  I have not ever, I guess, seen a Federal agency that has failed to \nspend the money. They do pretty well at that. But when they spend the \nmoney, and it is gone, the question is, Will this country have moved \nbeyond where we are today in energy policy? Will we have achieved the \nresult we wanted? Will the President have advanced the issues he \nportrayed so well in his State of the Union Address? I guess my answer \nto that is, I do not think so.\n\n  I come back finally to this point--and I will have to leave the floor \nbut make this my last word--I fail to see any downside at all to \nputting in these targets. Again, this is not some wild guess.\n  I go back to the Nissan example. The chairman of Nissan does not go \nto the board of directors aspiring to spend $800 million, and say, ``By \nthe way, I have a wild guess, and I want you to authorize my spending \n$800 million on it.''\n  This is not a wild guess. The private sector does not believe it is. \nI do not believe it is. President Bush does not. I think most of us \nunderstand this is a new, big, bold direction. We can do this the old \nway, giving the bureaucracy some money and hoping it turns out or we \ncan do this a different way, saying: Here is what we aspire to achieve \nas a country. Here are the targets. Here are the timetables. Let's get \nabout the business of doing this.\n  If we, in fact, want our children and their children to be able to \ndrive hydrogen fuel cell cars, then that is not going to happen because \nwe let it happen; it is going to happen because in the private sector \nand in the public sector we are taking the steps that can make this \nhappen.\n  Having said that, I have enjoyed our discussion. Again, I have great \nrespect for the Senator from Tennessee. I think the work he has done in \nthe bill is excellent. I hope in the intervening hours or days before \nwe vote on this proposal that I will be able to garner his support for \nthis very minor, very small adjustment to a piece of legislation that \nis not a mandate but that, in fact, is a commonsense approach in terms \nof how we ought to spend this money and what we ought to expect the \ntaxpayers to get for this money.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I thank him for \nhis amendment. I know he is leaving, and I will not take advantage of \nthat by continuing the debate. I have had a chance to say almost all I \nwant to say.\n  The president of Nissan is a good example, actually. He has gone \nbefore his board and said he wants to spend $800 million. I do not \nthink he went before the board and said he wanted to have 100,000 \nNissan cars and trucks on the road in 2010 whether they worked and no \nmatter how much they cost. That is the difference here.\n  I respectfully suggest there is a blueprint in this legislation, much \nof it provided by the Senator from North Dakota himself. The \nPresident's blueprint includes research on hydrogen-powered engines. \nThat is what the $1.3 billion in research is for--research on the \nproduction of hydrogen fuel cells, et cetera, research on the \ntransportation and delivery of hydrogen via pipelines and fueling \nstations, research on how to store hydrogen better and safer, on \nadditional research on the fuel cell engine.\n  Because of the Senator from North Dakota and others, there is a \nblueprint for various demonstration programs, which I mentioned \nearlier--the vehicle demonstration program for Government and nonprofit \nagencies, the stationary fuel cell demonstration program, hydrogen car \nand fuel cell demonstration programs in national parks,\n\n[[Page S7523]]\n\nthe Centers of Excellence at the university. Those are very specific \nproposals.\n  So I respectfully suggest we have a good bill. We have a broad \nbipartisan consensus that we have a bold vision, and yet with unproven \ntechnology it is not wise for us in the Government to try to guess just \nhow many of those cars there might be but to encourage it and let those \nwho make the cars do it as rapidly as possible and use their talents to \npersuade consumers to buy the cars.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, the Senator from \nTennessee, in the concerns he has expressed regarding this amendment. I \nam intrigued and as interested as any Member of the Senate, including \nthe Senator from North Dakota, in this new technology, the potential to \nuse hydrogen-based fuel cells for power storage, energy storage, and \nthe impact that can have on our automotive industry.\n  There are, and ought to be, concerns with an amendment that attempts \nto set a specific target for using such a future technology by a \nspecific date. I remember some 10 years ago being told that everyone in \nAmerica would be watching a high-definition TV by 1995; 1996 at the \nabsolute latest. That was a technology prediction regarding television, \nsomething with which I think every American is quite familiar. We \ncouldn't even get that future scenario right. To suggest that we know \nthe future of fuel cell technology or even the automotive industry 10--\nand I think as this amendment goes almost 20--years from today is an \nenormous mistake. It is a mistake for a couple of reasons.\n  First, as the Senator from Tennessee pointed out, the current cost of \nthese vehicles is $2 million or so, wildly out of the reach of anyone \nin the country who would be using these vehicles on a day-to-day basis. \nThe private sector is putting a lot of money into this area. That is \nanother reason to try to strike some balance in the bill. But even more \nbasically, despite the fact that the Senator from North Dakota points \nout that this is just a target, what it does is suggest that a target \nfor this technology is somehow better or more important than a target \nfor any other technology.\n  What about solar power? What about photovoltaics? What about hybrid \ncombustion technology? The highest fuel efficiency cars out there today \noften use a combination of electricity and traditional gasoline \ncombustion engines to try to get their fuel efficiency up to 60, 70, 80 \nmiles per gallon. There is certainly tremendous potential there if it \ncan be made cost effective for the average consumer to immediately \nbegin saving energy for our country and for the world sooner rather \nthan later.\n  We should not prejudge which technologies will win out in a \ncompetition of ideas, a competition of cost or a competition for \nconsumer interest in the marketplace. This amendment does just that. It \ntries to predict where the future will take us rather than trying to \ncreate a level playing field where different ideas can compete. \nCertainly money will be put into a lot of leading edge technologies, \nfundamental technologies regarding energy, and the Senator from \nTennessee listed a lot of those. I don't think we should try to predict \nwhich ones will make the greatest impact in the automotive industry or \nin any other industry.\n  While I am as interested as the Senator from North Dakota in this new \ntechnology--I believe it may well prove to be a very important source \nof energy storage in our future--I think it would be a mistake to try \nto prescribe exactly how it needs to be implemented on behalf of the \nautomotive industry and the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have one short reaction to the \ncomment of the Senator from New Hampshire. I will have nothing further \nto say on the amendment.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire reminds me of an experience I had in \n1980, discussing the idea of predicting a new technology. I hope my \nfriend Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive of Federal Express, \nwill not mind my using him as an example. All this is public \ninformation. In the early 1980s, although it is hard to recognize this \ntoday, no one knew what to do with the fax. They didn't know what would \nbe the future of the fax machine. There were those who were saying it \nwould revolutionize communications as much as the fuel cell might \nrevolutionize the automobile.\n  Mr. Smith, since he was in the business of delivering overnight \npackages, had to think about what the fax machine might do to Federal \nExpress. He thought about it, and he came to this conclusion: His \nconclusion was that probably by the end of the 1980s, all Americans \nwould go down to the street corner and find a Fed Ex fax machine and \nthey would use the Fed Ex fax machine on their street corner to send a \nfax to their friends wherever in the world they might want to do that. \nThat was his vision of what might happen with that new technology.\n  Well, we have seen what has happened since then. People didn't go \ndown to the street corner and send a fax to their friend. Everybody has \na fax in his or her office. Many people have them in their homes. They \nbecame personal faxes. Mr. Smith was wrong about that. Fed Ex lost a \nfew hundred millions dollars. Fortunately for Tennessee, he had other \ngreat ideas, and Fed Ex is our leading employer in Tennessee today \nbecause of his entrepreneurial spirit.\n  But what if the Congress had gotten excited and said: Fred Smith has \na great idea. The fax is a great invention and has an unlimited future. \nLet's pass a law saying that the Senate, having heard about the fax, \nhereby decrees that by the year 1990, there shall be a fax on 100,000 \nstreet corners in America and by 1992, there will be 300,000 faxes on \nstreet corners. All those faxes would be in the wrong places because \nthe Senate, with respect, would not have known enough about the future \nto know what it was talking about. It was right about its vision of the \nfax. It was wrong about how far that might work; Fed Ex was at that \ntime.\n  The analogy is pretty good here as well. We have a broad consensus on \nour excitement about the hydrogen car fuel cell and what it might do, \nnot just for the automobile but throughout our economy. It is part of a \nbalanced approach to toward energy. It could make the air cleaner and \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. We are recommending $3 billion to \nstimulate precommercial research on that. But let's not put ourselves, \nin the Congress, in the position of making the same kind of mistake we \nmight have made 20 years ago if we had passed a law suggesting we have \n100,000 fax machines on the street corners of America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are beginning this week again debating a \nnational energy policy for our country, an issue whose time clearly has \ncome, an issue that should have been resolved well over a year ago, but \nbecause of the difficulties and differences of approach, that was an \nimpossible resolution.\n  I will never forget the day I met in our majority leader's office \nwith the then-elect President George Bush. He had not yet taken the \noath of office. He was not yet our President. While he talked about a \nlot of his campaign promises and the priorities he would bring with his \nleadership in the Presidency, he said at that time--and honored it \nimmediately when he became President--first and foremost for this \ncountry was the desperate need for a national energy policy.\n  He, of course, upon becoming President, assigned Vice President Dick \nCheney to build a task force and make recommendations to Congress, \nproposals that should be contained within a national energy policy for \nour country.\n  Let's remember, it was not a decade ago. It was not 30 years ago. It \nwas just a few years ago that our President was reacting to what had \ngone on in California with brownouts, blackouts, and a frustrated \npopulation, and a very\n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\nconcerned economy that no longer were we the masters of our own energy \nfate; that somehow we had become increasingly dependent on foreign \ncountries for hydrocarbons, or oil, and even within our own structures \nof systems of delivery and interconnection of electricity and pipelines \nfor gas we were no longer as independent, strong, and self-reliant as \nwe had been; that some while over the course of the nineties, as our \neconomy grew, we were not replacing or building new infrastructure to \nserve that economy, we were simply relying on the surplus and the old \ninfrastructure that it delivered for that energy. And all of that was \ntrue.\n  The President made his proposals. We crafted a policy, and when the \nmajority in the Senate changed, the Energy Committee was shut down and \na new bill was crafted in the office of the then majority leader, Tom \nDaschle. The bill came to the floor. We had the debate. It ultimately \ngot into conference, but we could not produce a final product for our \nPresident. The differences between our parties and our interests were \ntoo great.\n  This year the Energy Committee, under the leadership of Pete \nDomenici, in a bipartisan way, held the hearings, held the markups, and \nwhat we have before us today is that legislation, a bill that is \nbipartisan, that has a broad range of interests in it, and really \nserves what I call the market-basket approach to energy, not that we \nhave decided one source of energy is going to be the future of our \ncountry. We have learned differently about all of that in the last \ndecade or two.\n  There are multiple sources and there are different markets and \ndifferent economies that demand different kinds of energy. Clearly, to \nadvance electrical production in this country from a coal-fired base, \nwe have clean coal technology built within this bill so that we can \nbuild future coal plants for electrical production that are less \nemitting and cleaner.\n  Within the bill, there is a hydro relicensing provision that will \nallow us to relicense the hundreds of hydro facilities that now serve \nimpoundments on our river systems, and do so in a much more \nenvironmentally sound way that will become more fish friendly but will \nstill allow us to maintain that very clean base of electrical energy \nknown as hydro.\n  It is very important, where I come from and where the Presiding \nOfficer comes from, that these facilities remain productive and, at the \nsame time, as we relicense them, that they can be retrofitted to meet \nthe demands of a new attitude, a new understanding of the management of \nour river systems.\n  In this bill also are the underpinnings of the hydrogen economy that \ncould in the future fuel the transportation needs of our country. The \nDorgan amendment that is before us today deals with those goals about \nwhich we talk. We have been investing as a country for some time in \nhydrogen fuel cell technology.\n  About 2\\1/2\\ or 3 years ago, I was at Dearborn, MI, at the Ford \nengineering facilities and test track. While I was there, I drove a new \nhydrogen fuel cell car. It was a car about the size of a Ford Taurus. \nIt had a hydrogen fuel cell within it that powered electric motors on \nall four tires. It was a marvelous, quietly running car. I got in, sat \ndown, turned on the key, and nothing happened except the dashboard lit \nup, and pretty soon the dashboard said: Go. I stepped down on the \naccelerator, and away I went. There was a small whirring sound as the \nhydrogen fuel cell generated fuel that produced electricity that sent \nit out to the electrical motors on each one of these four tires.\n  When I was out on the test track with the engineer, he said: Pick it \nup; speed it up a little bit. It had been raining, and as I went around \none corner of the test track, I slipped a little bit, and he suggested \nrather sheepishly that we probably ought to slow down. I was willing to \ndo that in his car, his baby. He pioneered and helped develop this car. \nHe said there is another reason besides safety to slow this car down. \nThis car is worth about $6.5 million, and they did not want to lose \nthat very expensive automobile. I did not realize at that time I was \ndriving probably one of the most expensive automobiles ever built. It \nwas a prototype. It was obviously not an assembly-line vehicle.\n  What I drove that day convinced me that in the future, if we choose \nto pursue it, we clearly can have, in part, not in toto, a hydrogen-\nbased transportation fuel system in our country.\n  Is, therefore, the Dorgan approach the right approach at this time? \nShould we start making it mandatory to set targets that are absolute or \nneed to be met? I question that, and I do so most sincerely because I \nwant to move us and our knowledge base and invest in a hydrogen base.\n  Where do we get the hydrogen and how does it get delivered? Do we \nforget that gas station on each corner of every community did not just \nhappen, that it took years and billions of dollars' worth of investment \nto develop the delivery system we have today by a myriad of companies \ninvesting their stockholder money and their profits in a delivery \nsystem? That is exactly what it took. That did not happen by accident.\n  To automatically suggest we are now going to have a hydrogen-based \ntransportation system and that all of these new hydrogen refueling \nstations will occur overnight is a phenomenal stretch. That is the \ndelivery system, and that delivery system alone would cost billions of \ndollars and, clearly, as we transition, if we do, into a hydrogen-based \ntransportation system, it will take time and cost a lot of money.\n  Where do we get the hydrogen? Today we tend to get hydrogen from a \nhydrogen-rich supply--natural gas. But natural gas today is \nincreasingly in less supply and more demand because of the Clean Air \nAct and because we decided years ago that if we were going to put \nadditional electrical production in line, it could be a gas-fired \nelectric turbine. It met our clean air standards.\n  All of a sudden, we began to consume a fuel that was once in surplus \nand is now becoming scarce. Some 3 months ago, its price spiked to over \n260 percent of the average price. Should we be directing ourselves \ntoward that, and should we be setting targets without an alternative \nsupply of hydrogen? In other words, that is why, if you are going to \nset targets and limitations and goals--and maybe there is a day when we \ndo--it is my argument and my belief that the Dorgan amendment is \nsubstantially premature with regard to that point. Let me tell my \ncolleagues why.\n  In the overall parent bill we are debating, the national energy \npolicy itself, there is a title that in time will begin to produce for \nthis country an ample hydrogen fuel base and not use natural gas as its \nsource. It is to develop, along with the new, safe, what we call \npassive generation for a nuclear reactor, an electrolysis system where \nwater can be effectively converted into hydrogen. It is a technology \nthat we know is doable. What is most important is that it is doable at \nmuch less cost and no demand on our natural gas base.\n  Why would it be at less cost, especially if it is allowed to be \nfacilitated and built within a nuclear reactor?\n  Nuclear reactors operate best if they are operated at a constant \nload, but electricity is not used in a constant pattern, whether it is \nmorning and one is cooking breakfast or it is a hot day and one is \nusing air-conditioning or a cold day and using heat. All of that is \nvariable within a range and within a market. So there are up and down \nsupplies. There is peak load and there is soft load, or less load. The \nbeauty of tying to a nuclear reactor a hydrogen electrolysis system as \nwe believe to be engineeringly and technically very possible today--it \nis why within this bill we authorized the development of a prototype--\nis the reactor can then be run at a constant load where it performs for \nthe least amount of money, and when it is peaking for electrical demand \npurposes, the power is shifted over there. When those demand loads come \ndown, the power is shifted over to hydrogen gas production, and it is \nalternated back and forth from electrolysis to online transmission, \nfrom electrolysis to online transmission, based on the demand load at \nthe time, while the reactor is operating constantly.\n  What I would therefore say about goals and targets within an area of \nfuel cell technology today, and supply, is let's get the supply at \nleast started in place and the technologies to develop that supply \nproven effectively before we begin to put targets on governmental \nfleets or other fleets as we begin to cause the transportation of our \neconomy to shift toward hydrogen.\n\n[[Page S7525]]\n\n  Having said all of that, the oil industry, oil per se, for the \nforeseeable future will continue to fuel a very large part of our \ntransportation needs in this country. That is a reality. It is \nsomething that we probably ought not force to cause to be different, \nbut we ought to create and put in place the technologies that allow the \ntransfer, that allow the movement, and that ultimately allow the \ncapitalization of a new form of energy that we believe is hydrogen, and \nwe believe this works.\n  The chairman of the full authorizing committee, who is the author of \nthis legislation, is in the Chamber, so I yield to the Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  First, please excuse my voice. I have somewhat of a cold. I say to \nthe occupant of the chair, it will be in good form tomorrow. Do not \nworry. Having said that, I compliment the Senator from Idaho on the \nwonderful explanation he has given today on the future of hydrogen in \nthe American economy. I also thank Senator Dorgan. Not only this year \nbut before, he has been a strong proponent of moving ahead as rapidly \nas we can with the hydrogen alternative, the fuel cell, and ultimately \nan automobile in our future.\n  Today, Senator Dorgan offered an amendment which will now line itself \nup with a couple of others and perhaps be the third amendment voted on \ntomorrow. For that, I thank him because he brought an amendment to the \nfloor which means we are moving.\n\n  I ask the Senator a question: The hydrogen car which I rode around \nin, as did the Senator, does the Senator remember how much they told us \nit cost?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Six point five million dollars.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not say that to in any way belittle anybody, but \nthe point of it is, they wanted to show us what it would look like, \nwhat the storage capacity or needs on the rear of this vehicle might \nbe, which meant somebody would have some idea how to refuel it later \non, and to put all of that together they spent 6 million-plus dollars.\n  The point of it is, S. 14, which I am very proud of, is an effort to \nproduce a myriad of energies for America so that there will be a \nchoice. It also says when it comes to hydrogen, let's pursue it with \nvigor. Let's get on with the research. Let's get the fuel cells moving \nahead as rapidly as possible. And, yes, for the first time we had a \nPresident say go ahead and authorize a lot of money, $1.6 billion, to \nenter into partnership arrangements with the automobile manufacturers \nto see if our science and their technology could get married up with \ntheir money and taxpayers' money to pursue this with some degree of \nvigor.\n  I do not think I am trying to make a mountain out of a molehill in \nterms of the issue, but to now say, in the midst of all of this, to \nprove we are serious about this let's go ahead and mandate a purchase \nof these automobiles by a date certain it seems to me to be a bit \npremature. I do not think we need it to prove our worth, to prove our \nvalor, to prove that we really want to move ahead with vigor. Quite to \nthe contrary, I think it might indicate that we really are a little bit \nahead of ourselves.\n  So when the time comes tomorrow, after discussing it with Senators \nsuch as Senator Craig, the Senator from New Mexico will decide whether \nwe will have just a straight yes or no vote or whether we should ask \nthe Senate to table what we consider to be a rather inappropriate \namendment because it is too early.\n  As far as I know, there is no other business today. We are waiting \naround for the Dorgan amendment to get itself lined up with two \namendments that are scheduled for tomorrow. There is still some \nsignificant debate on the motion to strike that concerns itself with \nnuclear power and on the so-called authority to the Indian tribes for \nthe development of their energy. There are two amendments. One is \nSenator Campbell's amendment, and one is Senator Bingaman's amendment. \nOne is a first degree, and a second degree. Those will be debated, and \nthen sometime tomorrow, hopefully, we can prove to the Senate that we \nare moving ahead with three votes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Good.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to say now to other Senators who may have \namendments, whatever they may be, the majority leader has been pretty \nfair with us. I am not so sure we have been quite that fair with him in \nthat we have not produced enough amendments, although we are getting \nthere now. We are starting to get a few of the hot button items, and \nmaybe after tomorrow we might be at a point where others will come \nforth. I am asking now that Senators and their staffs, who consider \nthemselves to have amendment potential on this bill, they should start \nto get ready. I am aware there are Senators who have amendments. We \nknow the title of their amendments, but the amendments are not ready \nyet. That is 2 weeks now, not solid but more or less we have had 2 \nweeks.\n  So we ask now that Senators reconsider getting on with this so they \ncan be helpful as we move ahead, and then with the minority soon we \nwill begin to ask for some times. Maybe by tomorrow we can start asking \nfor a time certain for the production of relevant amendments. That \nwould be my hope, I say to my friend Senator Craig and the occupant of \nthe chair, the distinguished Senator, Mr. Sununu.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the senior Senator from New Mexico for what really \nhas become a very thoughtful and methodical approach toward resolving a \nnational energy debate, and bringing us legislation that not all \nparties agree on but clearly is that abundant market basket full of \nideas and concepts and realities, we believe, that bring this country \nonce again toward energy self-sufficiency, and our ability to stand on \nour feet and be proud that we are what we are as a country.\n\n  Our great strength has always been in our abundance of relatively \ninexpensive energy. It has driven our economy. It powers us up as a \ngreat country. Without doubt, it is what lights up the computer screens \nof our country and has made us the leading high-tech manufacturer in \nthe world.\n  I was in San Jose, CA, this weekend speaking to a group. There were \nabout 50 CEOs from high-tech companies from the valley, the heart of \nthe Silicon Valley. We call it Silicon Valley West because right here \nat the beltway in northern Virginia is what I call Silicon Valley East, \nthe heart and home of the Internet systems and internet companies. \nWhile I was talking about technology, they wanted to know about energy. \nIn that valley they demand a high quality of electrical generation, \nconstant power loads to feed their manufacturing facilities. They are \nvery frustrated because of the problems California has had, which has \nbeen in part a policy issue and in part a transmission problem.\n  All of those problems are embodied in our legislation. That is why it \nis important we resolve and get to our President's desk a bill so we \ncan help the energy segment of our economy get on its feet and get \nmoving again for the sake of all.\n  I have said several times, and I think most agree, this legislation, \nS. 14, has more new jobs to be created in the next 4 to 5 years than \nthe stimulus package. While the stimulus package was critically \nimportant, and I voted for it and it already appears to be turning on \nthe economy across this country, the long-term infrastructure \ninvestment for the energy industries of our country that will fuel our \nhomes and light up our computer screens in the future is embodied in \nthis bill. That is why it becomes so important for everyone.\n  Let me step back to hydrogen for a moment. I have no difficulty with \nthe Senator from North Dakota proposing legislation that said agencies \nought to submit annual plans and reports that look at transition and \ntalk about and build a system or a mechanism for transition to a \nhydrogen economy as these technologies develop, as these new production \ncapabilities come on line. That would be a right and appropriate thing \nto do in light of where the technology of this industry is.\n  I have visited with hydrogen fuel cell engineers, scientists who \nstudy this area. They are telling me it would be very hard to measure. \nThey are suggesting we need to prove the worth of this technology to \nthe American consumer--``worth'' meaning a sense of safety. A lot of \nfolks are wondering, Is\n\n[[Page S7526]]\n\na hydrogen car going to be safe? They fail to recognize that a gas-\npowered car that they assume is safe sometimes is not as safe as we \nthink it is. There have been fires and explosions. Is a hydrogen car \nsafe? We believe they can be manufactured to be every bit as safe as a \ngas-powered car, if not safer.\n  But how do you prove it? One of the ways is to get hydrogen used in \nthe economy before it is transitioned to transportation. How does that \nhappen? The development of hydrogen fuel cells that actually fuel \nhomes, manufacturing plants, other facilities that are perhaps less \nadjacent to or isolated from transmission capability. To have a \nhydrogen fuel cell that can actually produce enough power for a factory \nis not unreasonable to assume, or a single home in a rural setting.\n\n  Once that consumerism begins to develop in this country and there is \na general understanding that hydrogen is a part of our energy economy, \nthe reality of transition to a transportation base is probably even \ngreater. Maybe they go equally together. But I know the scientists and \nthe engineers are thinking one or the other or both; one before the \nother. Part of it all comes together at some point. I believe it can.\n  I, along with Senator Domenici and others who study energy sources \nfor our country as members of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, have spent a long time looking at this as a concept to be \nexplored. As the Senator from New Mexico mentioned, we are committing a \nlot of public resources to this. We ought to. It is clean. What happens \nto the exhaust system of a hydrogen-powered fuel cell? No emission, \nexcept a drop of water. So there is no emission of greenhouse gases \ninto the atmosphere.\n  Interestingly enough, when you use natural gas to create hydrogen, \nthe process creates an emissions problem. When you use electrolysis of \nwater to create hydrogen, you do not. So there is another reason to \nexamine and build on the technology of electrolysis. We think the \nnatural blend, the hand in glove, if you will, the synergy that can be \ncreated by new passive nuclear reactors that are safe, cool in \noperation, automatic shutdowns, but can do the constant load, that can \ncreate the economies of optimum operation and therefore at great cost \nsaving to the consumer, is a technology that ought to be developed and \nis embodied within S. 14.\n  I will now, therefore, have to oppose the Dorgan amendment for all of \nthose reasons. It is not time to require the acquisition in the market. \nIt is time to push the technology. It is time to ask for the reports. \nIt is time for this Senate to be able to understand progress and growth \nand development in this area and the likelihood of a time down the road \nwhen more and more of our economy will actually be using hydrogen as an \nenergy base.\n  It is with that I come to the floor to debate this amendment. I hope \nas we get to it tomorrow and a vote in the Senate, as the chairman has \nspoken to, that Senators will consider the reality that this is not the \ntime for targets. This is not the time for hard goals. This is a time \nfor pushing the technology, building on it, encouraging the private \nsector to marry up with the public sector, to advance the technology, \nand it may well be time for the Department of Energy to be required to \nreport and analyze on an annual basis for our sake, for those who make \npublic policy, the reality of these technologies.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 867\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 867.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To ensure continued availability of natural gas)\n\n       On page 278, after line 8, insert the following:\n       ``(h) Triennial Report on Effect on Natural Gas Demand.--\n     Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, and every three years thereafter, the Secretary shall \n     submit to Congress an assessment of the effect of increased \n     use of hydrogen, as a result of the programs in subsections \n     (a) and (b), on demand for natural gas.''.\n       On page 291, strike line 22 and all that follows through \n     page 292, line 8 and insert the following:\n       ``(b) Contents.--At a minimum, each plan shall contain--\n       ``(1) a description of programs under the agency's control \n     in which the use of hydrogen or fuel cells could benefit the \n     operation of the agency, assist in the implementation of the \n     agency's regulatory functions, or enhance the agency's \n     mission;\n       ``(2) a description of any agency management practices, \n     procurement policies, regulations, policies, or guidelines \n     that may inhibit the agency's transitions to the use of fuel \n     cells and hydrogen as an energy source; and\n       ``(3) an assessment of the effect of increased use of \n     hydrogen by the agency, including increased use through \n     programs under section 303(b) of the Energy Policy Act of \n     1992, as amended by this Act, or section 824 of this Act, on \n     demand for natural gas.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment addresses the fact that \nmost hydrogen today is manufactured from natural gas. As far as we can \ntell, this is likely to remain the case as we make any transition to a \nhydrogen-based economy. This dependence on natural gas may prove to be \na real Achilles' heel for the future development of these promising \ntechnologies we have been discussing on the Senate floor today related \nto hydrogen.\n  The lead story in today's Financial Times has a headline entitled \n``U.S. Faces Natural Gas Shortage.'' I believe Chairman Greenspan has \nalso been testifying about this very important issue today in the House \nof Representatives. This is not a new story. There are a number of us \nwho have been sounding the alarm for a long time on this issue and the \nneed for effective action to address it. It is a serious situation. It \nhas been in the making for several years, and it will not be easy for \nus to reverse this situation.\n\n  As an example of this concern, on May 27 there were 29 other Senators \nwho joined me in a letter to Secretary Abraham. In that letter we \nexpressed concern about the current and continued high natural gas \nprices and their effects on consumers and industries that rely on \nnatural gas. We strongly urged the Secretary of Energy to look to \nconservation, energy efficiency, and fuel switching as important near-\nterm steps that can be taken to alleviate what is shaping up as a \ncritical problem, perhaps this coming winter.\n  This past Friday, Secretary Abraham wrote back, agreeing with the \nanalysis of the problem and agreeing that--this is a quote from his \nletter--``the natural gas industry has been strongly supportive of this \nconservation message. . . .''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter sent by 30 \nSenators to the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Energy's \nresponse be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, it would be ironic if, in the name of \nincreasing the diffusion of hydrogen-based energy technologies into the \nU.S. economy, we wound up exacerbating the long-term problem we have \nwith the natural gas supply. To make sure we maintain the awareness of \nthis linkage, and the potential downside that could arise because of \nit, this amendment I have sent to the desk would make two changes in \nthe underlying hydrogen title of the bill.\n  First, the amendment would require a triennial report from the \nSecretary of Energy with an assessment of how the various programs in \nthe bill to increase the number of hydrogen vehicles and the use of \nhydrogen as a fuel were affecting our long-term demands for natural \ngas. If other sources for the manufacture of hydrogen were coming\n\n[[Page S7527]]\n\nto the fore, such as renewable sources of electricity, and the \nincreased dependence on natural gas was not looming as a big problem, \nthen fine. But we would be looking at this natural gas issue on a \nperiodic basis at least each 3 years as hydrogen technologies move \nforward.\n  The second change the amendment would make would be to add a similar \nanalysis to a report from Federal agencies that is already required in \nthe bill on their own future use of hydrogen. It would require Federal \nagencies to assess how their own increased use of hydrogen would affect \nnatural gas demand.\n  Obviously, all of us want hydrogen to be better developed as a \ntechnological option. We all, I believe, also want to make sure we do \nnot have unwanted consequences or unwanted impacts on our strained \nnatural gas picture going forward. This amendment will help ensure that \nwe keep our eyes open and we keep focused on this important potential \nproblem as we move toward a hydrogen-based economy.\n  Mr. President, I think this amendment would strengthen the bill, and \nI hope it is acceptable and can be agreed to.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 27, 2003.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     Secretary, Department of Energy, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Abraham: We are writing to express our \n     concern about continued high natural gas prices, the impact \n     on industries that rely on natural gas for manufacturing, and \n     the possibility of severe price spikes recurring later this \n     year. In your recent address to the National Petroleum \n     Council, you correctly pointed out that the amount of natural \n     gas in storage is unusually low and that injection rates must \n     increase dramatically in order to fill storage to levels \n     sufficient to meet anticipated demand this year. With natural \n     gas prices twice as high as they were last year and the \n     increased demand for electricity expected this summer, market \n     fundamentals are not encouraging for robust storage refill \n     rates.\n       We commend you for focusing on the near term challenges we \n     face with respect to natural gas and for calling an emergency \n     meeting of the National Petroleum Council next month to \n     identify actions that can be taken immediately to ease short-\n     term supply constraints. The expertise of the NPC's members \n     in the production, transmission and distribution of natural \n     gas should be very helpful. Increased natural gas supplies \n     are needed of course and, in fact, drilling is up thirty \n     percent this year. But significant new gas supplies are not \n     likely to come on line in the near term.\n       Energy efficiency and conservation, as well as fuel \n     switching, are more likely to make a difference in natural \n     gas markets this summer and next winter. Analysis of the \n     successful efforts of California to reduce electricity \n     consumption in 2001 demonstrated that efficiency and \n     conservation were the fastest and least costly solutions \n     available. We urge you to cast a wider net for \n     recommendations on natural gas including meeting with \n     Governors, state and federal regulators, industrial and \n     commercial gas consumers, electric utilities and independent \n     generators, and experts in efficiency and conservation.\n       We look forward to working with you to address this \n     critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         Tom Daschle, Tim Johnson, Jay Rockefeller, Russell D. \n           Feingold, Harry Reid, Joseph Lieberman, Jeff Bingaman, \n           Tom Carper, Frank R.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Thank you for your May 27, 2003, \n     letter expressing concern about continued high natural gas \n     prices and their impact on consumers and industries that rely \n     on natural gas.\n       The Administration shares your concern--and it is for this \n     reason that I called for a Natural Gas Summit on June 26, \n     2003, which your letter referenced. In addition to including \n     members of our National Petroleum Council, the Summit will \n     also bring together State and Federal regulators; industrial, \n     residential, and commercial gas consumers; electric utilities \n     and independent generators; along with experts in energy \n     efficiency and conservation to discuss and develop \n     recommendations relating to the future of the natural gas \n     markets.\n       Based on the Department's analysis, we concur with the \n     conclusion advanced in your letter that over the next 12 to \n     18 months there are only limited opportunities to increase \n     supply; and that, therefore, the emphasis must be on \n     conservation, energy efficiency, and fuel switching. That is \n     why the speakers and attendees at the Summit will be \n     substantially consumer focused. I would note, however, that \n     the feedback we have been getting from the natural gas \n     industry has been strongly supportive of this conservation \n     message as they are concerned about the long-term effect on \n     the market of these high short-term prices.\n       In addition to sharing the same opinion regarding the role \n     of conservation, I am pleased that we also are in agreement \n     concerning the need to increase natural gas supplies. Last \n     year, I commissioned a National Petroleum Council study \n     focused on long-term issues that will more directly address \n     supply. This study, to be released in the fall, will include \n     a comprehensive evaluation of future natural gas supply and \n     demand issues. We will, of course, share the results of that \n     study upon its completion.\n       I appreciate your interest in the Natural Gas Summit and \n     look forward to working with you to address these important \n     issues.\n       If you have any questions please feel free to contact me or \n     Ms. Kelly S. Lugar, Deputy Assistant Secretary for \n     Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, at (202) 586-\n     5450.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Spencer Abraham.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have reviewed the amendment. We have \nno objection to the studies provided for in the amendment. We think \nthey will be worthwhile and helpful, so we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 867) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask Senator Bingaman, have you \nfinished with that issue?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted \nto proceed as in morning business for no longer than 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed as in morning business starting in 5 minutes and \nnot to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 5 minutes I \nasked to transpire before the time started be waived and that I be able \nto proceed with my 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized as in morning business.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1211 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCain are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand, from my parliamentary \ninquiry, that at 5:15 the Senate resumes executive calendar debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). In executive session, that is \ncorrect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7527-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7527-S7528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7527-S7528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-107]                         \n\n \n[Page S7527-S7528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-107]                         \n\n\n[Page S7527-S7528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-107]                         \n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Under the previous order, the hour of 5:15 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider the following nomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael \nChertoff, of New Jersey, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nThird Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Michael Chertoff to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. \nI happen to be admitted to the bar of the Third Circuit. I can't \nimagine a better person we can put on that circuit than Michael \nChertoff.\n  This is not the first time this body has had the opportunity to \nconsider Mr. Chertoff's qualifications. In May 2001, my colleagues and \nI voted to confirm his nomination to the post of Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Criminal Division of the United States Department of \nJustice. He has worked tirelessly in that position on behalf of our \ncountry prosecuting those whose specific goal is to harm America, and \nwe are grateful for his service.\n  The same credentials and experience that paved the way for Mr. \nChertoff's confirmation as Assistant Attorney General demonstrate that \nhe will make an exceptional Federal appellate judge. He graduated magna \ncum laude from Harvard College in 1975 and magna cum laude from Harvard \nLaw School in 1978. After his graduation, he served as a law clerk to \nUnited States Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.\n  Following his clerkship, he embarked on a long and distinguished \nprofessional career dedicated to fighting crime and corruption that \nbegan in the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District \nof New York in 1983, where he served as a line prosecutor. In 1987, he \nwas promoted to First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of New \nJersey. In 1990, former President Bush appointed him to be the United \nStates Attorney for the District of New Jersey.\n  During his time as a Federal prosecutor, Mr. Chertoff gained \nextensive experience in all phases of criminal investigations and \nprosecutions. He handled major organized crime, fraud, and corruption \nprosecutions. Here are a few examples:\n  Mr. Chertoff successfully prosecuted a RICO murder case involving the \nthird ranking member of the Genovese La Cosa Nostra family and others. \nThe principal defendants were convicted of conspiring to murder John \nGotti and murdering a mob associate. They each received 75-to-80 year \nprison terms.\n  Mr. Chertoff successfully prosecuted the Mafia commission case, which \ncharged the bosses of all five New York La Cosa Nostra families with \noperating a national commission through a pattern of racketeering acts \nsuch as extortion, loan sharking, and the murders of a mafia boss and \ntwo associates.\n  Mr. Chertoff successfully prosecuted the mail fraud, bank fraud, and \ntax evasion trial of the mayor of Jersey City, NJ. The case arose out \nof an investment fraud perpetrated by the mayor while he was in office. \nThe defendant was convicted of 14 felonies, sentenced to jail, and \nremoved from office.\n  Mr. Chertoff also successfully prosecuted Arthur and Irene Seale for \nthe 1992 kidnapping and murder of Exxon executive Sidney Reso, a tragic \ncase which garnered substantial media attention.\n  This record alone demonstrates that Michael Chertoff has the \nexperience and qualifications to serve as a judge on the Third Circuit. \nHowever, his public service is not limited to holding high level \ngovernment positions. For example:\n\n  Mr. Chertoff served as special counsel to the New Jersey Senate \nJudiciary Committee in its investigation of racial profiling. Under his \ncounsel, the Committee held nine hearings examining racial profiling \nallegations, concluding that the former attorney general had misled the \nCommittee and had attempted to cover up the extent of racial profiling \nin New Jersey from the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  After a convicted rapist was mistakenly released from prison, Mr. \nChertoff again served as Special Counsel for the New Jersey Senate \nJudiciary Committee during its hearings into the application of Megan's \nLaw, which requires State correction officials to notify prosecutors 90 \ndays prior to the release of a sex offender, and the reasons why it was \nnot being systematically employed by the State.\n  Mr. Chertoff also represented three indigent defendants on death row \nin Arkansas through a program operated by the NAACP legal defense fund. \nThe death sentences of all three defendants were overturned on the \nappeal that he handled.\n  Mr. Chertoff has received numerous awards and honors, including an \nhonorary law degree from Seton Hall University in 2002; the Anti-\nDefamation League Distinguished Public Service Award in 1992; and in \n1987 the U.S. Department of Justice John Marshall Award for Outstanding \nAchievement in Trial.\n  These are but a few examples of public service that reinforce the \ntrue nature of Michael Chertoff's character. Recognizing this level of \nexcellence, the American Bar Association has given Mr. Chertoff a \nunanimous well-qualified rating, the highest possible designation.\n  Plenty of others share the ABA's view of Mr. Chertoff. In a joint \npress release, New Jersey's two Democratic Senators, Jon Corzine and \nFrank Lautenberg, expressed their strong support for Mr. Chertoff, \nstating, ``We are pleased that the President has selected a \ndistinguished New Jerseyan for this important seat on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit. Michael Chertoff is a highly intelligent \nand competent lawyer with a long and impressive record of public \nservice.''\n  In a March 11, 2003 editorial, the Bergen Record endorsed Mr. \nChertoff's nomination, calling it ``a refreshing change.'' The \nnewspaper continued, ``Mr. Chertoff is exactly the type of nominee the \nnation needs for federal judgeships,'' and concluded, ``Mr. Chertoff is \nthe type of smart, non-ideological high achiever whom Presidents of \nboth parties should consider for the bench.''\n  Mr. President, I have touched on only some of the attributes and \naccomplishments that demonstrate Michael Chertoff's overwhelming \nqualifications for the Third Circuit. He will be an outstanding Federal \nappellate judge, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of his \nnomination.\n  Mr. President, I notice the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \nis here. Both he and I are admitted to the bar of the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. I am also admitted to the bar of the Tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  I yield the floor so the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania can \nmake his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is especially appropriate for members \nof the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to have a little special \nunderstanding of the needs of that court, and the Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit is very badly overworked at the present time and very \nmuch in need of judicial replacements. The court has served under the \nsuperb leadership of Chief Justice Edward R. Becker, and I know \npersonally from my discussions with him and the new Chief Judge, \nAnthony Scirica, the tremendous backlog and tremendous pressures the \ncourt of appeals has for the very busy States of Pennsylvania, New \nJersey, and Delaware. I am pleased to see that Michael Chertoff is now \ncoming up for a vote before the Senate. He has an extraordinary \nrecord--Harvard undergraduate, Bachelor's degree, magna cum laude,\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\n1975; Harvard Law School, again magna cum laude, in 1978. He has been \nengaged in the private practice of law. He has served as assistant U.S. \nattorney for the Southern District of New York, which is one of the \ntoughest, most complicated jurisdictions. They handle very difficult \ncases. Then he became an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of \nNew Jersey, moved up the ranks to be first assistant, and then later \nU.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey. Again, that is a \njurisdiction which has very complicated cases.\n  He has served as minority counsel for the Banking Committee. He has \nbeen the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division. \nHe has had very wide experience in both civil and criminal law, and I \nthink he comes to the position for the Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit with extraordinary qualifications.\n  It is my hope the vote which we are having today on Michael Chertoff \nmight be an indication the so-called logjam on filibusters will be \nbroken. The Rules Committee last week held a hearing on a variety of \nways to deal with the filibuster. It had been my hope during the 107th \nCongress, before the filibuster was tried, that we might find a \nprotocol, which would work regardless of who controlled the White \nHouse, and regardless of who controlled the Senate.\n\n  When President Clinton was in the White House and Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate, it was my view, stated on the floor at the time, \nthat we should have handled President Clinton's nominations \ndifferently. We should have processed them in a more expeditious \nmanner. Finally, we did handle quite a number of the judges who moved \nthrough after some judicial delays--Judge Berzon, and others.\n  When the Democrats controlled the Senate in 107th Congress and \nPresident Bush was in the White House, the situation was reversed. It \nwas my hope at that time we might find some protocol which I had \nproposed, one specifically which would establish a timetable: Sixty \ndays after the nomination was submitted to the Senate there would be a \nhearing by the Judiciary Committee; Sixty days later there would be \naction by the Judiciary Committee voting up or down; Sixty days later \nthere would be floor action in the Senate.\n  Those timetables were not written in stone. They could have varied. \nThey would be subject to a modification if cause was shown by the \nchairman of the committee upon notice to the ranking member or by the \nmajority leader listing it for the full Senate action upon notice to \nthe leader of the minority party.\n  It was my view at that time that we had so many votes which were \nparty line that if it was a party-line vote the matter would then go to \nthe full Senate for resolution. That was before advent of the \nfilibuster. The filibuster cut new ground. It was unprecedented in the \nSenate for a filibuster to be lodged against a Court of Appeals judge. \nOnce before in the history of the Senate was there a filibuster, and \nthat was when Associate Justice Abe Fortas was considered for Chief \nJustice of the United States. That was a bipartisan filibuster. There \nwere integrity issues there which were very different from the \nfilibusters which have been mounted during the 108th Congress where, as \nI say, this unprecedented action has been taken. That caused a good \ndeal of consternation on this side of the aisle, and I think a good \ndeal of consternation in the country.\n  A number of options were considered where the rule might be changed. \nOne proposal has been to have the first vote require 60 votes and on \nsubsequent votes down to 51. My frank view is that is unlikely to be \naccepted because it isn't very difficult to have a series of cloture \nmotions filed.\n  For those who may be wondering and for anyone watching C-SPAN II, a \ncloture motion is a motion filed to cut off debate. The current rule \nrequires 60 votes to cut off debate.\n  When the logjam continues, there has been the suggestion of what we \nrefer to colloquially as the ``nuclear option'' where there might be a \nruling of the Chair that requires 60 votes, and that ruling could be \nchallenged. On a 51-vote majority, that ruling could be overturned as a \nmatter of Senate precedent. That has been done on occasion in the past. \nBut it is an alternative which I think would be unwise and undesirable \nif any other alternative can be found. But if we were faced with the \nunprecedented cloture proceeding, the Senate may be driven to that \nalternative.\n  What is really under consideration in many minds is whether the \nfilibuster on the two circuit nominees pending is really a preliminary \nfor a Supreme Court nominee. I think if that were to be the case it \nwould be really most unfortunate for the judicial selection process and \nvery unfortunate for the Senate, which really turns on collegiality for \nus to do our job--traditional collegiality which has been sorely \ntempted in the recent several years.\n\n  If there had been an occasion for a filibuster on a Supreme Court \nnominee, I think that would have occurred with the nomination of \nJustice Clarence Thomas. And it was not attempted. I think it should \nnot have been attempted. But that was the most hotly contested Supreme \nCourt nomination during my tenure here, and I think perhaps the most \nhotly contested nomination short of the Fortas nomination in the \nhistory of the Court with the arguments which were raised during the \nhearings, with the arguments which were raised on the Senate floor, the \ndelay, the second round of hearings, and the entire difficulties which \nsurrounded that nomination. Had there been an occasion for a \nfilibuster, I think that would have been the ultimate test. I repeat \nthat I don't think a filibuster should have been attempted. None was. \nJustice Thomas was confirmed 52-48, which I think was a very firm \nimprimatur of regular procedure for the Senate not to filibuster but to \nvote on a majority vote.\n  It is my hope that what we are doing here with Michael Chertoff will \nbe a bellwether of a change of landscape and a sea change in the \nSenate, so that this confirmation is, I think, pretty much assured. I \nhope it will set the stage for affirmative votes in the Senate.\n  I see other colleagues who have come to the floor with only 15 \nminutes before the scheduled vote. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thought we were going to be \ndiscussing the candidate for office. I am sorry we kind of got off into \nanother discussion. We are not filibustering this appointment. We are \nhappy about this appointment. I want the chance to say that, and take \nwhat has happened as an indication of what can happen.\n  I rise today to support the confirmation of Michael Chertoff, whom I \nknow well, to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I am pleased that President Bush has selected this distinguished New \nJerseyan for this important seat on the court of appeals. I hope that \ntells us where, in fact, we might be going with future appointments.\n  Mr. Chertoff is a highly intelligent and competent lawyer who has \ncompiled a long and impressive record of accomplishment in both the \npublic and private sectors.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Chair, if I could, to remind me if I run \npast, let's say, 8 minutes so that my colleague, Jon Corzine, has a \nchance to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, Mr. Chertoff was born in Elizabeth, \nNJ, and distinguished himself academically as an undergraduate and law \nstudent at Harvard University. After law school, he served as a law \nclerk to Judge Murray Gurfein on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSecond Circuit.\n  After he clerked on the Second Circuit, Michael Chertoff served as a \nclerk to a legendary jurist from the great State of New Jersey--U.S. \nSupreme Court Justice William J. Brennan.\n  Justice Brennan was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1956 by \nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower, and he spent 34 years on the Court. He \nis universally regarded as one of the most influential Justices of the \nsecond half of the 20th century.\n  If Mr. Chertoff follows the legacy of his mentor, the Third Circuit \nis going to be in great hands.\n  In 1990, Mr. Chertoff became the U.S. attorney for the District of \nNew Jersey. He remained there until 1994. During his able tenure, he \naggressively tackled organized crime, public corruption, health care, \nand bank fraud.\n  He also played a critical role in helping the New Jersey State \nLegislature\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\nto investigate racial profiling. ``Driving while Black,'' as they say, \nshould not be a crime in any State in the Nation, and I know Mr. \nChertoff agrees. That is why I introduced the first bill in the Senate \nto ban racial profiling. And I am grateful to Mr. Chertoff for the \ninterest he took in this matter at the State level.\n  As a result of Michael Chertoff's contribution, I am proud to report \nthat just a couple of months ago New Jersey enacted the strongest \nantiracial profiling law in the Nation. The Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals is one of the most impressive courts in the country. Based on \nhis past performance, I am confident Mr. Chertoff will fit right in.\n  As you know, I have strongly opposed some of the President's judicial \nnominees. I believe some of them are not appropriate for the Federal \nbench, not simply because they may not have compiled the kind of record \nthat speaks to fairness and balance on the bench but because of a \nrefusal, let's say, to even discuss the views they hold and what their \nbackground might be. I think it is inappropriate.\n  Again, I did not want to discuss the process. I want to discuss the \nindividual. And that is where I think we ought to go. But in this case, \nwe have a candidate, and I stand here as an American, as a Democrat as \nwell, to fully support the appointment of Michael Chertoff because he \nhas the talent and ability to render justice fairly.\n  I believe some of the nominees who came up were on a mission to \ncurtail fundamental civil rights laws and protections. Others, as I \nsaid, have simply refused to answer important questions that would \npermit Senators to execute their constitutional duty for advice and \nconsent.\n  The fact is, there are many highly qualified candidates that the \nPresident could nominate to the circuit courts, the appeals courts, who \nwould enjoy broad support in the Senate from both Democrats and \nRepublicans. Mr. Chertoff is one such candidate.\n  So I enthusiastically support his nomination to the Third Circuit. I \nurge my fellow Senators to support this consensus nominee who will \nserve the people of New Jersey and the Third Circuit ably and \ncompetently.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and yield my remaining time to my \ncolleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to also speak today in \nsupport of Michael Chertoff, a nominee for the U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals is \none that includes my home State of New Jersey. It is a very \ndistinguished court and handles a diverse range of issues reflecting, \nfrankly, the diversity of the people, the economy, the society of that \ncircuit. It deserves a highly qualified candidate.\n  I believe the White House, in cooperation and dialog with the \nSenators from those areas that are attendant to the Third Circuit, has \nbeen fortunate, in working in that cooperative manner, to have a \nnominee as superb as Michael Chertoff.\n  He has ably served the citizens of New Jersey in a number of \ncapacities, as my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, \nmentioned. Indeed, he has served the Nation and the Department of \nJustice, where he is No. 3 today in the criminal justice system. We \nwill all be privileged to have his sound judgment and legal skills \nserving in this critical judicial position.\n  Mr. Chertoff has impeccable credentials. That is why we support him. \nAnd they are fully disclosed, fully responsive to the kinds of \nquestions one would raise. You have heard he attended Harvard College, \nthen Harvard Law School where he was editor of the Law Review. He then \nserved as a Supreme Court law clerk to Justice Brennan.\n  He has had a remarkable private practice. In private practice and \npublic service he has served, in every case, with excellence. He has \ndeveloped a reputation of being brilliant. He has an equal reputation \nfor being tough and fair. And he is a world class litigator and has \nearned the respect of his peers and adversaries in court, regardless of \ntheir political background.\n  While I will acknowledge that I might not always agree with Mr. \nChertoff on every issue--I may have philosophical differences--I find \nthat no excuse for a loss of support when he is prepared to speak to \nthe issues about how he will deal with the judgments he will make and \nhow he will go about forming those judgments in the context of legal \nstudy and the context of constitutional and legal precedent.\n  While there have been even serious concerns that a number of us have \nexpressed regarding the prosecution of the war on terrorism, as at \nleast implemented by the Justice Department--and I share some of those \nconcerns--I do not believe that impacts a judge when they are willing \nto address how they will deal with constitutional precedent. And \nMichael Chertoff clearly has done so. I think he is truly a qualified \ncandidate.\n  Once again, I mention he was a U.S. attorney, a tough one. He \ncombated organized crime, public corruption, health care fraud, and \nbank fraud. Unlike many of his predecessors--and people who now fill \nthe position of U.S. attorney--as a U.S. attorney he continued to try \ncases himself. He went to court; he took on the highest profile cases \nhimself. He is actually one of those people who did the work to go into \nthe courtroom and carry the case.\n  So I think we have a terrific candidate whom we all can support. I \nthink there is a precedent here to which all of us can look. Frankly, \nthis nomination process worked the way it is supposed to work. There \nwas dialog and consultation with the White House. And when there were \ndifferences of view, there was discussion with those who were involved. \nI compliment the White House for how they have worked with the Senators \ninvolved in the process. We have gotten to a positive conclusion \nbecause there has been the kind of dialog and mutual seeking of support \nthat we look for.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this nomination. I urge all of us to \nlook for a more cooperative manner in how we approach the selection of \njudges, particularly in the circuit courts, as we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we vote to confirm Michael Chertoff \nto serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. \nWith this confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed 128 judges, \nincluding 25 circuit court judges, nominated by President Bush.\n  One hundred judicial nominees were confirmed when Democrats acted as \nthe Senate majority for 17 months from the summer of 2001 to \nadjournment last year. After today, 28 will have been confirmed in the \nother 12 months in which Republicans have controlled the confirmation \nprocess under President Bush. This total of 128 judges confirmed for \nPresident Bush is more confirmations than the Republicans allowed \nPresident Clinton in all of 1995, 1996 and 1997 the first 3 full years \nof his last term. In those three years, the Republican leadership in \nthe Senate allowed only 111 judicial nominees to be confirmed, which \nincluded only 18 circuit court judges. We have already exceeded that \ntotal by 15 percent and the circuit court total by almost 40 percent \nwith 6 months remaining to us this year.\n  Today's confirmation makes the eighth Court of Appeals nominee \nconfirmed by the Senate just this year. That means that in the first \nhalf of this year, we have exceeded the average for an entire year \nachieved by Republican leadership from 1995 through the early part of \n2001. The Senate has now achieved more in fewer than 6 full months for \nPresident Bush than Republicans used to allow the Senate to achieve in \na full year with President Clinton. We are moving two to three times \nfaster for this President's nominees, despite the fact that the current \nappellate court nominees are more controversial, divisive and less \nwidely-supported than President Clinton's appellate court nominees \nwere.\n  If the Senate did not confirm another judicial nominee all year and \nsimply adjourned today, we would have treated President Bush more \nfairly and would have acted on more of his judicial nominees than \nRepublicans did for President Clinton in 1995-97. In addition, the \nvacancies on the Federal\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\ncourts around the country are significantly lower than the 80 vacancies \nRepublicans left at the end of 1997. Indeed, we have reduced vacancies \nto their lowest level in the last 13 years. Of course, the Senate is \nnot adjourning for the year and the Judiciary Committee continues to \nhold hearings for Bush judicial nominees at between two and four times \nas many as we did for President Clinton's.\n  I hope that the Republican leadership will see fit to schedule \nRichard Wesley's nomination to the Second Circuit for a vote this week. \nWhen he is confirmed, he will be the 26th circuit court nominee of this \nPresident to be confirmed by the Senate. I expect that we will also \nproceed this week on the nominations of J. Ronnie Greer to be a Federal \ntrial judge in Tennessee, Mark Kravitz to be a Federal trial judge in \nConnecticut and John Woodcock to be a federal trial judge in Maine. \nWhen they are all confirmed, as I expect they will be, the Senate will \nhave confirmed more than 130 judges in less than 2 years.\n  As a followup to what the distinguished Senators from New Jersey have \nsaid, this is a case where on paper this could be a controversial \njudge, surely for Democrats, as someone who was actively involved in \nthe Clinton impeachment matters and others. But I have worked with Mr. \nChertoff. I have found him to be fair. I found him to be honest with \nme. I also am aware of the fact that the White House took the time--\nsomething they normally don't do, or do not often do, I should say--to \nactually consult with the Senators from his home State. That makes a \nbig difference because we have had problems, of course, where that \nhasn't been done or where there has not been consultation or where a \nnominee has been sent up to divide us, not unite us.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will vote without any reservation for Mr. Chertoff.\n  Of course, I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Would the distinguished Senator from Vermont confirm that \nthis is the 128th judge approved during this Bush administration? Is \nthat a fair statement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is true. That includes 25 circuit judges.\n  Mr. REID. And the vacancy rate, as I understand it, is extremely low \nnow on the Federal court system generally; is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is extremely low. Actually the vacancy rate is lower \nthan the unemployment rate in the country. It probably wouldn't be any, \nhad it not been for the fact that 60 of President Clinton's nominees \nwere blocked because 1 or more Republican Senators opposed them--1 or \nmore. So they never got a vote. And had they gotten a vote, there would \nbe no vacancy at all.\n  Mr. REID. It is also true that all this furor created with changing \nthe rules and all this involves two judges whom the Democrats have \nprevented from coming to a vote; namely, Miguel Estrada and Priscilla \nOwen. So the count is 128 to 2. Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right. We have stopped 2 so far; we have confirmed \n128. I would note that friends on the other side of the aisle, when \nPresident Clinton was here, stopped 60, not by votes but by just simply \nhaving 1 or 2 Republicans object so they were never even allowed to \nhave a vote. In fact, when the Republicans were in charge in 1995 and \n1996 and 1997, when President Clinton was here, Republicans allowed 111 \njudicial nominees to be confirmed and only 18 circuit court judges. In \n2\\1/2\\ years, we have done 128 judges for President Bush and 25 circuit \ncourt judges. So crocodile tears have been shed. Unfortunately, it is \nembarrassing when you tell the other side the numbers.\n  Is there any time remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute 15 \nseconds. The Senator from Utah has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I withhold my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, all I will say, in yielding back the \nremainder of my seconds, is that I have been around here 17 years. I \ndon't know that I have ever seen a better nominee for any circuit court \nin the country. This is one very great lawyer, great human being, good \nfamily man, person with a record that all of us should emulate if we \ncould. I hope all of our colleagues will vote for Michael Chertoff. He \ndeserves our vote.\n  No raw number of confirmations means anything, in and of itself, \nwhile there are not one but two filibusters of exemplary nominees going \non now, potentially more to come, and emergency vacancies continue to \nexist. Are we supposed to be grateful that only a few of President \nBush's nominees are being filibustered? Is there an acceptable \nfilibuster percentage that the Democratic leadership has in mind? The \nmere fact that we have to ask these questions makes it crystal clear \nthat we have a broken process. Even one filibuster of a judicial \nnominee is one too many.\n  As for the allegation that two nominees have been defeated, well, I \nfor one would not be as quick as some of my Democratic colleagues to \ndeclare that the nominations of Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen have \nbeen defeated. We will continue to fight for the confirmation of these \nnominees and continue to file for cloture on their nominations. They \nare exemplary nominees who deserve to be confirmed.\n  And as for the implication that it is somehow acceptable to \nfilibuster two judicial nominees in light of the others that have been \nconfirmed, I must ask my Democratic colleagues who are leading these \nfilibusters: Would you ever argue that it is permissible to break two \ncriminal laws just as long as all the rest are being followed? Of \ncourse not. Nobody would make that argument any more than they would \nargue that it is permissible to disregard two of the constitutional \namendments that comprise our Bill of Rights simply because there are \neight others. The confirmation of other Bush judicial nominees in no \nway excuses or justifies the shabby treatment inflicted on Miguel \nEstrada and Priscilla Owen.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will vote for the nomination of Michael \nChertoff to be a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit. Mr. Chertoff has a fine reputation as a prosecutor, \nspecial counsel, and defense attorney. Fellow members of the bar in New \nJersey and the district of Columbia have described him as intelligent, \nfair-minded, and hard-working. Furthermore, in his role as the head of \nthe Justice Department's Criminal Division, certain aspects of his \nperformance have impressed me. For example, his testimony before our \ncommittee in November 2001, expressing confidence in the ability of our \nFederal courts to deal with terrorist suspects, has been important to \nthe debate over the need for military tribunals.\n  However, other policies and decisions involving criminal justice \nmatters during Mr. Chertoff's tenure as assistant Attorney General have \nraised serious concerns. At his hearing, I asked Mr. Chertoff extensive \nquestions about the Justice Department's advocacy on behalf of the \nFreeney amendment to the AMBER Alert bill. This Amendment has nothing \nto do with protecting children, and everything to do with handcuffing \njudges and eliminating fairness in our federal sentencing system. Its \nprovisions effectively strip Federal judges of discretion to impose \nindividualized sentences, and transform the longstanding sentencing \nguidelines system into a mandatory minimum sentencing system. As Chief \nJustice Rehnquist has said, they ``do serious harm to the basic \nstructure of the sentencing guideline system and . . . seriously impair \nthe ability of courts to impose just and responsible sentences.''\n  On April 4, 2003, the Justice Department sent a five-page letter to \nSenator Hatch expressing its ``strong support for Congressman Feeney's \namendment to the House version of S. 151.'' This letter was sent only a \nfew days before the House-Senate conference on the bill and was \ninfluential in persuading the conferees to accept the Feeney amendment. \nAt his hearing, Mr. Chertoff declined to say how involved he was in \ndeveloping the Department's position on the Feeney amendment or whether \nhe supported it. In his subsequent answers to my written questions, Mr. \nChertoff stated that he ``personally had no part in drafting'' the \nDepartment's April 4 letter and did not ``review it before it was \nsent.''\n\n[[Page S7532]]\n\n  While I appreciate the more forthcoming nature of Mr. Chertoff's \nwritten answers, I find it remarkable that the head of the Justice \nDepartment's Criminal Division Division did not participate in the \ndrafting or review of the Department's letter. The Feeney amendment was \nvery important legislation which substantially altered sentencing \npolicy for the Federal criminal justice system. It was vigorously \nopposed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the American \nBar Association, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and many prosecutors, \ndefense attorneys, law professors, civil rights organizations, and \nbusiness groups. As a Federal appellate judge, Mr. Chertoff will soon \nbe responsible for applying its provisions. He will need to explain to \nhis new colleagues why he did not do more at the Justice Department to \nstop this ill-advised legislation--or at least support Chief Justice \nRehnquist's call for a ``thorough and dispassionate inquiry into the \nconsequences'' of the Feeney amendment before its enactment.\n  I was similarly surprised to learn, as Mr. Chertoff acknowledged in \nhis most recent set of written answers, that neither he nor anyone else \nin the criminal division was involved in the decision to deny the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation the authority to investigate the recent \ngun purchases of suspected terrorists after September 11. This decision \nwas made in spite of the legal opinion issued by the Office of Legal \nCounsel on October 11, 2001, stating that there is ``nothing in the \nNICS regulations that prohibits the F.B.I. from deriving additional \nbenefits from checking audit log records.'' The F.B.I. had previously \nconducted such investigations for years. Furthermore, the Justice \nDepartment was at the time aggressively expanding its investigative and \nprosecutory powers in response to the 9/11 attacks. Mr. Chertoff could \nhave, and should have, done more to help the F.B.I. agents \ninvestigating those vicious attacks. As with the Feeney amendment, this \nwas an example of ideology trumping smart and effective law enforcement \nat the Department of Justice.\n\n  Finally, I am concerned about inconsistencies in the responses Mr. \nChertoff provided with respect to the debate over the legality of the \ninterrogation of John Walker Lindh. According to reports in Newsweek \nand the New Yorker, John DePue, an attorney in the Terrorism and \nViolent Crime Section of the Criminal Division, which Mr. Chertoff \nheads now and headed then, called the Professional Responsibility \nAdvisory Office in December 2001 and requested its opinion on the \npropriety of having the F.B.I. interview Lindh. At his hearing, Mr. \nChertoff testified:\n\n       [I have to say, Senator, I think the Professional \n     Responsibility [Advisory] Office was not asked for advice in \n     this matter. I am familiar with the matter. I was involved in \n     it.]\n\n  In response to my first set of written questions, Mr. Chertoff \nstated:\n\n       [T]hose at the Department responsible for the Lindh matter \n     before and during the time of Lindh's interrogation did not \n     to my knowledge seek PRAO's advice.]\n\n  Then, in response to my second set of written questions, Mr. Chertoff \nacknowledged that the e-mails published in Newsweek ``indicate that Mr. \nDePue initiated contact with PRAO about whether the FBI should question \nWalker Lindh and that Ms. Radack responded to that inquiry''--and that \nhe first learned about theses e-mails in early 2002. I understand that \nMr. Chertoff does not believe that Mr. DePue played a major role in the \nLindh investigation and prosecution, and does not understand why DePue \nasked PRAO for its opinion on this matter. Nevertheless, Mr. Chertoff \nshould have fully shared his knowledge regarding this situation from \nthe outset, rather than deny that PRAO was asked for its opinion.\n  According to the New Yorker article published on March 10, 2003, 2 \nweeks after the Justice Department filed charges against Lindh, Ms. \nRadack, a highly qualified employee who received a merit bonus the \nprevious year, received a ``blistering'' performance evaluation which \nseverely questioned her legal judgment, and she was advised to get a \nnew job. Mr. Chertoff has told me that has no knowledge of the facts \nsurrounding Ms. Radack's employment, performance, or departure from the \nDepartment, and I take him at his word. Nevertheless, I remain very \nconcerned about Ms. Radack's situation. According to press reprots--and \nthe Department has never issued any statement disputing them--Ms. \nRadack was in effect fired for providing legal advice on a matter \ninvolving ethical duties and civil liberties that high-level officials \nat the Department disagreed with. Furthermore, after Ms. Radack \nnotified Justice Department officials that they had failed to turn over \nseveral e-mails requested by the Federal court, Department officials \nnotified the managing partners at Ms. Radack's new law firm that she \nwas the target of a criminal investigation. I submitted questions to \nAttorney General Ashcroft regarding this matter in March, and I await \nhis response.\n  Notwithstanding my concerns about Mr. Chertoff's performance as head \nof the criminal division--as well as initial failure, later corrected, \nto provide serious, consistent, and responsive answers to the questions \nasked by members of the Judiciary Committee--I am supporting his \nnomination to the Third Circuit. I am doing so based on his fine \nreputation as a lawyer, his achievements as a prosecutor and special \ncounsel to the New Jersey legislature, and his assurances that as a \njudge he will apply the law with independence, integrity, and a \ncommitment to due process and the core constitutional values embedded \nin the fabric of our democracy. My support for Mr. Chertoff's \nnomination today, however, should not be interpreted as an endorsement \nor approval for any other position.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know Mr. Chertoff is waiting, biting his \nnails, wondering if he will get through this. I would mention for those \nof my colleagues who might actually be watching this, I will vote for \nhim. I will support him. I urge them to do the same.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Michael Chertoff, of New Jersey, to be a United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Third Circuit? On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the Senator from \nOregon (Mr. Smith), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens), and the \nSenator from Missouri (Mr. Talent) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \na period of morning business with Senators speaking for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, where is Aung San Suu Kyi? Burma's \npolitical crisis grows, and much of the world is outraged. Burma's \ndemocratically elected leader, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and \nworld-renowned icon of freedom, remains imprisoned. Burma's ruling \ngenerals so far have prevented both the U.N. special envoy, who has \nbeen in Rangoon for 3 days, and the International Committee for the Red \nCross, to visit her. The generals seem unmoved by the world's \ncondemnation, and their peoples' suffering. It is time for all \nrespectable members of the international community to put weight behind \ntheir words and take active measures to secure the freedom of Aung San \nSuu Kyi and the Burmese people.\n  Most of the world sees the Burma crisis in staggeringly different \nterms than do its military rulers. Despite the regime's denials, the \nMay 30 assault on Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters was a well-\norganized, premeditated attack by members of the Union Solidarity \nDevelopment Association, a militia of the ruling, and misnamed, State \nPeace and Development Council. Given Aung San Suu Kyi's stature within \nBurma and around the globe, we know Burma's top generals, led by \nGeneral Than Shwe, would have had to personally approve a physical \nattack on her and her delegation. We know that Than Shwe would never \nlet his conscience interfere with any calculation of what is in the \nbest interests of the junta's continued ability to repress the \ndemocratic aspirations of its people.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi's associates, including several who witnessed the \nMay 30 attacks, say that at least 70 and perhaps 100 members of her \nNational for Democracy were slaughtered by the regime's militia in the \nmost violent crackdown since the junta crushed the August 1988 popular \nuprising against the regime--and we know the junta's claim that only \nfour people died on May 30 in what they call a spontaneous clash with \nthe opposition is false. We know that Suu Kyi is not in ``protective \ncustody,'' as the junta insists, but that she is being held because her \nnational popularity and clear democratic mandate ultimately make rule \nby generals impossible to sustain. We know the generals are holding her \nincommunicado because, if she were free to speak, she would speak the \ntruth about their brutality, and about the ruin they have brought to \ntheir country. What's so dangerous about these obvious sentiments is \nthat the generals themselves know they are true, and that it is they \nwho are to blame for this devastation, exposed as they are before their \npeople and the world.\n  The irony is that by crushing the democratic opposition, the generals \nhave once again demonstrated to their people and the world the \nfragility of their rule, which no amount of repression will legitimize. \nThat one woman, unarmed and leading only an army of citizens who \nbelieve in her, can so rattle a group of uniformed officers who control \nevery instrument of national power is testimony to what Vaclav Havel \ncalled the power of the powerlessness. As Havel and many other brave \ndissidents behind the Iron Curtain knew, no amount of repression can \nprovide a regime the democratic legitimacy that is the only basis for \nregime survival. No leader or leaders can systematically repress their \npeople and loot their country and get away with it forever. The Burmese \nmilitary has been doing it for 40 years, and their time is running out.\n  Another sad truth the current crisis has exposed is how little the \nleaders of Burma's neighbors, including the democracies, seem to care \nfor the most basic rights of the Burmese people. The Prime Minister of \nThailand arrives in Washington today: I hope he is prepared for a \nbarrage of questioning--and criticism--of Thailand's warm embrace of \nthe dictatorship next door since he assumed office in 2001. Under Prime \nMinister Thaksin, Thailand has moved aggressively to deepen Thai \nbusiness ties with Burma, provide substantial economic assistance to \nthe junta, collaborate with the Burmese military against Burmese ethnic \ngroups who oppose rule by the generals, arrest and repatriate exiled \nBurmese democrats across the Thai-Burma border, and pursue a policy of \ncooperation and conciliation with a regime that is opposed by the vast \nmajority of its people and known to much of the world as an outlaw.\n  Bangkok's coddling of Rangoon has gone well beyond passive acceptance \nof the regime next door to something approaching active sponsorship of \nthe junta. Thailand has made no effort to reach out to the Burmese \nopposition, which is especially unfortunate since some of its most \nfearless leaders reside in the Thai-Burma border region. Under Prime \nMinister Thaksin, Thailand has supported and sustained its historic \nenemy, at the very time when it could use its influence to help bring \nabout the negotiated transition to democracy in Burma.\n  India's government also appears to have made a strategic decision to \n``constructively engage'' Rangoon out of fear of growing Chinese \ninfluence in Burma. India has legitimate concerns about China's \ninterest in using Burma as an outlet for Chinese commerce and military \nforces in the Andaman Sea. But given China's pervasive influence in \nBurma, India cannot hope to compete with Beijing for the junta's \naffection. A more effective strategy would be to support the Burmese \nopposition's campaign for a free Burma. I don't know what policies a \nBurma led by Aung San Suu Kyi would pursue towards China, but I'm quite \nconfident she wouldn't choose to pursue a strategic partnership with an \nAsian dictatorship. Democratic India would be a natural ally of a free \nBurma, and I believe Delhi would be wise to help move Burma in that \ndirection, rather than curry favor with the generals.\n  China's unreconstructed policy towards Burma following the attack of \nMay 30 was best expressed by China's ambassador to Rangoon, who told \nU.N. envoy Razali Ismail that China considers the crisis to be Burma's \n``internal political affair.'' Interestingly, China has been helpful in \ndealing with the North Korean nuclear crisis, I hope because Beijing \nunderstands the costs of tying itself too closely to a regime that is \nactively alienating the rest of the world. Perhaps it is wishful \nthinking to hope that China's rulers will reach a similar conclusion \nabout their support for the Burmese junta: that in their increasing \nrepression and devastation of their country, the generals are fighting \na battle they can't win, and that undermines the stability and \nprosperity China seeks in Southeast Asia. Perhaps Beijing would take a \nmore resolution line with the generals if Southeast Asia were united in \ncondemnation of their assault on the Burmese people.\n  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations will hold its annual \nministerial summit and security meetings next week in Phnom Penh. \nSecretary of State Powell is scheduled to attend the meetings of the \nASEAN Regional Forum and the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conferences from \nJune 18-20. I urge Secretary Powell to reconsider his plans to travel \nto Southeast Asis unless the ASEAN nations, excluding Burma, agree to \naddress the crisis in Burma as their central agenda item; agree to \nforcefully condemn the crackdown on democracy in Burma; agree to \nrequire the release of Burma's detained democracy leaders in order for \nBurma\n\n[[Page S7534]]\n\nto participate in the ASEAN ministerial meetings; and agree to issue a \nconcrete action plan to move Burma towards a negotiated settlement with \nAung San Suu Kyi that grants her a leading and irreversible political \nrole culminating in free and fair national elections.\n\n  I understand the importance of Secretary Powell's visit to Southeast \nAsia. I agree that the region is too important for the United States to \nneglect. But as long as Burma's neighbors neglect the political crisis \nin their backyard, it is hard to imagine what coherent role ASEAN can \nplay in the region and the world. All Southeast Asian leaders have a \nvested interest in building ASEAN into a strong regional bloc that can \nhelp expand prosperity and improve security in Southeast Asia. As long \nas Burma, an ASEAN member since 1997, is held captive by the generals, \ndestabilizing the region and attracting precisely the kind of \ninternational sanction Southeast Asian leaders would like to avoid--and \nas long as those leaders do little or nothing about it--Southeast Asia \nwill remain little more than the sum of its parts, and ASEAN will have \nlittle enduring relevance. Secretary Powell should condition his visit \nto Phnom Penh on an ASEAN agenda that addresses the rot at the heart of \nthe organization--the decaying dictatorship in Rangoon--and that helps \nmove ASEAN towards a more constructive role in Southeast Asia than that \nof ``constructively engaging'', and abetting, tyranny in Burma.\n  The United States has moved to restrict visas for officials of \nBurma's Union Solidarity Development Association and freeze Burmese \nleaders' assets. Tomorrow, the Senate will take up a measure banning \nimports from Burma. Europe is moving to tighten existing sanctions \nagainst the junta. These efforts to bring to bear pressure for \ndemocratization will have additional force if Burma's neighbors end \nbusiness as usual and take concrete steps to help liberate the Burmese \npeople.\n  It is hard to believe that Americans and Europeans care more about \nthe rights of the Burmese people than do people in Bangkok, Beijing, \nDelhi, Manila, Jakarta, and other Asian capitals. These nations will \nalways have Burma as a neighbor. Burma will not always be ruled by the \ngenerals. When they are gone, free Burma's leaders will speak the truth \nabout ASEAN and its support for Asian autocrats, unless that \norganization and its member states make a strategic decision to stand \nwith the Burmese people in their struggle for freedom today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7534-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-111]                         \n\n \n[Page S7534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-111]                         \n\n\n[Page S7534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-111]                         \n\n\n\n\n                 FORMER SENATOR DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, on March 31, 2003, a Mass of Christian \nBurial for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was held at St. Patrick's \nChurch here in Washington. At that service, a beautiful homily honoring \nour friend and revered former colleague Senator Moynihan was given by \nhis pastor, Rev. Msgr. Peter Vaghi. For the benefit of all Senators and \nfor history, I ask unanimous consent that Msgr. Vaghi's remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Mass of Christian Burial, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, March 31, 2003\n\n       My dear Liz, Maura, John, Tim and Tracey, Michael Zora, \n     distinguished guests and friends,\n       We gather on this Lenten Monday in this historic church of \n     St. Patrick in sorrow but also in confident hope. For we come \n     to pray for the soul of Daniel Patrick Moynihan in this his \n     parish church, a church which he loved so much with so many \n     of us who loved him as well. We commend him this morning into \n     the loving hands of God our Father as we celebrate this holy \n     Mass, this perfect prayer of redeeming love, given to the \n     church by Christ as He Himself prepared to return to His \n     Father in heaven. In this time of war, we pray at this Mass \n     for Pat's eternal and heavenly peace.\n       This parish church is a long way from Hells Kitchen in New \n     York where he was raised, but a short walk from his apartment \n     overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, an avenue which was so close \n     to his heart, an avenue he helped transform. And this short \n     walk is one he made each Sunday for holy Mass often with \n     Irish walking stick in hand and that unforgettable tweed hat.\n       In the preface for Christian Death in this morning's Mass, \n     we hear those consoling words that for your faithful people, \n     Lord, ``life is changed not ended.'' These are words of hope \n     in a world desperately looking for signs of hope. They are \n     words of our faith, a faith Pat embraced and lived. They are \n     words of faith in Jesus Christ who ``is the way, the truth \n     and the life.'' In that first reading from the Book of \n     Wisdom, how can we not be consoled, referring to ``the souls \n     of the just,'' thought `` in the view of the foolish to be \n     dead,'' but affirmed so cogently by that revealed text to be \n     ``at peace.''\n       There are many titles which describe the life and work of \n     Pat Moynihan, words which portray the mosaic of his 76 years \n     of long and productive, life: a senator for two and a half \n     decades, ambassador, professor and scholar, voracious reader, \n     an independent-minded intellectual, administration official \n     under four successive presidents, veteran, author of 18 \n     books, public servant, statesman, awardee of innumberable \n     honors, friend and confidante, a father and grandfather, \n     spouse of 48 years to his wonderful wife Liz, and I might \n     add, a faithful parishioner at this historic church of St. \n     Patrick, this church of his patron saint. Each part of this \n     rich mosaic of his life touches us in different ways \n     depending on how we knew him but assuredly the totality of \n     the gift of his life brings comfort and consolation to each \n     of us in these days of deep loss no matter how we knew him.\n       He loved this parish. He had a particular love for our \n     choir. He would often stand in the side aisle toward the end \n     of Mass and watch the choir looking up from that vantage \n     point. How he enjoyed them! On occasion, he would also take \n     up the collection. He did it ever so slowly thanking everyone \n     individually, in his unique style, for the contribution each \n     person made. As I would watch him with basket in hand, hoping \n     we could continue the Mass, I always found it hard to believe \n     that this was really the chair of the Senate Finance \n     Committee!\n       Pat Moynihan was a man of quiet faith. As with every person \n     of faith, however, he struggled to make the living Word of \n     God shape his decisions in life. for him, this found \n     expression in his long commitment to the body politic, the \n     pursuit of the common good and his special care for the poor, \n     the family structure, and the most needy in our midst. In the \n     words of Revelation, speaking of those who have died in the \n     Lord: ``. . . let them find rest from their labors, for \n     their works accompany them.'' Like Pat, they and each one \n     of us--in our turn--will meet our good and gracious God \n     who judges us all with a loving and merciful heart.\n       For him, there is now no longer any human pain, anxiety, \n     loneliness, the rush of daily life, the frailty of our human \n     condition. No longer must the Lord, like the Hound of Heaven, \n     pursue him--as He constantly pursues each one of us in life. \n     He now possesses him fully--we pray--for Pat was baptized \n     into Christ Jesus. Our faith teaches us that for those \n     baptized into Christ Jesus, ``those who have died with \n     Christ, we believe that [they] shall also live with him.'' \n     Yes, ``the souls of the just are in the hand of God and no \n     torment shall touch them.''\n       In this Mass of Christian Burial, we gather as a family to \n     pray for him. We gather as well to console his wife Liz, his \n     sons, daughter, daughter-in-law, his grandchildren and \n     family. We gather in prayer to console each other.\n       And as we ponder the mystery of Pat's death--for death is a \n     mystery--it is also an appropriate time for each of us to \n     ponder the mystery of life, the mystery of his life, the \n     mystery of life in general. For each one of us without \n     exception, life has its ups and downs, its surprises, its \n     victories and defeats, its happiness and loneliness. Life is \n     a mystery which only death will ultimately reveal. As we \n     contemplate Pat's rich life, we pray that now at last, in the \n     company of a gracious God, he will have the answer to the \n     challenge of his life.\n       In this morning's Gospel passage, Jesus told Martha that \n     ``I am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me, \n     even if he dies, will live, and everyone who lives and \n     believes in me will never die.'' As Martha came to believe \n     that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, we ask the Lord \n     Jesus this day, a day when we remember Pat Moynihan, to \n     empower us to believe and live more deeply in Him, our Savior \n     Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life. In His \n     own time, then, He will also raise us up as, in faith, we \n     believe He raises up Pat ``for everyone who lives and \n     believes in me will never die.''\n       We shall miss Pat Moynihan. How can we ever forget him? We \n     all loved him in life, may we never forget him in death. As \n     his extended family, let us pledge this day to pray for him, \n     his wife and family.\n       May he rest in peace!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7534-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7534-S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7534-S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-112]                         \n\n \n[Page S7534-S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-112]                         \n\n\n[Page S7534-S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-112]                         \n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a young \nman from Iowa who lost his life in service to his country. On Monday, \nMay 26, 2003, Private Kenneth Nalley was killed in a tragic accident on \na road in Iraq. Kenny was only 19 years old. As the town of Hamburg, \nIowa mourns the loss of one of its sons, I know I join many of my \nfellow Iowans in extending my prayers and sympathy to Kenny's family. \nPrivate Nalley is the third soldier from Iowa to be killed since the \nstart of Operation Iraqi Freedom. His death reminds us that a great \nmany American men and women are still putting\n\n[[Page S7535]]\n\nthemselves in harm's way every day in answer to their country's call. \nKenny joined the Army right out of high school in order to gain \nexperience and further his prospects for a career in law enforcement. \nLike all who serve in our armed forces, he knew that meant he might be \nasked to risk his life to defend American interests. I salute Kenny \nNalley's sense of public service, and I honor his sacrifice today. The \nannouncement I received from the Army regarding his death said it best. \nIt reads ``Pvt. Nalley epitomizes the best of our country--a brave \nsoldier-- who exhibited courage, selfless service, and honor in \nabundance. His ultimate sacrifice has contributed immeasurably to the \nfreedom and security of both Iraq and the world.'' I ask that all my \ncolleagues in the Senate remember Kenny Nalley today, and all those who \nhave given their lives in the service of our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7535-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-113]                         \n\n \n[Page S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-113]                         \n\n\n[Page S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-113]                         \n\n\n\n\n                          A TEAM OF CHAMPIONS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, in recent weeks, thousands of students \nhave received their diplomas and commenced a new phase of life. For the \nClass of 2003 at my alma mater, one of the enduring memories will be \nthe national championship won by our women's basketball team, and I \nwould like to take this opportunity to recognize that outstanding \naccomplishment.\n  South Dakota is a sparsely populated State known for its vast open \nspaces and cold winter nights. Yet on most Fridays and Saturdays, \nthousands of people make the trip to Frost Arena--named not after the \nwinter temperatures in Brookings, but after longtime coach and \nprofessor Reuben ``Jack'' Frost. Inside Frost Arena, they have come to \nexpect some of the best basketball played in Division II of the \nNational Collegiate Athletic Association.\n  This championship team came to South Dakota State University from \ncommunities--large and small, urban and rural--that dot the Upper \nMidwest. They arrived on campus, like so many of us, holding the \nhighest aspirations for themselves.\n  In 2002, the SDSU Jackrabbits reached the Division II national \nsemifinals. On March 29, 2003, Coach Aaron Johnston and his players won \nthe Division II national championship with a 65-50 win over Northern \nKentucky University, capping an incredible 32-3 season.\n  For years to come, SDSU players, fans, and students will recall the \nexcitement of that night. Whether you recall the moment as a player on \nthe court, a follower in the stands--or a fan who watched the game on \nESPN2--the excitement of that night will long be remembered as a \nhighlight in SDSU's history of athletic successes. Our memories of that \nnight will forever remind us why we are proud to call ourselves \nJackrabbits.\n  South Dakota State University, buoyed by its alumni's successes over \nits 122-year history, proudly boasts: ``You can go anywhere from \nhere.'' On a basketball court in St. Joseph, MO, in front of a \nnationally televised audience, these individuals offered further proof \nthat there are no limits and no boundaries to what a person can \naccomplish at South Dakota State.\n  Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting these \nyoung women and their coaches on this remarkable achievement. I am \nproud to request that the 2002-2003 South Dakota State University \nwomen's basketball team's roster be recorded in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       10: Stacie Cizek, G/F, 5-10, Jr., Omaha, Nebraska; 12: \n     Stephanie Bolden, G, 5-6, So., Marshall, Minnesota; 14: \n     Brenda Davis, G/F, 5-11, Jr., Colton, South Dakota; 20: \n     Heather Sieler, G, 5-6, Fr., Huron, South Dakota; 24: Megan \n     Otte, G, 5-7, So., Grand Island, Nebraska; 30: Brooke \n     Dickmeyer, G/F, 5-9, So., Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n       34: Melissa Pater, F, 5-11, Sr., Holland, Minnesota; 40: \n     Dianna Pavek, G/F, 5-8, So., Ivanhoe, Minnesota; 42: Shannon \n     Schlagel, F/C, 6-0, So., Raymond, South Dakota; 50: Karly \n     Hegge, C, 6-1, Sr., Baltic, South Dakota; 52: Sarita DeBoer, \n     C, 6-2, So., Huron, South Dakota; 54: Christina Gilbert, C, \n     6-2, Fr., Stillwater, Minnesota.\n       Head Coach: Aaron Johnston, Assistant Coach: Laurie Melum, \n     Graduate Assistant: Sheila Roux, Senior Women's \n     Administrator: Nancy Neiber, Student Assistant: Jamie Nelson, \n     Student Assistant: Chris Marquardt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7535-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-114]                         \n\n \n[Page S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-114]                         \n\n\n[Page S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-114]                         \n\n\n\n\n                        DR. DONALD FREDERICKSON\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I welcome this opportunity to pay \ntribute to the memory of one of the best medical leaders and \nresearchers of our time. One year ago, Dr. Donald Frederickson passed \naway at his home in Bethesda. Of his many achievements, he is best \nknown to the Nation as Director of the National Institutes of Health \nbut his contributions to medicine, especially in the field of \ncardiology, began much earlier.\n  Dr. Frederickson first joined the NIH in 1953, and he held several \nimportant research and administrative positions in the National Heart \nInstitute, now known as the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, \nbefore becoming Director of NIH. At the National Heart Institute, he \nled the research team that discovered the connection between \ncholesterol and heart disease. He founded the National Heart \nInstitute's Section on Molecular Disease, and discovered two new \ndiseases. As Director, one of Dr. Frederickson's most notable \nachievements was in the field of DNA research. He skillfully mediated \nthe early days of the dispute that still concerns us today--the dispute \nbetween those concerned with the social and ethical implications of DNA \nresearch and those who could see the potentially great benefits of \nthese discoveries. As a result of mediation, NIH was able to develop \nguidelines for DNA research that met the needs of both groups.\n  After leaving the NIH in 1981, Dr. Frederickson served on numerous \nboards and panels, in addition to serving as President of the Institute \nof Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and Scholar-in-\nResidence at the National Library of Medicine.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Frederickson was highly respected in both \nmedicine and government. The current NIH Director, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, \ncalled him ``a true statesman of science'' and ``a towering influence \nin the scientific community.''\n  Donald Frederickson's brilliant contributions to modern medicine will \nlive forever. He was a giant of medical research with an extraordinary \nability to see a better and brighter future, and lay the groundwork to \nmake it happen, and we will never forget him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7535-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7535-S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7535-S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-115]                         \n\n \n[Page S7535-S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-115]                         \n\n\n[Page S7535-S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-115]                         \n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF DR. JUDITH A. RYAN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, on July 2, 2003, after many years of \nservice, Dr. Judith A. Ryan of Sioux Falls, SD, will retire from her \nposition as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Evangelical \nLutheran Good Samaritan Society. Today I want to congratulate Dr. Ryan \non her upcoming retirement and thank her for her many years of service.\n  The Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Society began partnering with \nchurch leaders in small, rural communities in the early 1920s, \nresponding to the call to care for vulnerable populations--those who \nhad no other options for care and no one to care for them. Today, the \nGood Samaritan Society, headquartered in Sioux Falls, owns or manages \nfacilities in 25 States, employs 24,000 staff members, and serves more \nthan 28,000 residents.\n  I thank Dr. Ryan for her sterling management of this wonderful \norganization. Her long career as a health executive is distinguished by \nher commitment to excellence and her untiring efforts on behalf of \nAmerica's senior population. South Dakota has been fortunate to have \nsuch an advocate and leader.\n  Dr. Ryan's career is impressive. Prior to assuming her position as \nCEO of the Nation's largest not-for-profit long-term care and \nretirement system, she served as Chief Executive Officer of the \nAmerican Nurses Association; Senior Vice President of Lutheran General \nHealth System in Park Ridge, IL; Associate Director of the University \nof Iowa Hospitals and Clinics; and Associate Dean for the University of \nIowa College of Nursing.\n  Recognized for her work in the field of long-term health care, Dr. \nRyan earned international recognition and was invited by the Danish \nNurses Association to learn about emerging models of care in rural \ncommunities. Upon her return, she shared her insights at the National \nRural Health Association's Annual Conference.

Madam President, today I draw my colleagues' attention \nto the situation in Zimbabwe, where courageous citizens continue to \nprotest the political repression and economic collapse that have \nplunged their country into crisis.\n  Since 2000, President Mugabe has made a series of decisions intended \nto tighten his grip on power regardless of the cost to the country, \ntrampling on the independence of the judiciary, harassing the \nindependent media, manipulating the political process, intimidating \nopposition supporters, destroying the economy, and exacerbating a food \ncrisis. A very real and legitimate issue--the need for meaningful land \nreform--was for a time employed as a fig leaf for the regime. But it \nhas long been clear that this government is not interested in justice, \nonly in power.\n  Last week's general strike has been the latest manifestation of \npublic dissatisfaction. Reports from the region indicate that security \nforces are violently suppressing efforts to demonstrate in the streets, \nusing rubber clubs, rifle butts, water cannons, tear gas, and live \nammunition to disperse crowds, according to the Associated Press. Some \n300 people have been arrested, including opposition parliamentarians. \nAt this difficult time, it is important that the people of Zimbabwe \nknow that the world is watching, and that like the Zimbabweans \ndemanding change, the international community has not lost hope for the \ncountry.\n  I was proud to work with the distinguished majority leader, Senator \nFrist, on the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act, a bill \nwhich was passed into law in the last Congress. This legislation makes \nit clear that when the rule of law is restored in Zimbabwe, and when \nthe civil and political rights of citizens are respected, the United \nStates will come forward to help the country recover, rebuild. We will \ncontinue to fight the AIDS pandemic that is taking such a terrible toll \non Zimbabwean society. I look forward to the day when we can follow \nthrough on that commitment, Mr. President, and help Zimbabwe to realize \nits tremendous potential as an engine of growth and model of \nparticipatory democracy in the region. Time after time, news reports \nconfirm that Zimbabwe is full of patriots--citizens who refuse to allow \ntheir country to be hijacked by a self-serving cabal, independent \njournalists who risk torture when they seek to report the truth rather \nthan the ruling party line, parents who want their children to grow up \nin a Zimbabwe free from repression and corruption. These people deserve \nour support and our admiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7536-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-117]                         \n\n \n[Page S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-117]                         \n\n\n[Page S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-117]                         \n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SMALL CITIES DAY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, the National League of Cities, led by \nMayor Brenda Barger of Watertown, SD, has designated, June 20, 2003, as \nthe third annual National Small Cities Day to call attention to the \nrole of small cities and towns in American life.\n  The vast majority of cities throughout our Nation have populations of \nfewer than 50,000 people. These communities play an essential role in \nnurturing families, cultivating values, building a strong sense of \ncommitment and connection, and ensuring safety and security.\n  Millions of Americans live better lives because small cities and \ntowns provide services and programs that meet the needs of their \ncitizens. Particularly during these difficult times in our Nation's \nhistory, these Americans have looked to the leaders of their small \ncommunities to ensure their safety and security. Partnering with other \nlevels of government, small cities work hard to provide helpful and \nreliable information about national issues affecting hometown America, \nand to maintain confidence in our American way of life. Often, they \ncarry out their vital responsibilities with limited staff and tight \nbudgets but with enormous good will and close connections to the \ncitizens they serve every day. The leaders of the Nation's small cities \nand towns are indeed on the front lines in addressing many of our \nNation's most pressing problems.\n  Businesses, civic organizations, and citizens across the Nation are \npartners in strengthening hometown America, and must be encouraged to \ncontinue to support efforts that make these cities and towns such great \nplaces to live. The Federal Government, too, must continue to be a good \npartner by funding important Federal programs that support small cities \nand towns such as the Community Development Block Grant Program, the \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services Program, and local and regional \nhomeland security planning and preparedness.\n  We must continue to work together and look for ways to further \nstrengthen our small cities and towns through creativity, innovation, \nand, above all, collaboration. I join the National League of Cities and \nthe Small Cities Council in encouraging President Bush, my \ncongressional colleagues, State governments, community organizations, \nbusinesses, and citizens to honor the efforts of ``small town America'' \nand renew our commitment to work together on this day and in the future \nto strengthen our small cities and towns, and to recognize their \nessential role in our intergovernmental partnership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7536-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7536-S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7536-S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-118]                         \n\n \n[Page S7536-S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-118]                         \n\n\n[Page S7536-S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-118]                         \n\n\n\n\n                         CONFLICT IN THE CONGO\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's \nIturi Province. Recently, international attention has been focused on \nthe alarming ethic violence in the region, where thousands have been \nkilled in the past year. Credible reports suggest that over 50,000 \npeople have died in Ituri since 1999, and a half a million more have \nbeen displaced. For years, this horror was lost in the larger tragedy \nof Congo's conflict, in which over 4 million people are estimated to \nhave lost their lives.\n  Clashes between Hema and Lendu militia forces in Ituri escalated \nrecently as external actors fuel the fire with increasingly \nsophisticated arms and support, essentially waging proxy wars at the \nexpense of Congolese civilians. The reports from the region are truly \nappalling, featuring horrific murders, mutilation, cannibalism, rape, \nand the use of child soldiers. The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, \nwhich has no mandate or capacity to enforce peace, has been reduced to \nstruggling to to protect the civilians who have fled in desperation to \nU.N. sites in Bunia, but their capabilities are severely limited, and \nmost civilians frantically searching for help and security are left \nwith no help at all.\n  Congo's suffering is more than a humanitarian crisis. It is a \nmassively destabilizing force in Africa. The war has drawn in other \nstates and provided lucrative opportunities for international \ncriminals. We cannot forget that our security is at risk when these \nshadowy forces are making gains.\n  The pattern of massive human rights abuses and constant \ndestabilization has to stop. I recently offered an amendment to the \nforeign assistance authorization bill in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee designed to bolster U.S. support for activities in central \nAfrica aimed at pursuing justice and accountability, deterring abuses, \nand holding those responsible for such abuses accountable for their \nactions. That is one small step toward a constructive policy in the \nregion over the long-term. But with regard to Ituri, the U.S. must take \naction urgently today.\n  On May 30, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing \nthe Secretary-General to reinforce the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the \nnortheastern town of Bunia. France has\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n\nagreed to lead the multinational force, and while our relationship with \nFrance has certainly not been an easy one lately, their leadership on \nthis issue is admirable. The United States should provide all \nappropriate assistance to this mission, and I am grateful to be joined \nby Senator Alexander, Senator Biden, and Senator Lugar in making that \npoint clear in communications to the administration.\n  We have spent a great deal on MONUC to date, but if we do not take \naction to defuse this explosive situation, if we stand by and let \nmilitia forces rip apart the province in a struggle for power and \nmineral wealth, then I am at a loss as to how to explain this \ninvestment. The U.S. must also work closely with other international \nactors to move forward on a process of disarmament and a meaningful \npolitical solution to the conflict, so that the respite that may be \noffered by this new force is not short-lived. Perhaps most importantly, \nthe U.S. must take concrete steps to insist that the government in \nKinshasa and the governments of Rwanda and Uganda stop use their \ninfluence with the parties to stop the violence. We cannot simply stand \nby, reading reports of grotesque violence and massive suffering, and \nclaim that there is nothing we can do. There is actually a great deal \nof work to be done. We should start today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7537-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-119]                         \n\n \n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-119]                         \n\n\n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-119]                         \n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RUTH EVANS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Ruth \nEvans of Henderson, KY, for her selfless devotion to Kentucky's youth. \nRuth received the Excellence in Service award from the Kentucky Cabinet \nfor Families and Children for her relentless service as a foster \nparent.\n  Representing the Green River Region, Ruth Evans along with her late \nhusband, George, began providing a safe home to children in need 22 \nyears ago and have done so without any prejudice towards the foster \nchild's background, personality or disability. To date she is credited \nwith raising 250 foster children in addition to the eight children of \nher own. Her love of children and her dedication to ensuring that every \nchild receives the best opportunity to succeed has been the backbone of \nher service as a foster parent.\n  While receiving the Excellence in Service award is a wonderful honor \nfor Ruth, she says her greatest reward for her efforts are the \noccasional visits she receives from former foster children who return \nas adults with children of their own to share their lives with her. \nSome foster children come to Ruth neglected and abused but all have had \nthe opportunity to learn and grow in a safe environment.\n  Ruth's faith in God has been a guiding force during her years spent \nas a foster parent. As the father of nine children and the grandfather \nof many more, including some adopted children, I am inspired by Ruth's \nexample. Her efforts have made all the difference in the lives of so \nmany and she has helped make Kentucky a better place to live. Parents \nand foster parents alike throughout Kentucky and across America should \nemulate her example. I thank the Senate for allowing me to recognize \nRuth and voice her praises. She is Kentucky at its finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7537-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-120]                         \n\n \n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-120]                         \n\n\n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-120]                         \n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING FOSTERS DAILY DEMOCRAT ON 130 YEARS OF SERVICE TO NEW \n                          HAMPSHIRE'S SEACOAST\n\n Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nproud New Hampshire institution celebrating an important milestone this \nyear. For 130 years, Fosters Daily Democrat, a now daily newspaper \nserving the people of the city of Dover and New Hampshire's seacoast \nregion, has provided exceptional coverage of local and State news. \nSince its founding by Joshua L. Foster, the paper has remained under \nthe ownership and direction of the Foster family and is the only daily \nnewspaper in our Nation displaying a family name in its banner.\n  In order to understand the significance of the milestone Fosters is \ncelebrating this month, it is important to recognize just how much news \nthe publishers, editors and reporters have witnessed and brought to the \nDover area since June of 1863. The 1860 census lists a little over \n8,500 Dover residents. Today the city is proud to have nearly 27,000 \nresidents. During its first decade, Fosters witnessed a time of \ntremendous production and growth in the Cocheco Print Works and Pacific \nMills, two the most important employers in town. The Mills, which \nharnessed the power of the Cocheco River, produced some of the finest \ncotton products in the nation and employed 1,200 workers. The Print \nWorks was churning out in excess of 65 million yards of printed cottons \na year to an increasingly global market.\n  In addition to reporting on the area's growth and prosperity, Fosters \nalso brought one of the worst disasters in the history of the city to \nits readers--the great flood of March 1896. As any New Hampshire \nresident knows, tremendous amounts of rain in the early spring aided by \nmelting snow from the previous winter, causes flooding. This was \ncertainly true on March 1 and 2 that year when the city lost three \nbridges, numerous businesses, and incurred tens of thousands of dollars \nin economic hardship to a deluge that caused raging currents and swept \nlarge chunks of ice into the middle of town. Fosters was on hand to \ncover it all.\n  When President Theodore Roosevelt visited Dover in 1902, Fosters was \nthere. When 545 residents of Dover served in World War I, Fosters \nbrought their stories to New Hampshire, and again in World War II when \n2230 Dover residents fought to defend our Nation. And in 1973, when \nDover, the oldest continuous settlement in New Hampshire, and seventh \noldest city in the United States, marked its 350th birthday, Fosters \nDaily Democrat marked 100 years of publishing. Since the middle of the \n20th century it has followed countless Presidential candidates trudging \nthrough our State in the cold and snow. Fosters Daily Democrat has been \nthere every step of the way to make sure its readers stay informed and \nin touch with issues that concern them.\n  In addition to its coverage of events in and around the Dover area, \nthe paper also brings its readers coverage of national and world \nevents, including the war on terror. In a recent editorial, March 29, \nFosters cautioned its readers to be wary of folks ``who seek mightily \nto undermine the American way of life and their intent to perpetrate \natrocities against innocent people either directly or by aiding and \nabetting those who would carry out such deeds.'' Today, the paper holds \ntrue to the words of its original editor, Joshua Foster, who in the \nfirst editorial published in June 1873 pledged that, ``Whatever may \ntend to benefit this people and enhance their prosperity, will receive \nour warm and enthusiastic support.''\n  For 130 years, five generations of the Foster family, currently led \nby Bob and Terri Foster, have brought news from Dover City Hall, the \nNew Hampshire Statehouse and locations around the globe to the front \nporches of New Hampshire's seacoast. On this special anniversary I \nsincerely congratulate them on the tremendous job they continue to do, \nthank them for the important public service they perform, and wish them \nthe best of luck in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7537-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7537-S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7537-S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-121]                         \n\n \n[Page S7537-S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-121]                         \n\n\n[Page S7537-S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-121]                         \n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \nneed for hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Mesquite, \nTX. On October 4, 2001, Vasudev Patel, a 49-year-old Indian gas station \nowner, was shot to death during an armed robbery. His killer told \npolice that he was motivated by vengeance for the terrorist attacks as \nhe allegedly had lost a relative in the World Trade Center. A security \ncamera recorded the armed man walking into the station, ordering the \nowner to give him all of the money before shooting him. Unable to open \nthe cash register, however, the man fled without taking any of the \nmoney.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them\n\n[[Page S7538]]\n\nagainst the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that \nby passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7538-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-122]                         \n\n \n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-122]                         \n\n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-122]                         \n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO OPERATION BLESSING\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to all involved in organizing Operation Blessing. Operation \nBlessing was an event hosted by seven churches for the families of the \n159th Aviation Brigade at Fort Campbell, KY which took place on May 3, \n2003. It was a work of charity and compassion for which all those \ninvolved are certainly deserving of thanks and respect.\n  David Mudd of God's Outreach, Inc. in Owensboro, KY, led the \norganization of the event working closely with other community and \nchurch leaders, including Mrs. Allison Bird of Fort Campbell; Pastor \nTroy Oakley of World Destiny Church in Hopkinsville; Pastor Roy Ellis \nof Christian Assembly Church in Madisonville; Pastor Cleddie Keith of \nHeritage Assembly of God in Florence; Pastor Louis Embry of Christ \nCommunity Church in Hopkinsville; Pastor Tim and Linda Rigdon of New \nCovenant Church in Providence; Pastor Garswa Matally of Wing Avenue \nBaptist Church in Owensboro; Pastor Sammy Wilson of Word and Spirit \nChurch in Owensboro; Don Boyd of Bethel Church in McDaniels; Steve \nKukul of the Lipton Corporation in Owensboro; and Pastor David Pry of \nRiver Outreach Ministries in Evansville, IN.\n  These men and women raised a lot of needed items and services for the \nfamilies of the 159th Aviation Brigade, ranging from washing machines \nand furniture to live music and good company and fellowship. There was \na raffle to distribute bicycles and helmets for children of the 159th \nand 17,000 pounds of food was distributed to the military families. \nMany of the members of the pastors' congregations came from all around \nthe Commonwealth for fellowship with the families of deployed soldiers \nand to volunteer their time and services. The most important gift \nOperation Blessing gave was the reassurance that the sacrifices \nsoldiers and their families make do not go unnoticed or unappreciated.\n  Operation Blessing was a shining example of love of country and of \ncompassion for our fellow soldiers. These women and men demonstrated \nthat America treats her soldiers and their families with much deserved \nrespect and due honor. They are to be highly commended for their acts \nof charity and their example should be noted and followed by all.\n  I thank the Senate for allowing me to recognize Operation Blessing \nand the sacrifices of the 159th Aviation Brigade and their families. \nThose who made this charitable event successful and those military \nfamilies who stand by and support our soldiers in harm's way fighting \nfor our freedom are truly humble and patriotic Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7538-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-123]                         \n\n \n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-123]                         \n\n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-123]                         \n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7538-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-124]                         \n\n \n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-124]                         \n\n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-124]                         \n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7538-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-125]                         \n\n \n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-125]                         \n\n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-125]                         \n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 1215.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for special treatment for certain drugs and biologicals under \nthe prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department \nservices under the medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill that will \nensure that cancer patients continue to have access to the treatment \nand care they desperately need in their communities.\n  In Missouri alone, the number of new cancer patients is estimated to \nreach almost 30,000 this year. For the Nation, we're talking well over \n1.3 million. And the numbers continue to climb every year. These \nnumbers are in addition to patients currently living with cancer. Many \nof them are surviving--and thriving--because of new tests, new \ntreatments, and care they receive in community cancer centers across \nthe country.\n  Many of these patients will turn to hospitals in their communities \nfor lifesaving treatment. Hospital outpatient departments are a \ncritical part of the cancer care delivery system that provide a \nsignificant portion of the cancer care across the country.\n  However, this vital care is in jeopardy because this year, the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, has implemented \ndrastic reductions in reimbursements for cancer services, including \nchemotherapy. These cuts are forcing cancer centers across the country \nto reconsider how they are providing care or accept reimbursement that \nfails to cover their costs.\n  I was recently contacted by Wes Thompson, Director of Radiology at \nRay County Memorial Hospital in Richmond, MO. For those of you \nunfamiliar with Missouri, Richmond is a small town with a population of \nabout 6,100 approximately 50 miles east of Kansas City. Ray County \nMemorial Hospital is the sole referral center for chemotherapy \ntreatment for the rural residents outside of Kansas City.\n  In 1999, Wes' wife died of cancer at the age of 26. She happened to \nbe a patient of the pharmacist, Robert Courtney, who has been convicted \nof diluting thousands of chemotherapy treatments for profit over the \nlast several years. Wes will be receiving a monetary settlement from \nthe legal proceeding involving Robert Courtney and he would like to \ndonate it to the Ray County's oncology program in his wife's name. \nUnfortunately, cuts in reimbursements by Medicare for chemotherapy \ntreatment will force Ray County Memorial Hospital to discontinue \noutpatient cancer treatment on January 1, 2004. And, that is \ndevastating news to the community.\n  This is a department that treats over 250 patients a year across \nthree counties. 60-70 percent of their patients are Medicare \nbeneficiaries and about 40 percent of their patients are indigent. Many \nof these cancer patients would receive no care at all if Ray County \nMemorial closed the doors of the cancer program. And yet, that's \nexactly what they are considering. Their cancer program can't stay \nafloat when every chemotherapy treatment they give is reimbursed by \nMedicare at less than their costs. There are a lot of expensive drugs \ninvolved in the treatment of cancer. The heavy dependence on drugs has \na lot to do with why the cuts are devastating to cancer care in \nparticular.\n\n  At Ray County Memorial, the first round of cuts last year meant that \nhospital overall took a loss of over $150,000. This year's cuts will \nresult in the loss of approximately $200,000-$300,000 for oncology \nservices alone.\n  As of January 1 of next year 250 patients in rural Missouri will be \nforced to drive to Kansas City to receive cancer treatment. Oncologists \nat Ray County Memorial Hospital estimate that 40 percent of the \npatients they treat will be unable to make the trip to Kansan City area \nfacilities to receive their treatment--either because they lack the \ntransportation or the help to get there and back, or they are too sick \nor too weak to endure that trip. As a result of this cancer center \nclosing, 80-100 people will die from cancer with no treatment and no \nhope. Of course Ray Memorial Hospital will continue to give these \npeople loving care and try to make them as comfortable as possible, but \nthey will be unable to treat their cancer anymore.\n  This is not a problem unique to Ray County Memorial Hospital. Due to \ncuts in Medicare reimbursement for cancer treatments hospitals across \nMissouri and across the county that provide outpatient cancer care--\nlarge or small, rural or urban--are struggling to continue to provide \nthis care. These cancer centers work every day to ensure that the \nthousands of Americans diagnosed with cancer are receiving the best \ncare possible.\n  I also have the privilege of representing Truman Medical Center, \ndistinguished in its own way--for providing free care to so many. While \nTruman Medical Center sees only about 300-350 newly diagnosed cancer \npatients each year, about 70-75 percent of them are indigent. For these \npatients, they provide some 1,500-2,000 treatments of chemotherapy each \nyear . . . and starting in January of this year, Medicare is \nreimbursing for many of these at levels dramatically below Truman's \ncosts. And there are so many others.\n  In rural areas, where it is often hard to recruit physicians, it is \nthe community cancer centers that provide all the chemotherapy and \nother services that help ensure that cancer patients don't have to \ntravel long distances for the care they need. This is particularly \nimportant in cancer treatment, where life saving treatments often \nresult in difficult side effects in the short term.\n  These cancer centers are also often the early adopters of some of the \nnewest and most complicated drug regimens that cancer patients need \ntoday. And not only are they a ``safety net'' for rural patients, they \nare often the safety net for Medicaid and uninsured patients.\n  And yet, these are the very institutions that have been suffering \nunder\n\n[[Page S7544]]\n\nwhat is essentially an experiment underway by the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, CMS. I know that this isn't anyone's favorite \nagency, but I expect more under a Republican Administration.\n  For a number of years now, CMS has been trying to bring a new payment \nsystem to these hospitals. Each year this experiment brings a new set \nof rules and payments--for the hospitals to sort through and try to \nimplement.\n  But this isn't just an administrative burden that takes our \ncaregivers away from their payments. In the last two years, this \npayment system has resulted in significant payment reductions for a \nsetting of care that can now barely meet its costs.\n  My own Missouri institutions tell me they're considering closing \ntheir indigent care programs or worse, closing their doors altogether.\n  My office is hearing stories from around the country, about hospital \nadministration arming their doctors with lists of the most expensive \ndrugs and what CMS is now reimbursing them. Why do this if you aren't \ntrying to influence a doctor's decision about what to prescribe? \nPharmacists are under pressure to review dosing regimens to see where \nthey can cut corners. Some drugs are just not being given in these \ncommunity centers. Others that used to be given free of charge until \ntheir Medicare codes were assigned now aren't given at all.\n  In some cases, hospitals are sending patients to the nearest \nphysician's office, where inexplicably, Medicare is paying more for the \nsame drugs. But sometimes theses offices aren't nearby. Other times, \nhospitals are getting patients returned to them with complications that \nhave arisen--and now have to be admitted for overnight stays and close \nmonitoring.\n  How scary for a cancer patient? Sometimes with only months to live, \nto be told that it could take nine months before the next breakthrough \ndrug can be given because it's just too expensive. To be told that the \nhospital where you've gotten to know your doctors and nurses after \nweeks of chemotherapy is now closing its doors. To be told that you now \nhave to drive miles for care, away from friends and family who have \nhelped care for you when you return feeling nauseous and weak from \ntreatments.\n  These stories are accumulating--all because of a failed CMS \nexperiment. So should we terminate the experiment and start over with a \npayment system that actually reflects that cost of providing this care? \nYes, of course.\n  But that would take time--and while the time honored tradition here \nin Washington of debate and compromise for long term reform is a worthy \none--these community cancer centers around the country continue to rack \nup the stories of compromised care and reduced access for patients, and \ntime is one luxury many cancer patients simply do not have.\n  And this brings me to my legislation, which is measured, timely, and \nfocused on the most immediate of needs. And, written so as to recognize \nthe budgetary constraints facing us.\n  This legislation would set a payment floor for some of the most \ncostly drugs given in the outpatient community centers today. This bill \nisn't limited to cancer drugs. But cancer is one of those diseases that \nrelies so heavily on new drugs for treatment that tend to be costly \ndrugs, so the impact of this experiment has been felt here more. The \nbill provides this relief immediately--so that in January 2004, these \nhospitals can start receiving increased payments that at least cover \nmore of their costs.\n  This payment floor, by the way, was set not on the basis of these \ncenters' true costs. Instead, recognizing the little time they have and \nthe immediacy of their need, they have settled for payment rates \nadvocated by various members of Congress over the last year--as it \nbegan to be clear how devastating an impact this experiment could have.\n  This bill, for example, wouldn't help them cover the costs of the \npharmacy services they provide, so critical to ensuring safe and \neffective care in the hospitals. Again, these costs are especially \nsignificant for cancer patients, where mixing highly toxic \nchemotherapeutic agents using special equipment and wearing protective \ngear, reviewing protocols and checking for patient risks and side \neffects are all more intensive efforts. It recognizes these services by \nasking for a study of these costs, so that they may be recognized in \nlonger term solutions that we develop over the next year or so.\n  The legislation I introduce today will provide hospitals like Ray \nCounty Memorial Hospital and Truman Medical Center, and so many around \nMissouri and across the country the immediate relief they need to be \nable to treat their patients.\n  I look forward to working with my Finance Committee colleagues to \nensure that the provisions of this legislation and the immediate relief \nthat it provides are incorporated in anything we do on Medicare.\n  We have learned our lessons the hard way in home health. This crisis \nin community cancer centers promises to reach similar proportions if we \ndon't act now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TALENT:\n  S. 1207. A bill to redesignate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 120 East Ritchie Avenue in Marceline, \nMissouri, as the ``Walt Disney Post Office Building''; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1207\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WALT DISNEY POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Redesignation.--The facility of the United States \n     Postal Service located at 120 East Ritchie Avenue in \n     Marceline, Missouri, and known as the Marceline Main Office, \n     shall be known and designated as the ``Walt Disney Post \n     Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the Walt Disney Post Office Building.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1208. A bill to amend the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of \n1978 to establish a program to provide assistance to States and \nnonprofit organizations to preserve suburban forest land and open space \nand contain suburban sprawl, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the people of Maine have always been \nfaithful stewards of their forest lands because we understand and \nappreciate its tremendous value to our economy and to our way of life.\n  From the vast tracts of undeveloped land in the north, to the small \nwoodlots in the south, forest land has helped to shape the character \nand the heritage of my State.\n  While our commitment to stewardship has preserved the forests for \ngenerations, there is a new and troubling thereat to Maine's forest \nlands that requires a fresh approach. This threat is suburban sprawl. \nIt has already consumed tens of thousands of acres of forest land in \nthe southern part of my State. Sprawl occurs because the economic value \nof forests or crop land cannot compete with the value of developed \nland.\n  This problem is particularly acute in southern Maine where there has \nbeen more than a 100-percent increase in urbanized sprawl over the past \ntwo decades. This has resulted in the labeling of the greater Portland \narea as the ``sprawl capital of the Northeast.''\n  I am alarmed by the amount of working forest land and open space in \nsouthern and coastal Maine that has given way to strip malls and cul-\nde-sacs. Our State is working to respond to this challenge because once \nthat land is paved over, it is gone forever. Those forest lands and \nthose small woodlots are lost forever once that land is developed.\n  The people of Maine in response to this concern have approved a $50 \nmillion bond issue to preserve land through the Land for Maine's Future \nBoard. They have also worked hard supporting local efforts to preserve \nopen space. And they have contributed their time, their energy, and \ntheir money to the work done by our State's 88 land trusts.\n  The people of my State are dedicated to preserving our working \nforests and protecting our communities from sprawl. It is now time for \nthe Federal\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\nGovernment to lend a helping hand in support of those efforts.\n  Today, I am introducing the Suburban Community Forestry and Open \nSpace Act. This legislation, which was drafted with the advice of \nlandowners, conservation groups, and the Maine State Forester, \nestablishes a $50 million grant program within the U.S. Forest Service \nto support locally driven projects that will preserve our working \nforests. Local governments and nonprofit organizations would compete \nfor funds to purchase land outright or to buy conservation easements to \nkeep the forest land threatened by development in their traditional \nuse.\n  Projects funded under this legislation must be targeted at lands \nlocated in parts of the country that are threatened by sprawl. The \nlegislation requires that Federal funds be matched dollar for dollar by \nState, local, or private resources so that it is a true partnership to \npreserve this open space and working forests.\n  This grant program would help to promote sustainable forestry as well \nas public access to our forest lands. My legislation protects the \nrights of property owners with the inclusion of a ``willing seller'' \nprovision, which requires the consent of a landowner if a parcel of \nland is eligible to participate in the program.\n  The grant program would also allow nonprofits and municipalities, but \nnot the Federal Government, to hold title to the land or the easements \npurchased under this program. The $50 million is a modest amount but it \nwould help to achieve a number of stewardship objectives.\n  First, my legislation would help prevent forest fragmentation and \npreserve our working forests, helping to maintain the supply of timber \nthat fuels Maine most significant industry.\n  Second, the resources made available by my legislation would be a \nvaluable tool for communities that are struggling to manage growth and \nprevent sprawl. Currently, if a community trying to cope with the \neffects of sprawl turns to the Federal Government for help, they would \nfind that no assistance is available.\n  The Forest Legacy Program, which has been critical in preserving \nundeveloped forest land in my State and many others, is really not \nsuitable for the kinds of projects my bill envisions. My bill would \nchange that by making the Federal Government an active partner in \npreserving forest lands and managing sprawl, while leaving the \ndecisionmaking at the State and local level where it belongs.\n  Last year, this legislation was included in the forestry title of the \nSenate-approved version of the farm bill which passed this Senate by a \nvote of 58-40. Unfortunately, the forestry title was stripped out of \nthe farm bill conference report, despite bipartisan support for \nprovisions such as my legislation.\n  There is a great deal that needs to be done to protect our working \nforests for the next generation. I believe the legislation I am \nreintroducing today will help advance that goal. I am grateful for the \nsupport of many of the people and organizations that are leading the \neffort to support this legislation. By enacting the Suburban and \nCommunity Forestry and Open Space Act, Congress can provide a real \nboost to local conservation initiatives, help prevent sprawl, and help \nsustain the vitality of natural resource-based industries.\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record several letters \nof support for my legislation. They are from the National Association \nof State Foresters, the New England Forestry Foundation, The Trust for \nPublic Land, and the Pacific Forest Trust. I ask unanimous consent that \nthose letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                           of State Foresters,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Association \n     of State Foresters, I would like to thank you for your \n     efforts to reduce the impacts of urban and suburban sprawl on \n     private and tribal forestlands in the U.S. Your bill to \n     protect Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space \n     demonstrates your commitment to minimizing conversion of \n     suburban forestlands to nonforest uses. Maintaining working \n     forests in suburban environments is consistent with the goals \n     of NASF, and we appreciate your efforts to develop a program \n     that can be implemented by the States.\n       As the USDA Forest Service's Southern Forest Resource \n     Assessment clearly demonstrates, one of the major threats to \n     forestland is urban sprawl. The provisions in Section 1 of \n     your bill will enable private landowners to keep their land \n     in trees and sustain the public benefits that their forests \n     provide. Your bill provides another tool to address this \n     critical concern.\n       Thank you for your commitment to sustainable forest \n     management and to reducing suburban sprawl. We look forward \n     to continuing our work with you on the details of the entire \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                          James L. Sledge, Jr,\n\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       New England\n\n\n                                          Forestry Foundation,\n\n                                                     June 3, 2003.\n     Senator Susan M. Collins,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The New England Forestry Foundation \n     applauds Senator Collins' leadership and initiative in \n     sponsoring the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space \n     Program, designed to help towns and communities across \n     America's suburban landscape combat sprawl, and preserve open \n     space. This legislative package is exactly what is needed to \n     provide an incentive for local governments and land trusts \n     across the country to unite and partner to address an issue \n     of national importance.\n       Congratulations!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Amos Eno,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    The Trust for Public Land,\n\n                                         Boston, MA, June 4, 2003.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Trust for Public \n     Land, I am pleased to express our support for the Suburban \n     and Community Forestry and Open Space Act. This legislation \n     will provide a much-needed focus on working forests that \n     provide important resources in and around Maine's towns and \n     cities that are facing significant development pressures. We \n     applaud your foresight in addressing this issue.\n       As the Trust for Public Land pursues its mission of \n     protecting land for people in Maine, we are acutely aware of \n     the difficult choices many landowners face as land values \n     rise and development pressures intensify. The forest lands \n     that lie in the path of development are incredibly important \n     to local residents for a variety of resources, including \n     recreation, wildlife habitat, water quality and open space. \n     The Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Act will \n     allow these critical lands to remain intact as community \n     assets by focusing federal assistance to landowners in areas \n     affected by suburban sprawl. This is a much-needed addition \n     to the resource conservation efforts that states, localities \n     and non-governmental partners are already undertaking and \n     will provide the extra funding leverage needed to \n     successfully meet the challenges of the future.\n       Our work with willing sellers across the state leads us to \n     believe that your legislation will provide new resource \n     protection opportunities for many Maine communities that will \n     leave them in good shape for future generations. Maine's \n     forest resources are absolutely critical to ensuring a decent \n     quality of life for residents and visitors alike, and \n     proposals like yours will ensure that we address the \n     conservation of those resources wisely.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this and many other issues \n     affecting Maine. We look forward to working with you on this \n     legislation and for the long-term protection of Maine's \n     outstanding natural resources.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Whitney Hatch,\n     Regional Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The Pacific Forrest Trust (PFT) \n     strongly supports your proposed legislation, which will \n     encourage and facilitate the preservation of our nation's \n     privately owned forestlands. Your amendment to the Forest \n     Legacy Program will increase the flexibility of states in the \n     administration of the Program, which will, in turn, lead to \n     greater preservation of private forestland.\n       For over ten years, PFT, a non-profit organization, has \n     worked to preserve, restore and enhance the privately owned \n     productive forestlands in the United States. We currently \n     hold roughly 35,000 acres under easement and have been \n     instrumental in ensuring the preservation of private land \n     valued at over $115,000,000. We have provided oral and \n     written testimony to Congress regarding proposed policies to \n     protect and enhance our private forestlands and have written \n     extensively on this issue.\n       The legislation is critical to the preservation of private \n     forestlands throughout the\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\n     United States. Between 1982 and 1997, the United States lost \n     over 20 million acres of private forestlands to other uses. \n     States as diverse as California and Georgia have lost over \n     60,000 acres annually to development alone. Similar \n     statistics are reflected among privately owned forestland in \n     other areas of the United States, especially in the most \n     productive timber areas.\n       The amendment to the Forest Legacy Program will provide \n     states with the option to permit qualified non-profit \n     organizations, such as land trusts, to hold easements that \n     are purchased, in part or in whole, with Forest Legacy funds. \n     Currently, land trusts may only hold easements through Forest \n     Legacy if such easements are donated. Thus, this amendment \n     will give states the opportunity and flexibility to expand \n     their pool of landowners participating in the Program and as \n     a result, protect more private forestlands.\n       While many landowners acknowledge the need to preserve \n     their forestlands, they are not comfortable having a \n     governmental agency own a partial interest in their property, \n     which is the current requirement of the Program where the \n     easements are purchased. This amendment enables landowners to \n     work with a private, voluntary qualified land trust \n     organization at the option of the state. At the same time, \n     states retain full decision-making control over the selection \n     of Forest Legacy projects.\n       Furthermore, this legislation will provide essential \n     flexibility for states to work with partner organizations \n     that can often leverage additional funding into Forest Legacy \n     projects. It will open the door so that many more landowners \n     can participate in the Program nationwide and therefore, will \n     expand the opportunity to reverse the trend of forestland \n     loss.\n       Thank you for your continued leadership in private \n     forestland conservation. This is necessary and timely \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Laurie A. Wayburn,\n                              President, The Pacific Forest Trust.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 1209. A bill to provide for the acquisition of property in \nWashington County, Utah, for implementation of a desert tortoise \nhabitat conservation plan; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which will \nbring to a close the Federal acquisition of an important piece of \nprivately held land, located within the federally designated desert \ntortoise reserve in Washington County, UT.\n  As some of my colleagues are aware, this is not the first time \nlegislation has been introduced in an attempt to resolve this issue. In \nJuly of 2000, I introduced S. 2873, which was referred to and reported \nfavorably by the Senate committee on Energy and Natural Resources. In \naddition, similar legislation was twice approved by the other body, \nboth in the 106th and 107th Congresses. Nevertheless, we have been \nunable to bring this issue to resolution in the full Senate. For nearly \na decade, the private property addressed by this bill has been under \nFederal control during which time the Federal Government has been \nenjoying the benefits of the private property without compensating the \nlandowner. It is my hope that the time has come to finally resolve this \nissue.\n  In March of 1991, the desert tortoise was listed as an endangered \nspecies under the Endangered Species Act. Government and environmental \nresearchers determined that the land immediately north of St. George, \nUT, was prime desert tortoise habitat. Consequently, in February 1996, \nnearly five years after the listing, the United States Fish and \nWildlife Service, USFWS, issued Washington County a section 10 permit \nunder the Endangered Species Act which paved the way for the adoption \nof a habitat conservation plan, HCP, and an implementation agreement. \nUnder the plan and agreement, the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, \ncommitted to acquire all private lands in the designated habitat area \nfor the formation of the Red Cliffs Reserve for the protection of the \ndessert tortoise.\n  One of the private land owners within the reserve is Environmental \nLand Technology, Limited, ELT, which had begun acquiring lands from the \nState of Utah in 1981 for purposes of residential and recreational \ndevelopment several years prior to the listing of the species. \nMoreover, in the years preceding the listing of the desert tortoise and \nthe adoption of the habitat conservation plan, ELT completed \nappraisals, cost estimates, engineering studies, site plans, surveys, \nutility layouts, and right-of-way negotiations. They staked out golf \ncourses, and obtained water rights for the development of this land. \nPrior to the adoption of the HCP, it was not clear which lands the \nFederal and local governments would set aside for the desert tortoise, \nalthough it was assumed that there were sufficient surrounding Federal \nlands to provide adequate habitat. However, when the HCP was adopted in \n1996, the decision was made to include ELT's lands within the \nboundaries of the reserve primarily because of the high concentrations \nof tortoises. The tortoises on ELT land also appeared to be one of, if \nnot the only population without an upper respiratory disease that \nafflicted all of the other populations. As a consequence of the \ninclusion of the ELT lands, the development efforts were halted.\n  With assurances from the Federal Government that the acquisition of \nthe ELT development lands was a high priority, the owner negotiated \nwith, and entered into, an assembled land exchange agreement with the \nBLM in anticipation of intrastate land exchanges. The private land \nowner then began a costly process of identifying comparable federal \nlands within the state that would be suitable for an exchange for his \nlands in Washington County. Over the last seven years, BLM and the \nprivate land owners, including ELT, have completed several exchanges, \nand the Federal Government has acquired, through those exchanges or \ndirect purchases, nearly all of the private property located within the \nreserve, except for approximately 1,516 acres of the ELT development \nland. However, with the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nNational Monument in September 1996, and the subsequent land exchanges \nbetween the state of Utah and the Federal Government to consolidate \nfederal lands within that monument, there are no longer sufficient \ncomparable federal lands within Utah to complete the originally \ncontemplated intrastate exchanges for the remainder of the ELT land.\n\n  Faced with this problem, and in light of the high priority the \nDepartment of the Interior has placed on acquiring these lands, BLM \nofficials recommended that the ELT lands be acquired by direct \npurchase: During the FY 2000 budget process, BLM proposed that $30 \nmillion be set aside to begin acquiring the remaining lands in \nWashington County. Unfortunately, because this project involves \nendangered species habitat and the USFWS is responsible for \nadministering activities under the Endangered Species Act, the Office \nof Management and Budget shifted the $30 million from the BLM budget \nrequest to the USFWS's Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund \nbudget request. Ultimately, however, none of those funds were made \navailable for BLM acquisitions within the Federal section of the \nreserve. Instead, the funds in that account were made available on a \nmatching basis for the use of individual states to acquire wildlife \nhabitat. The result of this bureaucratic fumbling has resulted in \nextreme financial hardship for ELT.\n  The lands within the Red Cliffs Reserve are ELT's main asset. The \nestablishment of the Washington County HCP has effectively taken this \nproperty and prevented ELT from developing or otherwise disposing of \nthe property. ELT has been brought to the brink of financial ruin as it \nhas exhausted its resources in an effort to hold the property while \nawaiting the compensation to which it is entitled. ELT has had to sell \nits remaining assets, and the private land owner has also had to sell \nassets, including his home, to simply hold the property. This has \nbecome a financial crisis for the landowner. It is simply wrong for the \nFederal Government to expect the landowner to continue to bear the cost \nof the government's efforts to provide habitat for an endangered \nspecies. That is the responsibility of the Federal Government. \nMoreover, while the landowner is bearing these costs, he continues to \npay taxes on the property. This situation is made more egregious by the \nfailure of the Department of the Interior to request any acquisition \nfunding for FY 2004, even though this acquisition has been designated a \nhigh priority by the agency. Over the past several years, ELT has \npursued all possible avenues to complete the acquisition of these \nlands. The private land owner has spent millions of dollars pursuing \nboth intrastate and interstate land exchanges and has worked \ncooperatively with the Department of the Interior. Unfortunately, all \nof these efforts have thus far been fruitless.\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\n  The bill that I am introducing today will finally bring this \nacquisition to a close. In my view, a legislative taking should be an \naction of last resort. But, if ever a case warranted legislative \ncondemnation, this is it. This bill will transfer all right, title, and \ninterest in the ELT development property within the Red Cliffs Reserve, \nincluding an additional 34 acres of landlocked real property owned by \nELT adjacent to the land within the reserve, to the federal government. \nIt provides an initial payment to ELT to pay off existing debts accrued \nin holding the property, and provides 90 days during which ELT and the \nDepartment of the Interior can attempt to reach a negotiated settlement \non the remaining value of the property. I am aware that one of the \ndifficulties in solving this issue is the high value of the lands to be \nacquired. Due to the absence of comparable lands within the state for \nexchange, the legislation also authorizes an interstate land exchange \nas a means of acquiring the property. In the absence of a negotiated \namount, the Secretary of the Interior will be required to bring an \naction in the Federal District Court for the District of Utah to \ndetermine a value for the land. Payment for the land, whether \nnegotiated or determined by the court, will be made from the permanent \njudgment appropriation or any other appropriate account, or, at the \noption of the land owner, the Secretary of the Interior will credit a \nsurplus property account, established and maintained by the General \nServices Administration, which the land owner can then use to bid on \nsurplus government property.\n  Unfortunately, when this bill has been introduced in the past, there \nhas been occasional misunderstanding regarding the inclusion of the \nbill's reference to section 309(f) of Public Law 104-333, which \nrequires all Federal appraisals and acquisitions of land within \nWashington County to be conducted ``without regard'' to the presence of \nan endangered species. This references does not create a new appraisal \nstandard but rather restates the existing standard for all Federal land \nacquisition in Washington County, UT. Since its enactment, and without \nexception, the Department of the Interior has applied this standard to \nall its acquisitions in the county. This language was originally \nadopted to allay concerns that local landowners would not receive fair \ncompensation for their property which was being acquired for government \npurposes. Some have supposed the inclusion of this language would \nconstitute preferential treatment. To the contrary, the absence of this \nlanguage would unfairly treat this landowner differently than every \nother landowner in the reserve whose land has thus far been acquired by \nthe Federal Government. Moreover, its omission at this point would \nlikely lead the Justice Department to argue that Congress did not \nintend for this statutory standard to apply.\n  The bill includes language to allow, as part of the legislative \ntaking, for the landowner to recover reasonable costs, interest, and \ndamages. It is important to understand that while Federal acquisitions \nshould be completed on the basis of fair market value, when the Federal \nGovernment makes the commitment to acquire private land, the landowner \nshould not have to be driven into financial ruin while waiting upon the \nfederal government to discharge its obligation. While the Federal \nGovernment has never disputed its obligation to acquire the property, \nit has had the benefit of the private land for all these years without \nhaving to pay for it. The private landowner should not have to bear the \ncosts of this Federal foot-dragging.\n  This legislation is consistent with the high priority the Department \nof the Interior has repeatedly placed on this land acquisition, and is \na necessary final step towards an equitable resolution. The time for \npursuing other options has long since expired and it is unfortunate \nthat it requires legislation action. Without commenting on the \nEndangered Species Act itself, it would seem that if it is the \ngovernment's objective to provide habitat for the benefit of an \nendangered species, then the government ought to bear the costs, rather \nthan forcing them upon the landowner. It is also time to address this \nissue so that the Federal agencies may be single minded in their \nefforts to recover the desert tortoise which remains the aim of the \ncreation of the reserve. It is time to right this wrong and get on with \nthe efforts to recover the species and I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the timely enactment of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 1210. A bill to assist in the conservation of marine turtles and \nthe nesting habitats of marine turtles in foreign countries; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the ``Marine \nTurtle Conservation Act of 2003''.\n  Marine turtles were once abundant, but now they are in serious \ntrouble. Six of the seven recognized species are listed as threatened \nor endangered under the Endangered Species Act, and all seven species \nhave been included in Appendix I of the Convention on International \nTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, CITES. Because \nmarine turtles are long-lived, late-maturing, and highly migratory, \nthey are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of human exploitation \nand habitat loss. In addition, for some species, illegal trade \nseriously threatens wild populations. Because of the immense challenges \nfacing marine turtles, the resources available to date have not been \nsufficient to cope with the continued loss of nesting habitat due to \nhuman activities and the resulting diminution of marine turtle \npopulations.\n  The Marine Turtle Conservation Act of 2003 is modeled after the \nsuccessful Asian Elephant Conservation Act, the African Elephant \nConservation Act, and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. These \nacts have established programs within the Department of the Interior to \nassist in the conservation and preservation of these species around the \nworld. More than 300 projects have been funded and generated millions \nof dollars in private matching funds from sponsors representing a \ndiverse group of conservation organizations. The projects range from \npurchasing anti-poaching equipment for wildlife rangers to implementing \nelephant conservation plans to aerial monitoring of the Northern white \nrhinoceros.\n  The Marine Turtle Conservation Act of 2003 will assist in the \nrecovery and protection of marine turtles by supporting and providing \nfinancial resources for projects to conserve nesting habitats of marine \nturtles in foreign countries and marine turtles while they are found in \nsuch habitats, to prevent illegal trade in marine turtle parts and \nproducts, and to address other threats to the survival of marine \nturtles. The bill authorizes $5 million annually to implement the \nprogram.\n  This legislation will help to preserve this ancient and distinctive \npart of the world's biological diversity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Marine Turtle Conservation \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) marine turtle populations have declined to the point \n     that the long-term survival of the loggerhead, green, \n     hawksbill, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley, and leatherback \n     turtle in the wild is in serious jeopardy;\n       (2) 6 of the 7 recognized species of marine turtles are \n     listed as threatened or endangered species under the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and \n     all 7 species have been included in Appendix I of CITES;\n       (3) because marine turtles are long-lived, late-maturing, \n     and highly migratory, marine turtles are particularly \n     vulnerable to the impacts of human exploitation and habitat \n     loss;\n       (4) illegal international trade seriously threatens wild \n     populations of some marine turtle species, particularly the \n     hawksbill turtle;\n       (5) the challenges facing marine turtles are immense, and \n     the resources available have not been sufficient to cope with \n     the continued loss of nesting habitats caused by human \n     activities and the consequent diminution of marine turtle \n     populations;\n       (6) because marine turtles are flagship species for the \n     ecosystems in which marine turtles are found, sustaining \n     healthy populations of marine turtles provides benefits to \n     many other species of wildlife, including many other \n     threatened or endangered species;\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\n       (7) marine turtles are important components of the \n     ecosystems that they inhabit, and studies of wild populations \n     of marine turtles have provided important biological \n     insights;\n       (8) changes in marine turtle populations are most reliably \n     indicated by changes in the numbers of nests and nesting \n     females; and\n       (9) the reduction, removal, or other effective addressing \n     of the threats to the long-term viability of populations of \n     marine turtles will require the joint commitment and effort \n     of--\n       (A) countries that have within their boundaries marine \n     turtle nesting habitats; and\n       (B) persons with expertise in the conservation of marine \n     turtles.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assist in the \n     conservation of marine turtles and the nesting habitats of \n     marine turtles in foreign countries by supporting and \n     providing financial resources for projects to conserve the \n     nesting habitats, conserve marine turtles in those habitats, \n     and address other threats to the survival of marine turtles.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to further the purposes of title XVI of the \nReclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992, the \n``Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act'', by \ndirecting the Secretary of the Interior to undertake a demonstration \nprogram for water reclamation in the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, in the United States, especially when \nyou live in the eastern United States, you take water and the \navailability of water for granted. Probably the only thing that is ever \nthought about is: Do we have a big enough reservoir? Or are those \naqueducts getting too old that feed New York and northeastern America?\n  But I am here to suggest there are parts of these great United States \nwhere there is a huge shortage of the kind of water we need day by day \nfor our daily activities: to drink, to use for our families, and for \nthe everyday use of our people.\n  First, I show you a little chart with blue and white areas on it. All \nof the blue areas on this chart of the United States, believe it or \nnot, are areas in these United States where saline--that is, salty--\naquifers exist; that is, salty water either in large ponds or \nunderground in large pools.\n  So while we are running out of water, at the same time we have been \nblessed in that we have plenty of water available if we do something \nabout it. And I propose that we do something about it. I have a bill \nthat I hope will do something about it.\n  This second chart shows what would be a proposed Tularosa Basin \ndesalination facility. I show it because this is not a new concept. As \na matter of fact, this Tularosa Basin is a huge underground water basin \nin New Mexico. Much of it is very salty, large quantities are not so \nsalty, and then large quantities are of minor salt content.\n  The legislation I am introducing is to try to make a leap of \ntechnology for it directs the Secretary of the Interior to undertake at \nthis program, for lack of a better way to do it, what we call a \ndemonstration program, but it would be one that would be easily adopted \nanywhere. We ask that it have a capability of 100,000 gallons so that \nthe research would not be carried out at an academic level but really \nusable.\n  The Secretary is supposed to work with the greatest laboratories in \nthe Nation that have access in this regard to develop new desalination \ntechnology and a plan. The facility should be completed within 3 years. \nThe water from this facility will be disposed of to communities in and \naround this basin and in and around the county of Otero. We authorize \nthe money necessary for it. I have a detailed statement indicating why \nwe are doing this along with the bill and an extra bill which goes to \nthe desk, one for reference and one for retention.\n  I am quite confident that a new method of desalination beyond that \none that we all hear about is going to be forthcoming. I believe one of \nthe laboratories--probably Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, \nbut not certain, but probably--will make the breakthrough so that we \nwill not be using the old system that we might have been trying for as \nlong now as the occupant of the chair is of age. I even remember that \nsystem being used when I first came to the Senate. We were \nexperimenting with it in the city of Roswell under a Government \nprogram, and we stopped the program because it was too farfetched.\n  We have come a long way. Just as we have serious problems cleaning \nwater of other pollutants, and we have old-fashioned ways of doing it, \nvery modern technology is being applied. As an example, we all know \nthere is a big problem in some parts of America where arsenic which is \nfound in the normal topography, normal ground of the surrounding area \nand has been consumed by whoever lived there for years with no harm--we \nare going to have to remove it now to some very minuscule content per \nthousand gallons. In order to do that the old-fashioned way, the costs \nare enormous. But believe it or not, because of science, we might be \nable to do that job--albeit some of it should not have to be done at \nall--for a tenth of the cost.\n  We are hopeful that same new breed of technology will apply to taking \nsalt out of inland water or ocean water.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I rise today to introduce a bill that has \nthe potential to supply vast quantities of water to a thirsty New \nMexico and a number of Western States. New Mexico and the West face a \ncritical lack of water, but through the program contained in my bill, \nthe faucets could be ready to flow.\n  Most Western States already have large quantities of water. However, \nthe water contains such high levels of salt that it is simply unusable. \nMy bill proposes to turn untapped resource into potable water that \ncities, towns, farmers, industry, and nature can use to meet their \nneeds. This bill provides the opportunity for use to utilize brand new \ntechnology that may save the West.\n  This piece of legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to \nundertake a desalination demonstration program in the Tularosa Basin \nlocated in southern New Mexico. Additionally, it requires collaboration \nbetween the Bureau of Reclamation, an established leader in \ndesalination research and development, and the Department of Energy. \nOur national laboratories are at the forefront of science in many areas \nincluding water technology. The collaboration between these two \ndepartments would bring together the best minds and the most \nexperienced technicians. This bill would further task the Bureau of \nReclamation and the Department of Energy with evaluating current \ntechnology, advising on how to proceed with additional research, \ndeveloping a research plan and confirming project and operation costs \nin a real-world application. Finally, the bill authorizes the building \nof a facility where advances in technology could be tested.\n  The bill authorizes appropriations of $1.5 million for development of \na desalination technology plan which will utilize the experiences of \npresent facilities and programs to build the facility and guide its \nresearch. It further authorizes $30 million to construct the \ndesalination facility, $6 million for each of fiscal years 2004 through \n2010 for research programs at Sandia National Lab associated with the \nfacility, and $10 million for each of the fiscal years 2004 through \n2010 for research and development of desalination technologies.\n  Only 3 percent of the world's water is fresh and much of that is \nstored in the ice that caps the Earth's poles. We must develop the \ntechnology to economically utilize the rest of that water. Today, most \nof the world's desalination plants are applied to sea water. As I \nstates before, much of the west and, indeed, the Nation, sits on saline \naquifers. The facility I propose will develop and test the technologies \nto best access and utilize this inland water.\n  Currently, Sandia National Lab and the Department of the Interior are \nlooking for optimum sites to locate the facility and are developing a \nfeasibility study for the program. The sites are all in or around the \ncity of Alamogordo, NM. The designers envision a 13,000 square foot \nfacility that can process up\n\n[[Page S7550]]\n\nto 100,000 gallons of water per day. It will draw researchers from \naround the country and play an essential role in alleviating the \npressures on our water resources.\n  Mr. President, let me also say that I have a broader vision for what \ncan be accomplished with desalination. This is only the first step. \nThis is a serious issue, not only for New Mexico, but the world. More \nthan half the world's population will face severe water shortages in \nthe next 50 years. We must get started on this problem.\n  I have no doubt that this legislation will help to push forward the \nstate of the art to ensure that we have access to the most precious of \nresources. Let's take the first step.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1211\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       Sec. 1.

The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has submitted \nthis proposed legislation to the President of the Senate by letter \ndated May 12, 2003.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all Administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.

Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are transmitting a draft bill, ``To \n     amend title 38, United States Code, to improve benefits for \n     Filipino veterans of World War II and survivors of such \n     veterans, and for other purposes.'' We request that it be \n     referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n       The draft bill would extend health care benefits to certain \n     Filipino veterans residing legally in the United States. It \n     would also eliminate an inequity in statutory payment rates \n     between Filipino veterans and their survivors who legally \n     reside in the United States and other veterans and their \n     survivors living in the United States.\n       More specifically, section 2 of the draft bill would amend \n     38 U.S.C. Sec. 1734 to require the Secretary, within the \n     limits of Department facilities, to provide hospitals and \n     nursing home care and medical services to Commonwealth Army \n     veterans and to new Philippine Scouts in the same manner as \n     provided under section 1710, if such individuals reside \n     legally in the United States. Currently, both Commonwealth \n     Army veterans and new Philippine Scouts are eligible for \n     treatment of service-connected disabilities within the limit \n     of Department facilities. However, Commonwealth Army veterans \n     are also eligible for treatment of non service-connected \n     disabilities in the same manner as a veteran, if they are in \n     receipt of certain compensation and reside legally in the \n     United States. The proposal would extend to new Philippine \n     Scouts who reside legally in the United States the same \n     eligibility for medical care and services of non service-\n     connected disabilities that currently exists for Commonwealth \n     Army veterans, while eliminating the receipt-of-compensation \n     requirement for these veterans and scouts. It would also \n     apply the facilities-resources limitation to all care \n     furnished under this section. The Department estimates that \n     costs associated with enactment of this proposal would be \n     $16,228,000 for Fiscal Year 2004. The projected costs would \n     be $73,678,000 over a five-year period, and $130,265,000 over \n     a ten-year period. The Department will offset the \n     discretionary costs of this proposal with available de-\n     obligations of prior year Medical Care Collection Fund \n     balances.\n       Section 3 of the draft bill would, in the case of \n     compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation \n     (``DIC'') paid by reason of service in the new Philippine \n     Scouts, and in the case of DIC paid by reason of service \n     in the organized military forces of the Government of the \n     Commonwealth of the Philippines, including organized \n     guerilla units, remove the current $0.50 on-the-dollar \n     limitation if the individual to whom the benefits are \n     payable resides in the United States and is either a \n     citizens of the United States or an alien lawfully \n     admitted for permanent residence in the United States. The \n     amendments made by section 3 would take effect on the date \n     of enactment of the Act and apply to benefits paid for \n     months beginning after that date.\n       Section 107(a) of title 38, United States Code, generally \n     provides that service before July 1, 1946, in the organized \n     military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the \n     Philippines, including organized guerilla units, may in some \n     circumstances be a basis for entitlement to disability \n     compensation, DIC, monetary burial benefits, and certain \n     other benefits under title 38, United States Code, but that \n     payment of such benefits will be at the rate of $0.50 for \n     each collar authorized. Similarly, 38 U.S.C. Sec. 107(b) \n     generally provides that service in the Philippine Scouts \n     under section 14 of the Armed Forces Voluntary Recruitment \n     Act of 1945, i.e., service in the new Philippine Scouts, may \n     be a basis for entitlement to disability compensation, DIC, \n     and certain other benefits under title 38, United States \n     Code, but that payment of such benefits will be at the rate \n     of $0.50 for each dollar authorized.\n       These limitations on benefit payments to certain Filipino \n     beneficiaries were intended to reflect the differing economic \n     conditions in the Philippines and the United States. These \n     limitations were not made contingent, in any respect, on the \n     place of residence of the beneficiary, although, when the \n     limitations were established, the great majority of affected \n     individuals resided in the Philippines. Through the years, \n     numerous Filipino veterans and their dependents and survivors \n     have immigrated to this country, and many have become \n     permanent residents or citizens. It became evident that the \n     policy considerations underlying the restrictions on payment \n     of compensation and DIC to the affected individuals are no \n     longer relevant in the case of those who reside in the United \n     States. VA realized that Filipino beneficiaries residing in \n     the United States face living expenses comparable to United \n     States veterans and that limiting the payment of these \n     subsistence benefits to these individuals based on policy \n     considerations applicable to Philippine residents is not only \n     inequitable, but may result in undue hardships to these \n     beneficiaries.\n       Section 501(a) of Public Law 106-377, enacted in October \n     2000, added subsection (c) to section 107, providing that, in \n     the case of disability compensation paid by reason of service \n     in the organized military forces of the Government of the \n     commonwealth of the Philippines, including organized guerilla \n     forces, the $0.50 on-the-dollar limitation would not apply \n     if the individual to whom the benefits are payable resides \n     in the United States and is either a citizen of the United \n     States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent \n     residence. However, the statute left unchanged the $0.50 \n     on-the-dollar limitation on the payment of DIC for all \n     Filipino veterans and compensation for new Philippine \n     Scouts regardless of the recipient's place of residence.\n       In the case of those Filipino veterans and their dependents \n     and survivors who reside in the United States and therefore \n     face living expenses comparable to United States veterans and \n     their dependents and survivors, limiting the payment of \n     subsistence benefits based on policy considerations \n     applicable to Philippine residents is inequitable and may \n     result in undue hardships to those beneficiaries. A change in \n     law such as that provided in Public Law 106-377 is justified \n     in the case of compensation and DIC payable to United States \n     residents based on service in the new Philippine Scouts and \n     DIC payable to United States residents based on service in \n     the Philippine Commonwealth Army, including organized \n     guerilla units. Thus, we propose that the $0.50-on-the-dollar \n     limitation contained in section 107 be eliminated in the case \n     of disability compensation and DIC payments to all Filipino \n     veterans and their survivors who legally reside in the United \n     States.\n       We estimate that section 3, if enacted, would increase \n     benefit costs by $2.9 million in the first year and $45.6 \n     million cumulatively for ten years. VA has determined that \n     general-operating-expense costs for this proposal would be \n     insignificant. This provision was included in the FY 2004 \n     Budget.\n       Section 4 of the draft bill would extend until December 31, \n     2008, the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 315(b) to operate a regional office in \n     the Republic of the Philippines. Under current law, that \n     authority will expire on December 31, 2003. Congress has \n     periodically extended this authority, most recently in Public \n     Law 106-117.\n       Were VA to close the Manila regional office, veterans' \n     assistance activities would\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\n     still be needed in the Philippines. A Federal Benefits Unit \n     would have to be attached to the Department of State. Under \n     such an arrangement, VA's control of costs and quality of \n     service would be limited. Because a Federal Benefits Unit \n     would assume responsibility only for disseminating \n     information and assistance, but not processing benefits, \n     there could be no assurance that the extensive fraud-\n     preventive activities currently performed by the Manila \n     regional office would continue. This provision was included \n     in the FY 2004 Budget.\n       Section 5 of the draft bill would extend eligibility for \n     national cemetery burial to new Philippine Scouts who \n     lawfully reside in the United States. This section would also \n     extend eligibility for other in-kind burial benefits and \n     monetary burial benefits to new Philippine Scouts lawfully \n     residing in the United states on the same basis as such \n     benefits are provided under current law to persons who served \n     in the organized military forces of the Government of the \n     Commonwealth of the Philippines, including organized \n     guerrilla units (Commonwealth Army veterans).\n       Under current 38 U.S.C. Sec. 107, Commonwealth Army \n     veterans who lawfully reside in the United States are \n     eligible for national cemetery burial and are eligible for \n     monetary burial benefits at the full-dollar rate if at the \n     time of death they are receiving VA disability compensation \n     or would have been receiving VA pension but for their lack of \n     qualifying service. Section 5 would extend these benefits to \n     new Philippine Scouts who live in the United States. We \n     believe provision of these same benefits to new Philippine \n     Scouts who reside in the United States is equitable because \n     the service of new Philippine Scouts is also worthy of \n     recognition and new Philippine Scouts living in the Unites \n     States face the same cost of living as other Filipino \n     veterans who live in the United States. Enactment of this \n     provision is consistent with VA's goal of achieving parity in \n     the provision of veterans' benefits among similarly situated \n     Filipino beneficiaries.\n       We estimate the cost associated with national-cemetery-\n     burial eligibility for new Philippine Scouts would be $3,600 \n     for one year, $16,700 for five years, and $35,300 for ten \n     years. We estimate the costs of providing full-rate monetary \n     burial benefits to new Philippine Scouts lawfully residing in \n     the United States on the same basis as these benefits are \n     provided to Commonwealth Army veterans would be $4,000 for \n     one year, $16,000 for five years, and $32,000 for ten years.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the transmission of this bill and that its \n     enactment would be in accord with the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Anthony J. Principi,\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                               Section 1\n\n       Section 1(a) of the draft bill would provide that the short \n     title of this Act be the ``Filipino Veterans' Benefits Act of \n     2003''.\n       Section 1(b) would provide that amendments or repeals in \n     this Act be considered references to a section or other \n     provision of title 38, United States Code.\n\n\n                               Section 2\n\n       Section 2 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1734 to require the \n     Secretary, within the limits of Department facilities, to \n     provide hospital and nursing home care and medical services \n     to Commonwealth Army veterans and to new Philippine Scouts in \n     the same manner as provided under section 1710, if such \n     individuals reside legally in the United States. Currently, \n     both Commonwealth Army veterans and new Philippine Scouts are \n     eligible for treatment of service-connected disabilities \n     within the limits of Department facilities. However, \n     Commonwealth Army veterans are also eligible for treatment of \n     non service-connected disabilities in the same manner as a \n     veteran if they are in receipt of certain compensation and \n     reside legally in the United States. The proposal would \n     extend to new Philippine Scouts who reside legally in the \n     United States the same eligibility for medical care and \n     services that currently exists for Commonwealth Army \n     veterans, while eliminating the receipt of compensation \n     requirements for the veterans and scouts. It would also apply \n     the facilities-resources limitation to all care furnished \n     under this section. The Department estimates that costs \n     associated with enactment of this proposal would be \n     $16,228,000 for Fiscal Year 2004. The projected costs would \n     be $73,678,000 over a five-year period, and $130,265,000 over \n     a ten-year period.\n\n\n                               Section 3\n\n       Section 3 would, in the case of compensation and dependency \n     and indemnity compensation (``DIC'') paid by reason of \n     service in the new Philippine Scouts, and in the case of DIC \n     paid by reason of service in the organized military forces of \n     the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, \n     including organized guerrilla units, remove the current $0.50 \n     on-the-dollar limitation if the individual to whom the \n     benefits are payable resides in the United States and is \n     either a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully \n     admitted for permanent residence in the United States. These \n     amendments would take effect on the date of enactment of the \n     Act and apply to benefits paid for months beginning after \n     that date. This provision was included in the FY 2004 Budget.\n\n\n                               Section 4\n\n       Section 4 would extend until December 31, 2008, the \n     authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 315(b) to operate a regional office in the \n     Republic of the Philippines. This provision was included in \n     the FY 2004 Budget.\n\n\n                               section 5\n\n       Section 5(a) would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 107 to extend \n     eligibility for national cemetery burial to new Philippine \n     Scouts who lawfully reside in the United States and to extend \n     eligibility for other in-kind burial benefits and monetary \n     burial benefits to new Philippine Scouts who lawfully reside \n     in the United States on the same basis as such benefits are \n     provided under current law to Commonwealth Army veterans. \n     Section 5(b) makes a conforming amendment to section 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2402(8), which authorizes national cemetery \n     burial for certain Filipino veterans. Section 5(c) provides \n     that the amendments made by this section shall apply with \n     respect to deaths occurring after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1214. A bill to provide a partially refundable tax credit for \ncaregiving related expenses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to introduce the Family \nCaregiver Relief Act of 2003--my legislation to help those who face the \ncrushing consequences of caring for a chronically ill family member. \nWhile we stand up for America, we must also stand up for what America \nstands for. That means strengthening the safety net for those who need \nit most. That means standing up for American families.\n  Families are hurting. The economy is weak. Many are holding down two \njobs to make ends meet, going into debt to put kids through college, or \nfinding and paying for health insurance.\n  Some families are facing extraordinary challenges. They are caring \nfor a loved one with special needs which could be a child with autism, \nor cerebral palsy, a parent with alzheimer's, or a spouse with multiple \nsclerosis. These families struggle every day to take care of their \nloved ones.\n  I want to give help to those who practice self-help. My bill would \nprovide a tax credit of up to $5,000 for family caregivers. This tax \ncredit would help people pay for prescription drugs, home health care, \nspecialized day care, respite care, transportation to chronic care or \nmedical facilities, specialized therapy, including occupational, \nphysical, or rehabilitational therapy, and other specialized services \nfor children, including day care for children with special needs.\n  Family caregivers face so many stresses--emotional, physical, and \nfinancial stresses of caregiving. They face long days, supporting a \nfamily--while caring for a loved one with a chronic condition. A dad \nmight have to work two jobs to meet the costs of care which places \nstrains on marriage and relationships with other family members.\n  Caregivers also face high costs for medications, home health care, \nadult day care, physical therapy, durable medical equipment like a \nwheelchair, day care for children with special needs, and medical bills \nfrom care with specialists.\n  People who care for chronically ill family must patch together \nwhatever care they can afford. Too often they go into debt, use their \ncollege accounts or their retirement savings or go without the care \ntheir loved ones need.\n  I have heard from families from around Maryland who are facing these \nstrains, who are trying to make ends meet, and who are caring for a \nloved one who is chronically ill or needs assistance with activities of \ndaily living.\n  The Hart family from Baltimore has a 2 year old son named Jackson who \nwas born with severe brain abnormalities. He has the motor skill \ndevelopment of a 4 month old. He has daily seizures, so he needs total, \nround the clock care. The emotional cost of caring for a severely \ndisabled child are incalculable and the financial costs are crushing. \nFor the Harts, the costs include: $650 a month for day care for \nmedically fragile children; $1,400 for a wheel chair; and, $700 for a \nspecial shower chair--since Jackson can't sit up in the bath. My \nproposal would help them meet these costs by providing them with a tax \ncredit of $2,750.\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\n  I know of a a couple in Baltimore where the wife is in the final \nstages of Alzheimers. She was a school teacher and once spoke 5 \nlanguages. Now, she can only say a few words. She needs 24 hour-a-day \ncare which costs almost three thousand dollars a month. Their \nretirement savings are gone though this couple is only in their early \nsixties. My bill would only provide a tax credit of five thousand to \nthis couple. I know that this would help this couple as they face the \nchallenges of her final days.\n  My last example is a woman in Potomac, MD who is caring for her \nhusband who has multiple sclerosis. He can no longer talk, walk, stand \nor feed himself. She works full time to support them and cobbles \ntogether whatever home care she can afford. She is not able to afford \nrespite care to run errands, or take herself to the doctor. This couple \nmade a commitment in sickness or in health.\n  These are just a few examples of the stresses facing thousands of \nAmerican families. One in five Americans has multiple chronic \nconditions. About 26 million people in this country care for a family \nmembers who is chronically ill or disabled.\n  My legislation is supported by groups who see everyday the human cost \nof family caregiving, including: Autism Society of America; Cystic \nFibrosis Foundation; National Organization for Rare Disorders; Easter \nSeals; United Cerebral Palsy Associations; Arc of the United States; \nNational Health Council; National Council on the Aging; Paralyzed \nVeterans of America; Family Voices; National Respite Coalition; \nNational Family Caregivers Association; and National Alliance for \nCaregiving.\n  One of my first milestones in the Senate was the enactment of the \nSpousal Anti-Impoverishment Act to change the cruel rules of Medicaid \nso that families would not have to go bankrupt before Medicaid would \npay for nursing home care for a spouse. Under this law, the spouse \nliving in the community could keep the family home, keep a car, and \nkeep some income each month to live on. This law helped one million \npeople. But this was only a down payment.\n  Not much has been done since then except the National Family \nCaregiver Support Program and long-term care insurance for federal \nemployees. I was proud to sponsor and work on both of these bills on a \nbipartisan basis to get them signed into law.\n  Now it is time to help family caregivers. They are the backbone of \nthe long term care system in this country. They must be a priority in \nthe Federal law books and the tax code.\n  I thank Senators Clinton, Corzine, Sarbanes, Johnson, Lautenberg, \nMurray, Kennedy, Landrieu, Dayton, and Harkin for cosponsoring the \nFamily Caregiver Relief Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1214\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 1217. A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto expand and intensify programs with respect to research and related \nactivities concerning elder falls; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, walking--climbing the stairs--reaching for \nan object or a needed item on a shelf. They're all things we do and \ntake for granted every day. But for many of our nation's elderly, they \nare a constant source of anxiety and apprehension.\n  Anyone who has an elderly parent, relative or friend who lives alone \nknows the concern that is often raised when a phone call placed to them \ngoes unanswered. Our first and immediate reaction is often worry \nbecause we know that for many of our nation's elderly, a fall can \nproduce a very serious injury. As the phone continues to ring we wonder \nif Mom is upstairs and can't hear the phone, or Dad is in his workshop, \nor our friend has just stepped outside to catch a breath of fresh air.\n  We hang up, wait a few minutes and place our call again, often with a \ngreater sense of urgency.\n  This time, our concern becomes worry as we picture our loved one \nsuffering from the effects of a fall, alone, with no one to help them.\n  Then, when the phone is answered, a huge rush of relief overcomes us \nas we realize our fears were misplaced.\n  Would that every story like that have such a happy ending. For too \nmany of our Nation's elderly, however, it sometimes ends tragically as \nbrittle bones and a reduction in our sense of balance becomes a formula \nfor serious injury and a dramatic reduction in one's quality of life.\n  Although the physical healing process after a fall can be long and \ntraumatic, it often pales in comparison to the psychological effects of \na loss of confidence--and therefore activity--of an elderly individual \nwho no longer takes for granted his or her ability to walk and safely \nnavigate their world without assistance or support.\n  Fortunately, there are things that can be done to both reduce the \nnumber of these tragic falls and restore the confidence of our loved \nones in their ability to once again lead a normal life.\n  In an effort to address this issue I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with my distinguished colleague form Maryland, Senator \nMikulski, that would take a multi-faceted approach to solving this \nproblem. The Elder Fall Prevention Act of 2003 will look at every \naspect of this matter, from educating the elderly about how to ``fall-\nproof'' their home, to researching the causes of most falls and trying \nto find ways both to avoid them and to provide better treatment to \nthose who are recovering from them.\n  In today's world, when so many of us are living longer, it is quite \ncommonplace to hear of elderly friends and relatives who have fallen \nand faced the challenge of recovering from a broken bone. Almost all of \nus have had that experience, either with family or friends.\n  What is less well know is that 25 percent of the elderly who sustain \na hip fracture die within one year. On an annual basis, 40,000 people \nover age 65\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\nvisit emergency departments with traumatic brain injuries suffered as a \nresult of a fall; 16,000 of those people are hospitalized, and 4,000 \ndie. By the year 2030, as the baby boomer generation is added to the \nranks of the elderly, the number of people over age 65 will double, \npotentially doubling the current elder fall injury statistics.\n  There are also significant costs associated with such a large volume \nof fall-related injuries among our nation's senior citizens. Direct \ncosts to the Medicaid and Medicare programs alone will exceed an \nestimated $32 billion in the year 2020.\n  The Elder Fall Prevention Act of 2003 takes a three-pronged approach \nto this problem. It will direct the Department of Health and Human \nServices to develop public education on fall prevention for the \nelderly, family members, caregivers, and others involved with the \nelderly. It further calls for an expansion of research on effective \napproaches to fall prevention and treatment. Finally, the Elder Fall \nPrevention Act requires an evaluation of the effect of falls on the \ncosts of Medicare and Medicaid, as well as the potential for reducing \nthose costs through education, prevention and early intervention.\n  A wide variety of groups support this legislation, including the \nNational Safety Council, the Emergency Nurses Association, the Assisted \nLiving Federation of America, the American Geriatrics Society, the \nBrain Injury Association, the American Health Care Association, and \nmany more. All of these groups should and will be partners in this \ncomprehensive effort to address one of the leading causes of death and \ndisability in the elderly.\n  The largest generation in our nation's history is rapidly approaching \nretirement. Passing this bill into law will mean a better quality of \nlife for them and for all our nation's elderly. It will also help us \nreduce the cost of the Medicaid and Medicare programs for all \nAmericans.\n  I am looking forward to working on this bill in Committee and sending \nit on to the Senate floor for a vote. The sooner we act the sooner we \ncan begin to work to prevent falls and help our nation's elderly live \nsafely and in better health.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Enzi in \nintroducing the Elder Fall Prevention Act of 2003. Falls are a serious \npublic health problem that affect millions of seniors each year. This \nbill expands research and education on elder falls to help keep seniors \nsafe and in their own homes longer.\n  The facts are staggering. One out of every three Americans over age \n65 falls every year. In 2000, over 10,200 seniors died and \napproximately 1.6 million seniors visited an emergency department as a \nresult of a fall. Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among \nseniors, accounting for 64,000 traumatic brain injuries and 340,000 hip \nfractures each year. Falls can be financially disastrous for families, \nand falls place a serious financial strain on our health care system. \nBy 2020, senior falls are estimated to cost the health care system more \nthan $32 billion.\n  These facts do not begin to tell the story of what falls can mean for \nseniors and their loved ones. Falls don't discriminate. Kay Graham was \nthe victim of a fall. Many of us have friends or relatives who have \nfallen. A fall can have a devastating impact on a person's physical, \nemotional, and mental health. If an older woman loses her footing on \nher front porch steps, falls, and suffer a hip fracture, she would \nlikely spend about two weeks in the hospital, and there is a 50 percent \nchance that she would not return home or live independently as a result \nof her injuries.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing of the Subcommittee on Aging on the \nproblem of elder falls. The Subcommittee heard testimony from Lillie \nMarie Struchen, a 91-year-old woman who had recently fallen in her \nbathroom when she slipped on the tile. Lillie Marie could not reach the \npanic button in her apartment, and it took her some time before she \ncould get to her feet and call for help. Lille Marie was lucky. She \nrecovered from her fall and returned to her normal routines. She shared \nwith the Subcommittee some steps that she and her family had taken to \nprevent future falls, knowing that she may not be so lucky next time.\n  These falls, like the ones that Lillie Marie and thousands of others \nsuffer from each year, can be prevented. With some help, there are \nsimple ways that seniors can improve the safety of their homes and make \na fall far less likely. Home modifications like hand rails in the \nbathroom, rubber mats on slippery tile floors, and cordless telephones \nthat seniors can keep nearby can make a big difference. Well-trained \npharmacists can review medications to make sure that two drugs do not \ninteract to cause dizziness and throw a senior off balance.\n  That's what this legislation is about--getting behind our Nation's \nseniors and giving help to those who practice self-help. This bill \ncreates public education campaigns for seniors, their families, and \nhealth care providers about how to prevent falls. It expands research \non elder falls to develop better ways to prevent falls and to improve \nthe treatment and rehabilitation of elder falls victims. This \nlegislation also requires an evaluation of the effect of falls on \nMedicare and Medicaid, to look at potentially reducing costs by \nexpanding coverage to include fall-related services.\n  Reducing the number of falls will help seniors live longer, \nhealthier, more independent lives. This bill has the strong support of \nthe National Safety Council and has been supported in the past by over \n30 national and local aging and safety organizations. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Enzi and my colleagues on the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee to get this bill signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7555-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7555-S7556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7555-S7556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-132]                         \n\n \n[Page S7555-S7556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-132]                         \n\n\n[Page S7555-S7556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-132]                         \n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              SENATE RESOLUTION 162--HONORING TRADESWOMEN\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Collins, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kennedy, and \nMs. Cantwell) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 162\n\n       Whereas women worked side by side with men for long shifts \n     under dangerous conditions to rescue individuals, remove \n     debris, and prepare the sites for future use at Ground Zero, \n     the Pentagon, and in the Shanksville, Pennsylvania field \n     after the September 11th terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the number of tradeswoman has risen dramatically \n     over the last 30 years, but remains startlingly low;\n       Whereas while the number of women carpenters has tripled \n     since 1972, they still only represent 1.7 percent of workers \n     in the occupation;\n       Whereas the number of electricians who are female has \n     quadrupled over that same time period, yet women make up only \n     2.7 percent of electricians;\n       Whereas the number of women who are firefighters has \n     increased by 6 fold, yet women account for only 3 percent of \n     all firefighters;\n       Whereas the skilled trades industry is experiencing a \n     significant labor shortage, which will be exacerbated over \n     the next 2 decades as many skilled workers retire;\n       Whereas the United States Department of Labor projects job \n     growth in the skilled trades industry at 12.3 percent through \n     the year 2010;\n       Whereas the National Association of Manufacturers reports a \n     projected need for 10,000,000 new skilled workers by 2020, \n     and the Associated General Contractors predicts a shortage of \n     250,000 skilled workers per year;\n       Whereas the average age of a construction worker is 47;\n       Whereas many women are employed in jobs that pay only a \n     minimum wage and do not provide benefits, such as health \n     insurance;\n       Whereas 59 percent of women earn $8 per hour, and while \n     women constitute 47 percent of the workforce, they make up 60 \n     percent of the working poor;\n       Whereas 44 percent of women are reported to be the sole \n     supporter of themselves or their families;\n       Whereas the majority of women are segregated into 20 out of \n     440 occupations;\n       Whereas women could increase their earnings significantly \n     by obtaining skills that allow them to become tradeswomen, \n     for example a journey level electrician will make over \n     $1,000,000 more than a typical cashier in a 30-year career;\n       Whereas women make up 77 percent of all wait staff who earn \n     $6.55 an hour, on average, and only 5 percent of truck \n     drivers who make an average of $17.50 an hour; and\n       Whereas women need greater access to training and \n     opportunities to participate in skilled trades occupations: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) there should be more attention paid to breaking down \n     the barriers that women face in entering the skilled trades; \n     and\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\n       (2) policymakers, labor unions, and industry leaders should \n     look at different labor pools to address existing and future \n     skills shortages.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 50--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n  THERE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED A NATIONAL TRUCK SAFETY MONTH TO RAISE \n PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND NEEDS \n          OF TRUCK DRIVERS TO MAKE THE NATION'S HIGHWAYS SAFER\n\n  Mr. TALENT submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Con. Res. 51\n\n       Whereas a pioneer in the fight for racial justice, Medgar \n     Wiley Evers, was born July 2, 1925, in Decatur, Mississippi, \n     to James and Jessie Evers;\n       Whereas, to faithfully serve his country, Medgar Evers left \n     high school to join the Army when World War II began and, \n     after coming home to Mississippi, he completed high school, \n     enrolled in Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, \n     presently known as Alcorn State University, and majored in \n     business administration;\n       Whereas, as a student at Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical \n     College, Evers was a member of the debate team, the college \n     choir, and the football and track teams, was the editor of \n     the campus newspaper and the yearbook, and held several \n     student offices, which gained him recognition in Who's Who in \n     American Colleges;\n       Whereas, while a junior at Alcorn Agricultural and \n     Mechanical College, Evers met a freshman named Myrlie \n     Beasley, whom he married on December 24, 1951, and with whom \n     he spent the remainder of his life;\n       Whereas, after Medgar Evers received a bachelor of arts \n     degree, he moved to historic Mound Bayou, Mississippi, became \n     employed by Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company, and soon \n     began establishing local chapters of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People (referred to in this \n     resolution as the ``NAACP'') throughout the Delta region;\n       Whereas, moved by the plight of African-Americans in \n     Mississippi and a desire to change the conditions facing \n     them, in 1954, after the United States Supreme Court ruled \n     school segregation unconstitutional, Medgar Evers became the \n     first known African-American person to apply for admission to \n     the University of Mississippi Law School, but was denied that \n     admission;\n       Whereas, as a result of that denial, Medgar Evers contacted \n     the NAACP to take legal action;\n       Whereas in 1954, Medgar Evers was offered a position as the \n     Mississippi Field Secretary for the NAACP, and he accepted \n     the position, making Myrlie Evers his secretary;\n       Whereas, with his wife by his side, Medgar Evers began a \n     movement to register people to vote in Mississippi and, as a \n     result of his activities, Medgar Evers received numerous \n     threats;\n       Whereas, in spite of the threats, Medgar Evers persisted, \n     with dedication and courage, to organize rallies, build the \n     NAACP's membership, and travel around the country with Myrlie \n     Evers to educate the public;\n       Whereas Medgar Evers' passion for quality education for all \n     children led him to file suit against the Jackson, \n     Mississippi public schools, which gained him national media \n     coverage;\n       Whereas Medgar Evers organized students from Tougaloo and \n     Campbell Colleges, coordinated and led protest marches, \n     organized boycotts of Jackson businesses and sit-ins, and \n     challenged segregated bus seating, and for these heroic \n     efforts, he was arrested, beaten, and jailed;\n       Whereas the violence against Medgar Evers came to a climax \n     on June 12, 1963, when he was shot and killed in front of his \n     home;\n       Whereas, after the fingerprints of an outspoken \n     segregationist were recovered from the scene of the shooting, \n     and 2 juries deadlocked without a conviction in the shooting \n     case, Myrlie Evers and her 3 children moved to Claremont, \n     California, where she enrolled in Pomona College and earned \n     her bachelor's degree in sociology in 1968;\n       Whereas, after Medgar Evers' death, Myrlie Evers began to \n     create her own legacy and emerged as a national catalyst for \n     justice and equality by becoming active in politics, becoming \n     a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus, running \n     for Congress in California's 24th congressional district, \n     serving as Commissioner of Public Works for Los Angeles, \n     using her writing skills to serve as a correspondent for \n     Ladies Home Journal and to cover the Paris Peace Talks, and \n     rising to prominence as Director of Consumer Affairs for the \n     Atlantic Richfield Company;\n       Whereas Myrlie Evers became Myrlie Evers-Williams when she \n     married Walter Williams in 1976;\n       Whereas, in the 1990's, Evers-Williams convinced \n     Mississippi prosecutors to reopen Medgar Evers' murder case, \n     and the reopening of the case led to the conviction and life \n     imprisonment of Medgar Evers' killer;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams became the first female to chair the \n     64-member Board of Directors of the NAACP, to provide \n     guidance to an organization that was dear to Medgar Evers' \n     heart;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams has published her memoirs, entitled \n     ``Watch Me Fly: What I Learned on the Way to Becoming the \n     Women I Was Meant to Be'', to enlighten the world about the \n     struggles that plagued her life as the wife of an activist \n     and empowered her to become a community leader;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams is widely known as a motivational \n     lecturer and continues to speak out against discrimination \n     and injustice;\n       Whereas her latest endeavor has brought her home to \n     Mississippi to make two remarkable contributions, through the \n     establishment of the Evers Collection and the Medgar Evers \n     Institute, which advance the knowledge and cause of social \n     injustice and which encompass the many lessons in the life's \n     work of Medgar Evers and Myrlie Evers-Williams;\n       Whereas Evers-Williams has presented the extraordinary \n     papers in that Collection and Institute to the Mississippi \n     Department of Archives and History, where the papers are \n     being preserved and catalogued; and\n       Whereas it is the policy of Congress to recognize and pay \n     tribute to the lives and accomplishments of extraordinary \n     Mississippians such as Medgar Evers and Myrlie Evers-\n     Williams, whose life sacrifices have contributed to the \n     betterment of the lives of the citizens of Mississippi as \n     well as the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) Congress commends Medgar Wiley Evers and his widow, \n     Myrlie Evers-Williams, and expresses the greatest respect and \n     gratitude of Congress, for their lives and accomplishments;\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) designates the period beginning on June 9, 2003, and \n     ending on June 16, 2003, as the ``Medgar Evers National Week \n     of Remembrance''; and\n       (B) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (3) copies of this resolution shall be furnished to the \n     family of Medgar Wiley Evers and Myrlie Evers-Williams and \n     made available to representatives of the media.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url":

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:30 \na.m. tomorrow, Tuesday, June 10. I further ask consent that following \nthe prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal \nof proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be \nreserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume \nconsideration of S. 14, the Energy bill; provided further that there \nthen be 30 minutes equally divided for debate in relation to the Dorgan \namendment No. 865, with no amendments in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote; further, that following the debate time, the amendment be \nset aside for a vote in relation to the amendment at a time determined \nby the majority leader after consultation with the Democratic leader.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 \np.m. to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party lunches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, as I indicated \nto the majority leader this morning, I have spoken to Senator Daschle, \nand he has tentatively agreed that on Wednesday we would agree to \nhaving a unanimous consent agreement that there would be a finite list \nof amendments that would be put before the Senate at that time. The \nonly thing we have not determined is what time we would do that.\n  So we will continue to work with the majority in helping to move this \nbill. As we have indicated to the majority leader, once we get a finite \nlist of amendments, Senator McConnell and I and the two managers of the \nbill can try to work through them and eliminate some, reminding all \nSenators that a very similar bill was brought through the Senate last \nyear and we disposed of about 125 amendments. We had votes on about 40 \namendments--45. I knew it was around 40. So we hope to do a lot better \nthan that this time; that is, have fewer amendments than we had last \ntime. But it is something on which we are working. And as I have \nindicated now for the second time tonight, we will continue to work \nwith the majority to try to move that legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I say to my friend from Nevada, it \nremains the hope of the majority leader to finish the Energy bill this \nweek because it remains his intention to spend the last 2 weeks before \nthe Fourth of July break on the Medicare prescription drug issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7559-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7559-S7560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7559-S7560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-141]                         \n\n \n[Page S7559-S7560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-141]                         \n\n\n[Page S7559-S7560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-141]                         \n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the information of all Senators, tomorrow morning \nthe Senate will resume consideration of S. 14, the Energy bill. At 9:30 \ntomorrow morning, the Senate will debate the Dorgan amendment related \nto hydrogen. That vote will occur at some point Tuesday morning prior \nto the policy luncheons. It has also been my hope, and the hope of many \nMembers,\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\nas I indicated earlier, that tomorrow morning the Senate could consider \nand pass a bill relating to sanctions against Burma. As I suggested \nearlier, I will be asking the Senate to do that in the morning, and \nhopefully we will have a chance to move forward on that important piece \nof legislation.\n  Tomorrow we will continue to work with our Democratic colleagues to \nclear the Energy bill. Additional amendments are expected throughout \ntomorrow's session; therefore, rollcall votes will occur during \ntomorrow's session. It is also the hope of the bill managers that we \ncan lock in a final list of amendments. Senator Reid referred to that \nearlier. We hope to be able to do that as soon as possible, and we \nencourage all Senators who wish to offer an amendment to contact the \nchairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/09/senate-section/article/S7560-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[Page S7560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-142]                         \n\n \n[Page S7560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-142]                         \n\n\n[Page S7560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n[DOCID:cr09jn03-142]                         \n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
