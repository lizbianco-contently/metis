Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to \nconsideration of S. 2061.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to make a few opening comments on \nthe medical liability bill. Last year we had a debate in the Senate on \nproceeding--not voting on but proceeding--to an overall medical \nliability reform bill. That vote was 49 to 48 in favor of going to the \nbill. Unfortunately, the rules of the Senate provide that one needs 60 \nvotes. Otherwise, a filibuster, as it is commonly referred to, is \ncontinued. You cannot proceed to debating the legislation or to votes \nor amendments.\n  There are currently 19 States, according to the American Medical \nAssociation, that are in crisis. Nineteen States are experiencing some \nkind of crisis with their medical system because of problems with \nmedical liability insurance. All but 5 States of the remaining are \nshowing some problems, the type of problems that have led to those 19 \nStates being in crisis.\n  We had the vote last year and couldn't get it done. Senator Gregg and \nI have introduced the bill before us today, the Healthy Mothers and \nHealthy Babies Access to Medical Care Act. This bill limits the scope \nof reform of the medical liability system to the practice of obstetrics \nand gynecology and the doctors involved in those practices.\n  Using my own State as an example, at the University of Nevada School \nof\n\n[[Page S1468]]\n\nMedicine there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of medical \nstudents deciding to go into obstetrics. This is happening at a time \nwhen Nevada is the fastest growing State in the country. Southern \nNevada--Las Vegas, in particular--is by far the fastest growing \nmetropolitan area in the Nation. Not only are we not adding the OB/GYNs \nwe need, we are actually losing them.\n  The other side will argue that the General Accounting Office did a \nstudy and determined that doctors are not giving up their licenses. \nThey said that doctors are not leaving their States.\n  The problem with what the General Accounting Office did is, they went \nto the State boards and only did a survey of licenses. I was a \npracticing veterinarian and still have a license in veterinary \nmedicine. Once you have a license, you never give it up because you \nnever want to take the exam again. So when the General Accounting \nOffice asked the State board of medical examiners how many doctors have \ngiven up their licenses, and they found out nobody had given up their \nlicenses, that should not surprise anybody because they are not going \nto give them up. That does not mean these doctors are not quitting \npractice in Nevada and other States--Pennsylvania, West Virginia, \nWashington State, Mississippi, and many others around the country. It \nmeans they haven't given up their licenses because they don't want to \ntake the exam again. But they are limiting their practices. And many of \nthem are leaving those States that are affected.\n  Several years ago, California gave us a good model. California is \nright next to my State of Nevada. California passed what is known as \nMICRA. It is a medical liability reform bill. Luckily, they passed it \nback then because the trial lawyers have become so powerful across the \nUnited States that you could never get the same piece of legislation \npassed in California. That would be a shame because it has worked so \nwell. It is the model around which we built the legislation on the \nSenate floor today.\n  In California--Los Angeles, for example--OB/GYN medical liability \ninsurance is somewhere a little over $50,000 a year. In Las Vegas, \nwhere we don't have and haven't had this wonderful MICRA law on the \nbooks, premiums can run anywhere from $110,000 up to $200,000 a year. \nNot only that, they are telling the doctors in Las Vegas, you have to \nlimit the number of deliveries you do, especially if you are practicing \non high-risk deliveries.\n  If you are a woman who has a high-risk pregnancy, you want the best \npossible doctor you can get. Unfortunately, those doctors are having to \nlimit their practice or retire or leave the State because they cannot \nafford medical liability coverage any longer.\n  This is a crisis--a crisis of access to health care for women who \nneed the health care, women who are in search of gynecological services \nor women who are about to deliver babies. The stories--there are many \nof them--are tragic in many circumstances.\n  This is, by the way, only one area of our health care system that is \nin crisis. Trauma is another place, and we are going to address that \nlater this year--emergency rooms. As a matter of fact, the level I \ntrauma center in Las Vegas closed a couple of years ago because the \ndoctors could not afford to practice there because of the liability. \nThere were so many lawsuits--not lawsuits that actually had merit to \nthem; some of them did but most of them did not. Because of the \npotential liability, the doctors said we cannot afford to work here. So \nthe level I trauma center that serves a four-State region had to close. \nThat is the same level I trauma center, for those who followed the \nnational news this last year, where Roy Horn of Siegfried and Roy was \ntreated after the tiger had attacked him. It is an excellent level I \ntrauma center. It saves many lives.\n  We had a press conference last year where a woman whose father was in \nLas Vegas and had an accident while the level I trauma center was \nclosed. He had to be transferred to another hospital, and because of \nthe delay in treating him, we could definitely argue that this man \nwould be alive today if the trauma center had not closed. That trauma \ncenter was only closed for 1 week, and it was closed for that reason. \nThe State of Nevada stepped up; our Governor stepped up and said we \nwill cover that trauma center under the laws of the State of Nevada.\n  What are the laws of the State of Nevada? It has a $50,000 cap of \nliability--total cap. Not $50,000 for pain and suffering but a total \ncap of $50,000. That is not even close to what this bill says. This \nbill has a $250,000 cap on noneconomic, nonmedical damages. You can \nstill get all the economic damages you would have incurred; for \ninstance, loss of income or other types of economic damages. You can \nget all of the medical coverage you would need. It is just that \n$250,000 cap on pain and suffering awards. Those are the awards we have \nseen that are getting outrageous all across America.\n  That level I trauma center, luckily for Roy Horn, was open. Without \nthe type of intense care you can receive in a trauma center, Roy Horn, \nI think it could be argued, would not be with us today.\n  Mr. President, even though we have limited this bill to the practice \nof obstetrics and gynecology, we do have a much bigger problem in this \ncountry, a problem that must be addressed. We are in a political season \ntoday. We know that. It is an election year for the President, the \nSenate, and the House, and there is a lot of politics going on. Some \npeople say: You guys are just doing this with OB/GYNs to make a \npolitical issue out of it.\n  If people want to stand up and say that they don't want to fix the \nproblem happening with access to care for women and children, then I \nguess that is a political issue. I think it is a legitimate political \nissue. People need to know where Senators stand. They need to know \nwhere our Presidential candidates stand on issues of this importance. I \nbelieve that when they find out where candidates stand, whether they \nare incumbents or challengers, this issue will make a difference in \ntheir vote come November.\n  It is that important to our overall quality of life in America. I \nbelieve it is wrong that we have to have people moving, or not moving, \nfrom State to State because they cannot get access to quality care \nbecause the medical liability costs are too high--one reason versus \nanother reason.\n  Some States have enacted good reform. Colorado and California are the \nbest examples. My State enacted a bill, but, unfortunately, it will \ntake several years before we know whether that bill will withstand \nchallenge in the courts. Also, there were two huge loopholes in that \nbill that the trial lawyers were able to get in that you will be able \nto drive a truck through. That is why many in the medical community in \nNevada are trying to close those loopholes.\n  We need enactment at the national level. Sixty percent of all medical \nbills are paid by the Federal Government between Medicare, Medicaid, \nand veterans. It is a national priority. We must get this medical \nliability crisis under control so that our trauma centers are not \nclosing, so that women have access to their OBs, gynecologists, and \nnurse midwives, who are also covered under this bill. They sometimes \nget left out of the discussion, but they are a very important part of \nour health care delivery system in this country and delivering healthy \nbabies.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I know of \nhis personal interest in this issue. He has offered legislation before. \nToday we are considering S. 2061, which has been offered initially by \nSenator Gregg of New Hampshire and Senator Ensign.\n  It is important to note that this bill, which was brought directly to \nthe floor, has not been the subject of any committee hearings. In fact, \nthere has been no effort, to my knowledge, to sit down and find a \nbipartisan compromise or sponsorship for this legislation. This bill \nwas presented to the Senate a few days before we went into recess, and \nnow it is being called this day.\n  What is interesting, as well, is that there are announcements from \nthe Republican leadership that we will quickly move after the vote on \nthis bill to other issues, and they have been enunciated.\n  The point I want to make is this: I don't believe this is a \nconstructive effort that leads us to a solution to a national problem. \nThis, instead, is a bill\n\n[[Page S1469]]\n\nbeing called for one reason only: To get a rollcall. It is a bill being \ncalled today to put Senators on the spot. Vote yes; vote no. Why? \nBecause, frankly, there are some on one side of the issue who want to \ndemonstrate that they are concerned. So they are bringing a bill to the \nfloor. They want a rollcall so they can say to those who are looking \nfor some change and for some legislative progress: See, we moved \nquickly on this. We brought a bill to the floor and, darn it, it didn't \npass. We will try to get to it later in the session.\n  From my point of view, that is not the way to approach this. We \nshould have dealt with this in good faith and constructive, bipartisan \neffort to try to find a solution to a serious national problem. But \nthat is not the case. Instead, we are having a head-on collision \nbetween the trial lawyers on one side and the doctors on the other \nside.\n  I come to this debate as someone who had a little bit of experience \nin this issue a long time ago. Before I was elected to Congress 21 \nyears ago, I was a practicing lawyer. I used to defend doctors who were \nsued for medical malpractice. I did that for 5 or 6 years. I came to \nunderstand the nature of these lawsuits and how complicated and painful \nmany of them are. Then I was on the other side of the table, \nrepresenting patients who went into a doctor's office or a hospital and \nwere injured and they sought compensation because of these injuries. So \nI have seen both sides of the issue. I come to this debate with the \nbelief that we need to bring all of the parties together to find a \nsolution. What we have with this bill, I am afraid, does not come close \nto addressing a serious national issue.\n\n  Mr. President, I see that the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, has \ntaken to the Senate floor. I planned on giving a rather lengthy speech. \nAt this point, I would like to yield the floor to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota and then I can resume after he is finished.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois for his courtesy, and I appreciate very much the leadership he \nhas provided. He has said on many occasions that it is imperative we \naddress this issue in a meaningful, comprehensive way. Senators on both \nsides of the aisle recognize that this situation will not resolve \nitself; that it must be addressed. But like him, I share the concern \nthat the bill before us just doesn't do that.\n  Last year, the Senate was asked to consider a bill that promised to \nreduce insurance premiums for doctors by restricting the legal rights \nof injured patients. That bill was rejected by a strong bipartisan \nmargin in the Senate for one simple reason: It was a sham. It put the \nprofits of insurers ahead of the rights of patients, while offering \ndoctors no real relief whatsoever.\n  Today we are being asked to consider yet another bill that seeks to \nclose the doors of the courthouse to victims of malpractice, this time \nunder the guise of expanding health care access for women and infants.\n  Once again, the Senate should reject this bill for what it is: a \nmaneuver designed to protect nothing but the profits of insurance \ncompanies, HMOs, pharmaceutical companies, and medical device \nmanufacturers.\n  Democrats and Republicans agree that skyrocketing malpractice \ninsurance premiums are a serious challenge. Too many doctors, \nespecially obstetricians and gynecologists, are being forced to pay \nexorbitant premiums because of the arbitrary actuarial formulas of \ninsurance companies. This is a national problem, and it demands our \nattention. But like last year, this bill actually does nothing to help \ndoctors. Despite the claims of the insurance companies, every piece of \navailable evidence shows that capping damages has absolutely no impact \non the cost of malpractice insurance.\n  According to the Medical Liability Monitor in a sampling \nrepresentative of all States with caps on damages, malpractice \ninsurance premiums for OB/GYNs actually increased by as much as 54 \npercent in 2003. In States without caps on damages, OB/GYN premiums \nincreased no more than 14 percent in 2003. Many States without caps saw \nno increases whatsoever.\n  We have a situation, again documented by the Medical Liability \nMonitor, that States with caps saw increases of as much as 54 percent \nlast year. States with no caps saw increases of no more than 14 percent \nlast year.\n  A recent study by the Weiss rating organization found that caps on \nnoneconomic damages failed to result in lower premiums for doctors, \ndespite the fact they did reduce the amount insurers had to pay out to \nvictims. Insurers merely kept the savings for themselves and left \ndoctors to fend for themselves.\n  In the months since we last discussed this issue, the GAO and the CBO \nboth released reports demonstrating that the primary factor driving \ninsurance premiums higher is not malpractice awards, but the insurance \ncompanies' desire to recover their investment losses. After trying to \npass on the cost of their bad investments to doctors, they are now \ntrying to do the same thing by limiting the rights of injured patients.\n  Even the insurance industry admits that caps will not protect doctors \nfrom higher insurance premiums. A press release published on March 13, \n2002, by the American Insurance Association stated:\n\n       Insurers never promised that tort reform would achieve \n     specific premium savings. . . .\n\n  Just last year, Bob White, president of the largest medical \nmalpractice insurer in Florida, stated:\n\n       No responsible insurer can cut its rates after a [medical \n     malpractice tort ``reform''] bill passes.\n\n  Take it from the insurers themselves, no doctor should expect lower \ninsurance rates as a result of this bill, and no woman should expect \ngreater access to health care for themselves or their babies.\n  What women should expect, on the other hand, is a two-tiered legal \nsystem that restricts their rights in the courthouse if they are hurt \nby the negligence of a doctor, HMO, drug company, or medical device \nmanufacturer.\n\n  This bill is unjust. It restricts women's access to the legal system \nwhile preserving it actually for men.\n  Under this bill, if a man shows signs of lung cancer and his illness \nis misdiagnosed due to the negligence of his doctor, he can recover \ndamages to compensate him fully for his injuries. But if a woman with \ncervical cancer suffers the same negligence, her damages will be \narbitrarily capped. If a man is prescribed defective blood pressure \nmedication by an internist, he can recover full damages. But if a woman \nis prescribed blood pressure medication during pregnancy that causes \nblood clots, her damages will be capped.\n  The real problem with this bill is not merely that it values the \ninjuries of men and women differently, as troubling as that is, the \nreal problem is that it presumes that politicians in Washington are \nbetter able to determine how to compensate injured patients.\n  Every year, tens of thousands of women and infants are injured at the \nhands of OB/GYNs.\n  Nine years ago, Colin Gourely of Nebraska suffered complications at \nbirth due to his doctor's negligence. Today, he has cerebral palsy and \nis confined to a wheelchair. In his short life, he has needed five \nsurgeries to correct bone problems and sleeps in a cast every night to \nprevent further orthopedic problems.\n  Shannon Hughes from South Carolina was in the middle of a difficult \nlabor. Despite repeated calls, the doctor wouldn't come until her 35th \nhour of labor. It turned out that the umbilical cord was wrapped around \nher baby's neck cutting off oxygen. Today, Shannon's son, Tyler, is \nseverely brain damaged and bedridden. He requires constant medical care \nand is fed through a tube.\n  When Alexandra Katada was born in McKinney, TX, the doctor stretched \nher spine, destroying her nerves, leaving her partially paralyzed. The \nbaby's elbow was pulled from its socket and broken. She died 8 months \nlater from her spinal injuries.\n  Let us be clear: No amount of money can compensate a parent for their \nchild's pain, but malpractice awards are not simply about money. They \nare about offering victims a sense of justice, a way to hold \naccountable those responsible for their injuries or the death of their \nloved ones.\n  Some have said that without limits, the legal system looks more like \na lottery. But no jury award could ever make the parents of Colin \nGourely or Tyler Hughes or Alexandra Katada feel\n\n[[Page S1470]]\n\nthat they were holding a winning ticket.\n  Malpractice awards are decided by juries and approved by judges. This \nis the same system on which we rely to decide life and death issues in \ncapital cases. Why would we not trust our citizens to fairly evaluate \nhow to deliver justice for the victims of medical malpractice?\n  Democrats are eager to work together with our colleagues to craft a \nreal solution to the problem of rising malpractice premiums. But, once \nagain, rather than working with us to craft a true compromise that \nwould address the problems of increasing insurance premiums, the \nRepublican leadership has decided to bring this bill to the floor with \nthe same level of problems, the same concerns we had 7 months ago.\n  If our colleagues were serious about combating the rising cost of \nmalpractice premiums, they would join us in supporting bipartisan \nlegislation that includes both long-term and short-term solutions that \ndirectly address the rising premiums without harming injured \nAmericans--solutions such as individual tax credits to offset costs \nwhen premiums rise sharply; reasonable limits to punitive damages; \nprohibitions against commercial insurers engaging in activities that \nviolate Federal antitrust laws; sensible ways to reduce medical errors; \nand direct assistance to geographic areas that have a shortage of \nhealth care providers due to dramatic increases in malpractice \npremiums.\n  The Senate faced a similar situation discussing concerns about the \nrising terrorism insurance rates. Some thought then that the only \nsolution was to undo the jury system. Instead, the Senate worked \ntogether and developed a bipartisan solution that fixed the problem and \nbrought down insurance rates dramatically.\n  We should pursue the same model for addressing this problem as well.\n  There is no question that malpractice rates are a serious problem. \nDoctors and patients deserve a real answer. This bill is not it. I urge \nmy colleagues to reject cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota \nbecause I think he has raised an important issue of concern in this \ndebate and that is one I have initiated in my opening remarks. We need \nto have a constructive bipartisan conversation about a serious national \nproblem. Instead, this bill, S. 2061, was introduced just a few days \nago without a committee hearing, reference to committee, without any \nattempt to find common ground and find a solution. In fact, it is being \ncalled today so there will be a vote on record and nothing else. It is \nanticipated the bill will not go forward.\n  I spoke to doctors in Illinois over the weekend, doctors who share my \nconcern about the medical malpractice premium situation in our State. I \nhave told them what we are doing today is frankly a political exercise. \nIt is an exercise to come up with a roll call vote so those on one side \nof the issue can go to their supporters and say, we have worked hard. \nWe brought this bill to the floor, we have been stopped, and we cannot \nget back to it because we are so busy. Frankly, that is no solution. In \nState after State, including my State, there are areas where there are \nserious medical malpractice premium problems. They arise for a variety \nof reasons. Memorial Hospital in Belleville, IL, has lost numerous \nobstetricians and gynecologists in the last year due to rising \nmalpractice premiums. Community leaders in that town, which I am \nfamiliar with--it is an area I grew up in--have come to me and said, \nthis is a real source of concern. We are losing doctors. They are \ndoctors who are leaving the practice to retire early, and I met one \ndoctor in that circumstance. There are some who are moving to rural \ncounties where the malpractice premiums are lower and they are further \naway, of course, from the people they originally served. Some are \nmoving across the river to Missouri where they are finding malpractice \npremiums are a fraction of what they are in Illinois.\n  There is no doubt in my mind there is a serious problem that needs to \nbe addressed. It is not just in the obstetrical/gynecological area. The \nOB/GYN issue is an important one, but there are other areas of need \nrelative to trauma care, neurosurgery, and orthopedic surgery. The list \nis long and we need to address it in a serious and responsible way.\n  This bill, however, is being brought to us on a moment's notice. This \nbill is being brought to us in an effort to really check off the box \nthat says, yes, we considered medical malpractice and now we are going \nto move on. That is unfair and it is unfortunate, and we can do better.\n  I will tell my colleagues a story about some of the situations I know \nof in my State. Eduardo Barriuso, who is a physician in the Humboldt \nPark area of Chicago, pays $104,000 a year for malpractice insurance. \nHe earns about $175,000 because the patients he sees are poor patients, \nMedicaid and Medicare patients. Doctors who depend on Medicaid and \nMedicare are not wealthy individuals, but they perform a valuable \nfunction because if they are not there to serve the poorest of the \npoor, then who will?\n  This doctor says that faced with $104,000 in annual premiums and a \n$175,000 annual income, he cannot continue his practice, and he \ncertainly cannot pass on the higher costs of medical malpractice \ninsurance to his patients who are poor people.\n  Another Chicago area OB/GYN has announced he is going to study to \nobtain his pharmacist license. Right now he is paying $115,000 a year \nfor liability insurance.\n  Let's go to the root cause of the issue. Why are we even debating \nthis issue of medical malpractice? There are several reasons. First, \nthe men and women who are engaged in the medical profession are some of \nthe most important people in our lives, some of the most important \npeople in America. These are men and women who at great personal \nsacrifice go to medical school so that they are trained and skilled to \nbe there when we need them, when our families need them. Time and \nagain, my family and most who are following this debate have turned to \na doctor in the hopes that he or she can cure an illness, provide some \nhope, give people some reason to believe they can overcome a disease, \ndisability, or an injury.\n\n  Doctors are so critically important to all of us and yet when one \ntakes a look at a doctor's practice, at a doctor's skills, there is a \nhuman side to the equation. They are human beings. They do make \nmistakes. Some are simple negligence. Some are far worse. When these \nmistakes occur, when a patient is in a hospital or a doctor's office \nand the wrong thing is done and that patient is injured, what should \nhappen? In most walks of life in America, we are held accountable for \nour actions.\n  If I decide this evening to take my car and go out speeding on a \nhighway, strike another car and injure someone, I will be held \naccountable. I was negligent. I did not reach the standard of safety \nthat is expected of me as a driver and I must pay the price. That is \ntrue for businesspeople, for individuals, for virtually everyone in \nAmerica. It is certainly true for medical professionals. When they make \na mistake by negligence or intentional misconduct, they can and should \nbe held accountable. I think that is part of our system of justice. \nVery few, if any, people argue that is not a reasonable thing to do.\n  How serious then are the number of medical errors and medical \nmalpractice cases that occur across the United States? Well, the most \nfar-reaching study of the extended cost of medical errors in hospitals \nand doctors' offices was published by the Journal of the American \nMedical Association last October. This is a dispassionate, objective \nanalysis of the likelihood of medical errors and medical negligence in \nAmerica. The authors of the study analyzed 7.4 million patient records \nfrom 994 hospitals in 28 States, representing some 20 percent of all \nthe hospitals in America. This was an exhaustive study.\n  They concluded medical injuries in hospitals ``pose a significant \nthreat to patients and incur substantial costs to society,'' and ``are \na serious epidemic confronting our health care system.''\n  A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has told \nus as we go into this debate the first thing we can acknowledge is we \nhave an epidemic of medical negligence in America. Now this was not the \nJournal of\n\n[[Page S1471]]\n\nthe American Trial Lawyers. This was the Journal of the American \nMedical Association. They published a study that told us and warned us \nwe have a serious problem in America.\n  The study found injuries in U.S. hospitals in the year 2000, for just \none year, led to approximately 32,600 deaths, at least 2.4 million \nextra days of patient hospitalization, and additional costs of up to \n$9.3 billion. These injuries did not include adverse drug reactions or \nmalfunctioning medical devices.\n  Dr. Carolyn Clancy, Director of the Agency for Health Care Research \nand Quality, called medical errors ``a national problem of epidemic \nproportions.''\n  This was at a hearing before the Government Affairs Committee last \nJune. She said Congress and the Bush administration need to make sure \nhealth care professionals work in systems that are designed to prevent \nmistakes and catch problems before patients are injured.\n  According to the Institute of Medicine, the medical errors epidemic \nhas caused more American deaths per year than breast cancer, AIDS, and \nautomobile accidents combined. It is the equivalent to a jumbo jetliner \ncrashing every 24 hours for an entire year.\n  More than 70 studies of the past decade have documented serious \nquality problems in medical treatment, yet this bill before us today, \nS. 2061, does absolutely nothing to address this underlying problem of \npatient safety. How can we in good conscience talk about a medical \nmalpractice problem and conclude the only place we need look is to the \ncourtroom, to the patient once injured who goes to the courthouse \nseeking some compensation, some accountability for an injury that was \nabsolutely no fault of their own? Yet the bill before us is absolutely \nsilent when it comes to making doctors' offices, hospitals, and patient \ntreatment safer.\n  This last Sunday in the New York Times, an interesting article on \npatient safety was published. I ask unanimous consent that the article \nbe printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 22, 2004]\n\n            Running a Hospital Like a Factory, in a Good Way\n\n                           (By Andrea Gabor)\n\n       On the face of it, SSM St. Joseph Health Center, a small \n     hospital in suburban St. Louis, does not seem very \n     revolutionary in business terms. The hospital is a nonprofit \n     institution run by the Franciscan Sisters of Mary. The chief \n     executive, Alan Kevin Kast, is a former seminarian who begins \n     his meetings with prayer and refers to his hospital as a \n     ministry. A crucifix hangs in every room.\n       Yet St. Joseph is also guided by worldly objectives. The \n     364-bed hospital, part of SSM Health Care, which has 20 \n     hospitals in four states and is led by Sister Mary Jean Ryan, \n     is in the vanguard of health care change. By using the \n     quality and productivity techniques that helped strengthen \n     American industry in the 1980's, the hospital has improved \n     patient care and reduced medication errors, waiting time in \n     the emergency room and infection rates. It has even sharply \n     reduced nursing turnover, which prevents many hospitals from \n     delivering consistent care.\n       Other hospitals are also starting to use some of the \n     techniques that have made industry more efficient in its \n     quest to improve quality and save money. Every year, \n     preventable medical errors cost $9 billion, and tens of \n     thousands of lives, according to a recent study by the Agency \n     for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the Department \n     of Health and Human Services, and Johns Hopkins University.\n       Whether in industry or in health care, a quality strategy \n     ``gives a unified vocabulary for thinking about production as \n     a system with a focus on customers,'' said Donald Berwick, \n     founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, an \n     advocacy organization based in Boston.\n       Many hospitals are using a road map provided by General \n     Electric, which has been selling its productivity-enhancing, \n     cost-cutting elixir known as Six Sigma, along with medical \n     imaging equipment, to hospitals around the country. Six Sigma \n     is a statistical measure that can be applied to any industry \n     and refers to a goal of reducing errors to 3.5 parts per \n     million. Two years ago, for example, the North Shore-Long \n     Island Jewish Health System contracted with GE Medical \n     Systems and the Harvard School of Public Health to help start \n     a leadership training center. Similarly, after close to a \n     decade of cost-cutting, the Yale New Haven Hospital also \n     recently signed up with GE.\n       New devotees of quality are beginning to measure and \n     analyze everything from waste and waiting time to infection \n     rates and the narrow avoidances of mistakes in treatment, as \n     well as organizational barriers to improvement.\n       In a culture ruled by a fear of malpractice, the focus on \n     quality involves a shift from secrecy to transparency--\n     including reporting and dissecting mistakes.\n       That shift may be helped by a provision of the Medicare \n     legislation passed in December that withholds a small part of \n     Medicare payments if a hospital refuses to disclose quality \n     data. ``It's not a lot of money, but it's incredibly \n     historic,'' said Robert Galvin, director for global health \n     care of G.E. and a founder of the Leapfrog Group, an industry \n     consortium aimed at improving health care.\n       A few hospitals, including Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical \n     Center in New Hampshire and the nine hospitals that form the \n     Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality, have begun to \n     publish comparative quality data on their Web sites, \n     including statistics like mortality rates.\n       At St. Joseph, where a quality strategy was first embraced \n     in the late 1980's, measurement, standardization and analysis \n     are obsessions.\n       ``When I came here, everything was done differently,'' said \n     Filippo Ferrigni, who has led the hospital's intensive care \n     unit since 1987. ``We didn't even measure blood pressure the \n     same way in everyone. We decided we needed to have internal \n     standards for measurement of at least blood pressure, \n     pulmonary artery pressure, temperature, the fundamental \n     building blocks of medicine.''\n       The quality push at St. Joseph and the other hospitals in \n     the group has led to systemwide benefits. In 1999, the \n     company was in the red, but in 2002 it had net income of $17 \n     million, on revenue of $1.8 billion. Amid nationwide nursing \n     shortages, it lowered annual turnover to about 10 percent in \n     2002 from 15 percent in 2000. The national average turnover \n     rate is more than 20 percent.\n       At St. Joseph, the zeal for quality improvement is helping \n     the sickest patients. When Dr. Ferrigni read an article in a \n     recent issue of The New England Journal of Medicine linking \n     high glucose levels to an increased chance of infections, he \n     knew that he had found his next big opportunity for improving \n     patient care. Infections acquired in hospitals and intensive \n     care units are common, according to a report released in \n     December by the government's Agency for Healthcare Research \n     and Quality; about two million patients are infected each \n     year at a cost of more than $4.5 billion.\n       The stress of illness results in higher gluclose levels for \n     most patients--not just those with diabetes. Dr. Ferrigni \n     decided to see if lowering glucose levels in the intensive \n     care unit by giving patients intravenous insulin would lower \n     infection levels. Initially, the project ran into \n     ``tremendous resistance,'' he said. Doctors were concerned \n     that giving patients insulin might result in brain injury and \n     seizures. Dr. Ferrigni, however, persuaded his colleagues to \n     allow him to gradually reduce blood sugars of patients in the \n     intensive care unit. As blood sugars declined among the \n     patients, overall mortality in the unit declined by 40 \n     percent.\n       The results were so astonishing that the hospital decided \n     to make the reduction of glucose levels for all patients, not \n     just those in intensive care, a quality goal. Today, all \n     patients are given glucose tests and, if necessary, get \n     insulin. Hospitalwide, that change is credited with reducing \n     deaths over all, not just from infections, by 28 percent from \n     the average recorded from 1998 to 2001.\n       Because each serious infection costs about $35,000, the \n     savings are also huge. ``This is the single most important \n     leverage point for reducing mortality that's available to \n     hospitals,'' Dr. Ferrigni said. ``This is incredibly powerful \n     stuff.''\n       The effort, however, also demonstrated a major \n     organizational challenge. ``Doctors write the orders, but \n     nurses have to make it work,'' Dr. Ferrigni said, explaining \n     that the glucose initiative significantly increased nurses' \n     workloads.\n       Blood sugar, once measured four times a day, now must be \n     measured 12 times a day in intensive care. Once nurses saw \n     the impact of the glucose testing, however, ``they got all \n     over it,'' Dr. Ferrigni said.\n       Some of the greatest quality challenges involve persuading \n     employees in various departments to cooperate. Consider the \n     effort, known as 30/30, to cut waiting time in emergency \n     rooms. The goal is to evaluate patients with life-threatening \n     illnesses or injuries in just 30 seconds and to reduce the \n     time needed to admit patients to a hospital bed from the \n     emergency room to 30 minutes.\n       Improvements in the emergency room involved a number of \n     departments. When X-rays were needed, it often took an hour \n     for an X-ray technician to get to the emergency room. To \n     solve the problem, one X-ray technician was permanently \n     transferred there. Or, in admitting psychiatric patients, the \n     hospital had to wait for an evaluation by an outside \n     psychological social worker before moving patients out of the \n     emergency room, a process that averaged 90 minutes. To reduce \n     the wait, the hospital hired a psychological social worker.\n        Within two years, SSM St. Joseph has met its objectives in \n     the emergency room 94 percent of the time, up from about 65 \n     percent when the project began. To help keep the organization \n     from becoming complacent, patients receive a coupon for $10 \n     of groceries when SSM misses its 30/30 target. The hospital \n     spent $14,450 in 2003 on coupons.\n        The hospital now spends about $200,000 more each year on \n     increased emergency-room staffing. But a jump in admissions \n     has\n\n[[Page S1472]]\n\n     more than made up for that cost. In 2002, St. Joseph garnered \n     about 68 percent of all new emergency room admissions in St. \n     Charles County. After years without growth, the hospital also \n     had a 7 percent increase in patient admissions in general in \n     2001, and the same increase in 2002.\n        Some major health care institutions, like Johns Hopkins \n     and the Mayo Clinic, have been pursuing quality initiatives \n     for years, but generally the mantra has been slower to \n     penetrate big institutions.\n        Large teaching hospitals, which juggle teaching, research \n     and patient care, have special challenges. Because of their \n     residency programs, many of their doctors are temporary. At \n     Yale-New Haven, one big question is whether a hospitalwide \n     quality effort can succeed when only 10 percent of the \n     hospital's 2,600 physicians are full-time. The rest are \n     community physicians or professors at the School of Medicine.\n        The hospital began its Six Sigma effort in the intensive \n     care unit, which had its own staff of nurses. The project \n     involved reducing a relatively high rate of blood-stream \n     infections that occur in patients who have catheters.\n        When management broached the subject with Heidi Frankel, \n     director of surgical critical care at the hospital and a \n     doctor at the Yale School of Medicine, she was skeptical. \n     ``This isn't an assembly line; it's an I.C.U.,'' Dr. Frankel \n     recalled saying. ``But it turned out to be a brilliant and \n     inspired thing to use rigid corporate improvement techniques \n     in a patient model because there are many things we do that \n     are repetitive, and that we could standardize.''\n        After winning over fellow doctors and residents, Dr. \n     Frankel standardized the catheterization procedure and \n     created a training video for the regular influx of new \n     residents. During the last year, the surgical intensive care \n     unit cut its catheter-related infection rates by about 75 \n     percent. A rigorous quality strategy appeals to many \n     hospitals not only because it controls costs, but also \n     because it can improve care. But the process can take years \n     to master. That is why, at St. Joseph, the true believers \n     would also recommend a little prayer.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me just note a few things about it. It is entitled \n``Running a Hospital Like a Factory, in a Good Way.''\n  The article tells a story of a hospital in suburban St. Louis, the \nSSM St. Joseph Health Center. It is a very complimentary article. The \nhospital is a nonprofit institution run by the Franciscan Sisters of \nMary and the chief executive, a former seminarian, has really decided \nto make St. Joseph's Hospital different. They have decided they are \ngoing to go after quality control and the reduction of patient injuries \nand accidents at their hospital. They are using techniques that are \nused by private industry. I will quote from the article:\n\n       Other hospitals are also starting to use some of the \n     techniques that have made the hospital industry more \n     efficient in its quest to improve quality and save money. \n     Every year, preventable medical errors cost $9 billion, and \n     tens of thousands of lives, according to a recent study by \n     the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, . . .\n\n  So this hospital, St. Joseph's, in suburban St. Louis, decided to \nconsult with General Electric, a major corporation, to find a way to \nmake the services they offer to their patients better. They are using a \nprocess called Six Sigma. It is a statistical measure and refers to the \ngoal of reducing errors to 3.5 parts per million. What they found is \nthis:\n\n       New devotees of quality are beginning to measure and \n     analyze everything from waste and waiting time to infection \n     rates and the narrow avoidances of mistakes in treatment, as \n     well as organizational barriers to improvement.\n\n  The article says:\n\n       In a culture ruled by a fear of malpractice, the focus on \n     quality involves a shift from secrecy to transparency--\n     including reporting and dissecting mistakes.\n\n  Let me go on in the article. They noted here one specific example. \nThe New England Journal of Medicine had linked high glucose levels to \nan increased chance of infection, so this hospital decided, \nparticularly in the emergency room and for critical patients, to \ncontinue to monitor their glucose levels to avoid the incidence of \ninfection. The blood sugars declined among patients when they started \nmonitoring them and administering insulin to keep blood sugars down. \nSimply by using this quality approach to reduce the likelihood of \ninfection, this hospital reduced the overall mortality in the intensive \ncare unit by 40 percent. The results were so astonishing that the \nhospital--and I quote again:\n\n       . . . decided to make the reduction of glucose levels of \n     all patients, not just those in intensive care, a quality \n     goal. Today, all patients are given glucose tests and, if \n     necessary, get insulin. Hospitalwide, that change is credited \n     with reducing deaths overall, not just from infection, by 28 \n     percent from the average recorded from 1998 to 2001.\n       Blood sugar in this hospital, once measured four times a \n     day, now is measured 12 times a day.\n\n  Those who follow this debate and will read this article in the \nCongressional Record I think will understand the point I am trying to \nmake. If we are going to reduce the likelihood of doctors being sued \nfor malpractice, the first stop in that conversation should be the \nreduction of medical errors. If we do that, we are serving two goals: \nreducing doctors' exposure to malpractice and we are making certain \nthat patients will go through their medical experience with a much \nbetter outcome.\n  You would think that would be the first title in this bill, \n``Reducing Medical Accidents, Reducing Medical Errors.'' This bill does \nnot even address that. This bill says that after you are injured, after \nyou have gone to court, after you have successfully been given a \nverdict, this bill is going to restrict and reduce the amount of money \nyou can recover.\n  From an insurance company's point of view and the view of some \ndoctors, that is good enough. But from the viewpoint of making American \nhospitals and medical practice safer, that is hardly the place to \nstart. Frankly, this bill does not address the core issue.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. In my own State of Texas, that passed a constitutional \namendment along with implementing legislation to reduce the cost of \nmedical liability insurance, we have seen reductions offered by medical \nliability carriers of 12 percent in one case and projected to be as \nmuch as a 19 percent reduction in medical liability insurance costs.\n  While I certainly would agree with the Senator from Illinois that \nreduction of errors is an important goal, would he not find a reduction \nof medical liability insurance rates of 12 to 19 percent one way to \nreduce the cost of health insurance and health care generally, in a way \nthat would benefit the public generally?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas. I am aware of his State's \nexperience. I am not an expert on it, but I read a little bit about it.\n  I will say to him I will be citing some statistics in the course of \nmy remarks that will show that the caps on recovery for victims of \nmedical negligence have reduced premiums in some States but not in \nothers. It is an unpredictable outcome, when you reduce the exposure of \na doctor for his malpractice, as to whether or not the cost of medical \nmalpractice premiums goes down.\n  I would further say to the Senator from Texas, if our goal is simply \nto reduce medical malpractice premiums, frankly, we could stop people \nfrom suing in court. We could basically say you can't go to a \ncourthouse if you are a victim. Malpractice insurance would cease to \nexist in that case.\n  What we are trying to do here is find a balance, a balance that is \njust and fair and says if you are an innocent victim of medical \nnegligence, you are entitled to a day in court and a reasonable \nrecovery. That doesn't mean you can come in and expect punitive damages \nin every instance, or some enormous verdict in every instance, but we \nshould be able to say that if you are a victim, you will be able to \nrecover a reasonable amount for your injuries.\n  I say to the Senator from Texas, in this bill, this jury of the \nSenate has decided that we know the maximum amount any woman or baby \nshould be entitled to recover in a medical malpractice action for \nnoneconomic losses. We are saying here that, regardless of the facts, \nregardless of the culpability of the doctor, regardless of the \ncircumstances, regardless of how serious the injury is, the maximum \namount which the jury of the Senate will render in verdict for the \nvictim is $250,000 for pain, suffering, and disfigurement.\n  I say to my friend from Texas, there are some who say that is just \nthe price you have to pay; if you want to keep malpractice premiums \ndown, you are going to have to say in some circumstances there is going \nto be an outcome that makes us feel a little uncomfortable. I am going \nto give examples of specific cases where $250,000 in\n\n[[Page S1473]]\n\npain and suffering is not even close to compensating the family and the \nchild who are the victims of malpractice in these OB/GYN circumstances.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator from Illinois makes an important point, and \nthat is there will invariably be one or two, perhaps, cases, or a \nhandful of cases, or an example you can point to where a $250,000 limit \non noneconomic damages might seem to be too low. But would the Senator \nagree that what we are trying to do is use a rather indirect means to \ntry to accomplish a greater good for the patients who are denied access \nto health care?\n  For example, in 154 of the 254 counties in my State, a woman cannot \nfind a baby doctor to deliver her baby because of the cost of \nmalpractice insurance. Many obstetricians simply decide to give up and \nretire or to move someplace else where malpractice liability rates are \nlower.\n  While the Senator no doubt can find an example where the amount is \nlower than a jury perhaps might award, why shouldn't we take a step in \nthe direction of bringing some predictability and thus bringing some \nreasonableness in reducing the rates for liability insurance so people \ncan have access to doctors where they live?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Texas makes an excellent point. I think \nthat is the reason, I would say to my colleague, why once this bill is \ndefeated--and I hope it is defeated--once it is defeated, we really \nhave a responsibility here.\n  We come from different sides of the political spectrum. We are about \nas far apart as they come in this Chamber in terms of our political \nphilosophy, but I think we both can see there has a been problem. The \nmedical malpractice premiums in parts of your State and parts of my \nState have reached record high levels. These premiums are forcing my \ngood doctors in Illinois to retire, move away to another State or to an \narea that is friendlier when it comes to the cost of the premiums. \nThere is a denial of coverage. There is a denial of services to a lot \nof poor people in Texas, Illinois, and a lot of other States.\n\n  Shouldn't we come together instead of a take it or leave it bill that \nhas never been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, never been \nthe subject of a hearing, does not address issues of medical safety and \nother issues we can agree should be part of this conversation? \nShouldn't we at the end of this debate on this bill sit down and \nhonestly try, on a bipartisan basis, to find common ground and \ncompromise that would serve the goal the Senator is suggesting, the \ngreater good, to make sure these good doctors across America will be \nthere when we need them?\n  I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield for a final question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate the spirit in which the comments are offered \nby the Senator from Illinois, because this is a subject where we do \nneed to have a rational debate. Unfortunately, because we cannot get 60 \nvotes to allow the floor debate and actually vote, we are engaging in a \nhypothetical exercise.\n  Wouldn't the Senator from Illinois deem it important for this body to \nhave a realistic, rational debate and ultimately vote to see what the \nwill of this body and the people we represent is when it comes to \ntrying to get some handle on reducing the costs of liability insurance \nso more mothers can have access to obstetricians and more people can \nhave access to health insurance by reducing health insurance costs?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Texas. I thank him for his \ncomments which I believe are good-faith comments.\n  In my rank on this side, I do not set the calendar of how bills are \ndetermined; your leader, Senator Frist, does that. I suggest the best \nplace to start is not on the floor of the Senate but for a group, on a \nbipartisan basis, to try to come up with an honest answer to this issue \nand bring it to the floor and stand together to try to pass this bill \nin a responsible way. Simply bringing a bill, take it or leave it, a \nfew days, no committee hearings, does not serve the needs we are \naddressing.\n  I see a few other colleagues on the floor so I will go through a few \npoints quickly and return to the Senate later in the day if there is an \nopportunity.\n  This particular bill does not address the problems of malpractice \npremiums in an honest fashion. The problem with malpractice premiums is \na cyclical insurance problem. We have had crises before with high \npremiums in the 1970s and 1980s. Many States passed changes in the law \nto address this, some in tort reform and some in insurance reform.\n  This bill does not even look at the insurance companies that are \noffering medical malpractice insurance. What it is basically saying is \nthat we are not even going to ask the question as to whether these \ncompanies are overcharging doctors and hospitals. Instead, we are going \nto say that the only culprits, the only people who are at fault in this \nconversation, are the victims of medical malpractice. They are the ones \nwho have to tighten their belt, take fewer dollars. We will not even \nconsider in 2061 asking that the insurance companies be held \naccountable for their own conduct and ask whether they are gouging us \nwhen it comes to prices.\n  How can we have an honest discussion of the medical malpractice issue \nwithout addressing medical safety, without asking these important \nquestions of the insurance company?\n  This bill does not address frivolous lawsuits. The proponents of tort \nreform claim frivolous lawsuits are at the root of the problem. This \nbill does not do anything to cut down on the number of such suits but \nonly punishes those who make it to court.\n  Keep this in mind: If a lawsuit is worth $250,000 in noneconomic \nlosses, which is the maximum under this bill, this is a lawsuit where \nthe plaintiff clearly has a cause of action which a jury or judge has \ndecided is a worthy cause of action worth compensation. These are not \nfrivolous lawsuits that would have $250,000 in noneconomic losses. \nSomething happened. A patient went to a hospital or to a doctor and was \ninjured wrongly.\n\n  This bill is saying we are not going to address frivolous lawsuits. \nWe will basically say those who are entitled to recover are limited in \nthe amount they can recovery.\n  One of the worst parts of this bill, we will hear arguments in the \nSenate that we need OB/GYNs across America and without these doctors to \ndeliver babies we will be at a disadvantage. Frankly, no one can argue \nwith that. But when we read the bill, it is about more than doctors. \nThis bill, like the last one we considered last year, has been expanded \nto provide protection against lawsuits filed against pharmaceutical \ncompanies and medical device companies.\n  We are finding, time and again in the Senate, whatever the issue, the \nRepublican side of the aisle insists there be at least one provision in \nevery bill that is going to benefit the drug companies of America. In \nthis situation they are saying these drug companies should not be held \naccountable for the damages and injuries caused by their products \ninvolved in OB/GYN practice.\n  Why would we do this? Why would we decide we are going to exempt them \nfrom exposure, liability, and accountability for some of the drugs and \ndevices that are being used across America that cause injury to \ninnocent people? That is exactly what they do.\n  Let me give some examples of the types of litigation that would have \nbeen eliminated by this bill, had it been in law. The Dalkon Shield was \nan IUD on the market in the early 1970s and caused thousands of women \nto suffer miscarriages, loss of their female organs, and infertility. \nIt took eight punitive damage awards to force the manager of the Dalkon \nShield to finally recall the product. It was not a law passed by \nCongress. It was a lawsuit filed against the company because of their \ndangerous product; 400,000 claims were eventually filed against A.H. \nRobins, the manufacturer of Dalkon Shields. Evidence established that \nRobins, the device company, knew that its IUD was associated with high \nrates of pelvic disease and septic abortion and that this company had \nmisled doctors about the device's safety and had dropped or concealed \nstudies on the device.\n  Why in the world we would protect this brand of reckless, \nirresponsible corporate behavior with this bill? The honest answer is \nbecause politically\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\nthe pharmaceutical companies and the medical device companies have a \ndeath grip on this Congress. They get what they want. We saw that when \nwe considered the prescription drug bill for seniors and we are seeing \nit again. There is not a bill that comes through here, not one that \npasses through the traffic in the Senate, where somebody is not looking \nfor a way to increase the profits and reduce the liability of \npharmaceutical companies. This is a further illustration of it.\n  There are other things I could point out, drugs or devices that have \nbeen used. Let me give one from the State of Georgia. A Medical, a \nGeorgia-based manufacturer of OB/GYN devices such as forceps, failed to \nsterilize tens of thousands of devices from 1999 to 2002, posing life-\nthreatening injuries to women. Former staff of this company told FDA \ninvestigators that sterile and nonsterile devices were routinely \nshipped in the same batches. A month after urging the company to \nvoluntarily recall its products, the FDA seized and destroyed the \ncompany's inventory. The owners of A Medical left the country after \nthe seizure.\n  These are the kinds of companies we are trying to protect with this \nbill? This is not a question about whether a doctor could deliver a \nbaby in Texas, Connecticut, Ohio, or Alabama. It is a question about \nwhether or not these companies will be held accountable for their \nwrongdoing.\n  There is an approach that can be used and should be used that can \nbring a positive outcome. Senator Lindsey Graham from the State of \nSouth Carolina and I have introduced bipartisan legislation. We have \nworked to try to include in this legislation the key elements that we \nthink are necessary for medical malpractice reform. Let me tell you \nwhat they include.\n  First, dealing with medical safety, establish a voluntary system to \nshare medical error information among providers and patient safety \norganizations. The information shared will be immune from legal \ndiscovery so there is some transparency in what occurs but no \nliability, so a greater likelihood they would exchange information.\n  Also, consistent with the Institute of Medicine, the bill creates a \nnew center for quality improvement. We provide immediate relief for \ndoctors and hospitals.\n  If there is one point I make, it is this: If Senators are hearing \nback home that medical malpractice premiums are too high and that you \nshould vote for this bill, keep in mind what Senator Ensign of Nevada \nsaid in the debate we had a few months ago on a similar bill. Capping \nnoneconomic losses will not reduce medical malpractice premiums for \ndoctors for 4 to 6 to 8 years. Why? Because there is a long tail of \nliability. Doctors' acts today that constitute negligence can result in \ncourt suits tomorrow, next year, and for years to come when those \ninjuries are finally discovered. If we cap noneconomic losses today, \nthere will not be a relief for doctors in their medical malpractice \npremiums for years to come.\n  Senator Graham and I considered that and said we have to deal with \nthis directly. And dealing with it directly means offering a tax \ncredit, particularly to those doctors in specialties where the premiums \nhave gone too high. Doctors today deduct the cost of medical \nmalpractice premiums from their business expenses.\n  We would go further and offer to doctors and hospitals a tax credit \nwhen their premiums skyrocket. That is the only reasonable way to \nprovide immediate relief. We have given tax breaks to a lot of wealthy \npeople across America under this Bush administration. Why can't we, \nwhen it comes to the medical professionals, say they should have a tax \ncredit so that skyrocketing premiums do not force them out of business \ninto retirement or to move their practice?\n  In our legislation, we reduce frivolous lawsuits. We put in the \nDurbin-Graham bill penalties for attorneys who file frivolous lawsuits: \nThe first time, damages; the second time, even more expense; and the \nthird time we would subject them to losing their license to practice \nlaw for a frivolous lawsuit. There is no reason any doctor or any \nperson, for that matter, should be subjected to a lawsuit which ties \nthem up at great expense, costs their insurance company money, and \nraises their premiums when, in fact, that lawsuit is frivolous. There \nare few of these, but there should be none. We think there should be a \npenalty for those who take advantage.\n  We also stop any competitive activities by insurers under the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act, and we provide resources to help hard-hit areas \nof doctor shortages, particularly rural and inner-city areas, through \nthe Department of Health and Human Services.\n  We also address the issue of reinsurance. This is a topic we never \ntalk about. Most medical malpractice premiums are charged against the \ninitial liability which is usually in the range of $1 million, and then \nthe umbrella policy which covers all the damages which might exceed $1 \nmillion. Then companies are brought in, reinsurance companies, that \nsell the original insurance policy. These are the areas where we \nbelieve there is a need for reform.\n  Reinsurance costs are about 28 percent of medical malpractice \npremiums. Their prices swing widely. They are mainly international \ncorporations subjected to little regulation. Frankly, since September \n11, reinsurance costs have gone up dramatically across America.\n  As this chart illustrates, this is Hurricane Andrew; reinsurance \ncosts spiked in America. Then they went back down again. This is 9/11. \nAfter 9/11, reinsurance costs have gone up. So why are these medical \nmalpractice insurance companies charging higher premiums? Part of it is \nthe cost of reinsurance. Senator Graham and I address this and believe \nthat we should create a Federal fund which deals with reinsurance, \nwhere there would be contributions from doctors, hospitals, and health \ncare professionals, and we can see some stability in the amount that is \ncharged.\n  This situation we have before us is clear. Caps don't work. This \nchart shows the percentage increase in median premiums for medical \nmalpractice from 1991 to 2002, the States without caps, no limitations \non recoveries in verdicts, and the States with caps are shown in red. \nYou can see that Arizona, New York, Georgia, and Washington, with no \ncaps, had very modest increases in malpractice premiums.\n  Take a look at California, which has a $250,000 cap, Kansas, Utah, \nand Louisiana. In this period of time, malpractice premiums went up \ndramatically in the States with the caps. There is little or no \ncorrelation between the caps and the fact that malpractice premiums are \ngoing up.\n  Look at these OB/GYN insurance premiums in damage cap States versus \nnoncap States in 2003: In California, a State with caps, there was a \n54-percent increase in OB/GYN premiums with caps in place at the State \nlevel; in Oregon, zero percent increase; against the State of \nWashington, California, 15 percent, State of Washington, zero percent; \nColorado, 29 percent with caps, Georgia, only 10 percent without caps; \nNew Mexico, 52 percent increase in OB/GYN medical malpractice premiums \nwith caps, and in the State of Arizona, 14 percent. It is an \nillustration that you just can't rely on these caps to bring down \nmalpractice premiums for many years, if at all, and in many cases not \nat all.\n  Look at the percentage increase in median premiums: States with caps, \n48 percent between 1991 and 2002; States without caps, 36 percent.\n  This is an important issue that needs to be addressed. I see my \ncolleagues waiting. I will yield the floor but return later in the \ndebate.\n  I hope my colleagues will understand that we have a serious national \nproblem that needs to be addressed, but we should not address it in a \nway that is partial, that does not do justice to the serious challenges \nwe face. We need to reduce medical errors. We need to hold insurance \ncompanies accountable. We need to bring about tort reform which stops \nfrivolous lawsuits. We need to move into the area of tax credits for \ndoctors now--not 4, 6, and 8 years from now--so they can pay their \nmalpractice premiums and do it in a fashion that is fair--fair to the \npeople who have been injured and fair to the medical professionals who \nare so important to all of our communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are, indeed, losing physicians in the\n\n[[Page S1475]]\n\npractice of medicine throughout America. Senator Durbin expressed \nconcern in the conversations he has been having with doctors in his \nState, even though he opposes this bill. I traveled to Alabama this \npast week and visited five or six hospitals. I was at Fayette and \nWedowee and Gadsden and Alexander City. As I traveled the State talking \nto doctors, to hospitals about their insurance premiums, it is a very \nreal problem.\n  This is not a new issue. We have been talking about it for a number \nof years. The reform of litigation of malpractice cases in California \nis the model for this legislation. It has worked very well in \nCalifornia.\n  The people who are paying the premiums, people who are subjected to \nlawsuits, people who care about this every day, people who are giving \nup their practice every day as a result of abusive lawsuits, they \nsupport this legislation. Do they not know what this is all about? Do \nthey not know what they are asking for? These are matters that are \nquite serious.\n  I believe capping noneconomic damages has a good effect. When you \nlook at a doctor who delivers a baby, is that doctor a guarantor of a \nhealthy baby? They can't do that. They cannot be the guarantor that \nevery birth they preside over will result in a healthy baby. They are \nresponsible if they are negligent and that negligence causes damage to \na child. There is no doubt about that. So that is what we need to focus \non.\n  The limit on damages does not limit damages for injuries in care for \na child who lives many years with a great disability. They can recover \nunlimited amounts for that.\n  Under California law, these are some of the verdicts that have been \nrendered to compensate families for children who were born with serious \ndisabilities: In December, an $84 million verdict was rendered because \nof a 5-year-old with cerebral palsy after a mishandled birth; $25 \nmillion in San Diego County because a boy had severe brain damage; $27 \nmillion in San Bernardino for a woman who was a quadriplegic because of \nfailure to diagnose a spinal injury; $21 million in Los Angeles for a \nnewborn girl with cerebral palsy and mental retardation as a result of \na birth-related injury. They go on.\n  These are real recoveries to compensate people for economic losses \nthey will have in the future and to allow them every possibility to see \nthat the child or the person who is injured can be taken care of with \nthe best conditions we can make. We are concerned about the explosion \nof punitive damages. Some people say the person who did wrong ought to \nbe punished.\n  As a matter that we need to think about, the system is out of whack. \nThe person who commits malpractice is not the one who is punished. The \nperson who commits malpractice--for the most part, hopefully, \ncertainly, all of them doctors--has insurance. They don't pay the \nverdict. The insurance company pays the verdict. How do they get the \n$21 million or whatever they have to pay out in the verdict? How do \nthey get that money to compensate the victims? They raise the rates on \neverybody; the innocent and those who commit errors. It is driving up \nthe cost to practice.\n  I have a wonderful friend, an OB/GYN, in my hometown of Mobile. We go \nto church together. He was telling me about a doctor that just gave up \nhis practice. He handled 60 or 80 births a year. His insurance was \n$60,000 a year. That is almost $1,000 per birth. This week, I was in a \nhospital in Alabama. They told me 3 years ago they gave up deliveries--\nthere were 200 deliveries a year in this small town, and the hospital \nhad less than 50 beds--because they could not afford the insurance. The \nhospital quit doing it. The physician in the community also quit \ndelivering. This is a fact, a reality, and it is driving good \nphysicians out of health care.\n\n  No group of doctors in America has the hammer falling harder on them \nthan the doctors who deliver our babies. They are getting hit with \nextraordinary increases. They are getting sued to an extraordinary \ndegree. We need to do something about it. We have bills here, and \nwhatever the bill is, they say ``we need to do something, but this \nisn't the way to do it; but we want to do something.'' They say ``there \nare problems, I will admit, Senator, but this isn't the right bill.'' \nThey say ``you have not done this or that,'' and on and on. The result \nof that is we never pass anything. I believe it is time to do something \nabout this issue. We can do something about this.\n  When you look at the cost of delivering babies in America today, the \nliability cost is a very significant portion of it. Not only that, \ndoctors--particularly those who have been practicing for a number of \nyears--do not like the agony of going through a lawsuit. There is the \ncombination of premiums and the threat of being dragged through court \nfor long periods of time, and that is not good. That is why they are \nquitting.\n  I was at one of the hospitals in Gadsden this week. One of the nurse \nsupervisors came up to me after I had been asked in the meeting whether \nwe were going to do anything about the liability problem. She said she \nand the hospital had been in litigation. She had been away from the \nhospital for 10 days during the trial of this case. They were not \nnegligent and they won the lawsuit, but millions of dollars were spent \non that litigation. This is happening all over America. Most of the \ncases are defendants' verdicts, but many cases are coming in with \nextraordinarily high verdicts. The BMW case out of Alabama, decided by \nthe Supreme Court, raised real questions about how do you decide what \npunitive damages ought to be. Does the jury just feel bad this day or \nlook at the victim and feel sympathetic, or are they more sympathetic \nto one person than another? They come up with $50 million for one \nperson, and maybe in a similar situation they would come up with \n$500,000. These are aberrational verdicts in the country.\n  We are saying that there should be a limit for compensating \nnoneconomic damages. It is modeled on a successful program in \nCalifornia. I believe we are facing a national crisis in health care. \nIt is a crisis that ought to be confronted. It is not going to go away. \nA big part of it is litigation. If you don't believe it, ask any doctor \nor hospital you know. They sue everybody, including the nurses, \ndoctors, the aides, the hospital, the manufacturer of the hospital bed, \nor whatever, that might be possibly construed as being connected. All \nof that adds up to a tremendous burden, a tremendous cost on our health \ncare system.\n  The truth is health care costs are continuing to go up. One of the \nfactors is litigation costs, which are going up even faster than other \ncosts. We need to contain that and bring some rationality into it. I am \nwilling to listen to other ideas. I am not sure California is perfect, \nbut I will say it is working there. I believe it will work for our \ncountry. I thank our majority leader, Dr. Bill Frist, for bringing this \nup. It is time to debate this. We need to pass something soon to \nprotect the availability of health care. We need to make sure hospitals \nand doctors are not quitting delivering babies. That hurts us in \nAmerica and hurts health care in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have been listening to the arguments posed \nby our colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and our colleague from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions. I find myself sort of agreeing with both of \nthese individuals. Clearly, this is an area that cries out for some \nsolution. We have been back at this issue over and over again. Like my \ncolleague from Alabama, and I suspect my colleague from Illinois as \nwell, I was home in Connecticut over the past week and I have received \nletters from radiologists, and I have talked to OB/GYNs and others. My \nState ranks third in the country in the rate of premiums for OB/GYNs, \nwhich I will address in a minute. This is an area that clearly needs to \nbe addressed. So I appreciate the comments of my colleague from \nAlabama, that is, to see if we cannot find solutions to this.\n  As the Senator may recall, I have not been shy when it comes to tort \nreform issues, having authored the securities litigation reform bill, \nuniform standards legislation; and I have dealt with the issue of \nterrorism insurance, and Y2K legislation with Bob Bennett. I am someone \nwho wishes we were debating class action reform now. There, we\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\nhave an agreement. It is not going to satisfy everybody, but I have \nagreed with Bill Frist and others. Senators Schumer and Landrieu and I \nhave worked across party lines to come up with a compromise solution on \nclass action reform. That is a bill I believe we could actually adopt.\n  Here we are going to spend 2 days debating a cloture motion we both \nrecognize is probably going to fail this evening. But we have a class \naction reform bill we can get done. I regret I am not arguing on behalf \nof that proposal, rather than standing here and reluctantly disagreeing \nwith this particular bill; although I am agreeing with my colleague \nfrom Alabama that we cannot allow year after year to go by without \naddressing this issue. I regret we didn't make the effort here we did \non class action. On class action, once the cloture motion was defeated \non the motion to proceed, people reached out and said let's see where \nwe can find common ground on this. I think we have done that. Only time \nwill tell if the compromise will work. That is how you have to function \nin this body, when you have 100 Members representing different \nconstituencies and ideas and proposals, where there is a commonality \nand purpose to try to arrive at an answer to a staggering problem. One \nof the problems--not all, but one of the problems--is associated with \nhealth care. I will go into that in a minute. It seems to me we should \npause and reach out and see if we cannot find that common answer. It \nmay not satisfy everybody, but certainly it will come up with some \nintelligent responses to this problem.\n  So I say to my constituency in Connecticut, and elsewhere, I am \nlistening to you and I hear you. I know we have to answer this. The \nquestion is, is this particular proposal the answer to the problem we \nface, with the rising increase in malpractice premiums. What actually \ncould be done that may address the issue?\n  As my colleagues know, this legislation is similar to the one the \nSenate rejected last year. It would place, as we all know, a $250,000 \ncap on noneconomic damages that can be awarded to a plaintiff in a \nmedical malpractice case. The bill we are considering today has been \nnarrowed, but in narrowing it, its defects have not been remedied. Like \nS. 11, the previous bill, this bill would apply to claims brought by \nhealth care professionals, health care organizations, such as HMOs, \ninsurance companies, as well as product liability claims brought \nagainst medical device and drug manufacturers, by and on behalf of \npregnant women and children. However, it would only apply to claims \nrelating to obstetrics and gynecological services. We are dealing with \na reduced universe of people in this area, much narrower from the \nproposal of last year.\n  Once again, this legislation would cap noneconomic damages at \n$250,000. It would put the same cap on punitive damages while imposing \na stiffer evidentiary standard. It would also reduce economic damages a \nvictim could collect by subtracting benefits paid by health insurance, \nlife insurance, disability insurance, and Social Security benefits. In \nshort, it would make it much harder for the victims of medical \nmalpractice in this narrow area to receive fair and just compensation, \nin my view.\n  This legislation would not affect all victims of malpractice. We \npointed out the bill we are dealing with seeks to limit the legal \nrights of a specific segment of our society, women and newborns.\n  It is important to remember that this bill is going to affect those \nwho have actually been injured by malpractice. We are not debating \nwhether there has been a judgment. There has been a decision that \nmalpractice has occurred. A jury has already, in these cases, decided \nthe victims are eligible to collect noneconomic damages. Furthermore, \nit will hurt the most seriously injured, those who might receive a \nnoneconomic damage award of more than $250,000 were it not for the \narbitrary cap.\n  We are essentially telling women and infants that the injuries and \nsuffering they experience are not worth as much as injuries and \nsuffering of others.\n  The assumption is if we just do this in this one area, we are then \ngoing to be able to bring down the costs of these premiums. In fact, I \nsuggest that if the empirical evidence made that case, I would be very \ntempted to support this bill. I say that to my colleagues who are the \nauthors of this legislation. But, in fact, the data and information, \nunfortunately, does not substantiate the claim that by establishing a \ncap, you will achieve the desired results of lesser premiums on \nmalpractice insurance.\n  The argument used by supporters of this bill is OB/GYNs are \nparticularly hit by rising medical premiums. I want to make it clear \nthat I am not insensitive to that claim. As I said earlier, I have \nheard from many in my own State. In Connecticut, we face the third \nhighest premiums in the country for OB/GYNs. My doctors pay an average \nof $102,000 every year in medical liability premiums. I have heard from \nthem on numerous occasions about the difficulties they face in the \ncurrent environment. The vast majority are good doctors who are working \nto provide the best possible care they can for their patients. They are \ndoctors on whom families in Connecticut and newborns can rely. It is \nthe same across the country. I know, having had a newborn in my own \nhousehold, a child born to my wife Jackie and me a little over 2 years \nago, the tremendous care and attention we received from our OB/GYN in \nVirginia, where Grace was born.\n  The question is not whether these people are paying higher premiums. \nThe question is, Is the solution being proposed by this legislation \nactually going to address this problem? Again, if I thought it would do \nthat, I would be very tempted to support this legislation, as someone \nwho has offered legislation dealing with frivolous lawsuits and other \nclaims. I am not adverse to tort reform. In fact, I am disappointed. We \nare discussing tort reform in this instance, and we are also going to \nbe talking about the tort liability of gun manufacturers. It is going \nto be interesting to hear people on that issue.\n  We had language included in the Energy bill to deal with MTBE. \nSenator Schumer of New York eloquently made the case, asking why we \nshould be eliminating the liability of a product that was causing such \ndamage. I am frustrated to know that we are protecting people from \nliability because of the political pressures that occur.\n  I am prepared to support intelligent tort reform, but this problem, \nas serious as it is, is not addressed by this solution. Will this \nlegislation do anything to reduce premiums? Let me tell you why I don't \nthink it does.\n  If we are limiting the ability of women and young children to hold \naccountable doctors, nurses, insurance companies, and others for harm \nresulting from a mistake, we certainly must make sure we are doing so \nfor a very good reason.\n  The answer to the question posed above is a resounding no, in my \nview. The suggestive link between jury awards and rising premiums has \nnot been established at all. In fact, to the contrary. Nor is there a \nlink between insurance premiums and access to health care. In fact, the \nevidence suggests quite the opposite.\n  The two pillars upon which this bill is based are deeply flawed, in \nmy view. First, some would suggest jury awards have exploded in both \nnumbers and dollar amounts. That is something we will hear over and \nover, that victims are winning more and more so-called jackpot \nmalpractice cases. But the facts are quite different.\n  The amount defendants and insurers are paying for medical malpractice \nclaims, including jury awards and settlements, has increased in a \nmanner that is consistent with and even lags behind medical inflation. \nOver the 10-year period from 1992 to 2001, the mean payout in medical \nmalpractice cases rose by 6.2 percent per year, while medical inflation \nwas rising at 6.7 percent annually over the same period of time. In \nother words, malpractice awards are rising exactly in the manner we \nwould expect. They are tracking health care costs.\n\n  Of course, a rise in premiums might also be explained by an increase \nin the number of malpractice claims. That is also an argument we are \nhearing. Again, this is not the case. Between 1995 and 2000, the number \nof claims filed actually decreased by 4 percent, and the number of \nmedical malpractice payouts decreased by 8.2 percent between 2001 and \n2002. So we are not seeing these numbers go up financially, nor are the \nactual numbers of malpractice cases increasing. Both are the\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\ntwo pillars upon which this bill is based. It is the reason people are \nsaying we need to have the cap on these noneconomic awards.\n  The case made by supporters of this legislation is further damaged, \nin my view, when we compare States that currently have caps on \nnoneconomic damages with States that have no such caps. As I mentioned \npreviously, my home State of Connecticut has the third highest average \npremium for OB/GYNs. Connecticut has no cap. However, seven of the 10 \nStates with the highest premiums do have caps. Last year, premiums \nactually increased by 17.1 percent for OB/GYNs in States with caps \ncompared to a 16.6 percent increase in States without caps.\n  In the year 2003, the average premium for an OB/GYN in States with \ncaps was $63,000. The average premium in States without caps was \n$59,000. So if anything, the evidence suggests caps on patient damages \nactually correspond to higher insurance premiums for doctors.\n  I said that rather quickly. Let me run by it again and make the case. \nThe argument, again, is if you don't have caps, then these premiums go \nup. But if you look at places that have caps, seven of the 10 States \nwith the highest premiums for OB/GYNs do have caps--seven of the 10. \nLast year, premiums actually increased by 17.1 percent in States with \ncaps--an increase of 17.1 percent--compared to 16.6 percent in States \nwithout caps.\n  Again, if anything, the evidence suggests caps on patient damages \nactually correspond to higher insurance premiums for doctors.\n  The ineffectiveness of caps is illustrated by the experience in the \nState of California. Ironically, supporters of caps point to California \nas the model for limiting noneconomic damages. The State does, in fact, \nhave a $250,000 cap and premiums have remained stable relative to the \nrest of the country. However, California adopted the cap in 1975, and \nover the next 13 years in California, with a cap of $250,000, premiums \nincreased by 450 percent. This is comparable to a nationwide trend \nduring that same period.\n  Then in 1988, California did something else. It passed comprehensive \ninsurance reform. Only at that point did insurance premiums stabilize, \ndecreasing 2 percent between 1988 and 2001. So for 13 years, when they \nhad caps on the awards, they actually had premiums go up 450 percent, \ntracking the national average. In 1988, they put a cap on insurance \npremiums. Then they began to see the decline.\n  California is very worthwhile to look at, but we have to look at it \nin its totality. Don't disregard what happened in 1988. If we only look \nat 1975 to 1988, for that 13 years, there is nothing to brag about at \nall. The numbers went up as much as they did all across the country. It \nis only from 1988 up to now that we begin to see the real changes as a \nresult of the insurance reforms in that State.\n  So California is a good example, but look to all of California. I \ncould continue to quote numbers to underscore my point, but I do not \nwant to bore my colleagues with recitations of data. I think it is \nimportant because without knowing what the facts are and understanding \nthe argument, we cannot understand how best to deal with a very \nlegitimate problem of trying to get these premium costs down. Does this \nsolution meet that problem? One has to look at the data and the facts, \nand the facts are not holding this point up very well, in my view.\n  The point is very simple: The number of medical malpractice claims is \nnot rising. The amount awarded to victims is consistent with inflation. \nThe story in States with caps is similar to that without caps. Based on \nthis evidence, we are being asked to limit the rights of pregnant \nmothers and infants. I do not think we ought to do that. The facts fail \nutterly to dictate such a conclusion.\n  If neither the number nor the amount of malpractice awards can \nexplain rising premiums, then what is the explanation? Something is \ngoing on that is causing these premiums to continue to skyrocket as \nthey are in my State and others across the country. According to \nseveral analyses that have been done, the increase in premiums does in \nfact correlate with the stock market and interest rates.\n  One recent study showed that premiums very closely tracked the \ninsurers' economic cycle. During good economic times, insurers slash \npremiums in order to attract as much business as possible. Insurance \ncompanies receive their money from two sources. They get it from \npremium payments as well as investments. So when there is a good, \nhealthy market going on, then they will reduce premiums because the \ncycles in the market are allowing them to sustain their economic \ngrowth. When there is a downturn in the economy and the stock market is \nnot doing as well, the insurance industry is faced with only one other \nsolution and that is to raise the premiums in order to keep the \ncashflow coming in.\n  So it is not complicated. As someone who comes from a State with a \nlot of insurance companies, I know that is how this is done. There is \nnot some great magical secret out there. This is exactly how it occurs. \nSo, obviously, during good economic times, insurers will cut the \npremiums in order to attract as much business as possible, which makes \nsense. This is because every new policy brings in additional float, \nmoney to invest in a booming market so they bring in the dollars. \nHowever, when the market turns and investment returns are weak, as has \nhappened in the last few years, insurers raise their rates or, in some \ncases, leave the market altogether. When this happens, the result is \noften a crisis in the availability and affordability of insurance, and \nthat is exactly what we are seeing today.\n  I will take a moment to address one other claim made by the \nsupporters of this bill, and that is that rising premiums have reduced \naccess to care for women and infants. Again, this is a very significant \nclaim and needs to be addressed. Once again, I do not think the facts \nsupport that argument.\n  Between 1999 and the year 2002, the number of OB/GYNs across the \ncountry actually increased by 1,700 people. Only 6 States out of 50 saw \na decrease in the number of OB/GYNs. That is not good news for those \nsix States, but the argument that across the country this is occurring \nis not borne out by the facts. Actually, there were 1,700 new OB/GYNs \nin 44 States, so the number is stable or increasing, and in 6 States \nthe number is going down. We ought to be conscious of that because that \ncould be a trend that needs to be addressed.\n  Again, I underscore what I said at the outset. This is a serious \nproblem but a serious problem demands a serious solution. \nUnfortunately, this bill is not that answer.\n  As an interesting note, by the way, where we are losing OB/GYNs, half \nof those six States have caps on the amount that can be collected in \nnoneconomic terms. So we are talking about a bill that places caps on \nnoneconomic awards, and in six States the number of OB/GYNs is \ndeclining, and yet three out of the six States have actual caps. One \nhas to ask oneself: If this is failing in half of the States in terms \nof attracting or keeping OB/GYNs, is this bill or this idea the right \nsolution to this problem? I think the conclusion is no, it is not, \nunfortunately, if those are the facts.\n\n  A GAO report from August of last year identified access to care as a \nproblem--and I am quoting--``in scattered, often rural areas where \nproviders identified other long-standing factors that also affect the \navailability of services.''\n  The question was asked: Why is this happening? The General Accounting \nOffice comes back and said there are a lot of other factors that are \ncausing a decline in the number of OB/GYNs. In addition, the GAO \nfound--and I am quoting them again--``that many of the reported \nprovider actions were not substantiated or did not affect access to \nhealth care on a widespread basis.''\n  Unfortunately, this bill is a misguided attempt to solve a health \ncare problem with a tort reform solution. I am disappointed that we are \nnot using this time today to discuss the real issues. One issue I wish \nwe were discussing is class action reform because I think we have come \nup with an answer that a majority of us could support. Regrettably, we \nare not spending two days debating that issue. We are debating a bill \nthat is not going to go anywhere because the solution that is being \ncalled for does not do the job.\n  So instead of taking the few valuable days we have in this Chamber to \ndeal with some issues before we adjourn for elections and conventions, \nwe are not debating class action reform, we are\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\ndebating a bill that is going nowhere. That does not make any sense to \nme at all in terms of this agenda. So this is a waste of our time.\n  Let me get into other areas of health care because there are health \ncare problems that need addressing. I am disappointed, though, that we \nare not going to debate class action reform but instead these tort \nreform issues. We do have problems with access to care in our country. \nWe do have a patient safety problem in our country. We do have a health \ncare quality issue in this Nation of ours. We do have a problem with \nrising health care costs in the Nation. This bill does not answer any \nof those problems.\n  Why are we not discussing real solutions to the issue of access to \nhealth care, to patient safety, to health care quality in this country, \nand to the problem of rising health care costs? The American people \nhave a right to expect from this body better answers than the ones we \nare giving them on this bill dealing with the issue of rising premium \ncosts.\n  Supporters of this bill are right about one thing: Far too many in \nthis country have little or no access to health care. The latest Census \nBureau figures released in September are alarming, to say the least. \nForty-four million of our fellow countrymen, more than one out of every \nseven people in our great Nation, were without health care in the year \n2002. This figure represents a 10 percent increase in the number of \nuninsured since the year 2000.\n  Numerous studies have shown that being uninsured has a drastic impact \non the amount and quality of care individuals receive. Put very simply, \nthe uninsured receive less care, lower quality care, and are at a \ngreater risk of dying. The Institute of Medicine has estimated that \nevery year 18,000 of our fellow citizens die prematurely in this \ncountry as a result of the effects of being uninsured.\n  Our country has a growing health care underclass. The Bush \nadministration's response to this crisis has been woefully inadequate. \nTax credits and health savings accounts will do little or nothing to \nhelp the vast majority of the 44 million people who are uninsured, such \nas low-income working families. By the way, the majority of the \nuninsured work every day on one, two, three, and four jobs. These are \nnot people sitting around doing nothing. They are working. And we have \nnothing to say to them.\n  We are debating an issue of tort reform when we ought to be dealing \nwith how to provide some health care coverage for these people and \nexplain why 18,000 lives a year are being lost prematurely because of \nthe lack of health insurance. We should be talking about creative ideas \nto offer meaningful assistance to the uninsured. There are a variety of \nideas out there that are worth discussing.\n  We also have a health care quality and patient safety problem in the \ncountry. Again, according to the Institute of Medicine, as many as \n98,000 Americans are killed every year as a result of medical errors. A \nstudy conducted by the Rand Corporation and published in the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine last year came to a similar conclusion. \nIndividuals received the recommended treatment for their condition in \nonly 55 percent of the cases, according to that study. In other words, \nnearly half the time patients did not receive the appropriate care. Why \nare we not debating that and discussing that issue today?\n  There are a variety of proposals to address this real threat to the \nAmerican public. I am currently working with our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle on issues that would have some real impact on the \nquality of care in our country. One meaningful step we can take almost \nimmediately is to encourage the use of information technology in the \nhealth care setting.\n  The Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, is deeply interested in this \nsubject matter, as are several other colleagues. Improving quality is \nthe best tool we have to address rising health care costs. Supporters \nof this legislation we are debating today would have you believe \nmedical liability costs are the main driver of rising health care \ncosts. But that is simply not the case. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas estimated that malpractice costs represent, at most, only 2 percent \nof the overall health care costs in our country.\n\n  We ought to address this issue, but let's talk about it in the \ncontext in which it is really a problem. Furthermore, while health care \ncosts more than doubled between the years 1987 and 2001, the total \namount spent on medical liability premiums rose by only 52 percent over \nthat same period. The real drivers of health care costs are \nprescription drugs and hospital spending. We should be using the time \nto pursue proposals to address these issues, including expanding the \nuse of inexpensive generic prescription drugs, better chronic disease \nmanagement and preventive medicine, and improving health care quality \nand efficiency.\n  Let me finish by saying, as ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nChildren and Families, improving the health of women and children has \nbeen a priority of mine and many others who serve on that committee, \nincluding the Presiding Officer. If my colleagues are genuinely \ninterested in healthier mothers and healthier babies, I can suggest any \nnumber of pieces of legislation that are pending here that would \nrepresent real steps towards achieving that goal. I am the coauthor of \ntwo bills, the Newborn Screening Save Lives Act and the Prematurity \nResearch Expansion and Education for Mothers who Deliver Infants Early \nAct, the PREEMIE legislation, that I believe would go a long way \ntowards improving the health and well-being of newborns. During the \n107th Congress, Senator Harkin introduced the Safe Motherhood Act a \ncomprehensive bill to ensure safe pregnancy for all women. Senator \nBingaman introduced legislation to expand health care coverage for \npregnant women under Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  There are a variety of such bills out there, offered on a bipartisan \nbasis. The Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, and I have worked very hard \non a number of these bills. I am not going to suggest they solve all \nthe problems, but they are designed to deal with some of the very \nissues pregnant women and infants face every day. The idea that you are \ngoing to put a cap on noneconomic recoveries here and that is somehow \ngoing to address these other issues is ludicrous on its face. We ought \nto be spending the valuable time of this institution in debating and \ndiscussing and getting some of this legislation passed that could make \na difference to these people.\n  I am not shy when it comes to tort reform. I have spent a good deal \nof time in my Senate career authoring bills dealing with tort reform. \nThis is not one of them. This is not tort reform. This is not \naddressing the issue that people face every day and doctors face with \nrising premiums. There is a way of addressing that problem. When we get \naround to doing it and working on it, then we can take some pride in \npassing something that does something meaningful in this area. This \nbill doesn't do it.\n  I hope cloture will be denied. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n2061, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act, and I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to vote for cloture on the motion to \nproceed on this very important legislation.\n  I would like to point out in the beginning of my remarks, in response \nto some of the statements that have been made on the floor this \nmorning, that there has to be a reason the American College for \nObstetrics and Gynecology, the American Medical Association, and just \nabout every medical group in the United States of America is supportive \nof this legislation. We would not be talking about it unless they \nreally believed the passage of this legislation would have a dramatic \nimpact on the liability costs that OB/GYNs are experiencing, causing so \nmany of them to leave their practices.\n  This is a personal issue for me. Last summer when my daughter-in-law \nwas expecting her fourth child, she learned that after the delivery, \nher doctor would no longer deliver babies. At the time, her doctor was \nin a four-physician group, all of them obstetricians. They never had \nany lawsuits against them. Yet their insurance premiums had skyrocketed \nfrom $81,000 to over $381,000 in just 3 years. That is $75,000\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\nper person over a period of 3 years. How could physicians be expected \nto afford rate hikes such as these?\n  We need to be doing something about it. This legislation is going to \nhelp. This legislation is so important because the effects of the \nmedical liability crisis can be felt acutely by the obstetrics/\ngynecology community. Data from the American Medical Association \nindicates that 19 States currently face a medical liability crisis and \n25 States show problem signs. Women of childbearing age have been \nimpacted the most because 1 out of 11 obstetricians nationwide has \nstopped delivering babies and, instead, has scaled back their practice \nto gynecology only or just gotten out of the practice. In addition, one \nin six has begun to refuse high-risk cases.\n  How does this affect a patient's access to care? As premiums \nincrease, women's access to general health care, including regular \nscreenings for reproductive cancers, high blood pressure, cholesterol, \ndiabetes, and other serious health risks, will decrease. It leads to \nmore uninsured women because of health care costs that have gone up as \na result of the fact that malpractice costs have gone up so \nastronomically in the last couple of years.\n  In 2002, 11.7 million women of childbearing age were uninsured. \nWithout medical liability reform, a greater number of women ages 19 to \n44 will move into the ranks of the uninsured. With fewer health care \nproviders offering full services, the workload has increased \nsignificantly for those who still do. Wait times increase, putting \nwomen at risk. A physician facing higher premiums is likely to practice \ndefensively, ordering more tests than medically necessary, seeking more \nopinions, and giving more referrals.\n  Women receive less prenatal care in our current environment. Improved \naccess to prenatal care has resulted in record low infant mortality \nrates, an advance now threatened as OB/GYNs drop obstetrics. As some of \nyou may have read, for the first time since 1958, the U.S. infant \nmortality rate is up. According to preliminary data released this month \nby statisticians from the CDC, the Nation's infant mortality rate in \n2002 was 7 per 1,000 births. That is up from 6.8 in 2001. Some experts \nare attributing this to poor access to prenatal care, that that is the \ncause of this problem. Women have less preventive care. Women's general \nhealth care is routinely provided by community clinics and OB/GYNs. \nWomen receive fewer screenings for reproductive cancers, high blood \npressure and cholesterol, diabetes, and other serious health risks as \nOB/GYNs and community clinics reduce care.\n  The ramifications of this medical liability crisis on women's health \ncare are shocking, and we feel this crisis very strongly in Ohio. The \nMedical Liability Monitor ranked Ohio among the top five States for \npremium increases in 2002. The OHIC Insurance Company, among the \nlargest medical liability insurers in the State, has reported that \naverage premiums for Ohio doctors have doubled over the last 3 years.\n  I would like to point out that the argument that the insurance \nindustry is ripping off doctors and raising rates to make up for \ninvestment losses, as some contended here on the floor of the Senate \nthis morning, is preposterous.\n  I invite those Members who believe this to read an article from Brown \nBrothers Harriman Insurance Asset Management Group.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From BBH & Co. Insurance Asset Management, Jan. 21, 2003]\n\n          Did Investments Affect Medical Malpractice Premiums?\n\n                        (By Raghu Ramachandran)\n\n       It's deja vu all over again in the medical malpractice \n     arena.\n       Last July, the only trauma center in Las Vegas was forced \n     to close. At the beginning of this year, doctors in \n     Pennsylvania threatened to go on strike but relented when the \n     incoming governor promised to support legislative reforms to \n     limit jury awards in malpractice suits. Also in January, \n     doctors in Weirton, West Virginia went on strike, forcing \n     patients to travel up to 40 miles to find medical care. \n     Doctors in neighboring areas of West Virginia considered \n     joining the strike, threatening a near complete shutdown of \n     the medical delivery system in the region. Doctors and \n     hospitals around the country are suspending their practices \n     and closing their doors because they can no longer afford the \n     huge and increasing cost of medical malpractice insurance. \n     The situation is increasingly reminiscent of the malpractice \n     crisis of the 1970's. What is causing this controversy and \n     what can be done about it?\n       According to Americans for Insurance Reform (AIR), \n     ``insurance companies raise rates when they are seeking ways \n     to make up for declining interest rates and market-based \n     investment losses.'' Mainstream media, such as The New York \n     Times, have picked up this argument: ``The steep drop in bond \n     yields and the stock market has also fueled the crisis.'' \n     These arguments are both misleading and inaccurate. The root \n     causes of the problem are quite different from what is often \n     suggested by the media, and their resolution is far less \n     simplistic than the pundits imply.\n       In this paper, we will analyze several variables to \n     demonstrate that asset allocation and investment returns have \n     had little, if any, correlation to the development of the \n     current malpractice problem. The crisis is rather the result \n     of a generally unconstrained increase in losses and, over \n     several years, inadequate premium income to cover those \n     losses.\n       Given that conclusion, we will then examine several \n     possible solutions and attempt to gauge the magnitude of \n     changes necessary to resolve this problem.\n       AIR uses the following graph to demonstrate that losses \n     have tracked inflation and that premiums vary because of the \n     economy. The graph attempts to compare two key trends \n     underlying the medical malpractice controversy: premiums per \n     doctor (DPW/MD) and paid losses per doctor (DLP/MD). Both of \n     these variables are expressed in constant medical dollars.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Graphs not reproducible in the Record.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                             loss inflation\n\n       AIR claims this shows ``that since 1975, medical \n     malpractice paid claims per doctor have tracked medical \n     inflation very closely.'' In fact, the graph and the \n     underlying data suggest exactly the opposite. First, they \n     make an erroneous comparison. Since AIR uses real (or \n     constant) medical dollars, they have already factored out the \n     effect of medical inflation. So, any increase is a ``real'' \n     increase in excess of medical inflation. One cannot compare \n     real increases to inflation.\n       Second, the data show loss costs have increased \n     significantly faster than inflation. Using data from the AIR \n     report, we plotted medical inflation (CPI-U), premiums, and \n     losses to show how each has grown since 1975.\n       One sees that the losses per doctor have grown at a much \n     higher rate than either medical inflation or premiums per \n     doctor. In order for losses in 2001 to have equaled the build \n     up created by inflation in medical care during the period \n     1975-2001, companies would have to reduce the amount of paid \n     losses by approximately 60%. Therefore, losses, not \n     inflation, are the problem.\n\n\n                            economic effect\n\n       The other claim made by AIR is that ``insurance premiums \n     (in constant dollars) increase or decrease in direct \n     relationship to the strength or weakness of the economy, \n     reflecting the gains or losses experienced by the insurance \n     industry's market investments and their perception of how \n     much they can earn on the investment `float'.'' \n     Unfortunately, they make this claim without any supporting \n     analysis. Using the premium data from AIR, we found no \n     correlation between premiums and the economy.\n       The standard measure of the effect one variable has on \n     another is the coefficient of determination (r\\2\\); this \n     value shows how consistently two variables move in the same \n     direction. The coefficient of determination has values \n     between 0 and 1. A value of 1 means that if the first \n     variable moves up the second will move up at the same time; a \n     value of zero means that there is no similarity in the \n     movement of the two variables. The correlation coefficient \n     has to be greater than 0.75 for us to claim the observed \n     effect between the two variables is significant.\n       As a measure of the economy, we used the year-over-year \n     change in GDP; as a measure of investment yield, we used the \n     yield on a 5-year Treasury note. In our analysis, neither the \n     direct premiums written nor the direct premiums per doctor \n     showed any significant correlation to either the investment \n     yield or GDP variable. The table lists the coefficients of \n     determination generated by the regression analysis between \n     the economy, investment yield, and medical malpractice \n     premiums.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    GDP         Yield\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDPW...........................................       0.0001       0.1255\nDPW/MD........................................       0.0104       0.0318\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Several other analyses also failed to show a correlation \n     between premiums and the economy. To test if the premium \n     increases are related to the economy or bond market, we \n     analyzed the correlation of the change in premiums to GDP and \n     investment yield. To test whether premiums go up when the \n     investment yield goes down, we analyzed the correlation \n     between premiums and the change in yield as well as the \n     correlation between the change in premiums and the change in \n     yield.\n       One could reasonably claim that the premiums (or increases \n     in premiums) are dependent not upon the company's performance \n     this year but upon the company's performance in the previous \n     year. To test this hypothesis, we regressed both premiums and\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\n     change in premiums to both the economy and investment yield \n     in the previous year. For thoroughness, we also analyzed the \n     correlation between both premiums and change in premiums with \n     the change in yields in the prior year.\n       We also considered alternate measures for GDP and yield. We \n     used industrial production as an alternate measure of the \n     economy and the 10-year Treasury note as an alternate measure \n     of yield. We also analyzed the effect the slope of the yield \n     curve and the change in slope had on premiums. We performed \n     all of the analyses above on these new variables.\n       In 64 different regressions between the economy, yield, and \n     premiums, the highest coefficient of determination was \n     0.1505. Therefore, we can state with a fair degree of \n     certainty that investment yield and the performance of the \n     economy and interest rates do not influence medical \n     malpractice premiums.\n\n\n                          Stock Market Effect\n\n        But what about the stock market? How did the drop in the \n     equity markets affect insurance company performance? Are \n     companies raising premiums because they lost money on Enron \n     or WorldCom?\n        Obviously, the market decline affects insurance companies \n     like every other investor, but the magnitude of the losses \n     gets lost in the media hype. We analyzed the equity exposure \n     in two stages. Stage one: Did medical malpractice companies \n     have an unusually large amount of equities in their \n     portfolio? Stage Two: Given their level of equity exposure, \n     did they invest prudently in the market or did they gamble by \n     investing in technology or telecom stocks?\n        Using NAIC filings, we can determine the amount of assets \n     invested in equities.\n        Over the last five years, the amount medical malpractice \n     companies have invested in equities has remained fairly \n     constant. In 2001, the equity allocation was 9.03%. We can \n     also compare how the medical malpractice sector compares to \n     other P sectors.\n       This graph shows that medical malpractice companies have \n     less invested in equities than other sectors of the industry.\n       Even if the equity allocation is not large relative to the \n     industry or other insurance sectors, is 10% the correct \n     amount for medical malpractice insurers to invest in \n     equities? Insurance companies invest their assets as a \n     fiduciary of the policyholders. As such, they must invest \n     according to a ``prudent investor'' standard. This requires \n     the company not only to consider the risk in an individual \n     security, but also the risk to the portfolio as a whole. \n     Prudent investors know that diversifying across asset classes \n     can enhance return and reduce volatility. A simple analysis \n     shows a conservative investor will have at least 10% invested \n     in equities. Thus, a prudent insurance company should have \n     some allocation to equities.\n       If the degree of equity exposure was not unusual, was the \n     investing? Again using NAIC filing data, we can analyze the \n     distribution of equity investments for medical malpractice \n     companies and compare it to S performance.\n\n                             [In percentage]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Medical\n                 Sector                     malpractice     S sector\n                                             companies        return\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnergy..................................             5.6           -11.0\nMaterials...............................             1.9            -5.4\nIndustrials.............................            11.9           -26.2\nConsumer Discretionary..................            15.9           -23.7\nConsumer Staples........................             7.3            -4.3\nHealthcare..............................            14.1           -18.8\nFinancials..............................            17.8           -14.5\nTechnology..............................            17.9           -37.4\nTelecom.................................             6.3           -34.0\nUtilities...............................             1.4           -29.5\n                                         -------------------------------\n                                                  100.0%  ..............\n                                         ===============================\n      Total Return......................          -22.4%\n      S Return........................          -22.2%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       We see that medical malpractice companies had returns \n     similar to the market as a whole. This indicates that they \n     maintained a diversified equity investment strategy.\n       As medical malpractice companies did not have an unusual \n     amount invested in equities and since they invested these \n     monies in a reasonable market-like fashion, we conclude that \n     the decline in equity valuations is not the cause of rising \n     medical malpractice premiums.\n\n\n                       where do we go from here?\n\n       In order for any form of insurance coverage to be viable, \n     the insurance company must receive more in premium dollars \n     and investment income than they pay in losses and expenses. A \n     simple measure of this is the ratio of paid losses to \n     premiums Over the last 27 years, and especially over the last \n     16, the paid loss ratio in medical malpractice coverage has \n     steadily increased. Without some form of relief, this is not \n     a good sign.\n       Although the paid loss ratio is a good starting point, that \n     metric excludes other expenses such as incurred losses, loss \n     adjustment expenses, general operating expenses, etc. as well \n     as income from investments. A.M. Best provides the combined \n     loss ratio (paid loss + change in reserves + expenses) for \n     the medical malpractice industry. By subtracting the paid \n     loss ratio, from the AIR report, from the combined ratio, we \n     can get an estimate of the other expenses for an insurance \n     company. The average expense ratio for medical malpractice \n     companies was 43% when investment income is included and 74% \n     when investment income is excluded.\n       Over the last 27 years, the average paid loss ratio was 47% \n     and the minimum paid loss ratio was 16%. In 2001, the \n     industry paid loss ratio was nearly 75%. In other words, for \n     every dollar that comes in the door, 75 cents is paid out. \n     When combined with the expense ratios cited earlier, it is \n     clear that it has been extremely difficult--if not \n     impossible--for insurance companies to earn a profit writing \n     medical malpractice insurance. Further, at this rate of \n     expenditure, after the company pays its losses and expenses, \n     there is very little ``float'' on which they can earn \n     investment income.\n\n             Medical malpractice paid loss ratio 1975-2001\n\n\n                                                             In percent\nAverage loss ratio.................................................46.8\nMinimum loss ratio.................................................15.9\n2001 loss ratio....................................................74.4\n\n       To increase profitability, companies must effect one of \n     three changes: reduce their losses, increase their premiums, \n     or increase their investment income. As the industry, in \n     aggregate, cannot control return on investments, they have \n     only two choices. Using the methodology above, we can \n     estimate the magnitude of the change required to restore \n     profitability to the industry.\n       If losses are held constant--i.e., no change in loss and \n     expense trends, then we are left with increasing premiums to \n     restore the industry to profitability. For premiums to have \n     kept up with medical inflation for the period 1975 to 2001, \n     they would have to increase by 41%. For premiums to have kept \n     up with the increases in paid losses since 1975, they would \n     have to increase by 325%. For the industry's average loss \n     ratio to drop back to its 27-year average, premiums would \n     need to rise by 59%. For the loss ratio to drop to its nadir \n     during that period, premiums would have to increase by 368%.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Dollars     % Increase\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2001 DPW/MD...................................       $9,719\nPremium required for:\n  Average Loss Ratio..........................       15,448           59\n  Minimum Loss Ratio..........................       45,478          368\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Clearly, increases of this magnitude are intolerable, for \n     both the industry and state regulators.

Unfortunately, many special medical malpractice \n     companies, such as state PIAA companies, do not have other \n     lines of business to fall back on.\n\n\n                         rating agency response\n\n       The reaction of rating agencies to these trends is another \n     important ingredient in the medical malpractice landscape. \n     Principal concerns of the agencies are ``solvency'' and the \n     ``leverage'' built into the premium and surplus structure of \n     the industry. While agencies usually express the benchmarks \n     for the measurements (ratios) in ranges, trends are also \n     important. Either level or trend can result in a downgrade in \n     a company's rating, a serious event in the corporate life of \n     an insurer.\n       In 2001, medical malpractice companies had an average \n     premium-to-surplus ratio of 0.72. As premiums are increased, \n     this ratio will rise. If premiums rise too quickly, we would \n     observe a spike in this ratio as it takes time for the \n     increased premiums to show up in surplus. Unless rating \n     agencies account for this, a company could find they cannot \n     raise their rates by the required amount for fear of \n     impairing their rating. In fact, several companies have been \n     downgraded recently, with premium leverage given as the \n     primary reason. (The situation is exacerbated by the fact \n     that with the industry suffering from reduced capacity as a \n     result of the St. Paul type experiences, companies are adding \n     to their number of insureds. This puts further strain on \n     their leverage ratios.) Fortunately, the rating agencies seem \n     to be aware of the problem.\n\n\n                             taming losses\n\n       If companies cannot increase their premiums, then they must \n     be able to control the burgeoning increase in losses. Our \n     analysis suggests that the level of losses would\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\n     have to decrease by 37% to achieve the average loss ratio and \n     by 79% to obtain the minimum loss ratio observed over the \n     past 27 years. Such reductions would require significant \n     change in the tort environment.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Dollars     % decrease\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2001 DLP/MD...................................       $7,232  ...........\nLosses required for:\n  Average Loss Ratio..........................        4,549          -37\n  Minimum Loss Ratio..........................        1,545          -79\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The paid loss number cited above includes both jury awards \n     and settlements. Large jury awards have the pernicious effect \n     of enticing more lawsuits, most of which are settled out of \n     court but with an expense to the company. Prudent reforms, \n     such as MICRA, reduce not only the jury awards but also \n     reduce the amount of lawsuits filed.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The magnitude of these changes suggests that the eventual \n     solution to the current malpractice problem will be a blend \n     of premium increases and tort reform. Since the financial \n     shortfall compounds itself over time, it is imperative that \n     the solution set be developed as quickly as possible. Without \n     significant relief in fairly short order, the country may \n     find itself facing an accelerating loss of available medical \n     care.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The subject of the article is ``Did Investments Affect \nMedical Malpractice Premiums?'' It concluded:\n\n       . . . asset allocation and investment returns have had \n     little, if any, correlation to the development of the current \n     malpractice problem.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The crisis is rather the result of a generally \n     unconstrained increase in losses and, over several years, \n     inadequate premium income to cover those losses.\n\n  The article also goes on to say:\n\n       We see that medical malpractice companies had returns \n     similar to the market as a whole. This indicates that they \n     maintained a diversified equity investment strategy. As \n     medical malpractice companies did not have an unusual amount \n     invested in equities and since they invested these moneys in \n     a reasonable market-like fashion, we conclude the decline in \n     equity valuations is not the cause of rising medical \n     malpractice premiums.\n\n  Finally, I will finish up with a summary:\n\n       The magnitude of these changes suggests that the eventual \n     solution to the current malpractice problem will be a blend \n     of premium increases and tort reform. Since the financial \n     shortfall compounds itself over time, it is imperative \n     that the solution set be developed as quickly as possible. \n     Without significant relief in fairly short order, the \n     country may find itself facing an accelerating loss of \n     available medical care.\n\n  And I contend that acceleration is well underway not only in OB/GYN \nbut in other aspects of the medical profession.\n  According to a November 2000 study of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, 59 percent of responding Ohio OB/GYNs \nhave been forced to make changes to their practice such as quitting \nobstetrics, retiring, relocating, decreasing gynecological surgical \nprocedures, no longer performing gynecologic surgery, decreasing the \nnumber of deliveries, and/or decreasing the amount of high-risk \nobstetric care because of unaffordable and unavailable medical \nliability insurance. Of the respondents, 86 percent no longer practice \nobstetrics, which forces a potential of some 14,000 pregnant Ohio women \nto find new OB/GYNs to provide their obstetric care.\n  This is not the statistics. I have received dozens of testimonials \nfrom doctors saying they are quitting their practice because of the \nrising cost of medical liability insurance. A friend of mine shared \nwith me a letter from an OB/GYN in Dublin, OH, who decided to retire \nfrom his practice.\n  He wrote the following to his patients:\n\n       On June 17, 2003, I received my professional liability \n     insurance rate quote for the upcoming year, and it is 64% \n     higher than last year's rate. I have seen my premiums almost \n     triple during the past two years, despite never having had a \n     single penny paid out on my behalf in twenty-seven years as a \n     physician. Even worse, during this time the insurance company \n     has reduced the amount of coverage that I can purchase from \n     $5 million to only $1 million, while jury verdicts have \n     skyrocketed, often exceeding $3-4 million. If I were to \n     purchase this policy, I would be putting all of my family's \n     personal assets at risk every time that I delivered a baby or \n     performed surgery. I refuse to do that.\n       I have therefore decided to retire from private practice on \n     July 31, 2003, the final day of my current liability \n     insurance policy. This is not a decision that I take lightly, \n     but unfortunately it has become necessary. For many of you, I \n     have been part of your life for years. I have delivered your \n     babies, and helped you through some of life's most difficult \n     challenges. It has truly been an honor.\n\n  I received another letter from Dr. Ben Alvarez. He worked for \nBeachwood OB/GYN. He sent a letter informing his patients he was \nrelocating to Minnesota this March. He says, in part:\n\n       The decision to leave Ohio is the direct result of the \n     medical malpractice crisis: with a clean record, my annual \n     premium will reach well over $100,000 this July. I cannot, \n     and will not, in good conscience play the insurance company's \n     game--it's just that simple. What's not simple is saying \n     good-bye to a town and people that have given me so much. Ob/\n     Gyn is so different from other medical specialties due to the \n     emotional and personal relationships that exist between us. I \n     have been blessed to have experienced with so many of you the \n     joy of a new baby's arrival; prayed about the outcome of \n     surgery; and also shared the painful moments.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the complete letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Beachwood OB/GYN, Inc.,\n\n                                   Lyndhurst, OH, January 4, 2004.\n       My Dearest Patients: It is with a heavy heart that I inform \n     you that I shall be relocating to Minnesota in March. The \n     decision to leave Ohio is the direct result of the medical \n     malpractice crisis: with a clean record, my annual premium \n     will reach well over $100,000 this July. I cannot and will \n     not, in good conscience play the insurance company's game--\n     it's just that simple.\n       What is not simple is saying good-bye, to a town and people \n     that have given me so much. Ob/Gyn is so different from the \n     other medical specialities due to the emotional and personal \n     relationships that exist between us. I have been blessed to \n     have experienced with so many of you the joy of a new baby's \n     arrival; prayed about the outcome of a surgery, and also, \n     shared the painful moments. Indeed, it is I who thank God for \n     having met you, for, because of you, I have become a better, \n     more complete, human being.\n       Do not despair over the continuity of your care. My \n     colleagues in the practice will keep the ball rolling. From a \n     practical standpoint, I would encourage you to set up follow-\n     up appointments with any one of the doctors. Drs. Varyani and \n     Goldshmidt have schedules that allow for more flexibility, \n     but Drs. Bellin, Evans, Klein and Vexler are also available \n     to continue your care. They are all excellent doctors and \n     have my complete confidence.\n       Farewell, my friends, and the best to you and your \n     families.\n           With sincere affection and melancholy.\n                                                      Ben Alvarez,\n                                                               MD.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. After speaking at a physicians' rally in Ohio, I \nreceived a letter from a young doctor, Geoff Cly. Dr. Cly received a \nnotice from the insurance carrier that the premiums would increase by \n20 percent, $30,000, this plus the $20,000 increase from the year \nbefore, forcing him to make a difficult decision of uprooting his \nfamily and practice to go to another State. Doctor Cly was unable to \nmake the insurance premiums and still take care of his student loan \nobligations and his family. He moved to Fort Wayne, IN. He said to me: \nSenator, I am going to Indiana. My liability insurance will be less \nthere. But the practice has gotten so much different than what I \nanticipated it to be that I am seriously thinking, after I pay off my \ncollege loans, I am going to get out of medicine.\n  It is a tragedy what is happening today in my State and other States \nthroughout this country. For those of my colleagues who think medical \nliability reform is a State issue, I ask them to read this letter and \nsee how the medical liability crisis transcended State lines, \nparticularly my friends from the neighboring State of West Virginia. \nOur Ohio physicians who practice along the border are feeling the \neffects of their proximity to West Virginia and its favorable \nplaintiffs' verdicts. They are feeling these effects in their \nincreasing insurance premiums.\n  It is amazing the number of counties along the West Virginia border \nand eastern Ohio where they have no more OB/GYNs. They just left. These \ncounties go bare, with no OB/GYN to provide services to protect women.\n  I could go on and give more and more examples of Ohio physicians who \nhad to leave the practice of medicine. Dr. Komorowski of Bellevue \nstopped delivering babies after 20 years when he found out the day \nafter Christmas last year that his liability insurance was tripling to \nmore than--listen to this--$180,000. Dr. Komorowski, the only \nobstetrician in Bellevue, figured it would cost him nearly 11 months of \nhis salary to pay the premium increase in addition to taxes and other \nexpenses.\n  It is out of control. We need to do something now, not just for Ohio \nbut\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\nfor the rest of the country as well. Obstetrics/gynecology is among the \ntop three specialties in the cost of professional liability insurance \npremiums. Nationally, insurance premiums for OB/GYNs have increased \ndramatically. The median premium increased 167 percent between 1982 and \n1998. The median rate rose 7 percent in 2000, 12\\1/2\\ in 2001, 15.3 in \n2002, with increases as high as 69 percent according to a survey by the \nMedical Liability Monitor, a newsletter covering the liability \ninsurance industry.\n  According to the Physicians Insurance Association of America, OB/GYNs \nwere first among 28 specialty groups in the number of claims filed \nagainst them in 2000. OB/GYNs were the highest of all the specialty \ngroups in the average cost of defending against a claim in 2000 at a \ncost of almost $35,000. In the 1990s they were first, along with family \nphysicians, general practitioners, in the percentage of claims against \nthem closed with a payment of 36 percent. They were second after \nneurologists in the average claim payment made during that same period.\n  Although the number of claims filed against all physicians climbed in \nrecent decades, the phenomena do not reflect an increased rate of \nmedical negligence. In fact, OB/GYNs win most of the claims filed \nagainst them. In 1999, an American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists survey of its membership found that over one-half, 54 \npercent of claims against OB/GYNs were dropped by plaintiff attorneys, \ndismissed or settled without payment; 54 percent of the cases that did \nproceed. OB/GYNs won 7 of 10 times. Enormous resources are spent to \ndeal with these claims, only 10 percent of which are found to have \nmerit.\n\n  The cost to defend these claims can be staggering and often mean that \nphysicians invest less in new technologies that help patients. In 2000, \nthe average cost to defend a claim against the OB/GYN was the highest \nof all physicians.\n  According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \nthe typical OB/GYN is 47 years old, has been in practice for 15 years \nand can expect to be sued 2.53 times over his or her career. Over one-\nquarter of the residents have been sued for care provided during their \nresidency. And that is another problem we are seeing in this country: \nMany residencies are going unfulfilled because of the medical \nmalpractice lawsuit abuse growth in this country. Medical school \nenrollments have been impacted by what young people are seeing \nhappening in the medical profession in this country.\n  In 1999, 76 percent of the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists fellows reported they had been sued at least once so far \nin their career. The average claim takes over 4 years to resolve. I \nknow from anyone who has been the subject of a lawsuit that 4 years is \n4 years of stress as they worry about what is going to happen as a \nresult of the outcome of that litigation.\n  The legislation we are debating today gets us on our way to turning \nthese statistics and stories around. It provides a commonsense approach \nto our litigation problems that will help keep consumers from bearing \nthe cost of costly and unnecessary litigation while making sure that \nthose with legitimate grievances have recourse through the courts.\n  Throughout my career in public service, health care has been one of \nmy top legislative priorities. We all want access to quality, \naffordable health care. We do have a problem in this country in terms \nof access to quality health care. In my State, I have conducted eight \nlistening sessions. The result from all those sessions, regardless of \nwho was there, is that the system is broken, and we need to plow new \nground.\n  When the quality is not there, when people die or are truly sick due \nto negligence or other medical error, they should be compensated. We \nwant that. But when healthy plaintiffs file meaningless lawsuits to \nshake the money tree to get as much as they can get, there is a \nsnowball effect and all of us pay the price.\n  The last time I spoke on this subject, I had the front and back cover \nof the white pages and the yellow pages of the Cleveland phonebook. The \nfront cover and back cover of both of them were advertisements for \npersonal injury lawyers giving specific examples of encouraging people \nto file suits based on the information they had in their advertisement.\n  For the system to work, we must strike a delicate balance between the \nrights of aggrieved parties to bring lawsuits and the rights of society \nto be protected against frivolous lawsuits and outrageous judgments \nthat are disproportionate to compensating the injured and made at the \nexpense of society as a whole.\n  I have been concerned about this issue since my days as Governor of \nOhio. In 1996, I essentially had to pull teeth in the Ohio Legislature \nto pass a tort reform bill. I signed it into law in October of 1996. \nThree years later, the supreme court ruled it unconstitutional. If that \nlaw had withstood supreme court scrutiny--and it should have; we now \nhave what I call a balanced supreme court in Ohio--Ohioans would not be \nfacing the medical access problems they face today: Doctors leaving \ntheir practice, patients unable to receive the care they need, and the \ncost of health insurance going through the roof.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have continued my work to alleviate \nthe medical liability crisis. To this end, I have worked with the \nAmerican Tort Reform Association to produce a study in August of 2002 \nthat captured the impact of this crisis on Ohio's economy in order to \nshare these findings with my constituents and colleagues. Guess what we \nfound. What we have in this country today, in my opinion, not only in \nthis area but in a lot of areas, is a litigation tornado that is \nripping through the economy. We found in Ohio that the litigation \ncrisis costs every Ohioan $636 per year and every Ohio family of four \n$2,544. These are alarming figures, and the numbers are from 2 years \nago. Which family do you know that can pay $2,500 for the lawsuit abuse \nof a few individuals?\n  Next to the economy and jobs, the most important issue facing our \ncountry today is health care. In fact, it is a major part of what is \nwrong with the economy. We have too many uninsured, and those who have \ninsurance face soaring premiums every year, making it less likely they \ncan continue to pay them. In addition, employers are facing spiraling \ncosts and in some cases don't even provide insurance.\n\n  I have talked to one employer after another. They say: I want to \nprovide health insurance for my workers, but I cannot afford to do it \nat $10,000 for a family of four. I am asking my employees to pay more \nof the premiums. In many instances my employees cannot afford to pay \nthe premiums so they are going without health insurance.\n  We have a real problem. Medical malpractice lawsuit abuse reform is \nhaving a dramatic impact on the cost of health insurance, in spite of \nwhat some of my colleagues have said. Providing the sort of commonsense \napproach found in the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care \nAct is a win-win situation. The bill will help decrease the rising cost \nof health care. It will give patients access to care and it will \ncurtail the rising cost of medical liability insurance for those \nphysicians who provide prenatal delivery and postpartum care to mothers \nand babies.\n  Patients will not have to give away large portions of their judgments \nto their attorneys. Truly injured parties can recover 100 percent of \ntheir economic damages. Punitive damages are reserved for those cases \nwhere they are truly justified. Doctors and hospitals will not be held \nliable for harms they did not cause and physicians can focus on what \nthey do best--practicing medicine and providing health care.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can debate this issue \nand have an up-or-down vote on this legislation impacting on our most \nimportant patients: Pregnant women and their newborn babies.\n  There was some mention made of the General Accounting Office study of \nthe medical liability crisis and access to care. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record the response of the American \nMedical Association to that General Accounting Office report. It is \nvery important.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n  Medical Liability Crisis and Access to Care--AMA's Response to the \n               General Accounting Office, September 2003\n\n        The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released \n     two reports related to\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\n     America's medical liability crisis. [U.S. General Accounting \n     Office, Medical Malpractice Insurance: Multiple Factors Have \n     Contributed to Increased Premium Rates, GAO-03-702 (June, \n     2003); and Medical Malpractice: Implications of Rising \n     Premiums on Access to Health Care, GAO-03-836 (August, \n     2003)]. The first report (June 2003) confirms that, since \n     1999, medical liability premiums skyrocketed in some states \n     and specialties--and increasing settlements and jury awards \n     (``paid claims'') are the primary drivers for these \n     increases. The second report (August 2003) confirms that \n     America's medical liability crisis is causing access to \n     health care problems in high-risk medical specialties and in \n     select locations throughout America.\n        The GAO reports also confirm what the American Medical \n     Association (AMA) has long held to be true--tort reform \n     works. Medical liability premiums in states with strong caps \n     on non-economic damages grew at a slower rate than states \n     without caps on non-economic damages.\n        We appreciate the GAO's efforts and recognize that it is \n     difficult to quantify the medical liability crisis. Among its \n     findings, the GAO confirmed that:\n        Increased losses on claims are the primary contributor to \n     higher medical liability premium rates (GAO 03-702, p. 15);\n        Premiums were higher (GAO 03-702, p. 14) and grew more \n     quickly (GAO 03-836, p. 30) in states without non-economic \n     damage caps than in states with non-economic damage caps;\n        Physician responses to medical liability pressures in the \n     five crisis states have reduced access to services affecting \n     emergency surgery and newborn deliveries (GAO 03-836, p. 5);\n        Similar examples of access reductions attributed to \n     medical liability pressures were not identified in the four \n     non-crisis states without reported problems (GAO 03-836, p. \n     5);\n        Insurers are not charging/profiting from excessively high \n     premium rates (GAO 03-702, p. 32); and\n        None of the insurance companies studied experienced a net \n     investment loss (GAO 03-702, p. 25).\n        However, the GAO's August report fails to accurately \n     reflect the severity of the current crisis. Numerous changes \n     to the GAO methodology would strengthen the basic findings of \n     this report. Among the data sources, measures, or analytical \n     methods that could be improved:\n        Examine all crisis states. To date, the AMA, in \n     conjunction with its federation of state medical \n     associations, has identified 19 states in a medical liability \n     crisis. The GAO investigated access problems in only five of \n     those states. In each of those states it found examples of \n     reduced access to care. The GAO would have found similar \n     access problems if it had examined the other 14 crisis \n     states. In fact, the GAO did not identify any access problems \n     in the four non-crisis states it examined. Therefore, the \n     GAO's conclusion that access problems are not widespread is \n     not substantiated.\n        Recognize increased impact on rural areas. Health care \n     access problems do not have to affect every part of a state \n     to create crisis conditions. Health care by its nature is \n     local, where a loss of just one or a few physicians or other \n     health care providers in a community can have a traumatic \n     impact on the availability of health care services in that \n     community. Many rural areas suffered from physician shortages \n     prior to the recent escalation in liability premiums. It is \n     precisely in those areas where access is already threatened \n     that one would first notice the impact of physician's \n     relocation or curtailment of certain services.\n       Appropriately measure physician mobility. Physician counts \n     were based on state licensure data, which do not accurately \n     reflect the number of physicians practicing in a given \n     location. Actual physician practice location information must \n     be used instead.\n       Relying on the total number of licensed physicians is a \n     state to track physician mobility is inappropriate. According \n     to James Thompson, MD, President and CEO of the Federation of \n     State Medical Boards of the U.S. (FSMB) in September 2003: \n     ``The number of licensed physicians in a state is not an \n     accurate measure of whether patients have adequate access to \n     health care. Physicians may reduce their practice, stop \n     treating high-risk patients, or stop practicing altogether \n     and still maintain their license. Also, the number of \n     licensed physicians is not an accurate indicator of the \n     distribution of those physicians in underserved areas. \n     Licensed physicians may work in administrative, academic or \n     other settings where they may not have a clinical practice. \n     Also, many retired physicians maintain a license. Information \n     in the Federation of State Medical Boards' database shows \n     that approximately 60% of physicians are licensed in more \n     than one state which indicates that they are licensed in \n     states where they do not maintain a full-time or part-time \n     practice.''\n       Accurately count physicians by specialties and local \n     markets. The GAO's method of measuring physician supply and \n     potential access to care is not appropriate. Physician/\n     population ratios that aggregate physicians across local \n     markets and specialties obscure the significant market-\n     specific or speciality-specific changes in the supply of \n     physicians and availability of critically important medical \n     services. Similarly, the number of high-risk sub-specialists \n     that depart from any locality would likely account for only a \n     small percentage of physicians in the state.\n       Use multi-payor data to accurately measure access to health \n     care services that Medicare data alone do not capture. \n     Utilization statistics based exclusively on data from a \n     single payor (Medicare) exclude data for obstetric and \n     emergency care, and fail to capture the impairment of access \n     among other vulnerable populations, such as Medicaid \n     patients. Medicare data are inadequate to identify changes in \n     obstetric services because a vast majority of Medicare \n     eligible beneficiaries are beyond reproductive age. \n     Limitations in the data also preclude an assessment of \n     changes in emergency room services. Therefore, the report \n     significantly understates the impact of rising liability \n     insurance premiums because it does not examine two clinical \n     areas in which impairment of patient access has been the most \n     severe--obstetric and emergency room services.\n       The AMA will continue to advocate on behalf of patients and \n     physicians for national reforms similar to those already \n     passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. America's \n     patients are the ones who will suffer if Congress does not \n     act soon. This is a crisis. It is not waning, and without \n     real reforms more patients will be unable to find a doctor to \n     deliver a baby, perform life-saving trauma surgery, or \n     provide other critical care to high-risk patients who need it \n     most.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I will summarize quickly some of the conclusions. It \nsays: The GAO August report fails to accurately reflect the severity of \nthe current crisis. Numerous changes in the GAO methodology would \nstrengthen the basic findings. Among the data sources, measures, \nanalytical methods that could be improved: Examine all crisis States. \nTo date, the AMA, in conjunction with its federation of State medical \nassociations, has identified 19 States that have a medical liability \ncrisis.\n  They also suggest recognizing the increased impact on rural areas, \nwhich GAO did not do; approximately measure physician mobility. \nPhysician accounts were based on State licensure data which do not \naccurately reflect the number of physicians practicing in a given \nlocation. Actual physician practice location information must be used \ninstead.\n  They should accurately count physicians by specialties and local \nmarkets and use multi-payor data to accurately measure access to health \ncare services that Medicare data alone do not capture.\n  I can tell you I have not completely read the GAO report, but I have \nread portions of it. Its connection to reality in my State is not \nthere. I have talked to David Walker about it. I have talked to the \npeople who did the report and encouraged them to look at some of the \nsuggestions the AMA made and perhaps do another study that would \naccurately reflect what is really going on today in this country in \nterms of medical malpractice increases and what it is doing to access \nto health care.\n  I would like to end my remarks with the words of Dr. Evangeline \nAndarsio. Dr. Andarsio is an OB/GYN from Dayton, OH. I met Dr. Andarsio \nat a physicians rally in Ohio. I will never forget that day. It was \nOctober of 2002. It was very cold. I was freezing. In fact, when I got \nup, my teeth were chattering. But prior to my getting up, Dr. Andarsio \nstarted to speak. I thought to myself, this doctor is just going to go \non and on and on. And I was cold. But as she started, as I listened \nintently to what she was saying, I was moved by her remarks. This was \ntruly a dedicated physician who loved her patients, loved what she was \ndoing, and who was unable to practice medicine the way she wanted to \nbecause of this malpractice lawsuit abuse problem she is confronted \nwith in our State.\n  I would like to close with a quote from her speech:\n\n       Help us to maintain an ability to have a practice that \n     offers patients excellent access to care--to continue one of \n     the most important relationships in our lives--the doctor-\n     patient relationship--thus maintaining individualized and \n     compassionate care.\n\n  That is what much of this debate is about. It is about physicians \nbeing able to practice medicine and do it in a way they did back when \nmy wife Janet and I were having our four children. There is a special \nrelationship between an OB/GYN and a family. It breaks my heart to see \nso many of them leaving the practice of medicine because of these \nmalpractice costs with which they are confronted.\n  We do have a crisis. This Senate is going to have to face up to it. I \nam hoping that we will have 60 votes today on cloture on the motion to \nproceed. I think we need to debate this issue. This issue has to be \ndebated and the American people who are not aware of the crisis need to \nbe made aware of it.\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the present situation relative to \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 37 minutes and the \nother side has 12 and a half minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Florida wanted 20 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that he be allowed to proceed after I speak for 20 \nminutes, but to the extent his time exceeds 12 minutes, it be debited \nagainst the time of the Democratic membership after we come back from \nthe policy lunches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Ohio for an \nexcellent statement outlining the gravity of the problem we face, which \nis that women in this country are losing access to OB/GYN doctors, \nespecially if they want to have babies. As a result, we are putting a \nlot of pressure on a lot of people--women, specifically, in their \nbirthing years--and making it difficult, especially in rural areas, to \nget the type of health care we want them to get.\n  We are a society that is built around the concept of babies and \nchildren, and that is one of the more exciting things that happens in \neverybody's lifetime. Yet we are a society making it extraordinarily \ndifficult now for doctors who practice the delivery of children and \nbabies to practice their trade.\n  As I have said before, lawyers don't deliver children. Doctors \ndeliver children. Unfortunately, the doctors are being driven out of \nthe business by attorneys, and the cost of their malpractice premiums \nare going up radically. As a result, many doctors in my State are not \ndelivering children anymore. I went through the specifics of that \nyesterday. I want to read a compelling letter I received from Debbie \nRisteen. She lives in Derry, NH. She has six children.\n  She wrote:\n\n       I regret I could not be here with you in person today to \n     tell you my story myself, as it would have been quite an \n     honor for me. Let me tell you a little about myself. I am a \n     mother of 6 whose ages range from 12 to 8 months. I love \n     children and I homeschool. One of my favorite things of our \n     married life has been being pregnant and delivering our \n     babies. What an incredible time all 6 have been!\n       I would like to describe to you a word picture for a \n     moment. . . . It was a very difficult decision for me to \n     decline coming to speak to you all today. One that took a lot \n     thought. I need to weigh the cost at such a short notice. As \n     much as I wanted to be here today, my family needed me more. \n     If anything happened especially with the baby . . . I would \n     be so far away to be able to meet the need and it would take \n     me awhile to get to NH. In this picture, I now want you to \n     see the importance of a pregnant woman needing the care of \n     her OB. Someone she can depend on, trust in the decisions \n     that lie ahead and most of all close in case of an emergency \n     just like my family is depending on me.\n       You see, my heart was broken this Christmas when I learned \n     of our dear friend, Dr. Pat Miller, would not be doing what \n     was closest to her heart . . . delivering babies. I could not \n     believe it, you are so wonderful at this, people need you, I \n     would tell her.\n       12\\1/2\\ years ago we made one of the biggest decisions of \n     our lives . . . to begin a family. When we got the exciting \n     news, we were busy looking for the best care, a doctor who \n     was up on the latest, one who could handle complications, a \n     hospital close by, and the list went on. We learned of a new \n     OB in the area . . . Pat Miller. We heard she was all the \n     things we were looking for and more. We were thrilled to be \n     in the care of someone as wonderful as her. Through all of \n     our visits we became very close friends and I knew she truly \n     cared about me, the child, and my husband. Being our first \n     and not knowing what to expect, I knew she was right there if \n     anything was to happen and I trusted her wisdom to do what \n     was best for the both of us. As a matter of fact, 3 of our \n     children were born on her day off and she spent the day at \n     the hospital in case we needed her for any emergencies. It \n     was a tremendous comfort not only to me through these 9 \n     months, but also for my husband to know we were in the best \n     care and it was close. We knew that no matter what lied ahead \n     she was there and would make the best choices. As our family \n     began to grow it was a huge help to have her close by, \n     especially when bringing 1 then 2 and so on with me. I have \n     been so fortunate through 6 pregnancies to not have any \n     complications, but as we all know, there are no guarantees to \n     this. Other women are not as fortunate as me, but I would \n     love for them to be able to have the same comfort and trust \n     that I have experienced with our OB. I love our children \n     dearly, and I love babies, and my hearts desire in sharing my \n     story with you, is for legislators to hear 1st hand the \n     importance of people, like Pat Miller, to be able to continue \n     what she loves and does best. To be able to provide an \n     environment in which OB's can continue to deliver babies. To \n     allow other mothers the same opportunity of trust and \n     friendship that we still have today with our OB. Please \n     listen to my heart . . . we need people like Pat Miller back \n     in OB where she does what she knows best. Thank you for \n     listening.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Debbie Risteen.\n\n  That is a pretty compelling letter. It is anecdotal, but it is an \nanecdote happening across this country. Stories are being retold. Women \nare losing their OBs because these physicians are getting out of the \npractice of delivering babies because of the cost of their malpractice \ninsurance. This bill will help alleviate that problem, and it is \nabsolutely critical to give women this access and to not do things \nextremely discriminatory against women, and especially women who wish \nto become pregnant and have children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2061, the \nHealthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act, the principal \nsponsors of which were Senator Gregg and Senator Ensign.\n  Much of America cannot access basic medical services because lawsuits \nare driving insurance premiums through the roof and driving doctors \nliterally out of business. Seven months ago a majority of Senators \nvoted to try to do something about this problem. Unfortunately, not a \nsingle Democratic Senator supported our effort and therefore we could \nnot overcome a filibuster and were prevented from even considering S. \n11, the Patients First Act of 2003.\n  In the last 7 months, the crisis has gotten no better. That is the \nbad news. The good news is our resolve has not waned so again we are \nbefore the American people waiting and willing to roll up our sleeves \nto fix this problem if our friends on the other side of the aisle will \nlet us have a chance.\n  Like the bill we offered last July, the reforms we are now proposing \nare tried and true. They are based on California's MICRA legislation, \nwhich for a quarter of a century has stabilized insurance premiums and \nhelped ensure access to health care for those in the Golden State. The \nHealthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act would allow \nplaintiffs to recover unlimited economic damages, up to a quarter \nmillion dollars in noneconomic damages, and punitive damages up to the \ngreater of a quarter million or twice economic damages.\n  While the reforms in S. 2061 are similar to those in MICRA and S. 11, \nthe scope of S. 2061 is much more narrow. The bill we are asking the \nSenate to begin considering today pertains only to obstetrics and \ngynecological services. If our friends across the aisle will not help \nus protect all medical professionals with MICRA-type reforms, then \nperhaps they will let us take this important step toward reform by \nprotecting at least one specialty.\n  OB/GYNs provide some of the most critical medical services in our \ncountry. Unfortunately, OB/GYNs also suffer from some of the highest \npremiums. As a result, women and children across our country are placed \nin danger as they struggle to find, oftentimes unsuccessfully, basic \nobstetric care. This is a nationwide problem. Data from the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists illustrates the legal and \nfinancial jeopardy faced by OB/GYNs across our country today.\n  Obstetrics and gynecology are among the top three specialties with \nthe highest professional liability insurance premiums. OB/GYNs were No. \n1 among 28 specialty groups in the number of claims filed against them. \nOB/GYNs were also the highest of all specialty groups in the average \ncost of defending against a claim. OB/GYNs are also facing enormous \nincreases in the average payout of claims brought against them.\n  For example, back in 1996, the average award against an OB/GYN was \n$254,495. Between 1996 and 1998, the average award went up to about \n$350,000--from $250,000 up to $350,000 in 2 years. By 2000, the average \naward against an OB/GYN had increased to about $400,000. That is an \nincrease of almost 40 percent in 4 short years.\n  This phenomenon is even more striking when one looks at cases \ninvolving alleged brain injuries to newborns.\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\nSuch cases account for 30 percent of all claims against OB/GYNs but \nresearch shows physician error is responsible for fewer than 4 percent \nof neurologically impaired infants. Despite the rarity of physician \nerror in these cases, the average award in these few cases where \nobstetricians are at fault has dramatically increased in just a few \nyears. In 1996, the average award in these type cases was about \n$460,000. Two years later, the average award had doubled to $935,000.\n\n  Today, the median award in childbirth cases has risen to over $2 \nmillion. This is the highest category of award for all types of medical \nliability cases. American women should not be misled by these \nstatistics. They should not worry that despite annual advances in \nmedical technology and training there is somehow an increasingly poor \nlevel of obstetric care in this country.\n  No, these troubling statistics do not mean America's medical schools \nhave lowered their standards and a rash of incompetent obstetricians \nhas begun to practice medicine. In fact, according to the Society of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, over 80 percent of all cases that went \nto verdict against an OB/GYN resulted in judgments for the physician. \nIn other words, on average eight out of 10 cases that went to trial \nagainst OB/GYNs were not meritorious.\n  It is the dramatic increase in awards noted above and the specter of \nsuch awards in settlement negotiations that is driving malpractice \npremiums through the roof, not a lowering of medical standards for \npractice.\n  Looking at my own State, the immediate result of skyrocketing \nliability premiums is the doctors pack up and move to a State such as \nCalifornia with liability reform or they just simply close their doors \naltogether. When this happens, the ultimate victims, of course, are the \npatients, the mothers and their children.\n  Let's take a look at the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Kentucky does not \nhave a medical liability reform system. Not surprisingly, liability \ninsurance rates for OBs in my State increased 64 percent in one year \nfrom 2002 to 2003. Also not surprisingly in the last 3 years, Kentucky \nhas lost one-fourth of its obstetricians.\n  Moreover, Kentucky has lost nearly half its potential obstetric \nservices during this time when one factors in those who have limited \ntheir practices.\n  As this chart I have shows, roughly 60 percent of the counties in the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky have no obstetrician at all--none. These are \ncounties in red on this map. It is a majority of the counties in my \nState that have no obstetricians at all.\n  Other counties, such as Perry County, down in southeast Kentucky, \ndown this way, technically have a practicing OB/GYN, but that one \ndoctor has stopped delivering babies within the last year, so if you \nare in Perry County, that doesn't do you much good. Still other \ncounties, such as Greenup, Lawrence, and Johnson Counties, in northeast \nKentucky, have just one OB/GYN in each county, so if you are a woman in \nthose counties you better hope there is not another woman having a baby \nwhen you are, or the doctor isn't out of town or busy with another \npatient. If that happens, you are going to have to drive through the \nhills on the backroads of eastern Kentucky to try to find a doctor to \ndeliver your baby. All told, 82 of Kentucky's 120 counties have no OBs, \nor just have one OB.\n  According to Dr. Doug Milligan of Lexington, who specializes in \ncaring for women with high-risk pregnancies, 11 OBs in eastern Kentucky \nhave recently quit delivering babies or left the State, forcing women \nto drive for hours.\n  According to Dr. Milligan, apart from problems with delivering \nbabies, some women are developing complications because they are not \ngetting prenatal care.\n  So what should we conclude from all of this? The situation I have \njust described is not, unfortunately, unique to Kentucky. As you will \nhear from my colleagues, States across the country are in similar \nstraits. So I commend Senator Gregg and Senator Ensign for trying to \naddress this important problem.\n  As I have said earlier, their legislation is modeled on reforms that \nhave stood the test of time in California, and it has been endorsed by \nthe American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, and a host of other medical organizations.\n  I hope a dozen brave souls on the other side of the aisle will give \nthe Senate a chance to consider this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand there was an agreement for \nthe allocation of time evenly divided between the two parties this \nmorning, and that there has also been an agreement to divide the time \nduring the afternoon.\n  I have talked with our leadership. They have indicated I could use 10 \nminutes of our time this afternoon, for the Democratic side, and use it \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What adjustment has to be made in the afternoon will be \nmade.\n  Mr. President, I intend to speak to the issue before us, medical \nmalpractice, in a moment. I will yield myself 6 minutes now and then I \nwill speak on the medical malpractice in just a moment.\n\n\n                     The Federal Marriage Amendment\n\n  Earlier today the President announced his endorsement of the Federal \nmarriage amendment. By endorsing this shameful effort to write \ndiscrimination back into the Constitution, President Bush has betrayed \nhis campaign promise to be ``a uniter, not a divider.''\n  The Constitution is the foundation of our democracy and it reflects \nthe enduring principles of our country. We have amended the \nConstitution only 17 times in the two centuries since the adoption of \nthe Bill of Rights. Aside from the amendment on prohibition, which was \nquickly recognized as a mistake and repealed 13 years later, the \nConstitution has often been amended to expand and protect people's \nrights, never to take away or restrict their rights.\n  By endorsing this shameful proposal, President Bush will go down in \nhistory as the first President to try to write bias back into the \nConstitution.\n  Advocates of the Federal marriage amendment claim it will not prevent \nStates from granting some legal benefits to same-sex couples, but that \nis not what the proposed amendment says. By forbidding same-sex couples \nfrom receiving ``the legal incidents of marriage,'' the amendment would \nprohibit State courts from enforcing many existing State and local \nlaws, including laws that deal with civil unions and domestic \npartnerships and other laws that have nothing to do with such \nrelationships.\n  Just as it is wrong for a State's criminal laws to discriminate \nagainst gays and lesbians, it is wrong for a State's civil laws to \ndiscriminate against gays and lesbians by denying them the many \nbenefits and protections provided for married couples.\n  The proposed amendment would prohibit States from deciding these \nimportant issues for themselves. This Nation has made too much progress \nin the ongoing battle for civil rights to take such an unjustified step \nbackwards now.\n  We all know what this is about. It is not about how to protect the \nsanctity of marriage, or how to deal with activist judges. It is about \npolitics, an attempt to drive a wedge between one group of citizens and \nthe rest of the country, solely for partisan advantage. We have \nrejected that tactic before and I hope we will do so again.\n  The timing of today's statement is also a sign of the desperation of \nthe President's campaign for reelection. When the war in Iraq, jobs and \nthe economy, health care, education, and many other issues are going \nbadly for the President and his reelection campaign is in dire straits, \nthe President appeals to prejudice in a desperate tactic to salvage his \ncampaign.\n  I am optimistic the Congress will refuse to pass this shameful \namendment. Many of us on both sides of the aisle have worked together \nto expand and defend the civil rights of gays and lesbians. Together, \non a bipartisan basis, we have fought for a comprehensive Federal \nprohibition on job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. \nWe have fought together to expand the existing Federal hate\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\ncrimes law to include hate crimes based upon this flagrant form of \nbigotry.\n  I hope we can all agree that Congress has more pressing challenges to \nconsider than a divisive, discriminatory constitutional amendment that \nresponds to a nonexistent problem. Let's focus on the real issues of \nwar and peace, jobs and the economy, and the many other priorities that \ndemand our attention so urgently in these troubled times.\n  Mr. President, as to the issue that we will be voting on this \nafternoon, on the medical malpractice legislation, I spoke on this \nissue yesterday but there are a few additional points that I wish to \nmake today.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                    medical malpractice legislation\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today's vote of S. 2061 is a test of the \nSenate's character. In the past, this body has had the courage to \nreject the simplistic and ineffective responses proposed by those who \ncontend that the only way to help doctors is to further hurt seriously \ninjured patients. Unfortunately, as we saw in the Patients' Bill of \nRights debate, the Bush administration and congressional Republicans \nare again advocating a policy which will benefit neither doctors nor \npatients, only insurance companies. Caps on compensatory damages and \nother extreme ``tort reforms'' are not only unfair to the victims of \nmalpractice, the do not result in a reduction of malpractice insurance \npremiums.\n  Once more, we must stand resolute.\n  We must not sacrifice the fundamental legal rights of seriously \ninjured patients on the altar of insurance company profits. We must not \nsurrender our most vulnerable citizens--seriously injured women and \nnewborn babies--to the avarice of these companies.\n  This bill contains most of the same arbitrary and unreasonable \nprovisions which were decisively rejected by a bipartisan majority of \nthe Senate last year. The only difference is that last year's bill took \nbasic rights away from all patients, while this bill takes those rights \naway only from women and newborn babies who are the victims of \nnegligent obstetric and gynecological care. That change does not make \nthe legislation more acceptable. On the contrary, it adds a new element \nof unfairness.\n  This legislation would deprive seriously injured patients of the \nright to recover fair compensation for their injuries by placing \narbitrary caps on compensation for non-economic loss in all obstetrical \nand gynecological cases. These caps only serve to hurt those patients \nwho have suffered the most severe, life-altering injuries and who have \nproven their cases in court.\n  They are the children who suffered serious brain injuries at birth \nand will never be able to lead normal lives. They are the women who \nlast organs, reproductive capacity, and in some cases even years of \nlife. These are life-altering conditions. It would be terribly wrong to \ntake their rights away. The Republicans talk about deterring frivolous \ncases, but caps by their nature apply only to the most serious cases \nwhich have been proven in court. These badly injured patients are the \nlast ones we should be depriving of fair compensation.\n  A person with a severe injury is not made whole merely by receiving \nreimbursement for medical bills and lost wages. Noneconomic damages \ncompensate victims for the very real, though not easily quantifiable, \nloss in quality of life that results from a serious, permanent injury. \nIt is absurd to suggest that $250,000 is fair compensation for a child \nwho is severely brain injured at birth and, as a result, can never \nparticipate in the normal activities of day-to-day living; or for a \nwoman who lost her reproductive capacity because of an OB/GYN's \nmalpractice.\n  This is not a better bill because it applies only to patients injured \nby obstetrical and gynecological malpractice. That just makes it even \nmore arbitrary.\n  The entire premise of this bill is both false and offensive. Our \nRepublican colleagues claim that women and their babies must sacrifice \ntheir fundamental legal rights in order to preserve access to OB/GYN \ncare. The very idea is outrageous.\n  For those locales--mostly in sparsely populated areas--where the \navailability of specialists is a problem, there are far less drastic \nways to solve it. It is based on the false premise that the \navailability of OB/GYN physicians depends on the enactment of draconian \ntort reforms. If that were accurate, States that have already enacted \ndamage caps would have a higher number of OB/GYNs providing care. \nHowever, there is in fact no correlation. States without caps actually \nhave 28.4 OB/GYNs per 100,000 women, while States with caps have 25.2 \nOB/GYNs per 100,000 women.\n  And that is only one of many fallacies in this bill. If the issue is \ntruly access to obstetric and gynecological care, why has this bill \nbeen written to shield from accountability HMOs that deny needed \nmedical care to a woman suffering serious complications with her \npregnancy, a pharmaceutical company that fails to warn of dangerous \nside effects caused by its new fertility drug, and a manufacturer that \nmarkets a contraceptive device which can seriously injure the user? Who \nare the authors of this legislation really trying to protect?\n   In reality, this legislation is designed to shield the entire health \ncare industry from basic accountability for the care it provides to \nwomen and their infant children. It is a stalking horse for broader \nlegislation which would shield them from accountability in all health \ncare decisions involving all patients. While those across the aisle \nlike to talk about doctors, the real beneficiaries will be insurance \ncompanies and large health care corporations. This legislation would \nenrich them at the expense of the most seriously injured patients; \nwomen and children whose entire lives have been devastated by medical \nneglect and corporate abuse.\n   When will the Republican party start worrying about injured patients \nand stop trying to shield big business from the consequences of its \nwrongdoing?\n   If we were to arbitrarily restrict the rights of seriously injured \npatients as the sponsors of this legislation propose, what benefits \nwould result? Certainly less accountability for health care providers \nwill never improve the quality of health care. It will not even result \nin less costly care. The cost of medical malpractice premiums \nconstitutes less than two-thirds of 1 percent--0.66 percent--of the \nNation's health care expenditures each year. Malpractice premiums are \nnot the cause of the high rate of medical inflation.\n   In this era of managed care and cost controls, it is ludicrous to \nsuggest that the major problem facing American health care is \n``defensive medicine.'' The problem is not ``too much health care,'' it \nis ``too little'' quality health care.\n   A CBO report released in January of this year rejected claims being \nmade about the high cost of ``defensive medicine''. Their analysis \n``found no evidence that restrictions or tort liability reduce medical \nspending.'' There was ``no statistically significant difference in per \ncapita health care spending between States with and without limits on \nmalpractice torts.''\n   The White House and other supporters of caps have argued that \nrestricting an injured patient's right to recover fair compensation \nwill reduce malpractice premiums. But, there is scant evidence to \nsupport their claim. In fact, there is substantial evidence to refute \nit. In the past year, there have been dramatic increases in the cost of \nmedical malpractice insurance in States that already have damage caps \nand other restrictive tort reforms on the statute books, as well as the \nStates that do not. No substantial increase in the number or size of \nmalpractice judgments has suddenly occurred which would justify the \nenormous increase in premiums which many doctors are being forced to \npay.\n   The reason for sky-high premiums cannot be found in the courtroom.\n   Caps are not only unfair to patients, they are also an ineffective \nway to control medical malpractice premiums. Comprehensive national \nstudies show that medical malpractice premiums are not significantly \nlower on average in States that have enacted damage caps and other \nrestrictions on patient rights than in States without these \nrestrictions. Insurance companies are merely pocketing the dollars \nwhich patients no longer receive when ``tort reform'' is enacted.\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\n   Focusing on premiums paid by OB/GYN physicians, the evidence is the \nsame. Data from the Medical Liability Monitor shows that the average \nliability premium for OB/GYNs in 2003 was actually slightly higher in \nStates with caps of damages--$63,278--than in States without caps--\n$59,224. It also showed that the rate of increase last year was higher \nin States with caps--17.1 percent--than it was in States without caps--\n16.6 percent.\n   This evidence clearly demonstrates that capping malpractice damages \ndoes not benefit the doctors it purports to help. Their rates remain \nvirtually the same. It only helps the insurance companies earn even \nbigger profits. As Business Week Magazine concluded after reviewing the \ndata, ``the statistical case for caps is flimsy.'' That was in the \nMarch 3, 2003 issue.\n   If a Federal cap on non-economic compensatory damages were to pass, \nit would sacrifice fair compensation for injured patients in a vain \nattempt to reduce medical malpractice premiums. Doctors will not get \nthe relief they are seeking. Only the insurance companies, which \ncreated the recent market instability, will benefit.\n  Insurance industry practices are responsible for the sudden dramatic \npremium increases which have occurred in some States in the past 2 \nyears. The explanation for these premium spikes can be found not in \nlegislative halls or in courtrooms, but in the boardrooms of the \ninsurance companies themselves.\n  Insurers make much of their money from investment income. Interest \nearned on premium dollars is particularly important in medical \nmalpractice insurance because there is a much longer period of time \nbetween receipt of the premium and payment of the claim than in most \nlines of casualty insurance. The industry creates a ``malpractice \ncrisis'' whenever its investments do poorly. The combination of a sharp \ndecline in the equity markets and record low interest rates in recent \nyears is the reason for the sharp increase in medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums. What we are witnessing is not new. The industry has \nengaged in this pattern of behavior repeatedly over the last 30 years.\n  Last year, Weiss Ratings, Inc., a nationally recognized financial \nanalyst conducted an in-depth examination of the impact of capping \ndamages in medical malpractice cases. Their conclusions sharply \ncontradict the assumptions on which this legislation is based. Weiss \nfound that capping damages does reduce the amount of money that \nmalpractice insurance companies pay out to injured patients. However, \nthose savings are not passed on to doctors in lower premiums.\n  Between 1991 and 2002, the Weiss analysis shows that premiums rose by \nsubstantially more in the States with damage caps than in the States \nwithout caps. The 12-year increase in the annual malpractice premium \nwas 48.2 percent in the States that had caps, and only 35.9 percent in \nthe States that had no caps. In the words of the report:\n\n       On average, doctors in States with caps actually suffered a \n     significantly larger increase than doctors in States without \n     caps . . . . In short, the results clearly invalidate the \n     expectations of cap proponents.\n\n  Doctors, especially those in high-risk specialties, whose malpractice \npremiums have increased dramatically over the past few years, do \ndeserve premium relief. That relief will only come as the result of \ntougher regulation of the insurance industry. When insurance companies \nlose money on their investments, they should not be able to recover \nthose losses from the doctors they insure. Unfortunately, that is what \nis happening now.\n  Doctors and patients are both victims of the insurance industry. \nExcess profits from the boom years should be used to keep premiums \nstable when investment earnings drop. However, the insurance industry \nwill never do that voluntarily. Only by recognizing the real problem \ncan we begin to structure an effective solution that will bring an end \nto unreasonably high medical malpractice premiums.\n  There are specific changes in the law which should be made to address \nthe abusive manner in which medical malpractice insurers operate. The \nfirst and most important would be to subject the insurance industry to \nthe Nation's anti-trust laws. It is the only major industry in America \nwhere corporations are free to conspire to fix prices, withhold and \nrestrict coverage, and engage in a myriad of other anticompetitive \nactions. A medical malpractice ``crisis'' does not just happen. It is \nthe result of insurance industry schemes to raise premiums and to \nincrease profits by forcing anti-patient changes in the tort law. I \nhave introduced with Senator Leahy, legislation which will at long last \nrequire the insurance industry to abide by the same rules of fair \ncompetition as other businesses. Secondly, we need stronger insurance \nregulations which will require malpractice insurers to set aside a \nportion of the windfall profits they earn from their investment of \npremium dollars in the boom years to cover part of the cost of paying \nclaims in lean years. This would smooth out the extremes in the \ninsurance cycle which have been so brutal for doctors. Thirdly, to \naddress the immediate crisis that some doctors in high risk specialties \nare currently facing, we should provide temporary premium relief. This \nis particularly important for doctors who are providing care to \nunderserved populations in rural and inner city areas.\n  Unlike the harsh and ineffective proposals in S. 2061, these are real \nsolutions which will help physicians without further harming seriously \ninjured patients. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership continues to \nprotect their allies in the insurance industry and refuses to consider \nreal solutions to the malpractice premium crisis.\n  This legislation--S. 2061--is not a serious attempt to address a \nsignificant problem being faced by physicians in some States. It is the \nproduct of a party caucus rather than the bipartisan deliberations of a \nSenate committee. It was designed to score political points, not to \nachieve the bipartisan consensus which is needed to enact major \nlegislation. For that reason, it does not deserve to be taken seriously \nby the Senate.\n  I withhold whatever time I have and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold on suggesting the \nabsence of a quorum?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold suggesting the absence of the quorum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/24/senate-section/article/S1487-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the state of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 4:50 is evenly divided.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise to speak in support of S. 2061, the Healthy Mothers and \nHealthy Babies Access to Care Act.\n  This bill addresses the medical liability and litigation crisis in \nour country, a crisis that is preventing patients from receiving high \nquality health care--or, in some cases, any care at all because doctors \nare being driven out of practice. This crisis is limiting or denying \naccess to vital medical care and needlessly increasing the cost of care \nfor every American.\n  As you will recall, we have previously tried to remedy this crisis in \naccess to care. Most recently, we debated S. 11 which failed to receive \nthe 60 votes necessary to invoke cloture last July. You have to have a \nsupermajority now on these types of issues because of the opponents of \nthis bill--and some others.\n  The time to act is now. The health care crisis is jeopardizing access \nto health care for many Americans. The medical liability crisis is also \ninhibiting efforts to improve patient safety and is stifling medical \ninnovation. Excessive litigation is adding billions of dollars in \nincreased costs and reduced access to high quality health care.\n  Defensive medicine is way out of whack. We are spending billions of \ndollars on unnecessary defensive medicine because doctors are terrified \nthey are going to be sued in these frivolous lawsuits--called medical \nliability suits--by personal injury lawyers.\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\n  I am deeply concerned that we are needlessly compromising patient \nsafety and quality health care. We know about 4 percent of \nhospitalizations involve an adverse event, and 1 percent of \nhospitalizations involve an injury that would be considered negligent \nin court.\n  These numbers have been consistent in large studies done in New York, \nCalifornia, Colorado, and in my home State of Utah. However, the \nequally troubling statistic is only 2 percent of cases with actual \nnegligent injuries result in claims, and less than one-fifth--17 \npercent--of claims filed actually involve a negligent injury.\n  This situation has been likened to a traffic cop who regularly gives \nout more tickets to drivers who go through green lights than those who \nrun red lights. Clearly, nobody would defend that method of ensuring \ntraffic safety, and we should not accept such an insufficient and \ninequitable method of ensuring patient safety. Numbers are a searing \nindictment of the current medical liability system. I personally \nbelieve we can do better for the American people, and the Healthy \nMothers and Babies Act is an important step in that path.\n  The problem is particularly acute for women who need obstetrical and \ngynecologic care because OB/GYN is among the top three specialties with \nthe highest professional liability insurance premiums. This has led to \nmany doctors leaving practice and to a shortage of doctors in many \nStates, including my home State of Utah.\n  Studies by both the Utah Medical Association and the Utah Chapter of \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists underscore the \nproblem in my State. Over half--50.5 percent--of family practitioners \nin Utah have already given up obstetrical services or never practice \nobstetrics. Of the remaining 49.5 percent who still deliver babies, \n32.7 percent say they plan to stop providing OB services within the \nnext decade. Most plan to stop within the next 5 years.\n  An ACOG survey from August 2002 revealed that over half--53.16 \npercent--of OB/GYNs in Utah have changed their practice, such as \nretiring, relocating, or dropping obstetrics because of the medical \nliability reform crisis. This change in practice leaves 1,458 pregnant \nUtahns without OB/GYN care.\n  The medical liability crisis, while affecting all medical specialties \nand practices, hits OB/GYN practices especially hard, and I suspect \nthis is true of every State in the Union. Astonishingly, over three-\nfourths, 76.5 percent, of obstetricians/gynecologists report being sued \nat least once in their career. Indeed, over one-fourth of OB/GYN \ndoctors will be sued for care given during their residency. These \nnumbers have discouraged Americans finishing medical school from \nchoosing this vital specialty. Currently, one-third of OB/GYN residency \nslots are filled by foreign medical graduates compared to only 14 \npercent one decade ago. OB/GYN doctors are particularly vulnerable to \nunjustified lawsuits because of the tendency to blame the doctor for \nbrain-injured infants, although research has proven that physician \nerror is responsible for less than 4 percent of all neurologically \nimpaired babies.\n  Ensuring the availability of high-quality prenatal and delivery care \nfor pregnant women and their babies, the most vulnerable members of our \nsociety, is imperative. We simply must pass this bill.\n  In August 2003, a GAO report concluded that actions taken by health \nproviders as a result of skyrocketing malpractice premiums have \ncontributed to health care access problems. These problems include \nreduced access to hospital-based services for deliveries, especially in \nrural areas. In addition, the report indicated that States that have \nenacted tort reform laws with caps on noneconomic damages have slower \ngrowth rates in medical malpractice premiums and claims payments. From \n2001 to 2002, the average premiums for medical malpractice insurance \nincreased about 10 percent in States with caps on noneconomic damages. \nIn comparison, States with more limited reforms experienced an increase \nof 29 percent in medical malpractice premiums.\n  Medical liability litigation directly and dramatically increases \nhealth care costs for all Americans. Unfortunately, a high percentage \nof those cases are brought in order to get the defense costs by, in \nmany respects, lawyers who are not true to their profession, who are \npersonal injury lawyers seeking to make a buck.\n  In addition, skyrocketing medical litigation costs indirectly \nincrease health care costs by changing the way doctors practice \nmedicine. Defensive medicine is defined as medical care that is \nprimarily or solely motivated by fear of malpractice claims and not by \nthe patient's medical condition. According to a survey of 1,800 doctors \npublished in the Journal of Medical Economics, more than three-fourths \nof doctors believed they must practice defensive medicine. A 1998 study \nof defensive medicine by Mark McClellan, our current head of the FDA \nwho has been nominated now to be head of CMS, used national health \nexpenditure data that showed medical liability reform has the potential \nto reduce defensive medicine expenditures by $69 billion to $124 \nbillion in 2001, an amount that is between 3.2 and 5.8 times the amount \nof malpractice premiums.\n  The financial toll of defensive medicine is great and especially \nsignificant for reform purposes as it does not produce any positive \nhealth results nor benefits. Not only does defensive medicine increase \nhealth care costs, it also puts Americans at avoidable risk. Nearly \nevery test and every treatment has possible side effects. Thus every \nunnecessary test, procedure, and treatment potentially puts a patient \nin harm's way.\n  Seventy-six percent of physicians are concerned that malpractice \nlitigation has hurt their ability to provide quality care to patients. \nWhat can we do to address this crisis? The answer is plenty. There are \nexcellent examples of what works.\n  Last March, the Department of Health and Human Services released a \nreport describing how reasonable reforms in some States have reduced \nhealth care costs and improved access to quality health care. More \nspecifically, over the last 2 years in States with limits of $250,000 \nto $350,000 on noneconomic damages, premiums have increased an average \nof just 18 percent, compared to 45 percent in States without such \nlimits.\n  California enacted the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act, also \nknown as MICRA, more than a quarter century ago. MICRA slowed the rate \nof increase in medical liability premiums dramatically without \naffecting negatively the quality of health care received by the State's \nresidents. As a result, doctors are not leaving California. \nFurthermore, between 1976 and 2000, premiums increased by 167 percent \nin California, while they increased three times as much, 505 percent, \nin the rest of the country. Consequently, Californians were saved \nbillions of dollars in health care costs, and Federal taxpayers were \nsaved billions of dollars in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n\n  No one in this body, perhaps with the exception of our colleague from \nTennessee, Dr. Bill Frist, our majority leader, is more keenly aware of \nthe defects in this system than I. Before coming to Congress, I \nlitigated several medical liability cases. I defended health care \nproviders. I have seen the heart-wrenching cases in which mistakes were \nmade and where judgments should have been brought. But more often I \nhave seen heart-wrenching cases in which mistakes were not made and \ndoctors were forced to expend valuable time and resources defending \nthemselves against frivolous lawsuits.\n  I have seen a lot of cases where there was no injury at all that were \nbrought by unscrupulous personal injury lawyers, running up the cost to \nall the doctors, to the whole system. A high percentage of these cases \nare brought merely for defense costs because it cost so much to defend \nthese cases that even the defense costs mean a pretty good fee if you \nare charging 30 to 40 percent.\n  The recent Institute of Medicine report, ``To Err is Human,'' \nconcluded that ``the majority of medical errors do not result from \nindividual recklessness or the actions of a particular group. This is \nnot a bad apple problem. More commonly, errors are caused by faulty \nsystems, processes, and conditions that lead people to make mistakes or \nfail to prevent them''. We need reform to improve the health care \nsystems and processes that allow errors to occur and to identify better \nwhen malpractice has not occurred.\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\n  The reform I envision would address litigation abuses in order to \nprovide swift and appropriate compensation for malpractice victims, \nredress for serious problems, and ensure that medical liability costs \ndo not prevent patients from accessing the care they need. We need to \nmove ahead with legislation to improve patient safety and reduce \nmedical errors, and we need urgently to address the medical liability \ncrisis so that more women are not denied access to quality medical care \nbecause it has become too expensive for their OB/GYN doctors to \ncontinue their practice.\n  The Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act will allow \nus to begin ensuring women and babies get the medical care they need \nand deserve. Without tort reform, juries are awarding astounding and \nunreasonable sums for pain and suffering. A sizable portion of those \nawards goes to the attorney rather than to the patient. The result is \nthat doctors cannot get insurance and patients cannot get the care they \nneed and deserve.\n  All Americans deserve the access to care, the cost savings, and the \nlegal protections that States such as California provide their \nresidents. Today's bill will allow us to begin to address this crisis \nin our health care system, gives women and their babies access to their \nOB/GYN doctors, and enables doctors to provide high-quality, cost-\neffective medical care.\n  I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues to support \ncloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \ndebate this afternoon with respect to the cloture vote, any Democratic \nspeakers be limited to 10 minutes each. The reason I propound this \nrequest is that we have less than an hour left on our side. We have a \nnumber of speakers who have a desire to speak. If we have a limited \ntime, they will not be able to do that. I ask unanimous consent that be \nthe order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I do not object to that. I appreciate the \ntime consideration. The Senator from California is kind enough to allow \nme to proceed. I ask unanimous consent that she immediately follow me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first, I am here to speak on S. 2061 and \nask our colleagues to support it. Many of my colleagues have already \nspoken of the pressing need for this legislation, so I will not repeat \ntheir words now. What I will speak about is how the medical liability \ncrisis has played out in my region of the country, the Pacific \nNorthwest. I believe the situation as it exists there provides clear \nevidence of the need for national reform.\n\n  My story is the tale of two States, my home State of Idaho and our \nneighbor to the west, Oregon. Idaho enacted its original tort reform \nlegislation in 1987. This legislation limited the award of noneconomic \ndamages in personal injury cases to $400,000. This limit was indexed to \ninflation. Oregon also enacted tort reform legislation in 1987. Like \nthe Idaho law, the Oregon law limited the award of noneconomic damages \nin personal injury cases. Oregon's law placed this limit at $500,000.\n  Unlike Idaho however, where the tort reform measure withstood \njudicial scrutiny, and has since been strengthened by the Idaho State \nLegislature in 2003, Oregon's law was struck down by the State supreme \ncourt in 1999. Since the cap was removed, there have been 20 \nsettlements and jury awards of more than $1 million.\n  As expected, the costs of these awards have been passed on to medical \nprofessionals in the form of higher medical malpractice insurance \npremiums. The Eugene Oregon Register Guard reported on March 19, 2003, \nthat obstetricians who have base coverage ($1 million per claim, $3 \nmillion aggregate per year) through Northwest Physicians Mutual, a \ndoctor-owned insurance company, have seen their premiums increase \nnearly threefold, from $21,895 in 1999 to $61,203 in 2003. The same \narticle referred to a statewide survey conducted by researchers at \nOregon Health and Science University which found that since 1999, 125 \ndoctors have quit delivering babies in Oregon--representing about 25 \npercent of doctors providing obstetric care. Nearly half of these \nphysicians, 48 percent, cited insurance costs and 41 percent said they \nfeared lawsuits.\n  The article goes on to tell the story of an Oregon physician who is \nabandoning his practice in Eugene, in order to establish a new practice \nin Coeur d'Alene, ID. The physician stated that he was attracted to \nIdaho because the State has safeguards in place for doctors. These \nsafeguards have helped keep malpractice premiums down in Idaho. Indeed, \nthe Idaho Medical association reports that physicians in Idaho for some \nhigh-risk specialities, such as obstetrics and gynecology, pay about \nhalf of what their counterparts in Oregon pay.\n  While I welcome any healthcare providers who wish to practice in \nIdaho, I do not wish to see women of a neighboring State, or any State, \nsuffer from lack of available health care because medical providers \ncannot afford to purchase malpractice insurance in their home State.\n  Now as a firm proponent of our Federal system, I have always believed \nthat it is preferable to solve problems at the level of government \nclosest to the people. And my preference here would have been for State \ngovernments to address this issue, as indeed many have. However, many \nother States have either not enacted reform legislation, or as in the \ncase of Oregon, have found their efforts at reform sidetracked by \noverzealous judges. And, as the medical liability crisis in the 19 \nStates identified by the AMA now threatens to overwhelm the entire \nNation's medical liability system, I feel that now is the time to \naddress this issue at the national level.\n  A Federal law is required to ensure that reforms will be effected in \nall States. Furthermore, the language of S. 2061 will protect States \nwith existing caps. At the same time it will protect health care \nproviders by establishing a Federal standard for noneconomic damages \nlimits, even if such caps are barred by a State constitution, such as \nin Oregon. By allowing State autonomy in the setting of liability \nlimits, this bill respects our tradition of federalism.\n  Since this body refused to vote for cloture on a related bill last \nJuly, the general accounting Office has issued a report assessing the \neffects that rising malpractice insurance premiums have had on the \npublic's access to health care. This report, released in August of last \nyear, confirmed instances in the five ``crisis'' States studied where \nactions taken by physicians in response to malpractice pressures have \nreduced access to services affecting emergency surgery and newborn \ndeliveries. No instances of reduced access to heath care were \nidentified in the four ``non-crisis'' States studied.\n  The August report follows an earlier GAO report that examined the \ncauses of the dramatic increase in malpractice insurance rates. That \nearlier report found that ``losses on medical malpractice claims--which \nmake up the largest part of insurer's costs--appear to be the primary \ndriver of rate increased in the long run.''\n  Together these two studies provide strong evidence that: (1) Rising \nclaims costs are driving up the cost of malpractice insurance; (2) the \nrising cost of insurance is causing medical service providers to take \nactions which have limited access to health care; and (3) the \nimposition of noneconomic damages caps, as well as the other reform \nmeasures included in this bill, are effective in constraining the rise \nof insurance premiums.\n  From the Pacific Northwest to the Florida Keys, the problem is clear \nand the solution is clear. The only question awaiting clarification is \nwhether this body possesses the resolve to pass this much-needed \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, I want to tell the story of two States \nas it relates to this issue and the bill, Healthy Mothers and Healthy \nBabies Access to Care Act, addressing that problem. The States are \nIdaho and Oregon. In 1987, Idaho and Oregon passed identical laws--or \nrelatively identical laws. In the State of Idaho, we capped our \npersonal injury cases at $400,000. Oregon capped them at $500,000. \nUnlike Idaho, the Oregon Supreme Court, in a period of time immediately \nfollowing that, struck down the Oregon action. Idaho did not.\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\n  Idaho not only held its law but then strengthened that law in 2003. \nHere is the rest of the story. Idaho strengthened its law in 2003. \nOregon struck down its law in 1999. But they both started in the same \nplace. Since the cap was removed in Oregon, there have been 20 \nsettlements for injury awards of well over a million dollars.\n  As expected, the cost of these awards has been passed on to the \nmedical professional in the form of higher medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums. The Eugene, Oregon Register Guard reported on March \n19, 2003, that obstetricians who have base coverage--that is, $1 \nmillion per claim, $3 million per aggregate per year--through Northwest \nPhysician Mutual, a doctor-owned insurance company, have seen their \npremiums increase nearly threefold, from $21,895 in 1999, to 61,203 in \n2003. The same article referred to a statewide survey conducted by \nresearchers at Oregon Health and Science University, which found that \nsince 1999, 125 doctors have quit delivering babies in Oregon--\nrepresenting about 25 percent of the doctors providing obstetric care. \nNearly half of these physicians, 48 percent, cited insurance costs, and \n41 percent said they feared lawsuits.\n  The article went on to talk about one Eugene, OR, physician who moved \nto Coeur d'Alene, ID. The reason he moved to Idaho is because in our \nState of Idaho, their insurance premiums are substantially less because \nthe cap we placed in the law has held the test of the courts.\n  The reality is that we are trying to set the stage nationwide. We are \nall aware--and many colleagues have come to the floor of the Senate to \ntalk about it--of the studies done, the GAO report, the high-cost \nStates, and the OB/GYN doctors fleeing from those States, and as a \nresult making it very difficult in some instances for pregnant women to \nreceive the kind of health services they need and, in fact, upon time \nof delivery, to know they have a doctor waiting at their side to help \nthem.\n  As medical liability crises in these 19 identified States loom, it is \ntime we speak with uniformity across the Nation. That is exactly what \nthis bill does. I hope that our colleagues can support cloture and we \ncan move to a final vote on this bill. Clearly, the American people are \nnow expecting us to speak out.\n  Last week, I held a health care conference in Boise. One of the \nprimary concerns was the rapidly rising cost of health care. One of the \ncomponents of that escalation in cost is the very thing we are \nattempting to address today. So I hope the Senate can stand with \nreasonable unity. Myself and others understand the politics of the \ntrial bar. When is enough enough?\n  If we don't, by this action, deny access to the courts by those who \nare truly injured--and we don't--then why are we allowing a certain \nsegment of our society, in the litigious manner they have chosen, to \nline their pockets. Who is the beneficiary? The patient? In many \ninstances, they are not. Yet costs go up simply because of the risk \ninvolved.\n  We ought to be protecting the patient and, in this case, the average \ncitizen of this country on both sides of that equation by making sure \nthey can gain true access to the courts when true injury results and, \nat the same time, making sure we are wise enough to hold down the \nincreasing costs of health care, assisted by the dramatic increase in \npremium costs to our physician. This is a step toward that kind of a \nsolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho for his courtesy. I cannot support this bill. I don't believe it \nreflects compromise. I don't think it is materially changed from the \nbill that failed to get 50 votes last July. The major difference, as I \nsee it, in this bill is that the liability restrictions apply to only \none medical specialty group, obstetricians and gynecologists.\n  This bill sets a national cap of $250,000 for noneconomic damages. \nThe cap applies not only to suits against doctors but to suits against \nHMOs and to manufacturers of gynecological or obstetric products as \nwell.\n  So, under this bill, the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device would be \nshielded by this $250,000 cap regardless of the harm caused.\n  Moreover, this bill severely limits the availability of punitive \ndamages against OB/GYNs and manufacturers of related products. The bill \nwould also immunize manufacturers or sellers of gynecological products \napproved by the FDA from punitive damages.\n  The FDA exemption sets, in a way, a downward course. If a company has \nan FDA-approved product on the market and then learns of dangerous \ncomplications, the company must remove the product from the marketplace \nimmediately. To provide an exemption for products with FDA approval may \nwell be a disincentive to prompt removal from the shelf.\n  I am one who believes there needs to be a solution to rising \nmalpractice insurance premiums. I want to talk to that solution in just \na moment. But, it is correct that obstetricians and gynecologists are \nreeling under exorbitant medical malpractice premiums.\n  Obstetricians and gynecologists had more claims against them and paid \nout more money to plaintiffs than any other medical specialty between \n1985 and 2000.\n  Prior to the State of Florida passing medical liability caps last \nyear, OB/GYNs in Florida paid over $200,000 annually for malpractice \ninsurance.\n  OB/GYNS in California, a State with liability caps, pay an average in \nmalpractice insurance of $57,000, which is about a quarter of what it \nis in Florida.\n  According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \n20 percent of obstetricians and gynecologists in Nevada are leaving \ntheir practice due to rising malpractice insurance costs. Twenty \npercent of OB/GYNs in West Virginia and Georgia have been forced out of \ntheir practice. I could go on and on and on.\n  I want to talk for a moment about California, and then I want to talk \nabout what I think is a logical solution to this. But up to this point, \nthe AMA and my own medical association, the California Medical \nAssociation, won't buy it. Congress can and should provide some \nlegislative relief.\n  MICRA, the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act, took place 29 \nyears ago in California. MICRA set a precedent in the ensuing years for \nreform measures in several States. The MICRA law provides a model.\n  Last year, I spent several months reviewing MICRA to see what could \nbe transferred to the national level.\n  I have come to believe it is possible that reasonable caps on \nliability can lead to affordable premiums.\n  When MICRA was enacted in 1975, the cost of health insurance in \nCalifornia was higher than in any market except New York City. In the 6 \nyears before 1975, the number of malpractice suits filed per hundred \nphysicians in California had more than doubled.\n  MICRA has kept costs down. In 1975, California's doctors paid 20 \npercent of the gross costs of all malpractice insurance premiums in the \ncountry. Today, it is 11 percent.\n  California's premiums grew 167 percent over the past 25 years \ncompared to 505 percent in other States. So the growth in California is \njust about less than a third of what it is in the rest of the United \nStates.\n  In California, patients get their money faster. Cases in California \nsettle 23 percent faster than in States without caps on noneconomic \ndamages.\n  MICRA allows patients to obtain health care costs, recover for loss \nof income, and receive the funds they need to be rehabilitated. And \nCalifornia's malpractice premiums are now one-third to one-half lower \non average than those in Florida and New York.\n  The proposal I would put out for people to study today takes those \nparts of MICRA which I thought could serve as a national model. For \nexample, a schedule of attorney's fees; a strict statute of limitations \nrequiring that medical negligence claims be brought within 1 year from \nthe discovery of an injury or within 3 years of the injury's \noccurrence; the requirement that a claimant give a defendant 90 days' \nnotice of his or her intent to file a lawsuit before a claim can \nactually be filed; allowing defendants to pay damage awards in periodic \ninstallments; and allowing defendants to introduce evidence at trial to \nshow that claimants have already been compensated for their injuries \nthrough workers' compensation benefits, disability benefits, health \ninsurance, or other payments; and permitting the recovery of\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\nunlimited economic damages. All of these points are now in play in \nCalifornia. I believe they are applicable nationally.\n  The differences from the California MICRA that I would propose would \nbe in two key areas. The first is noneconomic damages, and the second \nwould be punitive damages. The California MICRA law has a $250,000 cap \non noneconomic damages. That is what is proposed in the pending bill. \nIn contrast, I would propose a national $500,000 flex cap, a general \ncap on noneconomic damages. This cap would allow a State to impose a \nlower or a higher limit, but it would be pivotal for those States where \nthe State laws do not currently allow a State to set a cap. This would \nallow in those States for the cap to be $500,000.\n  In catastrophic cases where a victim of malpractice was subject to \nsevere disfigurement, severe disability, or death, the cap would be the \ngreater of $2 million or $50,000 times the number of years of life \nexpectancy of the victim. This handles the situation of a very young \nvictim who was really the victim of egregious malpractice.\n  In addition, my proposal would have less onerous punitive damages \nstandards than California law. California law would require a plaintiff \nto prove punitive damages under the very high standard of fraud, \noppression, or malice. Under this standard, I am not aware of a single \ncase where a plaintiff has obtained punitive damages in California over \nthe past 10 years. However, if the State wanted to keep that--any \nState--they could under my proposal. But I would offer a four-part test \nwhere a plaintiff would have to show by clear and convincing evidence \nthat the defendant (1) intended to injure the claimant unrelated to the \nprovision of health care; (2) understood the claimant was substantially \ncertain to suffer unnecessary injury, and in providing or failing to \nprovide health care services, the defendant deliberately failed to \navoid such injury; (3), acted with a conscious, flagrant disregard of a \nsubstantial and unjustifiable risk of unnecessary injury which the \ndefendant failed to avoid; or, (4), acted with a conscious, flagrant \ndisregard of acceptable medical practices in such circumstances.\n  I firmly believe a variant of this type could lead to a compromise in \nthe Senate, but the AMA and my own medical association, the California \nMedical Association, both flatly rejected this proposal last year. They \nrefused any cap for noneconomic damages above $250,000 even in \ncatastrophic cases. To me this makes little sense because a $250,000 \ncap in 1975, which was when the cap was put in play in California, \nadjusted for inflation, was worth $839,000 in 2002. If $250,000 was \nadequate in 1975, why wouldn't a figure of a half a million dollars--\n$500,000--which is lower than the cap adjusted for inflation, be \nacceptable in 2004? If a victim receives $250,000 today, it is the \nequivalent of $40,000 in 1975 dollars.\n\n  There are many specific instances of why a $250,000 noneconomic \ndamage, especially today, remains too low. Let me just give you one \ncase. I happened to meet this woman, and it is a case that I think \nmakes my argument irrevocably. It is the case of Linda McDougal. She is \n46. She is a Navy veteran, an accountant, and a mother. She was \ndiagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer and underwent a double \nmastectomy. Two days later, she was told that a mistake was made. She \ndidn't have cancer, and the amputation of her breasts was not \nnecessary. A pathologist had mistakenly switched her test results with \nanother woman who had cancer.\n  A cap on noneconomic damages must take into account severe morbidity \nproduced by a physician's mistake, such as amputating the wrong limb or \ntransfusing a patient with the wrong type of blood.\n  I remain a supporter of malpractice insurance reform. If at any time \nthere would be physician support, I believe then the necessary 60 votes \nin this body could be generated for a plan such as I have just \nenumerated.\n  In conclusion, I will vote against this bill but stand ready to \nparticipate in a solution along the lines I have mentioned.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before Senator Feinstein leaves the \nChamber, she has laid out what may well be a very reasonable \nalternative for this body and our colleagues in the House to consider \nwith respect to medical malpractice. She has played a vital role as we \nhave worked over the last several years to craft a compromise on class \naction reform and offered maybe the critical amendment to the bill.\n  What I would like to do in the 10 minutes I am going to speak is \ncompare and contrast, if I can, the approach in bringing this medical \nmalpractice bill to the Senate today with the approach that has been \nfollowed as we have tried to bring class action reform legislation to \nthe Senate floor.\n  Let me step back for a moment. For those who may be listening to this \ndiscussion, class action reform seeks to address the issue of when a \nclass of people are harmed what kind of redress do they have to seek \ncompensation? I think most of us would agree that if a person were \nharmed by a product, good, or service that they had come in contact \nwith or acquired that that person should be made whole. I think we \nwould also agree if a whole class of people were somehow damaged by a \nproduct, good, or service that they came in contact with that the class \nof people should be made whole.\n  The question is, In what forum should those damaged persons, the \ndamaged class, the plaintiff class--where do they turn to for redress \nto gain compensation for their injury or for their harm?\n  In my view, and I think it is a view probably shared by a majority of \nmy colleagues, we believe that if the plaintiff class happens to be in \na State different from the State that the defendant is from, our \nConstitution would suggest that maybe in those cases that rather than \nthe case being litigated in the State where all of the plaintiffs are \nlocated, if the defendant is from another State, that the fair thing to \ndo to both the defendant and the plaintiff is to litigate that matter \nin Federal court. That has been a subject of some debate.\n  It is not an issue that involves limits on punitive damages, \neconomic, noneconomic damages, pain and suffering. The debate does not \nlie there. Rather, the debate lies in the area of in what court, in \nwhat jurisdiction should those kinds of questions be resolved.\n  I have been in the Senate for a bit more than 3 years. During that \ncourse of time, there have been any number of hearings in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and in the House Judiciary Committee to bring \nbefore the respective panels in both bodies those who believe that we \nneed to change the status quo with respect to class action litigation \nand those who think that what we have is just fine.\n  Proponents and advocates have had the opportunity to speak their \npoints of view and to testify repeatedly in the Senate and in the \nHouse. In fact, over the last couple of years, this is what has \nhappened in the Senate: Legislation has been developed in committee, it \nhas been debated in committee, it has been amended in committee, and it \nhas been brought to the floor in an effort to try to have it debated, \namended, and voted on.\n  Last fall, we were able to get 59 votes to proceed to the bill, to \ntake it up and offer amendments on the floor, but on class action we \nfell just short of the 60 that we needed to invoke cloture. So we went \nback and we did some more work. Those of us who think changes are \nnecessary worked with some of our Democrat colleagues, three of them \nespecially, and others as well, to come up with changes that would make \nthe bill better, fairer, and more defensible. Hopefully, within the \nnext several weeks we will have the opportunity to debate that on the \nfloor and to offer further amendments to class action reform \nlegislation.\n  It has been a long process, some would say too long. What happens is \nwe start off with a reasonable proposal, debate it in committee, \nimprove it in committee, report it out of committee, and then we are \ngoing to have the opportunity to bring the bill to the floor and it \nwill be altered, I think improved, when that same bill comes to the \nfloor.\n  Once the bill is on the floor, we will have the opportunity for full \nand open debate to consider what people like about it and do not like \nabout it. They can offer their changes and we will have an up-or-down \nvote at the end of\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\nthe day when we have amended the bill. That is what we call regular \norder. That is the way an issue of this nature should be decided.\n\n  To my knowledge, maybe in the last 3 years there has been one hearing \nin one committee in the Senate on the issue of medical malpractice. If \nthere have been others, I am not aware of them. A year ago, there was \none hearing in one committee on this issue. I do not believe the bill \nhas been marked up in that committee.\n  They did not vote on that bill in that committee. They did not seek \nto amend this medical malpractice bill in that committee. Instead, we \nsimply find a related bill appearing on the Senate agenda with no \nopportunity to offer amendments, to improve it as maybe Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Durbin, or others would like to do but, rather, to \nhave to kind of take it or leave it. That is not regular order and that \nis not the way to build consensus, particularly on an issue as \ndifficult and as contentious as this one.\n  Another issue we have been dealing with, which involves litigation \nreform, is the subject of asbestosis. We all know that for many years \npeople used asbestos. It was used in all kinds of projects, \nconstruction, automobiles, brakes, ship construction. Asbestos was \ncommonly used. We later found out that it kills people. It causes \nasbestosis, mesothelioma, and other diseases. We now have been working \nfor years to try to figure out how do we compensate the victims of \nasbestos exposure to make them whole. That process is one that has gone \non for any number of years, too. The process we followed there is the \nopportunity to fully debate the issue in committees, to hold hearings \nin committees, where people who are for and against it have a chance to \nexpress their views. There are a lot of interested parties such as \ninsurance companies, manufacturers, labor unions, the trial bar, and \nothers that have had the opportunity to add their input. I hope what we \nnow have coming to the Senate floor sometime later this spring is \nlegislation that says maybe the way we handle asbestos litigation in \nthis country can be improved on so we make sure people who are sick and \ndying of asbestos exposure get the help they need, and make sure people \nwho are not sick will not ever be sick and do not siphon off money from \nthose who truly need it. We need to come up with a fair system and one, \nfrankly, that will stem the loss of companies, corporations, and \nbusinesses that are going bankrupt by the scores of asbestos exposure.\n  If we compare the way this body has approached class action reform \nlegislation, in a very deliberate and thoughtful fashion, with plenty \nof opportunity for debate and changes, and compare that with what is \nbefore us today, it is night and day. There is really very little \nsimilarity.\n  I suggest to our friends on the other side of the aisle that on this \nparticular issue if they are interested in finding a fair and \nreasonable solution, there are a number of us on this side of the aisle \nwho would be willing to engage with them to find that. In the meantime, \nI would suggest they take a look at what States are doing.\n  Senator Feinstein talked about her own State. In Delaware, the \nGovernor put together a group, not a partisan group but a group that \nincludes the trial bar, health providers, hospital representatives, \nfolks within government and outside of government, to try to figure out \nif we needed to make any changes in our own State with respect to \nmedical malpractice.\n\n  In the end, they said: We do not think we have a problem in Delaware \nwith physicians being unable to get the coverage at a reasonable price. \nWe do not have out of control jury awards. This is not a huge Delaware \nproblem. Rather, they did suggest one change which I think is \ninstructive. What they did was said why do we not provide for the \ncertification of medical malpractice litigation to certify that it is \nnot a frivolous lawsuit. If someone wants to bring a suit before it \nends up in court, there will be a panel of knowledgeable people within \nthat area of health care who will look at the assertion of the \nplaintiff and decide whether or not this is a frivolous lawsuit. If it \nis, the litigation does not go forward. That is what one State is \ndoing, as a temporary measure.\n  I close by saying this: Unlike asbestos litigation reform, which \nneeds a national solution, unlike class action litigation reform, which \nI believe needs a national solution, for the most part States can deal \nwith on a case-by-case, State-by-State basis issues revolving around \nmedical malpractice. I think for the most part we are better off \npursuing that. Not everybody will agree with me on that point, but I \nthink most people in this body will agree on this point, and that is \nthe right way to legislate on these contentious issues is the approach \nwe have taken with respect to class action reform and the approach we \nare taking with respect to asbestos litigation reform, where all sides \nhave the opportunity to be heard, Members get to offer their amendments \nin committee and on the floor and then we go forward. That is the way \nto do business, and if we do business on those bases and in that \naccord, on a more consistent basis, we will be able to not only talk \nabout doing something that needs to be done but actually accomplish it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             Chicken Hawks\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a troubling issue \nthat has plagued our political debate for many years and now has come \nto a head. I cannot stay silent any longer.\n  We so much admire the eagle, the bird of strength, the bird that \nportrays the courage of America, the willingness to support our country \nno matter what the cost. That is what the eagle says to me. At times it \nhas been an endangered species. But there is another bird I want to \ntalk about today. That bird is called, in my view, the chicken hawk. \nThere is such a bird, but usually it is the hawk chasing the chicken. \nBut now I want to talk about the chicken that really chases the hawk.\n  Those of us who answered our Nation's call for military service at \nwartime have not grandstanded on that issue. We served our country and, \nfrankly, many of my colleagues who answered the call are not always \nwilling to talk about their experiences.\n  But now I see a disturbing trend from the other side of the political \naisle. More and more, Senators in this body are tagged as lax on \nnational security or homeland security or support for the military \nbecause of votes they took against problematic defense bills over the \nyears. For years the charge coming from across the aisle is that \nDemocrats are somehow or other less patriotic, less supportive of \ndefense, and it is a shameful and grotesque charge. In my view these \ncharges typically come from people I would simply call chicken hawks.\n  My definition of a chicken hawk is someone who talks tough on \nnational defense and military issues, casts aspersions on others who \nmight disagree on the vote, but when they had a chance to serve, they \nwere not there. Now they are attacking the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor opposing bloated or poorly designed defense bills. Is it known how \nmuch courage it takes to vote against a bad Defense authorization or \nappropriations bill? We all know it takes a lot of political courage, \nbecause even if the bill contains wasteful and damaging provisions, the \nvote can be twisted by your opponents. But when faced with a bad \ndefense bill, what do the chicken hawks do? They take the easy road. \nThey fly the easy route. They always vote for it, no matter what it \nsays. How much courage does it take to vote for a bad defense bill? \nNone. Zero. It is the easy thing to do.\n  Our colleague, the distinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts, \nis being attacked this week by the other side of the aisle as being \nweak on support for the military and compromising the defense of our \ncountry. I say shame on those who impugn the patriotism of those who \nsupported their country's call for duty and paid for it with injuries \nresulting from their obedience to that call.\n  In my view, that is the cry of the chicken hawk who has no idea what \nit means to have the courage to put your life at risk to defend your \ncountry and its ideals. But the Senator from Massachusetts knows it all \ntoo well. When our country went to war in southeast Asia, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts enlisted in the Navy. He requested to be sent to \nVietnam to fight for his country, and he did that. For his heroic\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\nservice in Vietnam, the Senator from Massachusetts won the Silver Star, \nthe Bronze Star, three Purple Hearts--that means he was wounded three \ntimes; it is a miracle he is still alive--the Combat Action Ribbon, the \nNavy Presidential Unit Citation, the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the \nVietnam Campaign Medal. How dare they challenge his commitment to our \ndefense? His patriotism?\n\n  The Senator's action took courage. It is the same courage the Senator \nshowed when he refused to vote for defense bills merely because they \nwere defense bills. As a man who has seen a battlefield, he has a keen \nunderstanding of military needs and military policy and he voted \naccordingly. He actually did what his constituents sent him here to do: \nevaluate legislation on its merits and vote with your conscience and \nyour obligation to our citizens.\n  Did it take courage? Of course. Integrity? Of course. Was it an easy \nthing to do? Absolutely not. The easy thing to do would be to simply \nvote for all the defense bills, no matter what they say, and pretend \nthese votes are the real measure of patriotism. That is what the \nchicken hawks do. That is the easy road.\n  It is the same easy road we see when someone files for five student \ndeferments and then claims an old football injury should prevent him \nfrom fighting for his country. Only a chicken hawk would attack a \npolitical rival who lost three limbs in Vietnam as being soft on \ndefense.\n  So I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we are not \ngoing to put up with these insinuations that attack our patriotism, our \nsupport for our troops, anymore. Because real patriotism and real \nsupport for our Nation's defense should not be judged on whether we \nignore our constitutional duty and rubberstamp legislation. Real \npatriotism and support for the defense of this country has to do with \nanswering the call. In my view, as a fellow veteran, the Senator from \nMassachusetts not only answered the call to fight for his country, but \nalso to perform his duty and judge legislation on its merits.\n  I served in the Army. It doesn't mean I should approve $1,500 toilet \nseats or poorly designed military equipment that is being procured \nsimply because of political influence. In fact, I believe because I \nserved, I have the duty to the men and women who are now in the \nmilitary to make sure our military is strong and is as free from waste \nand corruption as possible, and our military men and women are \nprotected to the fullest extent possible during their service and, when \nthey are veterans, to provide for their health care needs and other \nservices without question.\n  Our job is to think as Senators and not to bow to everything defense \ncontractors or Pentagon officials want. The Senator from Massachusetts \nhas voted for plenty of defense spending increases, but he has also \nvoted to prevent bad programs from moving forward. He does his duty to \nhis country and to his constituents.\n  The way I see it, the President and his proxies are attempting to \nbring American politics back to the days of dirty tricks. We saw it in \n2000, not against just Al Gore but also against the most serious \nRepublican challenger, the Senator from Arizona. The Bush campaign \ncoordinated attacks on the Senator from Arizona that questioned his \ncommitment to our troops. Outrageous. An attack on a man who not only \nfought for this Nation but spent years as a prisoner of war. They \ndidn't stop there. They even attacked the Senator's family. It was a \nnew low in modern American campaigning.\n  I want the administration and its allies in Congress to know we are \nnot going to put up with these despicable insinuations and dirty \ncampaigning. From now on, they question our commitment to our troops \nand the defense of this Nation at their own peril.\n  We saw it just the other day, I think it was yesterday. In a speech \nthat was publicly televised, those members of the NEA, the National \nEducation Association, who stick up for the quality of our teachers, \nfor their ability to earn a living, for the ability to take the courses \nthey need--to talk about them as terrorists? That is no different than \nthe chicken hawk line I just talked about.\n  With that, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are considering \nS. 2061, with 10-minute allocations of time for each Senator who is \nrecognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is debating the motion to proceed \nto that measure. An order has been entered limiting Democratic Senators \nto 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise pursuant to that order to speak for \n10 minutes about S. 2061. This bill which is pending before the Senate \naddresses a very serious national issue of medical malpractice. Medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums have increased in my State of Illinois \nand across the Nation. Because of those increases, a lot of good \ndoctors have been forced to a position where they have to retire or \nrelocate their practices. I have met with those doctors. I understand \nthe problems and dilemmas they face. I think we need to address that \nhere in the Congress. This point is dramatized by the fact that the \nbill before us is unfortunately not a bill which has been the product \nof any effort to find compromise or common ground or bipartisan answer \nto this national challenge.\n  This bill without referral to committee was sent to the floor of the \nSenate. It is a bill which, frankly, was introduced by Senator Gregg of \nNew Hampshire, a bill which ordinarily would have been referred to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. The bill did not go to that committee. \nSenator Gregg does not serve on that committee. The bill was sent to \nthe floor. I am afraid what this bill is all about is trying to make \ncertain we make a record rollcall on this issue so that those who are \nsupporting this bill will go back to some members of the medical \ncommittee and say all Senators who voted against it don't want to help \nyou with increasing medical practice premiums. That couldn't be further \nfrom the truth for this Senator.\n  I have strong feelings about what we need to do. I believe we need to \nbe doing something. We need to address the issue in a comprehensive \nway. We shouldn't be afraid to look at all aspects of this challenge.\n  The first aspect of this challenge is that there are too many medical \nerrors today in hospitals and doctors' offices across America. Don't \ntake my word for it. The Journal of the American Medical Association \nreached that conclusion and said medical errors are of epidemic \nproportions across America. The Institute of Medicine estimated that in \nany given year, 24,000 to 98,000 Americans lose their lives because of \nmedical negligence. This bill doesn't even address that issue. It \naddresses medical malpractice in a courtroom. It doesn't address it in \na doctor's office or in a hospital.\n  The first thing we should do is see how can we work with the medical \ncommunity and the hospitals to reduce errors, reduce negligence, and \nreduce the incidence of these grievous injuries and death that occur as \na result.\n  Currently, when you look at the universe of possible medical \nnegligence and the lawsuits filed as a result of it, a tiny fraction--\nsome 2 percent or less--end up in court. It means that 98 percent or \nmore of the medical negligence that is committed in America does not \nresult in a lawsuit.\n  If we want to make certain we have fewer cases going to court, let us \nstart at the beginning. Let us make the practice of medicine safer. \nThis bill does not even address that issue.\n  Second, if you are worried about the cost of medical malpractice \npremiums, isn't it reasonable to ask whether the insurance companies \nare treating doctors and hospitals fairly? This bill doesn't have a \nword in it about insurance companies and their responsibilities. Why \nare we afraid to even ask? Why wouldn't we have all the books open to \nfind out whether what is happening to doctors' medical malpractice \ninsurance is a result of some insurance practices which should be \nchanged?\n  The third element is tort reform. I used to practice law. I was a \ntrial lawyer. I defended doctors for many years and hospitals--and I \nsued them. I have been on both sides of the table. I understand those \nlawsuits, or at least how they were conducted in Illinois 20 years ago. \nSo I have at least a passing experience with this issue. I think in my\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\npractice I would never have considered taking a so-called frivolous \nlawsuit forward. It costs too much money. It takes too much time. You \nwouldn't want to put your plaintiff client through it, you wouldn't \nwant to waste your time and money, and you would not want to run the \nrisk at the end of the day that you would lose--or worse, be sanctioned \nby the court for raising a frivolous lawsuit. I think there are ways to \nstop it. A small percentage of lawsuits shouldn't be filed against \ndoctors. This bill doesn't deal with frivolous lawsuits, and it should.\n\n  The last element it should address in tort reform is one that I think \nis essential; that is, to make certain, while we try to reduce the \nlikelihood of frivolous lawsuits, we don't close the courthouse door \nfor those innocent patients who are the victims of medical negligence. \nThat is what this bill does. This bill says that instead of a jury in \nyour hometown deciding what your injury is worth, instead of your peers \nin the community, your neighbors sitting in the jury box considering \nthe evidence and the law and deciding what the value of your child's \nlife is, or your child's health, we instead will make that decision \nhere on the floor of the Senate. We will say that no matter what \nlawsuit you have filed for medical malpractice relating to OB/GYN, you \ncannot recover under any circumstances, regardless of what happened to \nyou or the baby, any more than $250,000--$250,000 for pain, suffering, \nand disfigurement.\n  Two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars may sound to some like a lot \nof money. Let me give you a few specific examples of cases I know of, \nand you decide whether $250,000 is a lot of money.\n  A settlement was reached last Friday in Chicago--a city I am honored \nto represent--in the case of Evelyn Arkebauer who gave girth to a \nquadriplegic son, Andrew ``A.J.'' Arkebauer, on October 4, 1998. Evelyn \nwent into labor at 5:30 in the morning with her second child. She had \nher first child by Cesarean section, so there was a risk for uterine \nrupture. Early in the afternoon, the doctor began to administer Pitocin \nto speed up labor.\n  At 6:15 p.m.--more than 12 hours later--the doctor cut off the \nPitocin and told Evelyn to start pushing. Evelyn pushed for more than \nan hour and a half and was rolled from her back to her side as the \nbaby's heart rate fluctuated during this labor.\n  At 7:53 p.m.--more than 12 hours into labor--the doctor decided an \nemergency C section was necessary and paged the anesthesiologist to \ncome to the delivery room. The anesthesiologist failed to return the \npage and numerous pages after that.\n  Finally, an hour after the doctor had decided on an emergency C \nsection, the anesthesiologist showed up and the procedure began. The \ndoctor discovered that the uterus had already ruptured. The baby had \nbeen without oxygen for 10 to 15 minutes. This baby is quadriplegic and \nspastic. He cannot walk, talk, or feed himself and will require full-\ntime care for the rest of his life on Earth. This baby had no injury to \nhis cerebrum, so he has normal cognitive thought, meaning he thinks \nlike a normal child but is trapped in a body he cannot use.\n  During the trial, a nurse working the night of Andrew's birth \ntestified that the anesthesiologist was with her in a private room on \nthe hospital's fourth floor and that he ignored three different pages \nto respond to this emergency C section before going to the fifth floor \ndelivery room where Evelyn was. This baby--quadriplegic and spastic for \nthe rest of his life with a mind that is functioning--has a body that \ncannot be used.\n  This bill, S. 2061, says the jury of the Senate will decide the cases \nexactly like this--that that baby and that baby's family can recover no \nmore than $250,000 for a lifetime of pain and suffering. That is not \nfair. It is not just. It is not reasonable. It may reduce medical \npractice premiums but at the cost of justice.\n\n  Gina Santoro-Cotton was 29 years old and pregnant with her first \nchild. Her prenatal course was normal. She was admitted to the hospital \n1 week after her due date to induce labor. The drug Pitocin was used. \nWithin a few hours of starting Pitocin, deceleration of the baby's \nheart rate was noted. The Pitocin was not stopped, which is normally \ndone when there are signs that the baby is in distress.\n  By early afternoon, the fetal monitor strips showed signs of oxygen \ndeprivation to the baby--a clear warning sign. The Pitocin was still \nnot stopped. At 2:45 p.m., the baby had a prolonged drop in his heart \nrate. The Pitocin was finally stopped and the baby was resuscitated in \nits mother's womb.\n  Within hours, the Pitocin was restarted, and decelerations and other \nsigns of poor oxygenation to the baby appeared. Rather than stopping \nthe Pitocin, the dose was increased.\n  At 7:30 p.m., there were still severe decelerations on the fetal \nmonitor strips. Pitocin was increased.\n  At approximately 9:45 p.m., Pitocin was finally stopped and the baby \nwas delivered. The baby was near death at the time of delivery.\n  Today, that baby is 6 years old and permanently disabled. He has \nsevere cognitive dysfunction and is partially paralyzed in all four of \nhis extremities. He has motor problems, and he can't walk. His speech \nis not understandable. He is fed through a tube in his stomach because \nhe cannot feed himself. He has paralysis of the vocal cords. He \nrequires care 24 hours a day and extensive therapy.\n  There are Senators who come to the floor and talk about cases just \nlike this and call it jackpot justice, arguing, I guess, that the \nparents of that little baby, who will be functionally impaired for his \nentire life, will never be able to express himself, will never be able \nto feed himself or walk--that the parents of that baby, if they recover \na verdict in court, have somehow won a jackpot. How many of us would \nwant to buy a ticket for that jackpot? How many of us would sacrifice \nthe health of any child, let alone our own children, with the prospect \nof recovering a verdict?\n\n  This bill before the Senate has said that in cases just like this, no \nmatter how serious, no matter how long that baby lives, no matter what \nconditions that baby faces, the rest of its natural life, the sum total \nand value of the pain and suffering of that baby and its family can \nnever, ever, be worth more than $250,000. And if that baby, who is now \n6, lives 20 years, is it worth $10,000, $12,000, $1,000 a month for \nwhat that family will go through? I don't think so.\n  Let me discuss one last case. Terri Sadowski was pregnant with her \nsecond child. At 34 weeks, she went into preterm labor and had a \nrupture of her membranes. Medication was not successful in stopping her \nlabor so she was transferred from a community hospital to a high-risk \nreferral center, to the care of a perinatologist, a specialist in high-\nrisk pregnancies.\n  The perinatologist decided to let Terri proceed with labor and \ndeliver normally even though the baby was in a breech position. The \ndoctor also decided to administer Pitocin, a medication to bring on \ncontractions. Within 3 hours of starting the Pitocin, the fetal heart \nrate began to show signs that the baby was in distress. A normal heart \nrate for a baby in the mother's womb is 120 to 160 beats per minute. \nThis baby's heart rate was dropping in the 70s. By the time Terri was \nready to start pushing, the fetal monitor strips showed significant \nfetal heart rate decelerations with a consistent heart rate in the 60s \nand 70s. Despite the overwhelming evidence that the baby was in severe \ndistress, a decision to perform a C section was not made for 40 \nminutes.\n  An emergency C section was done but the baby had no movement and was \nunresponsive. She developed seizures shortly after birth. She sustained \nsevere brain damage due to lack of oxygen in labor in delivery. Had the \nperinatologist performed a C section, the baby could have been a \nnormal, healthy baby.\n  The baby lived for 1 year in a vegetative state. During her short \nlife, she had multiple hospital admissions for pneumonia, bowel \nobstructions, unable to suck, and she required tube feedings and \nconstant suctioning to keep her airways clear. At the time of death, \nshe had frequent seizures.\n  Think about this for a moment. Think about the happiness each of us \nhas been lucky enough to experience in life from a family and children. \nAnd think about something going wrong in that delivery room, something \nthat results in a baby facing a lifetime--long or short--in a terrible \nsituation.\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\n  The parents were not at fault. They were not at fault in any of these \ncases. Eventually they went to court and asked for compensation for \nwhat they would face for medical bills, what they would face for pain \nand suffering, and a jury from their community decided what it was \nworth.\n  This bill says it really should not be a decision of a jury, it \nshould be a decision of the Senate, a one-size-fits-all, one solution \nfor every problem, $250,000, take it or leave it. That is not right.\n  I say to my friends in the medical profession, I know you are not \nperfect, you are humans; you do make mistakes. Quite honestly, those \nwho have dealt with doctors and have great respect for them know that \nthe overwhelming majority of doctors are good men and women, well \ntrained, dedicated to their profession, who make sacrifices every \nsingle day way beyond those called on by Members of the Senate.\n\n  Having said that, doctors I have spoken to understand that even \ngiving it their best, occasionally they make a mistake in judgment--\nthey do not know enough, they did not do the right thing--and terrible \nthings occur. And most of them, under those circumstances, say yes, in \nthose cases, people who are the victims of that kind of a circumstance \nshould be compensated. I certainly believe that. It is not fair to \nestablish an artificial limit and say that no matter what happens to \nthat baby or that mother, there will never be another nickel beyond \n$250,000; a lifetime of pain and suffering limited to $250,000 in \nrecovery.\n  To my friends in the medical profession who have a genuine concern, \nas they should, about the increase in medical malpractice premium \nrates, let me say you are not going to get any favor with this bill. \nThis bill is being offered for reasons I cannot explain. It is being \noffered in the name of OB/GYNs across America who certainly do need \nhelp and need it now. But it is a bill that also includes immunity and \nrelief from liability for pharmaceutical companies and medical device \ncompanies. I am sorry, but I have not heard anyone with a hue and cry \nabout a crisis when it comes to these companies dealing with medical \nmalpractice claims. But, naturally, they are included here because most \nbills that come through have to have a provision to help drug \ncompanies. They are the poster kids when it comes to this Congress. We \nare always going to find ways to help them.\n  For once, why don't we try to help the families who are the victims? \nAnd why don't we try to help the good doctors who need a helping hand?\n  I will make this statement in closing before I yield the floor: I \nwant to work with those Members of the Senate on both sides of the \naisle who in good faith want to address this issue. We can do things to \ndeal with this. We must do them. We should do them now. This bill is \nnot the way. This bill is a bad start. It is better to come together, \noff the Senate floor, try to find common ground and compromises on a \nbipartisan basis to protect the medical profession, on whom we all rely \nso much. We want to give the men and women in that profession, who have \ngiven their lives to serving us, a chance to practice medicine without \nskyrocketing premiums, but to also say to the families and patients who \ncome to these doctors and these hospitals, we will not abandon you in \nthe process.\n  There is reason to believe we can find this common ground. This bill \nis a bad start. It is likely to be defeated today. Once defeated, I \nhope Senators who believe, as I do, that we should address this issue \nwill come together to try to find that common ground.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate goes into a quorum call, the time for the quorum call be equally \ndivided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n    the birth of senator byrd's fourth and fifth great-grandchildren\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, later this afternoon, many of us will \nhave an opportunity to see one another after the recess. I will make a \nprediction that we will notice a special twinkle in Senator Byrd's eye \nas we visit with him this afternoon. There is good reason. Actually, \nthere are two very good reasons.\n  In the last month, Senator Byrd became a great-grandfather for the \nfourth and fifth times. Hannah Byrd Clarkson was born 4 weeks ago \ntoday, on January 27, weighing 10 pounds 3 ounces.\n  Hannah is the second child of another member of our Senate family, \nMary Anne Clarkson, of the Bill Clerk's Office, and her husband James \nClarkson. She joins her older sister Emma.\n  Hannah's cousin, Michael Yew Fatemi, was born on February 11. Michael \nis Senator Byrd's fifth great-grandchild, and his first great-grandson. \nHe is named in honor of his uncle John Michael Moore, Senator Byrd's \nbeloved grandson, who died in a car accident. Michael is the first \nchild of Senator Byrd's grandson Fredrik Fatemi, and his wife Jinny.\n  Few people live long enough to see and hold even one of their great-\ngrandchildren. To be able to welcome five of them into the world is a \nrare blessing, indeed.\n  I was deeply touched by Senator Byrd's kind words to me and my family \non the births of my grandchildren, Henry and Ava.\n  I am sure I speak for the entire Senate family--and people throughout \nAmerica--in wishing Senator Byrd and his wife Erma many happy hours \nwith Hannah, Michael, and all of their family members.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, going to the doctor for a checkup is hard \nenough these days between juggling family and work schedules. Few of us \nget all the checkups and screenings we need. Making matters worse, more \nand more doctors are closing their practices or limiting the services \nthey offer.\n  They are doing so because they cannot afford the increasing costs of \nmedical malpractice insurance which they are required to carry.\n  According to the American Medical Association, 19 States are in a \nfull-blown medical liability crisis, including the home State of the \noccupant of the chair and mine.\n  In Missouri, physicians' average premium increases for 2002 was 61 \npercent on top of increases the previous year of 22 percent. What \nhappens? Well, 31 percent of the physicians surveyed by the Missouri \nState Medical Association said they were thinking about leaving their \npractice altogether.\n  Almost one in three physicians in Missouri considered leaving their \npractice because they cannot afford the exorbitant medical malpractice \ninsurance cost caused by the lawsuits brought--some frivolously, and \nmany of them, I assume, against doctors. Doctors who have practiced for \nyears in Missouri are closing their doors.\n  But this is not just a problem for doctors. They are well educated. \nThey can move elsewhere and resume their practice, as difficult and \nunfair as that is. The real damage and pain is being felt by the \npatients.\n  Last summer we considered a comprehensive bill, S. 11, the Patients \nFirst Act. Unfortunately, the motion to proceed was not successful. \nBecause this issue is so critical to the health care of all Americans \nand because the crisis continues to grow, inaction\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\nshould not be an option because the outcome of considering the same \ncomprehensive reform bill again is clear.\n  Today we have narrowed our focus on the health care needs of women \nand babies.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists last year \nsaid:\n\n       An ailing civil justice system is severely jeopardizing \n     patient care for women and their newborns. Across the \n     country, liability insurance for OB/GYNs has become \n     prohibitively expensive. Premiums have tripled and quadrupled \n     practically overnight. In some areas, OB/GYNs can no longer \n     obtain liability insurance at all, as insurance companies \n     fold or abruptly stop ensuring doctors. When OB/GYNs cannot \n     find or afford liability insurance, they are forced to stop \n     delivering babies, curtail surgical services or close their \n     doors. The shortage of care affects hospitals, public health \n     clinics, and medical facilities in rural areas, inner cities \n     and communities across the country.\n\n  It is a real problem in Missouri. A survey conducted by the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in August of 2002 said 55 \npercent of their members from Missouri have been forced to change their \npractice, retire, relocate, decrease surgery, stop practicing \nobstetrics, decrease the number of deliveries, and decrease the number \nof high-risk obstetric care.\n  Last year, Missouri lost a total of 33 obstetricians. I want to share \nwith you a few examples.\n   A St. Joseph, MO, practice, the only practice in Northeast Missouri \nto accept Medicaid, lost one-third of its doctors after the insurance \ncompany would no longer offer insurance to OB/GYNs. St. Joseph now has \nonly seven OB/GYNs serving its population.\n   A Missouri doctor who has been in private practice for 3 years \nexperienced a 400 percent increase in his liability premiums over the \npast 3 years and received a quote for $108,000 in 2004. This OB/GYN is \nconsidering quitting obstetrics in order to find affordable insurance.\n   A gynecological oncologist in Missouri left a group practice and \neliminated a rural outreach clinic because of rising professional \nmedical liability premiums. ``Women with gynecologic cancers in Ste. \nGenevieve, Carbondale, and Chester now have to drive over 100 miles to \nsee a gynecologic oncologist and receive the care they deserve,'' said \nthe doctor.\n   An OB/GYN in St. Ann, MO, was forced to close his practice last year \nbecause of medical liability costs that rose 100 percent. The practice \nhad delivered about 400 babies a year.\n   Twelve doctors at the Kansas City Women's Clinic used to serve women \nin both Missouri and Kansas. But, because of rising medical liability \ninsurance rates, the clinic could not find a single company that would \noffer them a medical malpractice insurance policy they need for their \noffice in Missouri.\n  I should say parenthetically, I have been approached by some lawyers \nwho practice medical malpractice plaintiff cases, and they said: The \nproblem is the insurance companies are making too much money. It is not \nthe lawyers. That is strange when the insurance companies can't even \nstay in business. They can't stay in business because of the lawyers.\n   As a result at the end of 2002 they closed their doors to their \nMissouri patients. There were over 6,600 visits a year in their \nMissouri office. Now, these women must either travel to Kansas to see \ntheir OB/GYN or find a new doctor elsewhere in Missouri.\n   Two Kansas City, inner city OB/GYNs who serve low-income, high-risk \npatients had to sell their practices to their hospital in order to \ncontinue to see patients in Missouri. Excessive litigation has created \nan environment that forced two doctors--committed to serving some of \nthe most vulnerable women in Kansas City--out of business. They are no \nlonger in independent practice.\n   One OB/GYN practice in Missouri had to take a $1.5 million loan to \npay the malpractice insurance for this year. That does not even include \nthe cost of the tail coverage.\n   Other doctors in Missouri are considering going without insurance \nfor their tail coverage because they simply can't afford the premiums.\n   Women are having a hard time getting the care they need and \ncommunities are losing their trusted doctors. We have a health care \nsystem that is in crisis in Missouri.\n   The bill before us today, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies \nAccess to Care Act is narrowly crafted to protect access to prenatal, \ndelivery, and postnatal care for women and babies by reducing the \nexcessive burden the liability system places on the delivery of OB/GYN \nservices.\n  This bill will protect the right of an injured patient to recover \nfair compensation while at the same time prevent clear lawsuit abuse.\n  The bill protects the right of injured patients to receive full \neconomic damages that cover the out-of-pocket expenses that a victim \nmight incur due to a doctor's negligence, such as hospital costs, \ndoctor bills, long-term care, other medical expenses, and lost wages. \nThis bill also includes a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, with \ndeference to existing and future State caps.\n  This bill maximizes the amount of awards received by injured patients \nby limiting attorney's contingency fee to a reasonable, sliding scale.\n  Too often large percentages of an injured patient's award go to \nattorneys, leaving the patient with less money for their medical care \nand other needs. Injured patients are entitled to an overwhelming \namount of their award after settling or winning a lawsuit.\n  Currently, lawyers in many States can take up to 40 percent of all \nawards and settlements, robbing the injured patients of their award. We \nthink by protecting injured patients by limiting lawyers to 15 percent \nof any payment over $600,000 makes good sense.\n  These are just a few of the many vital reforms contained in this \nbill.\n  I urge my colleagues to protect access to quality health care for \nwomen and babies and support the Healthy Babies, Healthy Mothers Access \nto Care Act.\n  We cannot afford to have OB/GYNs to continue closing their practices, \nreducing the number of babies they deliver or eliminating care for \nhigh-risk patients, the uninsured, and the underinsured because of \nexcessive frivolous lawsuits brought by plaintiff attorneys.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose S. 2061, the Healthy Mothers \nand Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. It should be called the \n``Insurance Companies First Act.'' This is extreme legislation that \nputs the interests of the insurance industry ahead of the interests of \nwomen, their families and their doctors. It applies only to women \nseeking obstetrics and gynecological services--that's it. Every other \npatient can recover full damages. But under this bill only women will \nbe limited in what they can recover for a doctor's medical error. This \nbill penalizes patients, while doing nothing to prevent doctors from \nbeing gouged by insurance companies.\n  This bill is legislative malpractice. First of all, the procedure for \nconsidering this bill is seriously flawed. The bill was brought to the \nfull Senate without hearings, without consideration by the Judiciary \nCommittee. There was no chance for patients, doctors or others affected \nby this bill to testify. There was no Committee Report to analyze the \neffects of the extremely complex and controversial legislation.\n  The result is a bill that targets some of the most serious cases of \nmedical error, restricts the rights of women and infants, while doing \ntoo little to protect doctors from the high cost of insurance. It is \nthe same broad brush legislation that we defeated in July, only this \ntime they limit it to obstetrical and gynecological services and by \ndesign only restrict the rights of women patients. Proponents of the \nbill say they wanted to streamline the bill, to address the area of \nmedicine with one of the highest premium rates and they claim that the \nbeneficiaries will be women who will have improved access to health \ncare. But since when has limiting one's rights improved anything? And \nhow does restricting a woman's right to full recovery and only her \nrights provide her a benefit?\n  The real beneficiaries of this bill are the insurance companies. They \nget to see their profits soar while mothers who take care of infants \nwho suffer because of medical error will face unfair caps in the \nremedies they receive. These are often stay at home mothers who need \nresources to care for their families and their infants who may need \nconstant care, but the cap on non-economic damages will prevent them \nfrom getting those resources. It's unfair to penalize these women \nbecause\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\nthey can't recover economic damages. I think the Senate can do better.\n  I oppose this legislation for three reasons:\n  As a Senator from Maryland, I cannot support legislation that gives \nMarylanders a worse deal. This legislation would override the Maryland \nlaw and place a $250,000 cap on non-economic damages. Maryland law \nstrikes an important balance, providing a much higher cap on non-\neconomic damages. The cap increases each year to offset inflation. It \nstarted at $500,000 and is now $635,000. It also has no caps on \npunitive damages. The Maryland law is supported by both physicians and \npatient advocates.\n  Yet the Republican bill would preempt Maryland law. It would put \nwomen and infants in Maryland at a disadvantage. It would severely \nlimit their ability to get relief for the death, physical impairment or \ndisfigurement that they suffer as a result of serious medical error.\n  This legislation shuts the court house door. It denies justice to \nwomen and women only. It denies justice to those who must care for a \nmentally disabled child for his or her whole life because of a doctor's \nmistake during prenatal or post-natal care. It denies justice to women \nwho needlessly lost a child during delivery because of a serious \nmedical error. It does this by imposing arbitrary caps instead of \nenabling juries to determine damages. I have faith in juries made up of \nmembers of the community to reach a fair verdict.\n  Who would be hurt by this legislation?\n  Someone like the mother from Baltimore whose newborn baby suffered \nbrain damage because an emergency c-section was not performed in time. \nHis mother had gone to the hospital reporting that there was decreased \nfetal movement. She knew something was wrong. Tests were performed. Yet \nthe doctor misdiagnosed the problem. After several days, an emergency \nc-section was performed. It was too late. The baby suffered severe \nbrain damage. He died 13 months later.\n  It is impossible to put a price on the loss of a child. Imagine if \nthat death is the result of carelessness. Parents who suffer the \nunbearable pain of losing a child deserve the right to use the courts \nto seek full accountability.\n  Instead of penalizing patients, we need legislation to help doctors \nwho are facing skyrocketing insurance costs. A doctor's number one \npriority is the care of his or her patients. We should make sure that \nit is easy for them to do so, knocking down the roadblocks to practice \nthat excessive insurance premiums create. S. 2061 won't do that. It \nwon't provide doctors with real relief today.\n  That's why the Senate should consider alternatives such as that \nproposed by Senator Durbin, which focuses on solving the problems where \nthey start. Senator Durbin addresses the root of the problem, creating \ngreater accountability for doctors through a voluntary error reporting \ndatabase, economic help for those who face growing premiums, punishment \nfor frivolous lawsuits, grants to provide physicians in areas where \nmalpractice insurance has led to a shortage of doctors, and critically, \nan end to the immunity that insurance companies face from anti-trust \nregulations.\n  Yet instead of helping patients and doctors, the Senate is again \ncaught up in a political game. It doesn't have to be this way. We have \nworked together in the past to pass legislation that helps victims and \nlowers insurance costs. The terrorism insurance legislation is a prime \nexample. We passed it because there was a national will and the urgency \nto do something that provided real solutions.\n  Today, we are faced with the same national will. And I urge my \ncolleagues to work toward a sensible compromise. One that does not \nunfairly target women and their infants. One that addresses all forms \nof medical error, not just those affecting women and puts the rights of \nall patients first. The public is demanding that we do something, as \nmore Americans are suffering from serious medical mistakes and more \ndoctors are unable to treat patients because of rising premiums. We now \nneed the political will to help doctors without harming patients.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture. We need to send this bill \nback to the Judiciary Committee for full consideration of the issue of \nmedical liability as well as the impact of limiting women's rights to \nrecovery on their health and well-being and that of their new born \ninfants.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the bill that is \nthe subject of today's cloture vote on the motion to proceed.\n  We must not be fooled by the seemingly friendly title of this bill. \nThe Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act of 2003 does \nnothing to promote the health of mothers or babies. This bill will \ndevastate the rights of parents and children, but it will help neither \npatients nor doctors. The real beneficiaries will be insurance \ncompanies, HMOs and large medical corporations. Sponsors of this bill \ninsult us by calling it a Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Act. How \ncan shielding from accountability an entire medical specialty area \nresult in healthy babies? Less accountability will never lead to better \nhealth care.\n  This bill discriminates against women and infants by restricting \ntheir right to hold physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, HMOs, \nand even drug and medical device manufacturers fully accountable for \ninjuries resulting from the provision of obstetrical and gynecological \ncare. Although proponents of the legislation say the bill is necessary \nto increase access to women's health care, nowhere does the bill make \nliability insurance for doctors more available or affordable. And \nnowhere does it provide access to health care for women who are \nuninsured. What it does do is greatly limit the ability of women and \nchildren with the most devastating injuries to hold the wrongdoer \naccountable.\n  It is another example of what I call the ``maleogarchy'' that \nprevails around here placing a higher value on a man's worth than a \nwoman's. The bill cynically devalues the worth of pregnant women \ninjured by medical negligence. Men's injuries are given full value. For \nexample, if a woman is inappropriately prescribed blood pressure \nmedication during pregnancy that causes blood clots, her recovery is \nlimited under the bill's provisions. If a man is prescribed the same \ndefective blood pressure medication by his internist, he may recover \nagainst the drug manufacturer in accordance with available State law \nremedies.\n  The legislation unfairly reduces the amount of time that an injured \nwoman has to file a lawsuit. Under the bill, a suit would have to be \nfiled no later than 1 year from the date the injury was discovered or \nshould have been discovered, but not later than 3 years after the \n``manifestation'' of injury. Thus, a pregnant woman who contracted HIV \nthrough a transfusion but only learned of the disease 4 years after the \ntransfusion would be barred from filing a claim. In addition, the bill \nlimits the rights of injured newborns by requiring that actions on \ntheir behalf be brought within three years from the date of the \nmanifestation of injury. This is in direct contradiction to the laws of \nmany States, which preserve the rights of minors to seek legal redress \nupon the age of majority.\n  The bill limits non-economic damages to $250,000 in the aggregate, \nregardless of the number of parties against whom an action is brought. \nNoneconomic damages compensate patients for very real injuries such as \nthe loss of fertility, excruciating pain, and permanent and severe \ndisfigurement. They also compensate for the loss of a child or a \nspouse. These are very real damages, and juries are able to calculate \nthem fairly. How do you calculate the economic damages to infants who \nsustain life-long injuries during childbirth or stay-at-home mothers \nwho lose their fertility due to a defective drug taken during the \ncourse of pregnancy? Their injuries may be almost completely non-\neconomic and this bill would have a devastating impact.\n  This bill is an appallingly cynical attack on the rights of mothers \nand their babies. In many ways, it is even more insidious than the bill \nthat failed in the Senate last July. It is almost as if the proponents \nof that bill, having failed to eliminate the rights of all patients \ninjured by negligence, decided they would simply target the rights of \nthe most vulnerable: pregnant mothers and their babies.\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today the Senate is voting on a political \ngimmick that will punish women and children and do nothing to address \nthe real medical malpractice crisis that is crippling healthcare \nthroughout our State.\n  Doctors are facing escalating costs that are unsustainable, but \ninstead of addressing this problem with a common-sense and immediate \nfix, the majority is engaging in a blame game. We don't have time for \nthe blame game. Instead, we should be debating the bipartisan bill I \nsupport to provide immediate relief to doctors, stop frivolous \nlawsuits, and fix the broken insurance market.\n  But this bill doesn't just fail to address the real crisis in \nmalpractice insurance; it actually undermines the rights of women and \nchildren in the name of helping them.\n  As a woman, a mother, and a Senator who has fought for the safety and \nwelfare of mothers and infants, I am disturbed that the U.S. Senate \nwould single out women and babies for different treatment than everyone \nelse in America if they are injured through no fault of their own. This \nbill tells women that if we are injured, we don't deserve the same \nlegal protections as men.\n  The sponsors of this bill have spoken about the health and well-being \nof women and babies in hypothetical terms. But I have to tell you, the \ninjuries and crimes that continue to plague female patients are all too \nreal.\n  Currently, in my State of Washington, we are following a high-profile \ncase in which an OB/GYN has been accused of raping or molesting dozens \nof female patients under his care. This doctor is also accused of \nproviding substandard care, ranging from performing unnecessary medical \nprocedures to failing to prescribe prenatal vitamins to a pregnant \npatient with low iron levels.\n  In one case, this doctor even performed a surgery despite the fact \nthat his office was not licensed for surgery and did not have a supply \nof blood available in case of complications.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider this case. If your wife or daughter \nor sister had been hurt, molested or worse by this doctor, would a \n$250,000 cap seem like a reasonable solution?\n  These cases are not hypothetical. They are not frivolous. And this \nbill will not protect the health or increase the wellbeing of any of \nthese patients.\n  I find some sad irony in being told by this bill's sponsors that if I \nwant to help women and babies, I should strip away their rights. I take \na backseat to no one when it comes to standing up for women and \nchildren.\n  I wish that the people who are pushing this bill today had shown the \nsame interest when I was fighting to ensure women could get direct \naccess to an OB/GYN during the Patients Bill of Rights debate, but \ninstead, they killed that effort. I wish they had shown the same \ninterest in 1999 when I offered an amendment to end drive-through \nmastectomies, but they killed that effort as well. I wish this bill's \nsponsors had showed the same concern when I was fighting to improve \ndrug labeling for pregnant women, but instead, they killed that \nproposal as well. They weren't on the side of women during all those \nfights, but here they are today, using the real shortage of OB/GYNs and \nthe real malpractice crisis as an excuse for punishing women and babies \nwithout giving doctors or patients the help they desperately need.\n  If the sponsors of this bill are now serious about helping ensure \nhealthy women and babies, I say ``Come on over!'' I've got a long list \nof legislation that they can sign onto today to really help women--like \nextending Family and Medical Leave, boosting the federal Medicaid match \nfor OB/GYNs, and expanding Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, CHIP, for low-income pregnant women. The single most important \nstep to ensure a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby is prenatal care. \nFully-funding and expanding CHIP would provide this care to low-income \nwomen who would otherwise go without.\n  The saddest part of this exercise is that we should be spending this \ntime discussing a real solution, like the bipartisan bill I am \ncosponsoring with Senators Graham and Durbin, the Better HEALTH Act, S. \n1374. If the Senate leadership really wants to help doctors and \npatients, they will bring up the widely-supported Graham-Durbin bill \nfor a vote and stop playing games at the expense of women and babies. \nEvery day they deny a vote on this bipartisan bill speaks volumes about \ntheir interest in a real solution.\n  The Graham-Durbin bill would give doctors an immediate 20 percent tax \nrebate on their malpractice premiums, provide federal help for a broken \ninsurance market, and block frivolous lawsuits. That's the type of \ncomprehensive, immediate and effective solution our doctors, patients \nand communities deserve.\n  My action plan to fix the malpractice crisis has four steps. The \nfirst thing we have to do is get doctors and hospitals some immediate \nrelief--because the clock is ticking. Even if proposals to cap non-\neconomic and punitive damages were passed this year, it is impossible \nto predict when--if ever--doctors and hospitals would see relief. That \nis not good enough for me, and it is not good enough for the doctors in \nmy community. I want doctors and hospitals to get immediate relief.\n  Under the Graham-Durbin bill, doctors in high-risk specialties would \nbe eligible for a tax credit that's 20 percent of their malpractice \npremium. Doctors in lower-risk specialties would get a 10 percent tax-\ncredit. For-profit hospitals would get a 15 percent tax credit, and \nnon-profit hospitals would get new grants. Immediate financial relief \ndirectly to doctors and hospitals must be part of any solution to the \nmalpractice crisis.\n  Second, we have to cut down on frivolous lawsuits. Under the Graham-\nDurbin bill, every plaintiff attorney that files a medical malpractice \ncase would be required to include an affidavit by a qualified health \ncare professional verifying that malpractice has occurred. No more \nlaunching lawsuits that don't have merit. And anyone who violates this \naffidavit is going to be punished with strict, and increasingly harsh, \ncivil penalties. We are not going to tolerate frivolous lawsuits, and \nthat's the second part of the Graham-Durbin bill.\n  Third, we need to provide additional protections for doctors who are \ndoing the right thing and serving patients through Medicare, Medicaid \nand S-CHIP. Doctors with a 25 percent caseload of Medicare, Medicaid, \nand State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, patients would be \nprotected from punitive damages under the Graham-Durbin bill. \nExemptions would only be allowed for cases involving sexual abuse, \nassault and battery, and falsification of records. Other than that \nthere will be no punitive damages for doctors who are doing the right \nthing and serving Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP patients.\n  Finally, the Graham-Durbin bill says the Federal Government should \nunderwrite some of the risk in malpractice insurance--just as we have \nwith terrorism and flood insurance. Doctors and hospitals should not \nhave to shoulder the burden of a broken insurance market.\n  If the Senate leadership is serious about helping doctors and \npatients, it will bring up the bipartisan Graham-Durbin bill. It \nprovides immediate and direct financial relief to doctors and \nhospitals. It cuts down on frivolous lawsuits. It limits liability for \ndoctors with high Medicaid caseloads, and it provides Federal help for \na broken insurance system.\n  As I have done for the past 10 years, I will continue to advocate for \nthe policies that truly help women and infants and I will continue to \nstand up for my doctors, patients and communities who deserve an \nimmediate, comprehensive solution to the malpractice insurance crisis. \nI welcome the support of any Senator who wishes to sign onto the \nlegislation I have outlined today.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I express my concern once again with \nthe rising cost of medical liability insurance. Last July we debated \nthis issue in the Senate, and unfortunately did not reach cloture on \nthis important issue. Today we are limiting our debate on the issue to \ncare for mothers and babies. We must protect a woman's access to \nobstetric and gynecological care to ensure healthy mothers and babies. \nThe increasing cost of medical liability insurance is creating a \npatient access crisis because doctors are leaving the practice of \nmedicine.\n  At Hardin County General Hospital in Savannah, TN, the OB/GYN left \nthe hospital to go practice in another state because the insurance \npremium was\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\ntoo high. High medical liability insurance is one more reason it is \ndifficult to recruit specialists to rural areas.\n  In 2002, the average net medical liability premium for an OB/GYN in \nTennessee was $33,600. In 2003, the premium increased to $41,980, and \nin 2004, it increased again to $49,408. This is a 47 percent increase \nover the past 3 years. This sort of increased cost is not sustainable. \nI continue to be worried about who will deliver babies in my state.\n  I believe that S. 2061, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access \nto Care Act of 2004, will help protect access to care for mothers and \nbabies in Tennessee. This bill will still allow unlimited economic \ndamages, but it places a sensible cap on non-economic damages. I hope \nwe reach cloture on the motion to proceed so that we can consider this \nvery important legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am concerned about the increasing costs of \nmalpractice insurance and a lack of access to medical providers in West \nVirginia and other States. The current challenges facing the medical \nmalpractice system are complex and require a multifaceted solution.\n  Unfortunately, this issue has become highly politicized with powerful \ninterests pitted against each other. Patients and their doctors are \nbeing squeezed in the middle. It is long past time to give some peace \nof mind to patients and doctors alike who are caught in this political \ntug of war. We ought to have a wide-ranging debate in the Senate on how \nto best reform the medical liability and insurance system and also \nprevent medical errors.\n  I am disappointed that the administration and the Senate leadership \nhave adopted a take-it-or-leave-it and one-size-fits-all approach to \nthis issue.\n  Especially in more rural areas of this country, there is a serious \nshortage of doctors and a lack of access to quality medical care close \nto home. Too often, families must travel long distances to see a \nphysician, and even farther if specialized care is required. I hope \nthat, by proceeding to the medical malpractice bill, the Senate can \nhave a constructive debate and reach a commonsense concensus on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I will vote in favor of invoking \ncloture on the motion to proceed to S. 2061, the Healthy Mothers and \nHealthy Babies Access to Care Act. My vote is not an endorsement of S. \n2061 as it was introduced in the Senate. In fact, I have concerns about \nvarious aspects of the bill including the $250,000 cap on noneconomic \ndamages and I anticipate supporting amendments to S. 2061 if the Senate \nhas an opportunity to fully debate this legislation.\n  However, I do believe that reform of the medical liability system \nshould be considered as part of a comprehensive response to surging \nmedical malpractice premiums that endanger Americans' access to quality \nmedical care by causing doctors to leave certain communities or cease \noffering critical services, such as obstetrical care. For this reason, \nI will vote for cloture on S. 2061 in an effort to move the debate \nforward.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, once again we are faced with an ill-\nadvised medical malpractice bill coming to the Senate floor without any \ncommittee consideration. Some argue that we have a malpractice \ninsurance ``crisis'' that is driving doctors from the practice of \nmedicine, particularly in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, or \nOB/GYN. But we have not yet explored that issue in the Senate at all. \nNo committee has held hearings or marked up a bill on this topic. \nInstead, an extreme proposal has been brought directly to the floor and \nSenators are expected to vote for it because there is a crisis. That is \nnot how the legislative process should work on an issue of importance \nto so many people.\n  I would like very much for Congress to address the problem of \nmalpractice insurance premiums once we understand the seriousness of \nthe problem and the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. But by \nbringing this bill directly to the floor, the majority shows that it is \nnot serious about addressing the problem. It just wants to play a \npolitical card. To the extent that there really is a malpractice \ninsurance problem, what is going on here is a cynical exercise, \ndesigned only to fail and to provide fodder for political attacks. I \nwill vote ``no'' on cloture.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I will not be voting for S. 2061, a bill \nthat imposes very low damage caps on noneconomic damages in cases \ninvolving obstetrical services. I cannot support the bill before us \ntoday because I do not believe it would be effective in reducing the \nvery serious problem that we have with rising medical malpractice \npremiums for doctors and hospitals in my State of Washington.\n  The fundamental premise of the bill is that by placing a very low cap \non the amount persons injured in obstetrics cases could receive for \nnoneconomic damages, insurers would respond by reducing premiums for \nphysicians and hospitals. However, multiple studies have now shown that \npremiums for physicians in States that have already imposed limits on \ndamages continue to increase. According to the Medical Liability \nMonitor, overall, premiums are 6.8 percent higher for OB/GYNs in States \nwith caps than States without caps, and premium increases last year \nwere slightly higher in States with caps on damages, than in States \nwithout them. That is why the Seattle Times, the Seattle Post \nIntelligencer, The Tacoma News Tribune, The Everett Herald and the \nBellingham Herald have all come out in opposition to $250,000 caps in \nthe last 2 weeks. As the editorial board of the Spokane Spokesman wrote \nlast June 4 about proposals to cap damages, ``No doctor would prescribe \nradical surgery based on anecdotes or conflicting data.''\n  In the process of educating myself about this issue over the past \nyear, including meeting with hundreds of Washington State physicians \nand hospital administrators, touring 29 rural hospitals, and reviewing \nthe claims history of Physicians Insurance, Washington State's leading \nprovider of malpractice insurance, I have asked many of these \nindividuals what they believed the cap on damages should be. The fact \nthat I have received answers ranging from zero to $5 million \nillustrates the difficulty in determining what a damage limit should be \nwithout reference to specific facts. I believe that juries made up of \nWashington State residents are better positioned to make a \ndetermination of appropriate compensation after hearing the facts of an \nindividual case, than are Senators trying to find a one-size-fits-all \nsolution. Washington State has the third best tort system in the \ncountry according to the Chamber of Commerce. Our State has long banned \npunitive damages, and as a result, capping noneconomic damages, without \nthe knowledge of the jury, could lead to very unfair results for \nWashington State residents.\n  Imposing a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages is radical. The \n$250,000 cap is based on a California law that was enacted in 1975 and \nhas never been adjusted for inflation. While I wish that it were not \ntrue, Washington residents are sometimes harmed by negligent care in \nthe course of obstetrics cases, and they suffer genuine damages. \nDespite efforts to create an exception for the most serious and \negregious cases, there is no exception in the bill before the Senate \nfor even the worst cases. Noneconomic damages compensate patients for \nreal injuries including the loss of fertility, loss of a child, or loss \nof a spouse, as well as for excruciating pain and permanent and severe \ndisfigurement. Caps on noneconomic damages disproportionately affect \nwomen and children because they lack the work history to make economic \ndamages very meaningful.\n  That is not to say that we do not have a very serious problem in our \nState. Individual physicians have experienced premium increases of up \nto 75 percent and hospitals have suffered even greater increases. \nIncreases have hit specialists, including obstetricians, particularly \nhard. This adds to pressure already being felt by physicians and \nhospitals in our State as a result of our abysmal Medicare \nreimbursement rate. Washington currently ranks 41st in the Nation and \nreceives only $4,303 per beneficiary. Physician practices are small \nbusinesses, and many of our hospitals are nonprofit entities. They \ncannot be expected to absorb these huge increases without help.\n\n  That is why I support many measures that would actually help deal \nwith the problem of rising insurance costs. I believe that we should be \nexploring the creation of best practices for physicians, which, if \nfollowed, would protect\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\nphysicians from law suits. I also believe that specialized malpractice \ncourts could be a useful tool in curbing abuses of the system.\n  I also support legislation introduced by Senators Lindsey Graham and \nDick Durbin. Unlike S. 2061, which relies on damage caps to reduce \nfuture premiums, the Graham-Durbin bill provides tax credits to \nphysicians and hospitals to help offset the increases in malpractice \ninsurance. It would also create a medical mistake database, repeal the \ncurrent law that prevents Federal regulators from examining whether the \ninsurance industry is engaging in anticompetitive behavior and price \nmanipulation to artificially inflate premiums, and impose stricter \nstandards to demonstrate that a malpractice case has merit before it \nproceeds.\n  I am committed to finding solutions to these problems to ensure that \nWashingtonians continue to have access to quality affordable care \nthroughout every city and county in our State. The bill on the floor \nunfortunately is not part of that solution. Hopefully, the debate \ndoesn't stop today and these other alternatives will be considered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we will be voting on a cloture motion \nto allow the Senate to proceed to debate S. 2061, the Healthy Mothers \nand Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nvote for the cloture motion on the motion to proceed.\n  We have had a good discussion over the last few days, and it is clear \nthat our medical litigation system is failing the American people. It \nis failing our communities, our hospitals, our doctors, our families \nand, most importantly, our patients. OB/GYNs and the women and babies \nthey serve have been uniquely affected. Reform of this broken system is \ndesperately needed, and we must act.\n  The upcoming vote will allow us to fully debate this critical issue. \nIf action is delayed, we know what will happen: patients will suffer, \nwomen will suffer, and babies will suffer. OB/GYNs will continue to \nflee their practices and drop obstetrical services, and more States \nwill be added to the AMA crisis list, a list that already has 19 \nStates.\n  I have received letters from doctors all over America, including from \nmy home State of Tennessee, demonstrating the devastating effect of the \ncrisis. Premiums in Tennessee have gone up 68 percent over the last 4 \nyears, and Tennessee is not even considered a crisis State by the AMA--\nyet.\n  One doctor from Paris, TN, writes:\n\n       As a reproductive health physician I have provided a wide \n     range of obstetrical and gynecologic services to west \n     Tennessee for 13 years. I am one of only two physicians \n     practicing in this area and do a significant amount of high \n     risk procedures. My malpractice insurance premiums have \n     increased from $30,000 to $60,000 in just two years. This is \n     without a claim being filed against me. . . . I am strongly \n     considering terminating my obstetrical practice to leave this \n     area markedly undeserved.\n\n  Another doctor from Athens, TN, writes:\n\n       As an obstetrician in East Tennessee whose liability \n     insurance premiums increased 23 percent in the year 2003, it \n     is becoming progressively difficult and risky for me to \n     continue to deliver babies. Many of my colleagues have either \n     retired or quit doing obstetrics. This is going to severely \n     limit what is already excellent care in this country for the \n     obstetrical patients especially in this part of the State.\n\n  As these real life stories show, this health care crisis is real, \nspreading and uniquely affects OB/GYNs. The current medical liability \nsystem is costly, inefficient and hurts all Americans. In addition to \ndamaging access to medical services, the current medical litigation \nsystem creates problems throughout the entire health care system:\n  It indirectly costs the country billions of dollars every year in \ndefensive medicine. The fear of lawsuits forces doctors to practice \ndefensive medicine by ordering extra tests and procedures. Though the \nnumbers are hard to calculate, well researched reports predict savings \nfrom reform at tens of billions of dollars per year.\n  It directly costs the tax payers billions. The CBO has estimated that \nreasonable broad reform will save the Federal Government $14.9 billion \nover 10 years through savings in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  It impedes efforts to improve patient safety. The threat of excessive \nlitigation discourages doctors from discussing medical errors in ways \nthat could dramatically improve health care and save hundreds or \nthousands of lives. I am a strong supporter of patient safety \nlegislation which I hope we will pass this year. But in addition to \npatient safety legislation, we need to address the underlying problem--\nour liability system.\n  We must reform this broken liability system. That is why I strongly \nsupport the Health Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. I \nthank my colleague, Senator Gregg, who skillfully led this debate, and \nI thank Senator Ensign, a leading proponent of reform, who has seen the \ncurrent crisis close up in his own State of Nevada.\n  This legislation will protect women's access to care and ensure that \nthose who are negligently injured are fairly compensated. Again, I \nencourage my colleagues to move this legislation forward. We cannot \nafford further delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of groups that \nsupport S. 2061 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n\nGroups That Support S. 2061--Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access \n                              to Care Act\n\n     American Medical Association\n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n     American College of Emergency Physicians\n     American College of Cardiology\n     American Association of Neurological Surgeons\n     American Academy of Dermatology Association\n     American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons\n     American College of Cardiology\n     American College of Surgeons\n     American College of Radiology\n     American Gastroenterological Association\n     American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery\n     American Urological Association\n     Congress of Neurological Surgeons\n     National Association of Spine Specialists\n     Society of Thoracic Surgeons\n     American Academy of Family Physicians\n     American Society of Anesthesiologists\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant bill clerk (Ms. Stacy Sullivan) proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support legislation which would address \nthe serious problems faced today by doctors, hospitals and other \nmedical professionals who provide obstetrical and gynecological \nservices and at the same time provide balance to treat fairly people \nwho are injured in the course of medical treatment.\n  While most of the attention has been directed to OB/GYN malpractice \nverdicts, the issues are much broader, involving medical errors, \ninsurance company investments and administrative practices.\n  I support caps on noneconomic damages so long as they do not apply to \nsituations such as the paperwork mix-up leading to the double \nmastectomy of a woman or the death of a 17-year-old woman on a North \nCarolina transplant case where there was a faulty blood type match or \ncomparable cases in the OB/GYN services area.\n  An appropriate standard for cases not covered could be analogous \nprovisions in Pennsylvania law which limit actions against governmental \nentities or in the limited tort context which exclude death, serious \nimpairment of bodily function, and permanent disfigurement or \ndismemberment.\n  Beyond the issue of caps, I believe there could be savings on the \ncost of OB/GYN malpractice insurance by eliminating frivolous cases by \nrequiring plaintiffs to file with the court a certification by a doctor \nin the field that it is an appropriate case to bring to court. This \nproposal, which is now part of Pennsylvania State procedure, would be \nexpanded federally, thus reducing claims and saving costs. While most \nmalpractice cases are won by defendants, the high cost of litigation \ndrives up OB/GYN malpractice premiums. The proposed certification would \nreduce plaintiff's joinder of peripheral defendants and cut defense \ncosts.\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\n  Further savings could be accomplished through patient safety \ninitiatives identified in the report of the Institute of Medicine.\n  On November 29, 1999, the Institute of Medicine, IOM, issued a report \nentitled: To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System. The IOM \nreport estimated that anywhere between 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized \nAmericans die each year due to avoidable medical mistakes. However, \nonly a fraction of these deaths and injuries are due to negligence; \nmost errors are caused by system failures. The IOM issued a \ncomprehensive set of recommendations, including the establishment of a \nnationwide mandatory reporting system; incorporation of patient safety \nstandards in regulatory and accreditation programs; and the development \nof a non-punitive culture of safety in health care organizations. The \nreport called for a 50 percent reduction in medical errors over 5 \nyears.\n  The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services \nand Education, which I chair, held three hearings to discuss the IOM's \nfindings and explore ways to implement the recommendations outlined in \nthe IOM report. The fiscal year 2001 Labor-HHS appropriations bill \ncontained $50 million for a patient safety initiative and directed the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ, to develop guidelines \non the collection of uniform error data; establish a competitive \ndemonstration program to test best practices; and research ways to \nimprove provider training. In fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2003, \n$55 million was included to continue these initiatives. We are awaiting \na report, which has been delayed after being scheduled for issuance in \nSeptember, 2003, by the Department of Health and Human Services, which \nwill detail the results of the patient safety initiative.\n  There is evidence that increases in OB/GYN insurance premiums have \nbeen caused, at least in part, by insurance company losses, the \ndeclining stock market of the past several years, and the general rate-\nsetting practices of the industry. As a matter of insurance company \ncalculations, premiums are collected and invested to build up an \ninsurance reserve where there is considerable lag time between the \npayment of the premium and litigation which results in a verdict or \nsettlement. When the stock market has gone down, for example, that has \nresulted in insufficient funding to pay claims and the attendant \nincrease in OB/GYN insurance premiums. A similar result occurred in \nTexas on homeowners insurance where cost and availability of insurance \nbecame an issue because companies lost money in the market and could \nnot cover the insured losses on hurricanes.\n\n  In structuring legislation to put caps on jury verdicts in OB/GYN \ncases, due regard should be given to the history and development of \ntrial by jury under the common law where reliance is placed on average \nmen and women who comprise a jury to reach a just result reflecting the \nvalues and views of the community.\n  Jury trials in modern tort cases descend from the common law jury in \ntrespass, which was drawn from and intended to be representative of the \naverage members of the community in which the alleged trespass \noccurred. This coincides with the incorporation of negligence standards \nof liability into trespass actions.\n  This ``representative'' jury right in civil actions was protected by \nconsensus among the state drafters of the U.S. Constitution's Bill of \nRights. The explicit trial by jury safeguards in the seventh amendment \nto the Constitution were adaptations of these common law concepts \nharmonized with the sixth amendment's clause that local juries be used \nin criminal trials. Thus, from its inception at common law through its \ninclusion in the Bill of Rights and today, the jury in tort/negligence \ncases is meant to be representative of the judgment of average members \nof the community, not of elected representatives.\n  The right to have a jury decide one's damages has been greatly \ncircumscribed in recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court. \nAn example is the analysis that the court has recently applied to limit \npunitive damage awards.\n  In recent cases, the Court has shifted its Seventh Amendment focus \naway from two centuries of precedent in deciding that federal appellate \nreview of punitive damage awards will be decided on a de novo basis and \nthat a jury's determination of punitive damages is not a finding of \nfact for purposes of the re-examination clause of the Seventh \nAmendment--``no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in \nany Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the \ncommon law''. Then, in 2003, the Court reasoned that any ratio of \npunitive damages to compensatory damages greater than 9:1 will likely \nbe considered unreasonable and disproportionate, and thus constitute an \nunconstitutional deprivation of property in non-personal injury cases. \nPlaintiffs will inevitably face a vastly increased burden to justify a \ngreater ratio, and appellate courts have far greater latitude to \ndisallow or reduce such an award.\n  These decisions may have already, in effect, placed caps on some jury \nverdicts in malpractice cases which may involve punitive damages.\n  Consideration of the many complex issues on the Senate floor on the \npending legislation will obviously be very difficult in the absence of \na markup in committee or the submission of a committee report and a \ncommittee bill.\n  The pending bill is the starting point for analysis, discussion, \ndebate and amendment. I am prepared to proceed with the caveat that \nthere is much work to be done before the Senate would be ready, in my \nopinion, for consideration of final passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we had a debate today--sort of a debate, \nbecause we are only debating whether to proceed to a debate on the \nissue of whether we are going to continue to allow obstetricians and \ngynecologists and nurse-midwives to be able to practice in this country \nbecause of the runaway cost of medical liability insurance. The \nDemocrats are not even allowing us to proceed to the bill, just like \nlast year, when we tried to pass a more comprehensive reform. If they \ndon't like the bill, let's amend the bill. But to have no debate on the \nbill, it seems to me, they are completely turning their backs on the \nwomen and children of this country, and those babies yet to be born.\n  I had a discussion this afternoon with the President of the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. I was talking to her about \nthe numbers of students going into the field of obstetrics and \ngynecology. At the Nevada School of Medicine, the lowest number ever of \nstudents have applied to go into obstetrics and gynecology. She pointed \nout a statistic in the State right next door, Utah. That number \nactually was zero. Zero have decided to go into obstetrics and \ngynecology. Let me repeat--in Utah, there are no new physicians this \nyear who decided to go into obstetrics and gynecology. That is an \nalarming figure for the future.\n  For those people who are saying it is a problem but it is not that \nbad--the problem is bad today and it is going to get much worse in the \nfuture.\n  There have been statistics bantered about as to why this happened and \nwhy that happened. However, the bottom line is shown pretty well in \nthis picture. This building is located in a very busy thoroughfare in \nLas Vegas. This is a picture taken last week . The sign says, ``OB/\nGYN--For Lease.'' The represents what is going on in many places in \nNevada and other parts of the country--OB/GYN practices are shutting \ndown.\n  There are obstetricians and gynecologists leaving my State. It is the \nfastest growing State in the country by far, yet we have OB/GYNs \nleaving. They are stopping their practices. Some of them are retiring \nearly. Some of them are limiting their practices to only the practice \nof gynecology. For others to get coverage from the insurance companies, \nthey have to limit the number of babies that they deliver each month.\n  My wife and I have had three wonderful children. Three of the most \nremarkable experiences of my life were the births of our three \nchildren. I know a husband and wife team, Joe and Kirsten Rojas, both \nof them OB/GYNs. They are passionate about what they do. They love to \ndeliver babies. We have been out to dinner with them and often they get \ninterrupted, and they have to go off and deliver a baby. Some of the \nhardest working people are OB/GYNs. Yet now they cannot afford to\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nkeep practicing. They have to limit the number of deliveries.\n  The Rojases are our friends. We talk with them, and they have \nactually talked about leaving Nevada to go to California to practice \ntheir passion of delivering babies. They love Las Vegas. As a matter of \nfact, Dr. Joe Rojas, his father, was my mom's gynecologist. Actually, \nhe did surgery on my wife when she had a medical condition. I graduated \nhigh school with Dr. Joe Rojas. He was born and raised in southern \nNevada, and his wife now is in practice in Nevada, and they may have to \nleave their beloved home because they cannot afford the high costs of \nmedical liability insurance.\n  I want to put up another chart that shows the comparison of the rates \nin States around the country compared with California. Some people are \nsaying the insurance rates are rising or falling because of the stock \nmarket, or insurance companies are just raising the rates arbitrarily \nor because of some kind of actuarial tables. The bottom line is on this \nchart. This puts it into context.\n  The one State where we have had medical liability reform for any \nlength of time, and it has been since the mid 1980s after surviving \nmultiple court challenges, is the State of California. They enacted \nwhat is called MICRA. It is a strong medical liability reform law that, \nfrankly, you could not get passed in the State of California today \nbecause the trial lawyers are so powerful. Over the years the trial \nlawyers have made so much money off of lawsuits that they are, I would \nargue, the most powerful political lobby in the United States today.\n  But in California they were able to enact a medical liability reform \nbill. Their rates are down here shown by the blue line. You see very \nlittle increase over the years all the way through 1999. The rest of \nthe country is shown by this red dashed line. You can see the rates \ngoing up. This only goes through about 1999. If we took it out to the \nyear 2004, to today, you would see another spike going up right now.\n  Actually the biggest increases in medical liability insurance we have \nseen have been in the last few years. This crisis is growing and \ngetting worse year by year.\n  Let us just compare a few cities in two States that have enacted good \nmedical liability reform versus cities in four States that have not.\n  Los Angeles in California: They have their MICRA law which is an \neffective medical liability reform law. Denver, CO: Once again, they \nhave had a law on the books for about 10 years. They have an excellent \nlaw there.\n  Let us look here at OB/GYNs. There are some other specialties and the \ncomparison is very fair, but us stay with OB/GYNs:\n  Los Angeles, a little over $54,000 a year; Denver, their premiums are \nabout $31,000 a year; New York City, $89,000; Los Angeles, $108,000. By \nthe way, this number, because this is 2002 data, is very low. In Las \nVegas, it is somewhere between $140,000 and $200,000 a year, depending \non how many babies they are delivering and whether they are dealing \nwith difficult pregnancies. Looking on: Chicago, $102,000; and Miami, \n$201,000 per year in medical liability premiums.\n  Some people say these are rich doctors. Has anybody talked to an OB/\nGYN and asked them how much money they make these days? In Maryland, \nthey get paid $1,400 for a delivery--not just a delivery but all the \nprecare, the delivery, and the aftercare--$1,400 for all of those \nvisits, including the hospital time. In the State of Nevada, Medicaid \npays $1,200. That is about what managed care pays in the State of \nNevada as well. These are not rich doctors.\n  By the way, we are not just talking about doctors; we are talking \nabout nurse-midwives as well. When was the last time you talked to a \nrich nurse-midwife? They are in a crisis as well. A lot of them are \nhaving to leave their practices. In 2 States, legislators they have \nenacted excellent reforms, in too few states, nothing has been done.\n  That is the simplest evidence we can give as to why it is so \ndesperately needed to enact the bill we have on the floor today. It \nwill protect people involved in the delivery of babies and those \ninvolved in the practice of gynecology.\n  We have heard anecdotal stories about women delivering babies \nliterally on the side of the road because they had to drive too far \nbecause their obstetrician left town. This is happening in my State, in \nArizona, in Mississippi, in West Virginia--there are 19 States \ncurrently in crisis. Of the States that are left, all but five are \nshowing signs of heading into crisis. The one thing we know, unless \nthis problem is fixed, is that all of those States showing signs of \ncrisis will head into the crisis as well.\n  How bad does the situation have to get before this body and those who \ndefend the trial lawyers finally say enough is enough? How bad does it \nhave to get? How many women have to be denied the care they need?\n\n  In the State of Nevada, sometimes politics drives this argument. \nSometimes it drives many pieces of legislation around here. In the \nState of Nevada, our level I trauma center closed a few years ago. Just \nprior to its closing, the Democrat leaders in our State said there was \nno way they would pass medical liability reform--no way--it would never \nsee the light of day. Our level I trauma center closed. What happened? \nBecause of that closing, 3 weeks later a medical liability reform bill \nwas passed in the State of Nevada. That medical liability reform bill \nis not a good one--it does have some good components, but it certainly \ndoes not go far enough. In the State of Nevada, we are trying to close \nthe loopholes that were left open by that bill.\n  The politics that can be generated out of debating the bill and going \nforward can be a positive thing for actually getting this bill passed. \nThe level I trauma center that closed in my State is the same level I \ntrauma center where Roy Horn--the famous entertainer from Siegfried and \nRoy who was attacked by the tiger this last year--was treated. Had that \nlevel I trauma center not been reopened, Roy Horn would probably not be \nwith us today.\n  The reason it is so apparent that this legislation would work is \nbecause we have the numbers here to show that in the States who have \nstrong medical liability laws, much of the costs have been constrained. \nCase in point, the reason our level 1 trauma center was allowed to \nreopen was that our Governor stepped in and said: We will cover the \nlevel I trauma center under the State's liability protection.\n  What does the State of Nevada have for liability protection? It has a \n$50,000 cap for total damages, which is much more severe than we have \nin this bill. We have only a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages. You \ncan get as much as you want out of economic damages, and you can get as \nmuch as a jury says. Whatever your medical costs, you can get all of \nthose. But on pain and suffering, with some of the most outrageous \nrunaway jury awards, we limit it to $250,000.\n  Some say you are limiting the access to courts when you do that. In \nthe State of California, once again, there have been tens of millions \nof dollars awarded in loss of income. For instance, a child was \ninjured, and in one case $84 million was awarded by a jury. We are not \nlimiting the access. We are trying to get rid of the frivolous lawsuits \nthat are plaguing this Nation and leading to this crisis. There is a \ndirect correlation.\n  Senator Daschle stood on the floor earlier today and said this bill \nwould not help doctors. I question that statement because the doctors \nare supporting this bill. Virtually every medical association in this \ncountry is supporting this bill today. If it is not providing relief to \nthe doctors, why are they supporting this bill? The answer is obvious. \nThe answer is, it will help. It will help our entire system, and it \nwill help those women and children who are being denied access to care \nright now. Unfortunately, if we don't do something, this situation in \nthe future is only going to get worse and worse and worse.\n  The bill we have before us today, Senator Gregg and I introduced. I \nappreciate all of the great work he has done on this bill, which is a \nnarrowed down version of what we tried to pass last year. What we tried \nto pass last year was a comprehensive bill. If we are not able to move \nto this bill today, we are going to try to do emergency room and trauma \ncare and a good samaritan bill packaged together. If we can't get that \ndone, we are going to do inner-city and rural health care areas--\nunderserved areas.\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\n  We are trying to drive this issue home to the American people. They \nrealize where their representatives stand.\n  Some have said you are trying to get a rollcall vote. You are darned \nright we are. We are trying to let people know who stands with patients \nand who stands with women and children with this bill and who stands \nwith the trial lawyers.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Another friend of mine in southern Nevada, whom I was \ntalking to about 6 months ago, is one of the best OB/GYNs we have in \nsouthern Nevada. He focused his practice on difficult pregnancies, on \nthe high-risk pregnancies, pregnancies with complicating factors. Maybe \nthere is diabetes involved. That is a very common problem. One of my \ngoddaughters who babysits our children has gestational diabetes. It is \nnot an uncommon problem among women. During that time, there can be \ncomplications develop because of diabetes. It can be a very serious \nproblem, but if handled by highly trained physicians, usually you do \nnot end up with any problems.\n  Because my friend is in the high-risk category--by the way, he has \nnever had a lawsuit against him--his insurance company this past year \nsaid he had to severely limit the number of babies he could deliver. \nThis is his passion, and now he has to limit the number of high-risk \ndeliveries. That means some other OB/GYN who is not as highly trained \nis going to have to deliver those babies.\n  If you are getting ready to deliver and you have a high-risk \npregnancy, you would want the best possible medical care you could get. \nYou would want the most highly trained physician. If you were told that \nbecause of our medical liability crisis in this country--I am sorry, \nyou cannot go see your doctor--the one you have come to trust, because \nthey had to limit the number of babies they could deliver in this \nmonth, imagine how that whole family would feel--the father, the \nmother, the grandparents. It puts an unnecessary risk on that delivery \nwe should not be facing.\n  While no one wants to have medical malpractice cases, there are \nmistakes that occur in medicine. I am a veterinarian by profession. \nThere are human mistakes. There is gross negligence. Those people \nshould have the right to access a courtroom. They should have the \nability of a remedy. I argue that our legislation actually gets them \nthe remedy faster. It limits the attorney's fees so more of the money \ngoes to the victim. It also gets the money to the victim faster. Right \nnow it can take 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years. A lot of times the patient may \nhave already died. Our bill gets them the compensation they need much \nmore quickly and in a fair manner.\n  I have heard it described that this bill discriminates against women. \nThat would be like saying the whole State of California and the whole \nState of Colorado discriminates against women. That is ridiculous. \nCalifornia and Colorado are the two best examples of medical liability \nreform having been enacted and have been enacted for enough time to see \nit work. The patients who are injured actually get the compensation \nthey deserve and we do not have the proliferation of frivolous lawsuits \nwe see in the rest of the country in the healthcare field. There are \nmany areas of tort reform we need to address. This happens to be one of \nthem.\n  Anyone who has delivered or seen their child's birth knows the \nanxiety that builds up; it is a tense time. Every time one of our \nbabies comes out of the birth canal, we are hoping and praying \neverything is going to be all right. The biggest fear of any parent is \nfor something to go wrong. We want to know the best possible health \ncare and the best possible health care provider is going to be there. \nThat is not happening in too many cases. That is not happening because, \nI believe, the trial lawyers have been too powerful in the United \nStates. We have to break that power base if we really want to care \nabout the mothers who are expecting or about the level of gynecological \ncare they have come to expect and deserve in this country.\n\n  This legislation is critical to the future quality of life in the \nUnited States. It is critical that we put special interests aside and \nthe interests of patients at the forefront. That is what we are \ndebating today. Are we going to put expectant mothers, midwives, OB/\nGYNs first? Or are we going to put the trial bar first?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. With the attention of my friend from Nevada, I ask \nunanimous consent I be allowed to speak as in morning business for 6 or \n7 minutes. I think there are a couple of other speakers on the majority \nside who want to be here. When they come over, I will wrap up my \nremarks to give them time to be heard on the matter.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I agree to the unanimous consent request with the caveat \nthat if a Member of the majority comes over and seeks recognition, they \nwill be recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to do that and I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Growing Anarchy in Haiti\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I come this afternoon to express my deep \nconcern over the growing anarchy and lawlessness in Haiti. This ominous \nsituation, only miles off our own shores, threatens to overwhelm the \nelected government of Haiti in a number of days, and unless our \ncountry, the United States, along with other members of the \ninternational community, acts to stop it, it will get worse and pose \nfar many more serious problems for us.\n  In my view, 3 years of neglected, mixed signals and inertia by the \npresent administration--and the international community, for that \nmatter--have brought a country already steeped in misery and poverty to \nthe brink of uncontrollable violence and chaos. With respect to our own \nadministration, which has sought to remake the political landscape of \nthe Middle East, it is profoundly disturbing and unsettling that it \nseems incapable or unwilling to act to fortify a struggling democracy \nin our hemisphere.\n  I will not defend every action of the Aristide government in Haiti. \nThere have been major problems there. I accept that and understand \nthat. But no one denies this government was duly elected by the people \nof Haiti and it is being threatened today by a group of thugs and \nrebels, many of them who come from the previous death squads and ousted \narmed forces members which ruled that country with a brutal hand, who \nmake up the majority of the people holding the second and fourth \nlargest cities in Haiti today.\n\n  I am not standing here as some political defense of a specific \nadministration, but I do stand here as someone who believes that if we \nare going to defend democracy, we have to be willing to stand up when \nfragile democracies, such as this desperately poor country, are being \nthreatened by a group of people who do not have the interests of \ndemocracy at heart and have no right to be threatening this \ndemocratically elected government.\n  While I cannot discuss the administration's classified briefing of \nthis morning, I can say that I was stunned by the lack of any coherent \nadministration strategy for addressing the violence that may unseat the \nelected government. It is no secret that Haiti's long history of \nauthoritarian governments as well as political and social upheaval have \nmade it ripe to destabilize. The Haitian people continue to be the \nprincipal victims of this instability. The statistics are devastating.\n  Eighty percent of Haitians live in abject poverty; that is, 8 out of \n10 people. By 1998, the World Bank reported that the per capita income \nin Haiti was $250 a year, less than one-tenth of the average in all of \nLatin America. In addition, only half of Haitian children attend \nschool. Only 45 percent of the Haitian population can read or write and \nonly marginally so. That is less than the people of Iraq.\n  The scarcity of resources have contributed to a public health crisis \nin that nation. Fifteen percent of children don't live past the age of \n5. The average life expectancy is under 50 years of age. Haitians \nsuffer from the highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the Western Hemisphere, \nroughly 6 percent of the population.\n  I note the presence of the Presiding Officer who, in a former life \nand occupation, knew these numbers and statistics as well as anybody. I \nappreciate her listening to this because she understands better than \nmany what goes on in these impoverished nations.\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\n  Equally important are the intangible effects of this instability in \nthis little country. Chief among them is the growing chaos in civil \nsociety. Indeed, the very fabric of Haitian society is at risk as pro \nand antigovernment factions armed with every imaginable weapon are \nincreasingly clashing in the streets. Just in the last 2 weeks, more \nthan 50 people have been killed in politically charged street protests. \nThis violence took a new and disturbing turn when a group of armed \ngangs seized the towns of Cap Haitien and Gonaives, Haiti's second and \nfourth largest cities. They burned police stations and homes of \nsupporters of Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide.\n  The year 2004 was to be a year of rejoicing and celebration for the \npeople of Haiti as they were expected to proudly celebrate 200 years of \nindependence. Instead they are forced to flee from their communities to \nescape seemingly indiscriminate violence. There is no mystery, in my \nview, who is behind these armed attacks. They have audaciously \nidentified themselves to local and international journalists. They are \nformer members of the Haitian armed forces and former members of the \nso-called FRAPH, the paramilitary organizations that terrorized \nHaitians in the early 1990s. They were responsible for the deaths of \nthousands of Haitians and the flight of tens of thousands more who were \nprepared to risk their lives at sea coming to this country rather \nthan bear the repression and violence that was a daily occurrence in \nthat country. They are back in Haiti, and they are within an eyelash of \ntaking control of Haiti again. We are going to see the effects of it \nhere in a matter of days.\n\n  These armed thugs have publicly announced that they intend to march \non Port-au-Prince within hours. In fact, within 15 minutes of my \naddress today, a decision will be made by the so-called political \nopposition in Haiti on whether to accept the recommended political \nsolution that would bring about a new Prime Minister, sort of a \ncopresidency with the present elected government. That is the offer to \nbe made. It has been rejected in the last several days by these gangs \nand the opposition.\n  At 5 o'clock they are going to announce whether they are willing to \ntry it again. I hope they will try. I hope they will accept what has \nbeen offered to them by CARICOM, our Government, and others. If they \ndon't, I am fearful that we will see a continued rise in this violence, \nthe cost of human life, of innocent life unnecessarily.\n  The administration up to now has offered only words. I commend Colin \nPowell. He has said that we respect this elected government and we \ndon't believe it ought to be overthrown, that we will not support any \nremoval of this democratically elected government. But those are words. \nThey are important words coming from an important individual, but it \ndoesn't diffuse the growing crisis. A rejection of the political \nsolution does not portend well for the people of this country. A \nviolent coup that unseats the duly elected government is not an \nauspicious foundation for further stability in that country as the \npainful aftermath of the 1991 coups should remind us.\n  It is too late for diplomacy alone to turn the tide. The political \nopposition's rebuff of last weekend's diplomatic mission makes that \npainfully clear. The international community must act with strength and \nresolve to thwart these criminal elements and prevent the impending \nhumanitarian refugee crisis that is about to explode before our very \neyes. It is time for the administration to take the lead in this \nmatter.\n  I am not suggesting that we send some massive force. We are talking \nabout 200, 300, 400 gang members, thugs. It is not a large operation. \nIt wouldn't take much of an international force to send a message that \nwe are not going to allow this government, this crowd to overthrow the \nelected government.\n  Our position as of right now is that we won't do anything. We are not \ngoing to step up until there is some political context in which to \noperate.\n  There will be a political context when we let these thugs know that \nwe are not going to tolerate the overthrow of this government by asking \nothers to join us. I hope the administration would be prepared to act, \nparticularly in light of what I anticipate to be the rejection of the \noffer of a political solution.\n  While I commend CARICOM, the Caribbean community's organization, for \nongoing efforts to find a temporary solution to the political crisis, \nthese efforts have so far been fruitless because the political \nopposition hopes they will be able to watch an overthrow of this \nelected government and then count on the U.S. Government to come in and \nsanction them, as if somehow they have arrived in power legitimately.\n  Let me say to them today: If you think for a single second you are \ngoing to get any support out of this Congress by overthrowing an \nelected government, you are fooling yourselves. It is not going to \nhappen.\n\n  This government of ours needs to speak loudly and clearly to these \npeople that this is not what the United States stands for. This is not \nan endorsement of every action by the Aristide government any more than \nwe endorse every action of other governments around this hemisphere or \nelsewhere. But to sit back and sort of wink, in a sense, that it is OK \nfor these gangs and thugs and literally drug dealers, some of the worst \nelements that that country has ever seen, come back into power and be \nable to overthrow this government is a huge mistake.\n  It is occurring on this administration's watch. To allow it to happen \nwill be tragic. Let there be no doubt the United States will suffer, \nalong with the Haitian people, if we permit this to go on. Haiti is \nlocated only miles from our doorstep. Lawlessness in Haiti only ripens \nconditions for narcotrafficking and illegal migration.\n  Haiti is already a major transition site for drugs coming into this \ncountry. We know that already. If we think we are going to get a better \ndeal from these gangs that are about to overthrow this country, we are \nmaking a mistake. Engagement with the Haitian people is clearly in the \nbest interests of both our peoples.\n  Not only is the lack of real leadership on the part of our own \ncountry disgraceful and disappointing, it is dangerous. Without that \nleadership, there will be worse violence and greater chaos.\n  Once security has been restored, the administration has at its \ndisposal the tools to move both sides toward a political compromise, \nshould it choose to utilize them. With respect to the Government of \nHaiti, that includes providing direct assistance to the Haitian police, \nassistance in the form of training and equipment in return for \ncompliance with the CARICOM initiative.\n  With respect to political parties and civil society, the United \nStates should revoke U.S. visas to any of these organization members \nwho are unwilling to participate wholeheartedly with the diplomatic \nefforts to find compromise or who support or condone violence. If it \ntakes legislation banning these people from getting visas, I will do \nit. These people travel to the United States all the time and then turn \naround and provide support to these thugs and then anticipate coming \nhere when it gets a little dangerous. They have no right to come to \nAmerica, if they participate in this action going on in Haiti as we \nspeak.\n  The Dominican Republic and other Caribbean countries must take action \nto stop these territories from being used as a transit point for \nillegal arms shipments to Haiti or as staging areas for armed Haitian \nopposition groups. Equally important, the United States and the \ninternational community must stop ignoring the negative impact that our \neconomic policy of withholding assistance to the Haitian people is \nhaving on Haiti's stability.\n  Corruption aside, the Haitian government's lack of resources would \npreclude anybody from effectively ruling that country. It is \ndisingenuous of the Bush administration and the international community \nto cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to these desperately \npoor people, some of the poorest people in the world. They needed just \na small amount of help, and we were unwilling to give them any over the \nlast 3 or 4 years. It is no wonder that chaos is running wild in that \ncountry today.\n  I hope the administration will take far more concrete steps to \nrespond to this crisis than they have presently. My hope is that within \na matter of minutes the political opposition and\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\nothers will agree to the political solution offered to them. If not, \nthe United States and the international community need to step up and \noffer to send in armed forces, if necessary, to protect the overthrow \nof this legitimately elected government.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, what is the situation regarding time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Of the 10 minutes remaining, 5 minutes is for the \nminority and 5 is for the majority leader, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The majority leader has the last 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, my \ncolleague, Senator Ensign, has been waiting for the minority leader to \ncome. The time is here for the majority to use. If the minority leader \ndecides to use 5 minutes, I ask unanimous consent that the majority be \ngiven the final 5 minutes to speak on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The junior Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I want to sum up this debate telling one \nstory and making a few other points. Some on the other side of the \naisle claim ``they want to make health care a birthright for every \nsingle child born in this country.'' Yet they are driving the very \ndoctors who bring America's babies into the world out of their medical \npractices.\n  Let me remind you of Melinda Sellard's story. She is the unfortunate \nwoman who went through a horrifying experience of delivering a baby on \nthe side of the road in the middle of the night because her doctor had \nquit obstetrics altogether due to exorbitant insurance premiums. En \nroute, she and her husband had to drive right past the Copper Queen \nCommunity Hospital, which closed its maternity ward 2 months earlier \nbecause of the medical liability crisis. Instead, the Sellards were \nforced out onto the highway to try to get to the only hospital within \n6,000 square miles with obstetricians who could afford malpractice \ninsurance.\n  After enduring the excruciating pains of labor without anesthesia, \nMelinda was forced to give her newborn infant CPR, since the baby was \nnot breathing immediately after delivery. She finally got her newborn \nbreathing, wrapped him in a sweater she was wearing, and drove the rest \nof the way to the hospital where the emergency staff cut the umbilical \ncord in the parking lot.\n  I urge my colleagues to think of Melinda and the other mothers in \nthis country who have lost their doctors and to stand up to the trial \nlawyers and support cloture on this bill. The ``objects in your rear \nview mirror that are closer than you think'' should never be a woman \nand her newborn child on the side of the road.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I know that time is close to having the \nvote. I will use my leader time. I want to make a couple of additional \nremarks about the bill.\n  We have had a great deal of discussion today and comments made by \nsome of our Republican colleagues about the hardships malpractice \ninsurance premiums place on doctors. There is no difference of opinion \nin that regard. Both Republicans and Democrats agree this is a real \nchallenge and it certainly demands our attention. But I think we have \nto reject cloture this afternoon for the simple reason this bill does \nnothing to solve it. As we have heard most of the day, every piece of \navailable evidence shows capping damages has no impact on the cost of \nmalpractice insurance.\n  Reports from the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, Weiss Ratings, and the Medical Liability Monitor all confirm \nmalpractice awards are not the primary factor driving the cost of \nmalpractice insurance higher. Even the insurance industry admits caps \nwon't protect doctors from higher insurance premiums. Just last year, \nBob White, president of the largest medical malpractice insurer in \nFlorida, stated, ``No responsible insurer can cut its rates after a \n[medical malpractice tort reform] bill passes.''\n  Doctors deserve our help. They need our help. They certainly want it. \nBut no doctor should expect lower insurance rates as a result of this \nbill. It is wrong to take away the women's right in the courtroom \nmerely to protect the profits of the insurance companies.\n  This bill would create, for the first time, an unjust two-tiered \nlegal system, actually restricting the rights of women and infants who \nare hurt by the negligence of a doctor, HMO, drug company, or even a \nmedical device manufacturer.\n  If a man is prescribed defective blood pressure medication by an \ninternist, he can recover full damages under the bill. If a woman is \nprescribed blood pressure medication during pregnancy that causes blood \nclots, her damages will be arbitrarily capped. There may even be a \nconstitutional question involved in this disparity between men and \nwomen.\n  The idea that men and women should have unequal access to the legal \nsystem offends, if not the Constitution, certainly our sense of \njustice. But the real problem with this bill isn't merely that it \nvalues the injuries of men and women differently, as troubling as that \nis. The real problem is that it presumes that somehow those of us in \nthis Chamber are better able to determine how to compensate injured \npatients in a preemptive way, knowing ahead of time all of the \ncircumstances. Knowing exactly how these people are going to be \naffected by the decisions we make today is something I don't think \nanyone could acknowledge they have the ability to do.\n  This morning, I spoke with Colin Gourely of Valley, NE. At his birth, \nhe suffered complications due to his doctor's negligence. Today he has \ncerebral palsy and is confined to a wheelchair. He has had five \nsurgeries to correct his bone problems that have occurred as a result \nof this serious misjudgment in medical care.\n  Politicians in Washington can't decide what is just compensation for \nColin's pain or the pain of any injured patient. We shouldn't apply the \none-size-fits-all remedy for the tens of thousands of women and infants \nwho are injured each year.\n  The fact is, no amount of money can ever compensate a parent for \ntheir child's pain, but malpractice awards are not simply about money. \nThey are about offering victims a sense of justice, a way of holding \naccountable those responsible for their injuries or the death of their \nloved ones.\n  Malpractice awards are decided by juries and approved by judges. This \nis the same system we rely on to decide life or death issues in capital \ncases. Why wouldn't we trust our citizens to fairly evaluate how to \ndeliver justice for the victims of medical malpractice?\n  There are real solutions that can bring down the cost of malpractice \ninsurance, and Democrats are eager to work with our Republican \ncolleagues to implement them. We have talked about tax credits to \noffset the high cost of premiums, prohibitions against commercial \ninsurers engaging in activities that violate Federal antitrust laws, \nsensible ways to reduce medical errors, direct assistance to geographic \nareas that have a shortage of health care providers, due especially to \nmalpractice insurance premiums.\n  So if our colleagues are as concerned about the plight of doctors as \nthey have indicated again today, I hope they will work with us to \ndevise a real solution. Let's drop the maneuvers that protect only the \nprofits of insurers and HMOs and pharmaceutical companies, and let's \nhave a serious discussion about how we solve the problem for our \nNation. I think we have an obligation to have that conversation and \nultimately come to some solution. Doctors and patients deserve it. They \ndeserve an answer. This bill is not it.\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\n  As a result, once again I urge my colleagues to reject cloture. I \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 429, S. 2061, a bill to improve \n     women's access to health care services and provides improved \n     medical care by reducing the excessive burden the liability \n     system places on the delivery of obstetrical and \n     gynecological services:\n         Bill Frist, Judd Gregg, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Lisa \n           Murkowski, Susan Collins, Elizabeth Dole, Michael B. \n           Enzi, James M.

Mr. President, in 1996, the Congress voted overwhelmingly \nto pass the Defense of Marriage Act. This is a bipartisan bill, where \nMembers of both parties in both Houses voted overwhelmingly to define \nmarriage as an institution in traditional terms, between a man and a \nwoman. This, as you may recall, was in part a response at the time to \nthe Vermont decision implementing civil unions. This body, just like \napproximately 38 States, has now passed defense of marriage acts \ndefining marriage in traditional terms.\n  Last September, the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the \nConstitution held a hearing at which we elicited testimony on this \nissue: Is the Defense of Marriage Act in jeopardy?\n  The reason we had that hearing is because the U.S. Supreme Court, \nlast year, made some pretty significant decisions, one of which was \nLawrence v. Texas, which, if the rationale was going to be followed \nthrough, would seem to place the Defense of Marriage Act in jeopardy, \nsaying that that somehow violated the Constitution, thus opening the \nway to marriage between same-sex couples.\n  At the time we had people, as you might imagine, as in every hearing, \nsome of whom said, oh, no, the Defense of Marriage Act will stand as \nlong as it is the will of Congress and the will of the American people. \nOthers said more presciently, as it turns out, that if there are judges \nwho want to use the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Lawrence v. \nTexas, and to extend that, indeed, yes, the Defense of Marriage Act \ncould be in jeopardy--indeed, the very definition of marriage between a \nman and a woman that is part of the Federal law and, as I said, I \nbelieve some 38 States.\n  Well, of course, the day that many thought would come only remotely \nin the future came much more quickly, when the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt decided that, indeed, traditional marriage violated the \nMassachusetts Constitution. Now, some might say, well, since it was a \nmatter of State constitution law, it is limited only to the State of \nMassachusetts. But a closer reading of that decision reveals that one \nof the bases upon which the Massachusetts Supreme Court decided that \ntraditional marriage violated the Massachusetts Constitution was a U.S. \nSupreme Court decision in Lawrence v. Texas, interpreting the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  So as it turns out, there is a much closer relationship between the \nState court constitutional decision and a decision under the Federal \nConstitution.\n  Well, once the Massachusetts Supreme Court did, indeed, hold that \nmarriage was no longer limited to men and women in Massachusetts, some \nsaid this was just a State matter and there was no reason for the \nFederal Government to get involved, and there was no reason for other \nStates to be concerned. Yet over the last week or so, we have seen that \nindividuals have moved--I saw one report in the Washington Post of \npeople leaving Maryland and going to San Francisco and getting \nmarried--in defiance of State law, I might add--where the city of San \nFrancisco, the mayor, and others, would issue marriage licenses, and \nthen people would return to places such as Maryland. Or people would \nshow up in San Francisco and, because of an act of civil disobedience \nby the mayor and municipal officials there, seek to get married, even \nthough California law is consistent with Federal law and the law of \nother States defining marriage in traditional terms.\n  Indeed, we see in New Mexico and in Chicago, where the mayor said if \nsame-sex couples sought to get married, he saw no reason not to issue \nthem marriage licenses. Indeed, in Nebraska, a lawsuit in Federal Court \nis being defended by the attorney general of Nebraska under the Federal \nConstitution seeking to define marriage in not untraditional terms, to \nallow it not to be limited to just traditional marriage.\n  So this is not an issue that has been raised by Members of Congress \ninitially. This is a matter that has been injected into the public \narena by activist judges who have decided to radically redefine the \ninstitution of marriage in Massachusetts but the reverberations of \nwhich have resounded all across this Nation.\n  It is in that light I believe we in this body have a responsibility \nto ask what\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\nare the implications of the Massachusetts decision in this brush fire \nacross the country where local officials and others are in acts of \ncivil disobedience defying State law to issue marriage licenses and \nwhat are the ramifications of the Massachusetts decision in terms of \nthe continued viability of the Defense of Marriage Act at the Federal \nlevel.\n  Next Wednesday morning, March 3, under the auspices of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Chairman Hatch has graciously agreed to allow the \nholding of a subcommittee hearing of the Constitution Subcommittee, \nwhich I chair, to have witnesses talk about what the implications are \nin terms of national policy, in terms of the institution of marriage, \nwhich I believe is important. Indeed, if Congress is to be believed, on \na bipartisan, overwhelming basis Congress has said it is important and, \nindeed, that bill itself was signed by President Clinton.\n  We cannot simply stand idly by, in my opinion, and let activist \njudges radically redefine the institution of marriage when it stands in \nstark relief and defiance of the will of the American people and \ncertainly of the decision this body has made in terms of passing the \nDefense of Marriage Act. So we are going to have a hearing next \nWednesday on that issue.\n  I suspect others will come to the same conclusion I have, and that is \nthe Constitution of the United States will be amended eventually; that \nthis decision in Massachusetts will spread to Federal courts where \nothers will cite this Massachusetts decision as precedent for an \ninterpretation of the Federal Constitution that will strike down the \ndefinition of traditional marriage.\n  I think that is important for a couple of reasons. I know there are \npeople who are reluctant to even talk about this issue because they \ndon't want to be painted or cast as intolerant or haters or bashers or \nany other term one might think of. Indeed, I think it is important to \npoint out you can believe in the essential dignity and worth of every \nhuman being and still believe the institution of marriage is important \nto our civilization, to families, to providing the most stable means of \nestablishing family life, but also to the benefit of children.\n  The best interest of children requires us to do everything we can to \nencourage stable family life and, indeed, in the course of history, not \njust in this Nation's history, but throughout human history, I believe \nit is irrefutable that traditional marriage between a man and a woman \nis the firmest and most stable basis to establish family life. Indeed, \nthat is the relationship, that is the basic social unit under which \nchildren thrive and are at reduced risk.\n  When I was attorney general of Texas for 4 years, I had the \nresponsibility to collect child support for some 1.2 million children. \nThese were children who were from single-parent families. They were \neither born without their parents ever marrying or their parents \nmarried and then divorced and they, of course, were in the custody of \none parent and the other parent would typically be ordered to pay child \nsupport. I became very much convinced, not just because of the social \nscience, but because of what I saw as a person responsible for \ncollecting that child support for these 1.2 million children, that \nchildren are at less risk when they have two loving parents who care \nabout them and support them emotionally and financially; that certainly \ntraditional families are the optimal situation in terms of children \ndoing well and becoming productive citizens.\n\n  At that time, of course, it had nothing to do with this new and \nrevolutionary constitutional theory that has been thrust upon us by the \nMassachusetts Supreme Court that seems to be picking up around the \ncountry which I think we need to address, but really we need to, as a \nnation, reaffirm our commitment to doing what is in the best interest \nof our children.\n  Indeed, it is irrefutable that intact families, traditional \nfamilies--mom and dad providing role models for children they can then \nuse when they grow up to then become not only productive citizens but \nmoms and dads themselves and raise their own children--is something the \nFederal Government ought to be encouraging. We shouldn't be agnostic \nabout something that is so fundamentally important to the well-being of \nthis country and to our future. We should not stand idly by and see the \nconstitution of one State then spread to another State and, indeed, \nthen to the courts where the Federal Constitution is called into \nquestion that would radically redefine this basic social institution.\n  While I know there are those who are hesitant to talk about this \nissue because, as I say, no one wants to be cast as intolerant of other \nrelationships--indeed, I think you can say and recognize there are \npeople in loving relationships outside of marriage. But when they want \nto say marriage is what we redefine it to be, and there is no \ndifference between a man and a woman and a same-sex marriage, I think, \nfirst of all, that tends to trivialize what we all have come to \nrecognize as an institution that is a basic social good in this \ncountry. But it also is game playing.\n  There are others who say we want to have all the legal benefits of \nmarriage, but maybe we won't call it marriage, which to me is game \nplaying.\n  I am a little skeptical of that, especially when, as a lawyer, I know \nif two people of the same sex want to make contractual or other \narrangements between themselves so one can inherit from the other, so \none can act on the other's behalf by use of a power of attorney, either \nto make medical decisions, if one is disabled, or financial decisions \nif the circumstances arise, there is virtually an unlimited opportunity \nfor same-sex partners to order their relationship from a legal \nstandpoint in a way that satisfies virtually all the reasons I have \nheard articulated for same-sex marriage.\n  It is important we have a hearing. It is important for this body to \ndefend, if necessary, its prerogative under the Defense of Marriage Act \nto do what we believe and I believe the overwhelming number of American \npeople believe is in the best interest of families and children and not \nleave this to activist judges who consider themselves to be \nsuperlegislators, who consider their prerogative to take a social or \npolitical or some other agenda and essentially dictate that to the \nAmerican people from the bench.\n  We know Federal judges and many State judges serve for a lifetime. \nThere is no way for the American people, short of impeachment, to \nremove a Federal judge or a judge who is appointed for a lifetime who \nacts in such a radical fashion, so inconsistent with our norms and \ntraditions, with our traditional understanding of the separation of \npowers, And yet in a way that would so radically transform this \nfundamental social unit that is so important to who we are as people \nand as families, and one that is the best and most optimal arrangement \nfound yet in the history of mankind to have and raise children so that \nthey will be productive citizens.\n\n  I have come to the same reluctant position as I know the President \nannounced he has today and believe that indeed the Constitution will be \namended. The question is whether we the people are going to amend it by \nusing article V of the Constitution, which creates an admittedly \ndifficult process but one which is important to make sure that it is \nnot done flippantly, too fast or without adequate deliberation. It is \ntime to consider whether we ought to invoke that provision the Framers \nprovided in article V of the Constitution to say: Not so fast, judge. \nWe the people ultimately have the power within our hands to decide how \nthis institution will be defined and we think there is a positive \nsocial good to define marriage in traditional terms.\n  So I believe it is important, as the President has concluded in his \nannouncement today, that we consider a constitutional amendment.\n  There are some who say our Constitution is a sacred document. Indeed, \nI think our Constitution is very important and even an inspired \ndocument, but I disagree with those who say the Constitution is \nsacrosanct to the extent that they say the Constitution should never be \namended. Indeed, if the Founding Fathers believed the Constitution \nshould never be amended because it was a sacred document, then they \nwould not have provided a means within that document itself for \ndeliberation, hearings, decisions, and ultimately a vote of this body \nand of the other body by two-thirds and then three-quarters of the \nStates voting for\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\nratification, which is the process by which that Constitution can be \namended.\n  In my lifetime, I never imagined I would be standing on the Senate \nfloor having to say I believe in the traditional institution of \nmarriage between a man and a woman. I just thought, of all the other \nissues we would be debating in this body, whether they are matters of \nwar and peace, job creation, access to health care, education, all of \nthe important issues that affect the people in this country, the last \nissue I ever thought we would have to address would be a redefinition \nof marriage, but I submit that is where we are.\n  Reluctantly, as many of us come to this discussion--and I think if \none looks at the polls we have all followed in the news media in the \nlast few weeks since this issue has been splashed across our TV \nscreens, our newspapers, the Internet, and elsewhere, one sees that the \nAmerican people are getting the sense that something has gone terribly \nwrong, that somehow their values and their traditions are being \ndisrespected in a way that needs correction.\n  As more and more people find out about the way this came about, \nthrough a sort of--well, I would call it judicial lawlessness; in other \nwords, judges who are not interpreting the law but who are taking it \nupon themselves to redefine what the Constitution means and indeed \nredefine this basic social unit in our civilization, I think they are \ngoing to be pretty upset and they are going to expect us to take up a \ndiscussion of this constitutional amendment in a reasonable, \ndeliberate, civil sort of fashion.\n  I hope we can rise to that challenge. Indeed, if one looks at the \nvote in the Defense of Marriage Act, one sees there is an overwhelming \nbipartisan group in this body and in the other body who believe that \nthe institution of marriage is a positive social good and worthy of \npreservation. I hope we will not be afraid to talk about it in a frank \nand open way, to listen to the concerns of those who maybe are not yet \nconvinced, to take those into account and then, as a Senate, we can \ndischarge our responsibility under article V of the Constitution to \nbegin the process of allowing the American people to vote on the \ndefinition of marriage.\n\n  We know who is voting now and it is a handful of judges and municipal \nofficials who are encouraging civil disobedience. They are issuing \nmarriage licenses in violation of State law, for example, in California \nand elsewhere. Ultimately, if we are going to preserve something that I \nthink is infinitely worthy of preservation--and that is government of \nthe people, by the people and for the people--this is something we are \ngoing to have to do. This is a responsibility we are going to have to \naccept and we are going to have to risk the possibility that some may \nmischaracterize what we are trying to do as being disrespectful of \nother people. That is not what this is about.\n  I would condemn rhetoric or language which would appear to be \ndisrespectful of other people, but that does not mean at the same time \nthat I do not believe the institution of marriage is worthy of \nprotection.\n  I look forward to the hearing we are going to have in the \nConstitution Subcommittee on March 3, I believe at 10 in the morning. I \nanticipate that perhaps later in the month, maybe the week after we \ncome back from the March recess, we will have another hearing. Senator \nHatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, of course, reserves the \nright to make that final decision. At that time, we will begin to take \nup language, which we might then consider first in committee but then \non this floor, that would preserve the definition of marriage for the \nAmerican people and not allow ourselves to be dictated to by judges who \nare pursuing some other agenda, one that the overwhelming number of \nAmerican people disagree with strenuously.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Black History Month \nby supporting the Sickle Cell Treatment Act, which is S. 874, and \ninviting my colleagues to join me and my chief cosponsor, Senator \nSchumer, in doing the same. I am very pleased we now have over 40 \nbipartisan cosponsors in the Senate for this bill. We certainly would \nwelcome more. I invite our colleagues to look carefully at this act and \nto support it. It is an important measure. It deals with a disease that \nafflicts many hundreds of thousands of Americans and a disease that \nreally has not received enough attention and enough visibility in the \nlast few years.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral legislation is designed to treat and find \na comprehensive cure for sickle cell disease which is a genetic disease \nwhich primarily affects but not exclusively African Americans. About 1 \nin 300 newborn African-American infants is born with this disease, but \nthe disease also affects people of Hispanic, Mediterranean, and Middle \nEastern ancestry, as well as Caucasians.\n  More than 2.5 million Americans, mostly but again not exclusively \nAfrican Americans, have the sickle cell trait, which is not the same as \nhaving the disease.\n  Why focus on sickle cell disease? Because it is the most common \ngenetic disease that is screened in American newborns. People with the \ndisease have red blood cells that contain an abnormal type of \nhemoglobin. These cells have a sickle shape, hence the name of the \ndisease, that makes it difficult for the cells to pass through small \nblood vessels or carry the appropriate amount of oxygen or nutrients or \nantibiotics, if that has been prescribed. The tissue that does not \nreceive normal blood flow because of the disease eventually becomes \ndamaged and can and often does cause potentially life-threatening \ncomplications.\n  Stroke in particular is the most feared complication for children \nwith sickle cell disease. It may affect infants as young as 18 months. \nI have personally talked with a number of parents whose children have \nhad strokes as toddlers. One of the difficulties with this disease is \nrecognizing it--and I will talk about that in just a minute--\nrecognizing its symptoms. Young children can have strokes without the \nparents even realizing it for some time.\n  While some patients live without symptoms for years, many others do \nnot survive infancy or early childhood.\n  I became involved with this effort because of an African-American \ndoctor from St. Louis, Dr. Michael DeBaun, who treats children with \nsickle cell disease. When you meet the practitioners who specialize in \ntreating people who have this disease, you meet a series of American \nheroes. Dr. DeBaun is one of them. After meeting and visiting with him \nabout a year ago, I realized the hardship this disease puts on families \nand especially on the children, who often have to receive blood \ntransfusion after blood transfusion in order to avoid strokes. And, \nyes, in order to stay alive.\n  About one-third of children with sickle cell disease suffer a stroke \nbefore age 18. These children require frequent blood transfusions, \nsometimes 15 to 25 units of blood a year, to prevent subsequent \nstrokes.\n  If you study the disease, you will also learn firsthand how it can \naffect the daily lives of children. I will just use one example, 9-\nyear-old Isaac Cornell, whom I also had the privilege of meeting. He is \none of Dr. DeBaun's patients and attends fourth grade at Gateway \nElementary School in St. Louis. About four times a year, Isaac misses \nschool because of severe episodes of pain, with each episode lasting \nabout 5 to 7 days. Every 4 weeks Isaac has to go for a blood \ntransfusion at St. Louis Children's Hospital where he's treated by Dr. \nDeBaun. Isaac has a permanent port installed in his upper chest to \nallow for the transfusions. That is one of the reasons he cannot play \ncontact sports or join the wrestling team.\n\n  Sickle cell disease affects Isaac's decisions every day. He has to \ndrink plenty of water to lubricate his cells, he has to be careful not \nto overexert himself--and that is certainly difficult for a 9-year-old \nboy--and he has to be careful to get plenty of rest. Because so\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\nmany patients like Isaac are struggling with this disease, in April of \n2003, Senator Schumer and I introduced the Sickle Cell Treatment Act. \nOur friends, Representatives Danny Davis and Richard Burr, introduced a \ncompanion bill, H.R. 1736, in the House, which now has 39 bipartisan \ncosponsors.\n  S. 874, which is the bill Senator Schumer and I introduced, has 41 \nbipartisan cosponsors as well as the support of dozens of prominent \nAfrican-American children's and health advocates, as well as union and \nchurch groups including--I am going to read the list. This is not a \ncomplete list, but it includes the Congressional Black Caucus, the \nSickle Cell Disease Association of America, the American Medical \nAssociation, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the \nNational Association of Community Health Centers, the NAACP, the \nChildren's Defense Fund, the Health Care Leadership Council, United \nFood & Commercial Workers Union--Minority Coalition, the UFCW Faces of \nOur Children, United Church of Christ, and National Baptist U.S.A. \nThese advocates, as well as the others who support this legislation, \nknow the bill will make a difference in the lives of kids and families \nwho are struggling with sickle cell disease.\n  I want to outline four key ways in which the bill makes a difference. \nFirst, it increases access to affordable, quality health care. The \nprovision provides funding to currently eligible Medicaid recipients \nfor physician and laboratory services targeted to sickle cell disease \nthat are not currently reimbursed or are underreimbursed by Medicaid. \nImportantly, however, the bill does not increase the number of Medicaid \neligibles and the Federal Medicaid match will stay the same. We have \nstructured this bill so it is very affordable.\n  The bill also enhances services available to sickle cell disease \npatients. This is a crucial aspect of the bill. When you have this \ndisease, you have to stay on top of it. You have to manage this \ndisease. I mentioned Isaac Cornell before, how he drinks water and gets \nadequate rest and is careful not to overexert himself. You also have to \nknow the various respects in which the symptoms of the disease can show \nup. This is a tricky, sneaky disease.\n  I was talking with another parent whose son was having considerable \ndental problems. This is something people with this disease struggle \nwith, because when they get periodontal disease and some form of \nantibiotic is prescribed by their dentist, they can't be certain the \nred blood cells will carry the antibiotic to the infected point, so \nindeed any infections they have are particularly dangerous.\n  Obviously there is a whole medical side to this we have to be aware \nof, but in addition, people need to know about the disease. They need \nto receive counseling and education as well as screening, genetic \ncounseling, community outreach. Education and other services are \ncrucial. Currently, those kinds of services are not reimbursed under \nMedicaid unless they are performed by the physicians such as Dr. \nDeBaun. Dr. DeBaun simply does not have the time, certainly not as much \nas he would want to spend, the hours and hours he would need to spend \nwith each set of parents, with each patient, in order to go over all \nthe various ways in which this disease can affect their lives.\n\n  So it is important that Medicaid reimburse these services, even if \nthey are done by counselors or outreach personnel who are not \nphysicians. They are perfectly appropriate and able to do it. The bill \nwould allow nonmedical personnel such as counselors to spend time with \nsickle cell disease families to discuss how they can manage the \ndisease. That, by the way, will end up saving the Government money \nbecause it will prevent strokes and other serious episodes that then \nMedicaid does appropriately reimburse.\n  The bill creates 40 sickle cell disease treatment centers. This \nprovision of the bill authorizes the Department of Health and Human \nServices to distribute grants to up to 40 eligible community health \ncenters nationwide for $10 million for the next 5 fiscal years for a \ntotal of $50 million. That is subject to appropriation. That could mean \na health center grant in almost every State. Grant money may be used \nfor purposes including the education, treatment, and continuity of care \nfor sickle cell disease patients and for training health professionals.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a sickle cell disease research \nheadquarters. This provision of the bill creates a national \ncoordinating center, which also would be operated by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, to coordinate and oversee sickle cell \ndisease funding and research conducted at hospitals, universities, and \ncommunity-based organizations. This will help ensure efficiency so we \ncan share information about the disease, accountability to make sure \nthe taxpayers' dollars are being used well, and also help us get best \npractices and monitor outcomes for the disease so we can improve \nservices to people who have it around the country.\n  I cannot overemphasize the outpouring of support Senator Schumer and \nI have received for this bill. I am sure if he were here he would \nrelate the stories he has had. I have myself received personal \nhandwritten letters from sickle cell disease patients who expressed \ntheir gratitude for this legislation and who asked what they can do to \nhelp pass the bill since they know how many families it will help.\n  For example, Allyce Renee Ford of Blue Springs, MO, wrote, and I will \nparaphrase: I was pleased to read of your bill to increase funding for \ntreatment of sickle cell disease. My twin sons were born with sickle \nsell in 1973 and suffered from this debilitating disease all their \nlives. They both lost the battle to painful complications in 2002. \nPlease believe me, it is a painful life-constricting disease both for \nthe victims and their families. Even though I do not have any other \nchildren to lose to the disease, I mourn for all the other parents who \nwill lose their children in the future--today, tomorrow, someday they \nwill lose them. Thank God there will be help for sickle cell disease \nvictims--help not just in the form of additional funding--and the bill \nis very affordable--but help in the form of greater visibility, \ncommunity support. This bill is lifting the profile of this disease \nwhich has remained in the corner for too long. The business exclusively \nin the past has been the business of those struggling and the small \ncommunity helping them. We need to show these people that the country \nis with them.\n  In conclusion, it is critical to help this historically underserved \npopulation. Many of these people do not even know they carry the trait \nor they have the disease until consequences have been visited upon them \nthat they could have lessened or mitigated in some respect had they had \nprior knowledge.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and Senator Schumer to honor Black \nHistory Month by cosponsoring this Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Act. I \ncannot think of a better way to honor this month than to help all of \nthe families, most of whom are African-American families, who are \nliving and struggling with this disease.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be closing in a very few moments, \nbut I want to express my disappointment in not being able to proceed to \nthe bill. We have been on the motion to proceed the last 2 days to a \nbill that reflects a pressing problem, a crisis in many States. It has \nto do with a medical liability system that is having an impact now, not \njust on physicians paying for their insurance, but on the quality of \ncare, access to care throughout the United States of America.\n  I do not believe the full impact of the medical malpractice \nmalignancy is truly understood by the average American. Like a cancer, \nthis malady is eating away at the experience of our medical system in \ncritical areas such as obstetrics.\n  Dr. Sean White of Kingsport is a perfect example of what is \nhappening. Dr. White moved to Tennessee in 2002 due to the outrageous \nincreases in medical malpractice premiums in Pennsylvania. A staggering \n7-physician group increase of $210,000 forced a 30-year-old practice to \nutterly dissolve. Alone, Dr. White's medical malpractice premiums were \nestimated to increase by $30,000 to $110,000.\n  And this wasn't just any practice, but an OB-GYN group focusing \nprincipally on one of the most precious of\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\nall practices, the delivery of babies. Medical malpractice malignancy \nultimately claimed the two senior physicians in the practice, as they \nretired early, while Dr. White was forced to leave town.\n  ``They really had to scramble,'' Dr. White said of his fellow \ncolleagues who didn't have the option to retire early. ``They went to \ntwo local hospitals and asked them to just employ them because they \ncouldn't afford to pay their bills anymore. And no, I don't know how \nhospitals afford it.'' Dr. White left the Bethlehem practice in 2002 \nbecause the bank requested a lien on his home and the co-signature of \nhis wife, Tracy, to finance his malpractice premiums for that year.\n  ``I could see the hand-writing on the wall,'' Dr. White said. ``But I \nhave delivered so many babies in that community. You invest so much \ntime and energy into the practice and develop such a rapport with \npeople. I delivered half of my daughters' friends, the children of my \nown friends. It was very difficult to just pack up and leave.''\n  Collectively, Bethlehem's 72,000 residents lost the better part of a \ncentury of combined experience when Dr. White left for Tennessee and \nhis two senior partners took early retirement. Let me underscore here, \na better part of a century of experience claimed by exorbitant medical \nmalpractice premium hikes.\n  In addition to taking a loss in order to buyout his partnership in \nBethlehem, Tennessee has hardly been a refuge for Dr. White and his \nfamily. Yes, malpractice malignancy is also eating away in my own home \nstate, where Dr. White's personal medical malpractice premiums jumped \nto $65,000 this year, up $20,000 from just last year in Tennessee.\n  Statistics indicate that as many as nine in 10 obstetric physicians \nhave been sued in Tennessee if they're in the practice of delivering \nbabies for more than 10 years, Dr. White said. This despite the fact \nthat maternal death rates have plummeted to all time lows in this \ncountry.\n  ``The trial lawyers will tell you they are trying to weed out the bad \napples,'' Dr. White said. ``Obviously, with 90 percent being sued, \nthey're not all bad apples.''\n  And that is the crux of the issue here.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I would be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through you to the distinguished majority \nleader, I got a call from a dear friend in Nevada today, a surgeon. He \nis very active in public affairs, a very close friend of our Republican \nGovernor. He told me that in Nevada, where the Governor called a \nspecial session that we have caps, the insurance rates have not been \naffected at all; they are still going up. He originally had a policy \nwith St. Paul. They pulled out. Another company came in and doctors are \nalways concerned with what they call the ``tail,'' to make sure if \nsomething happens after their policy expires that they are covered for \nacts that took place in the past. He went with a new company. They \npulled out after a year and a half. Now he is going to have to pay more \nthan $100,000 for 1 year to have coverage for today and acts that took \nplace in the past.\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, a \nphysician, this medical malpractice is something we have to address. I \ndon't know the best form to do it. But when we do it, we are not only \ngoing to have to deal with some of the policies outlined by both \nparties today, but we will have to take a look at what the insurance \nindustry is doing to my friend and other physicians. This is not just a \nproblem generated solely by the trial bar; the insurance industry has \nsome culpability.\n  I hope the distinguished majority leader, when again we get to this \nissue, will help us come up with a framework and we can discuss this \nissue. Part of the discussion has to be directed toward the insurance \nindustry.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me respond through the Chair that the \nproblem has gotten so big that patients are being hurt and potential \npatients are being hurt. It is a crisis. It is a complex problem.\n  As a physician, and as one who sees patients, I recognize they are \nbeing hurt by this system, and we have to start somewhere. Part of it \nis being able to proceed to debate. If the timing is not right, we will \ncome back and do it at another time. We will come back to it. This \nproblem is not going to go away. I look forward to addressing it again.\n  This particular bill is not a comprehensive bill. We are not talking \nabout all of the doctors out there. Rather, we took one specialty. I am \na little perplexed how to come back to it because I want to keep the \nissue out there. Patients are being hurt, and we are going to come back \nto it. We will work together to figure out the best way to try to have \nan appropriate forum for what is a complex issue. Hopefully, we will \nbring it back in some shape or form in the next several weeks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to share a few \nobservations and thoughts about the current circumstances, the tragic \ncircumstances in our near neighboring country of Haiti.\n  Haiti was once a beautiful country. It was one of the jewels of the \nCaribbean. Its people, who secured their freedom from France in 1804, \nhave suffered a long history of despair, poverty, and misrule. This \ncountry has now fallen into chaos.\n  Regrettably, Haiti is one of the poorest nations on Earth. It is \nranked 172 out of 208 countries in per capita gross national income. It \nis the only country in the Western Hemisphere to be labeled a least-\ndeveloped nation.\n  Haitians are also among the most malnourished people in the Western \nHemisphere. The World Health Organization reports that the average \ndaily caloric intake for Haitians is the lowest in the hemisphere and \non a par with the poorest nations in Africa.\n  Violence is on the rise. At least 70 people have been killed in the \nrecent uprising, and the number of dead and wounded grows daily.\n  Indeed, the country of Haiti now faces twin crises. The first is the \npossible collapse, if not the violent overthrow, of a democratically \nelected government, with no agreed-upon follow-on governmental \nstructure. An opposition leader predicted on Sunday that the capital, \nPort-au-Prince, would fall to armed rebels in 2 weeks.\n  Second is the humanitarian catastrophe, primarily caused by the \nviolence and the disruption that the violence has created.\n  The current humanitarian crisis is forcing poor Haitians to literally \neat the seeds they have saved for spring planting. With nothing \nplanted, there will be no harvest. These desperate food shortages will \nstrike at the same time the weather improves, and a massive exodus by \nsea will be feasible and more likely.\n  The question before the United States and the world is, What should \nbe our priorities? Tragically, it appears that our administration has \ntaken a firm stance on the side of indifference. This may prove to be \nthe longest running and biggest crisis of all for Haiti. The diplomatic \neffort this past weekend, unfortunately, has accomplished nothing to \ndate.\n  Cap Hatien, the second largest city in Haiti, fell to the rebels the \nday after our Assistant Secretary of State left the country. We sent 50 \nmarines to Port-au-Prince on Monday to protect our embassy. From what I \ncan tell, there is no administration plan B.\n  Furthermore, I have detected very little concern for the potential \nimpact of this crisis on the United States itself, with my State of \nFlorida being on the front lines.\n  As we have seen repeatedly over the past two decades, one of the \nimpacts of this catastrophe will almost certainly be a dramatic \nincrease in the number of refugees risking their lives in leaky and \nunsafe boats to try to escape the violence.\n  Yet there has been little or no contact between Federal agencies and \nthe State and local authorities, our first responders, to prepare for \nthe potential influx of refugees. The principal agencies of the Federal \nGovernment have limited capacities to handle yet another immigration \ncrisis. I am told the Department of Homeland Security, which includes \nthe Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has the capability \nto handle only 150 additional\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\nrefugees once they reach our shores. This is in large part because of, \nin my judgment, the inappropriate use of what is supposed to be a \ntemporary holding facility as, in fact, the permanent prison for long-\nterm detainees. But that is another story.\n  The Defense Department is understandably hesitant to mix Haitian \nrefugees with the detainees from the war on terror at Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba.\n  The Bush administration's feeling--which appears to be shared by \nothers in the international community--is that the problem in Haiti is \na political crisis, and that until these paltry and late-starting \ndiplomatic efforts run their course, there is no basis for dealing with \nthe humanitarian crisis.\n  When asked at a briefing yesterday what the administration is \nplanning to do to halt the violence, Scott McClellan, the White House \nspokesman, responded:\n\n       We remain actively engaged in these diplomatic efforts to \n     bring about a peaceful, political solution to the situation \n     in Haiti.\n\n  That is simply and obviously not enough. Our first priority must be \nthe humanitarian crisis and finding a way to halt the violence which \nhas fueled it.\n  A political solution should, of course, be actively pursued, but not \nat the cost of abandoning efforts to address the humanitarian crisis \nand loss of lives which are occurring daily in Haiti.\n  There was already a humanitarian crisis as seen by the level of \nmalnutrition. It is now crashing to new levels with the killings and \nthe threats of violence which have forced international aid \norganizations to reduce support to the poor and impoverished of Haiti.\n\n  If we wait for a political settlement, we will be tolerating more \nscores of people being killed and more deaths due to the meager food \nsupply and lack of adequate health services. Sadly, most of those who \nare feeling this humanitarian crisis, who are dying today, are innocent \nwomen and children.\n  If we continue to wait for a political solution, the country will be \ncontrolled by armed gangs, drug dealers, and thugs. These conditions \nrepresent a clear threat to the national security of the United States \nof America and to the security of friendly allies even closer to Haiti \nthan we are.\n  It is estimated, for example, that approximately 30 percent of the \npopulation of the Bahamas represents Haitian refugees. Allowing the \ncrisis in Haiti to continue could destabilize the Bahamas and its other \nneighbors, such as the Dominican Republic.\n  What do we need to do to avoid a humanitarian tragedy? What do we \nneed to do to make that priority No. 1? First, we need to see a sense \nof urgency on the part of the United States, and that sense of urgency \nneeds to start at the White House.\n  Just a few days ago, I met with the top administration official who \neffectively said that it was the policy of the administration to stand \non the sidelines and hope that someone else--France, Canada, the \nOrganization of Caribbean Nations, CARICOM, or the Organization of \nAmerican States--would take the lead in settling the problem.\n  This is unacceptable as American foreign policy. There is no other \nalternative but the use of U.S. influence. We must become engaged at a \nserious and sustained level or, failing to do so, be prepared to pay \nthe cost of chaos 700 miles off our coast and on the seas which \nseparate us from Haiti.\n  Second, the next step should be a police presence of sufficient scale \nthat it can quell the violence. This can and should be done under the \nauspices of the Organization of American States, but the United States \nmust be a leader and full participant.\n  Third, to assure the success of that police presence, the U.S. \nmilitary should serve as a visible backup force. Recently, this visible \nbackup force worked off the coast of Liberia when we sent a marine \namphibious group aboard Navy ships to stand by off the coast while we \nput ashore a marine security team to protect our embassy. If we can \nprovide the powerful influence of U.S. military troops 3,000 miles \naway, certainly we can do so in our own neighborhood.\n  Next, we must enhance our humanitarian presence starting with \nemergency deliveries of additional foodstuffs and medical supplies, and \nwe must assure that delivery of those supplies is available throughout \nthe countryside.\n  Next, given the indifference of the State Department and the National \nSecurity Council, the President should seriously consider the \nappointment of a high-level delegation to Haiti, such as that \nrepresented by President Carter, Senator Nunn, and General Powell in \n1994, to make certain that our expectations, as well as our level of \ncommitment, is clear.\n  Next, we must enhance our capacity to understand what is happening \ninside Haiti. In a manner which is eerily similar to the situation in \nthe late 1980s and the early 1990s, our capacity to gather information \ninside Haiti is woefully inadequate to the scale and the significance \nof the crisis.\n  Among other problems, all diplomatic personnel are confined to the \ncapital Port-au-Prince. As one senior administration official described \nit:\n\n       Our intelligence is very thin.\n  This limited understanding, without question, has contributed to our \nallowing the situation to reach near anarchy without the United States \nassertively engaging itself. These circumstances in Haiti are part of a \ndisturbing pattern of our current international relations. One, by its \nunwillingness to engage in a leadership role in the world, with the \ndramatic exception of Iraq, this administration is ceding its \nsovereignty to other nations. We have ceded to China the leadership for \nnegotiations with North Korea over its nuclear capability. We have \nceded to the French, the Canadians, the OAS, and the Caribbean \nleadership our sovereignty in dealing with the crisis in Haiti.\n  That loss of sovereignty comes at a heavy price in our ability to \ninfluence other nations and international organizations from a position \nof strength. How can we challenge China on its trade practices when we \nare relying on China to handle the most sensitive negotiations with \nNorth Korea?\n  Just a year ago, our fragile relations with France were center stage. \nHow can we now rely on France and regional organizations alone to \ndefend our national interests in the Caribbean? The current \nadministration appears indifferent, at best, to our neighbors in the \nhemisphere, specifically those in the Caribbean and Latin America. This \nis surprising and distressing because candidate George W. Bush stated \nthat as President George W. Bush he would pursue a policy of much \ngreater U.S. involvement in Latin America.\n  On August 25, 2000, speaking at Florida International University in \nMiami, FL, candidate George W. Bush declared:\n\n       This can be the century of the Americas. . . . Should I \n     become president, I will look South not as an afterthought, \n     but as a fundamental commitment to my presidency. . . . Those \n     who ignore Latin America do not fully understand America \n     itself.\n\n  After crises in Argentina, in Bolivia, in Venezuela, and now this \ntest in Haiti, the Bush administration has yet another credibility \ncrisis and yet another failure of intelligence. While not on the scale \nof missed opportunities to disrupt the plots of September 11 or the \nmisinformation which led us to war in Iraq, again we have a failure of \nintelligence to inform national leadership as to the true state of an \ninternational situation or of national leadership to effectively \nutilize the intelligence which was provided.\n  Had we secured and utilized accurate and timely information on Haiti, \npossibly our response would not have been as impotent and retarded as \nit now is.\n  Finally, this is the latest example of the need for a United States \nor international capacity to respond effectively in nation sustaining, \neven nation building, after our military has successfully secured the \nterritory.\n  In 1994, the United States effectively invaded Haiti in order to \nremove a military dictatorship and replace its democratically elected \npresident. We did that with the kind of surgical precision that has \ncome to characterize our military efforts. We then proceeded to spend \nalmost $3 billion attempting to sustain and build the nation of Haiti. \nI suggest that today, 10 years later, Haiti is in worse condition than \nit was when we invaded in 1994. The very things that make our military \nso effective; recruitment, training, support, the exercises of actions, \nhave allowed us to have such a string of successes in the military \nphase of dealing\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\nwith a hostile or chaotic foreign situation. Unfortunately, none of \nthose characteristics is true of the efforts that are made after the \nwar concludes. We need to take the leadership, either unilaterally or, \nI believe, preferably with other international allies, to develop a \ncapability which has the same characteristics of recruitment, training, \nsupport. Having exercised, before actual use, the security, the \ndevelopment of democratic institutions, the restoration of a \ngovernmental structure, the development of infrastructure necessary to \nsupport the population and a market economy, which can be available \nafter the bullets stop flying, assures our future investments in nation \nsustaining and nation building are not as ineffective as they have been \nin the last decade.\n  The failure to have such a capacity after the 1994 invasion is a \nprimary reason why today we stand on the edge of the volcano of chaos \nin Haiti yet again, 10 short years later. Let us today, by our inaction \nand indifference, not provide as a heritage to future generations in \nAmerica and to future generations in countries like Haiti, Iraq, and \nSomalia the heritage of a failed effort because we were not able to \ncomplete the mission that began so brilliantly with military actions to \nthe conclusion of a stable, democratic, functioning country that gave \nto their people some reasonable prospect of prosperity and personal \npeace.\n  I ask that immediately after my remarks editorials from the Miami \nHerald, the St. Petersburg Times, the Palm Beach Post, the Washington \nPost, and the New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Feb. 19, 2004]\n\n     Set the Right Priorities in Haiti; Our Opinion: It's Time for \n                 Washington to Take a More Active Role\n\n       Now that Haiti is in flames again, an epidemic of hand-\n     wringing is spreading from Washington to the United Nations \n     to the Elysee Palace in Paris.\n       Where was everybody when the first puffs of smoke appeared \n     years ago? When President Jean-Bertrand Aristide started \n     relying on thugs to maintain order? When brave journalists \n     were murdered for writing and broadcasting the truth? When \n     peaceful protests were repressed by violent means? Today, in \n     the belated haste to do something--anything--there is a \n     danger of failing to adopt the right set of priorities.\n\n\n                           Prevent a disaster\n\n       The first goal should be to prevent a full-scale \n     humanitarian crisis, and it is already late in the day. It \n     shouldn't take an armed invasion of Haiti to put an end to \n     the hooliganism that has made food, gasoline and medicine \n     scarce. But if strong diplomatic pressure on all sides can't \n     do the job, a small military force may have to be deployed \n     before conditions worsen.\n       Restoring civil order on the streets is the next priority. \n     Here the challenge is both military and, ultimately, \n     political. Before any outside attempt to launch a police \n     action is made, the nonviolent opposition should be given a \n     chance to show that it is capable of doing something besides \n     voicing demands that Mr. Aristide must go. An effort by Mr. \n     Aristide's critics to curtail the growing insurrection would \n     demonstrate that the opposition is a legitimate political \n     force with clout. The opposition should be mature enough to \n     try to reach at least a temporary accommodation with Mr. \n     Aristide that could lay the groundwork for a political \n     settlement.\n       Although the president has failed to live up to previous \n     promises to govern in a more democratic manner, the crisis \n     demands a suspension of political demands from his opponents \n     because violence threatens the survival of all political \n     factions in the country.\n       Mr. Aristide carries the main burden of political \n     responsibility. A band of thugs must not be allowed to depose \n     an elected president, but Mr. Aristide has to do more than \n     simply insist on remaining in power. Reaching out to the \n     opposition to form a bulwark against the forces of violence \n     is the best way to show that he has Haiti's best interests at \n     heart.\n\n\n                          democracy takes time\n\n       The fundamental problem is that Haiti is a failed state, \n     and will remain one until democracy takes root--the ultimate \n     goal. CARICOM and the OAS can help Haiti get there, but only \n     the United States has the authority, or the muscle, to lead \n     this effort. It is time for the Bush administration to take a \n     more active role in stabilizing the situation. As Sen. Bob \n     Graham has pointed out, if we can send a military force to \n     Liberia to protect our interests, we can do the same in \n     Haiti, the sooner the better.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the St. Petersburg Times, Feb. 21, 2004]\n\n                            Crisis in Haiti\n\n       With violence and chaos spreading in Haiti, the world \n     community cannot afford to just stand by and do nothing. With \n     the police hiding in their barracks, armed thugs patrolling \n     the street and the elected president appealing for \n     international protection, Haiti is on the verge of another \n     major humanitarian and political crisis. It's understandable \n     that the Bush administration has ``no enthusiasm,'' as \n     Secretary of State Colin Powell put it, to intervene \n     militarily. However, there is an urgent need for an \n     international peacekeeping effort. If ever there was a \n     situation calling out for United Nations peacekeepers, Haiti \n     is it.\n       The two-week-old uprising has killed at least 60 people. \n     The U.S. government Thursday urged Americans to leave, and \n     the Peace Corps began withdrawing its staff. Washington also \n     dispatched a military team to assess security at the U.S. \n     Embassy. As the nation that stood behind the president, Jean-\n     Bertrand Aristide, the United States has a special obligation \n     to help. Since American military forces restored Aristide to \n     power in 1994, after his ouster in a coup, Aristide has \n     cruelly turned his back on his people and promises. He has \n     not alleviated the human misery in Haiti or reached out to \n     his political opponents. Armed vigilantes roaming the streets \n     terrorize in his name. Aristide has become a polarizing force \n     and a discredited figure internationally. The rebels, \n     however, are not any better. Many leaders are one-time death \n     squad commanders, who have no political legitimacy or idea \n     how to govern.\n       The United Nations, working with Caribbean leaders and \n     France and Canada, should dispatch a peacekeeping force as \n     soon as possible to try to end the bloodshed. Beyond the need \n     to protect innocent lives and extend a humanitarian hand, the \n     United Nations should underscore that change in Haiti must \n     come through the democratic process. Aristide should be held \n     to the commitments he made to his people. He needs to disarm \n     and disband the vigilante groups, disassociate himself from \n     their operations and bring political opponents into the \n     governing process. The world community has an interest in \n     protecting Aristide, but it stems from his standing as a \n     democratically elected president and because the alternative \n     is even worse. Far from endorsing his presidency, \n     international intervention would be a slap at the character \n     of a man who sold himself to the world as a champion of \n     democratic principles and then betrayed those very \n     principles.\n       Washington has a major role to play in defusing this \n     crisis--and a big stake in the outcome. This country, after \n     all, restored Aristide to power, and it will become the \n     destination of any mass exodus of Haitian refugees. On \n     Friday, diplomats from the United States, Europe and the \n     Caribbean were preparing to present Aristide and opposition \n     groups a plan for political reform and a return to the rule \n     of law. It's largely the same plan that was presented to the \n     warring parties weeks ago. Secretary of State Powell said the \n     plan does not call for Aristide's resignation but added that \n     the United States would not object if he decided to step down \n     before his term ends as part of a negotiated political \n     solution.\n       Even if the violence can be quelled in the coming days, a \n     humanitarian crisis is already upon one of the poorest \n     countries in the world. The world community should quickly \n     unite behind an effort that offers humanitarian aid and \n     protects both human rights and Haiti's sovereignty.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Palm Beach Post, Feb. 21, 2004]\n\n                       On Haiti, U.S. Can't Wait\n\n       As President Bush tries to install democracy thousands of \n     miles away in Iraq, he no longer can remain disengaged from \n     the moral and practical need for democracy hundreds of miles \n     away in Haiti.\n       Late this week, the State Department acknowledged that \n     Americans in Haiti should leave the ``steady deterioration of \n     the security situation'' between an increasingly defiant \n     President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the loosely organized \n     movement to oust him. But as the administration finally has \n     become more active in trying to broker a political \n     settlement, it has become increasingly unrealistic to think \n     that a settlement will not require military action. Ideally, \n     that would take place in concert with regional allies, \n     stabilizing Haiti and bolstering the country for the long \n     haul beyond the end of Mr. Aristide's term in 2006.\n       Each hour's delay only makes the problem more difficult, as \n     the loyal opposition that Mr. Aristide calls a band of \n     terrorists is being subordinated by gangsters returning from \n     exile. Haiti's outnumbered and outgunned police force of \n     fewer than 4,000 is retreating from its posts. If certain \n     rebels take control, they will not easily give it up.\n       Gov. Bush was brief by the Coast Guard again this week. \n     ``But we have the power to some degree to stop this from \n     hitting our shores,'' said U.S. Rep. Mark Foley, R-West Plam \n     Beach. ``We can't take the standoff position.'' Colombia, he \n     said, is a case where the U.S. has ``used the military to try \n     to rebuild the economy and stem the drug flow. Liberia also \n     is an example that's on point. (Former President) Charles \n     Taylor wasn't going anywhere until the U.S. said we're \n     backing the nations that are liberating Liberia.''\n       In Haiti, Rep. Foley said, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic \n     and the Bahamas ``need to be leading the dialogue rather than \n     have the perception of imperial saber-rattling. We\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\n     have to have the sense that we're all in this together, With \n     America saying, `We're behind you.' '' But it is important, \n     as he said, ``to make sure the Haitian people understand, as \n     well as Aristide, that we are not there to prop him up.''\n       That's the message the international delegation led by \n     Assistant Secretary of State Roger Noriega should carry to \n     Haiti today. There's a lot at stake for Florida and the \n     United States, which doesn't need a failed state close to \n     home. It is too late just to assume that things will get \n     better.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 9, 2004]\n\n                           No Help for Haiti\n\n       Once again a poor nation with strong ties to the United \n     States is in desperate trouble--and once again, the response \n     of the Bush administration is to backpedal away, forswear all \n     responsibility and leave any rescue to others. Last summer \n     President Bush refused to commit even a few hundred U.S. \n     troops on the ground to help end a bloody crisis in Liberia. \n     Now he and his administration stand by as Haiti, a country of \n     7.5 million just 600 miles from Florida, plunges into \n     anarchy.\n       Armed gangs are spreading through cities across the country \n     in a violent rebellion against President Jean-Bertrand \n     Aristide, whose own police force is so weak that a group of \n     about 40 thugs was able to take over a town of 87,000 people \n     on Tuesday. France and the United Nations have begun \n     exploring the possible deployment of police or peacekeepers--\n     which is probably the only way to stop the killing. But \n     Secretary of State Colin L. Powell made clear that ``there is \n     frankly no enthusiasm'' within the Bush administration ``for \n     sending in military or police forces to put down the \n     violence.'' Mr. Powell rejected ``a proposition that says the \n     elected president must be forced out of office by thugs.'' \n     But that, apparently, doesn't mean the United States--which \n     has intervened repeatedly in Haitian affairs during its 200-\n     year history--is prepared to take any action to stop it.\n       Nor has the administration been willing to take the lead in \n     seeking a political settlement to the crisis. For several \n     years it has delegated the arbitration of Haiti's mounting \n     domestic conflict to well-meaning but powerless diplomats \n     from the Organization of American States or the Caribbean \n     Community, also known as Caricom. In particular, it has \n     declined to exercise its considerable leverage on the \n     civilian opposition parties, some of which have been \n     supported by such U.S. groups as the International Republican \n     Institute and which have rejected any political solution \n     short of Mr. Aristide's immediate resignation. Apart from Mr. \n     Powell's statement, the administration's rhetoric has mostly \n     been directed at Mr. Aristide. ``There certainly needs to be \n     some changes in the way Haiti is governed,'' said White House \n     spokesman Scott McClellan.\n       Mr. Aristide is guilty of supporting violence against the \n     opposition and has cruelly disappointed those who expected \n     him to consolidate democracy. But Haiti's mess flows in part \n     from U.S. actions. After restoring Mr. Aristide to power in \n     1994 and abolishing the army that previously ruled the \n     country by dictatorship, the United States failed to follow \n     through. U.S. forces were pulled out after only two years--\n     they are still in Bosnia and Kosovo eight and five years, \n     respectively, after they arrived--and all aid to the \n     government was suspended after Mr. Aristide's party tampered \n     with the results of a congressional election. Some of the \n     military's former death-squad leaders command the gangs that \n     would seize power. But the Bush administration would rather \n     leave the answers to Caricom or the United Nations or France. \n     It's an inexcusable abdication.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 24, 2004]\n\n                      Hour of the Gunmen in Haiti\n\n       Rebels in Haiti were going house to house yesterday, \n     arresting supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and \n     looting their possessions. The capital, Port-au-Prince, \n     remained in government hands, but the nation's second-largest \n     city, Cap Haitien, was held by the insurgents. The situation \n     is clearly becoming dire. The United States needs to take the \n     lead in protecting the Haitian people from the growing \n     anarchy around them. There is much that Washington could do.\n       Only the slimmest hope remains for salvaging an \n     international mediation effort that began last weekend. If it \n     cannot be revived, there is a strong likelihood that the \n     country's raging political crisis could ultimately be \n     resolved by brute force. Abrupt and violent changes of \n     government have been a regular feature of Haitian politics \n     over the years and are among the main reasons that Haiti has \n     never developed stable democratic institutions.\n       Mr. Aristide is no beacon of democratic principles, but he \n     was freely elected to a five-year term that is not scheduled \n     to run out until February 2006. It would have been better if \n     all sides had accepted the proposed compromise that would \n     allow him to stay in office while sharing power with the \n     opposition.\n       Most, but not all, of the responsibility for the failure to \n     reach an agreement lies with the leaders of Haiti's \n     nonviolent political opposition. They argued that with \n     popular anger against Mr. Aristide running so high, they \n     could accept no compromise that did not cut short his \n     presidency.\n       That public anger is largely Mr. Aristide's fault, because \n     of a succession of betrayals of his original democratic \n     promises. By failing to end a long impasse over flawed \n     parliamentary elections, he has effectively shut down \n     Parliament and now rules by decree. He has politicized the \n     police and courts and uses special police brigades and armed \n     gangs of his supporters to terrorize civilians and break up \n     opposition demonstrations.\n       Yet the opposition's unwillingness to stand up to the \n     former army leaders and opposition thugs now demanding Mr. \n     Aristide departure--and their failure to back a compromise \n     that would have been strongly supported by Washington and \n     other mediating countries--is a troubling sign. It suggests \n     that these politicians may not have the toughness needed to \n     make sure that any armed ouster of Mr. Aristide does not lead \n     to a rapid restoration of the same discredited forces that \n     ruled Haiti before he came to power. These include thuggish \n     leaders of the country's officially disbanded army and the \n     murderous paramilitary groups that supported military rule. \n     Some of these elements have already re-entered Haiti from the \n     neighboring Dominican Republic.\n       There is still time for the political opposition to \n     reconsider its rejection of compromise before the armed \n     rebels impose their own new tyranny.\n       Whether or not the opposition comes to its senses, Haiti's \n     people deserve protection. More than 70 lives have already \n     been lost. The United States should quickly offer to build up \n     the current force of 50 marines who arrived Monday to protect \n     the American Embassy and make it the core of a multinational \n     stabilization force that would also include soldiers from \n     France, Canada and Latin America. Haiti's army was dissolved \n     in 1994, and a modest international military force could go a \n     long way. It should be in place before armed rebel elements \n     grab power for themselves.\n       Once a stabilization force is established, an American-led \n     international effort should be mounted to train professional, \n     politically independent police officers and judges. It was \n     the absence of such institutions that allowed Mr. Aristide to \n     create a new authoritarianism behind a democratic shell. \n     American police training programs during the Clinton \n     administration did not reach far enough or last long enough \n     to succeed. Washington should also make it easier for Haiti \n     to earn its way out of poverty by eliminating the American \n     rice subsidies that have contributed to pricing poor Haitian \n     rice farmers out of the market.\n       Developing a durable democracy in this deeply impoverished \n     country, which has no history of strong, independent civic \n     institutions, will take plenty of time and effort. Failure to \n     begin that effort now will surely result in future revolts, \n     future dictators and future tides of desperate refugees \n     headed for American shores.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern \nabout the violent political crisis engulfing Haiti. We dare not remain \nsilent when faced with such a widespread insurrection in our backyard. \nI believe that we, members of Congress and the Bush administration, \nmust make an honest reckoning regarding our history of often \ninconsistence and sometimes even negligent U.S. policies toward this \nneighboring country, the poorest in the western hemisphere. If the \ncurrent vicious cycle of resistance and violent reaction to the \nresistance continues, the resulting instability will have a substantial \nimpact on democracy and security in the Caribbean and will affect our \nentire hemisphere.\n  Just last month, Haiti celebrated the 200th anniversary of its \nindependence; it was only the second country in the western hemisphere \nafter the United State to throw off the yoke of foreign domination and \nto declare independence from a European colonizer. Unfortunately, \nHaiti's long experience with democracy and self-rule has been impeded \nby successive waves of military coups--over 30 since its independence--\nand power consolidation by elites. Poverty and disease are pervasive \nand government corruption rampant. In its October 2003 survey, \nTransparency International labeled Haiti the third most corrupt country \nout of 133 countries in the world and the most corrupt of the 30 \ncountries in the Americas and the Caribbean.\n  Prior to Jean-Bertrand Aristide's election to his first term in 1990, \nHaiti had been ruled by successive military dictators, many of whom \nwere anointed by foreign leaders. In 1990, the U.S. government and we, \nthe members of the U.S. Congress, felt optimistic about democratic \nprospects under Aristide's leadership. The subsequent U.S.-backed \nrestoration of Aristide to power derived from an American hope, perhaps \neven a naive idealism, that he could rebuild viable democratic \ninstitutions and further democratic progress as a legitimate head of \nstate. This American idealism, I believe, led the Clinton \nadministration to deploy 20,000 American troops to support Aristide. \nSince this time, however, Aristide and his political party have made \npoor economic\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nchoices; they have consolidated power, eviscerated the role of the \nparliament, and allowed corruption and cronyism to corrode the \ngovernment.\n  Indeed, over the past few years, as our foreign policy attention has \nshifted eastward, towards hotpots in the Middle East and Southeast \nAsia, we have been dangerously negligent of Haiti's continuing \npolitical dissolution and Aristide's failed leadership.\n  I believe that the current violent expression of political \nopposition, which has taken the lives of over 40 Haitians in the past \ntwo weeks, derives directly from the Haitians' frustration with their \ngovernment. Haitian political rights have been chipped away since \nAristide's 2000 re-election, based on only five percent voter turnout, \ncreated a political stalemate. The Haitian parliament has since stopped \nfunctioning, prompting international aid donors to block millions of \ndollars in needed economic aid.\n  The resulting economic situation is bleak. Most of Haiti's 8 million \npeople live on less than $1 per day and it ranks 150th out of 175 \ncountries on the United Nations Human Development Index.\n  But Aristide's government has exacerbated Haiti's economic crisis. \nThe U.S. State Department classified the country's current situation as \n``economic stagnation'' caused by ineffective economic policies, \npolitical instability, environmental deterioration, the lack of a \nfunctioning judiciary, and the migration of skilled workers.\n  On the other hand, we know that this month's violent outburst is not \nthe only means for Haitians to express political opposition. For years, \nlegitimate opposition groups have opposed Aristide's government and \nmost of them do not condone today's violence. Instead they endorse new \nelections and a peaceful transition of power.\n  We have a unique obligation to stand up for the people of Haiti. Our \ntwo countries are inextricably linked--by the virtue of our similar \nhistories, because of our involvement in Aristide's return to power, \nand as a result of the influx of Haitians who have come to our shores \nseeking refuge from the economically and politically ravaged country. \nThese Haitian Americans have contributed greatly to American life and I \nam proud to have a talented young man of Haitian origins on my staff \nand to represent nearly 60,000 Haitian Americans in my State.\n  The Bush administration has advocated for a negotiated political \nsolution to the crisis. Yesterday, Southern Command has dispatched a \nsmall military team to Haiti to provide the ambassador and the embassy \nstaff with an enhanced capability to monitor the current situation. \nSecretary of State Colin Powell recently met with regional officials \nand the Canadian and Haitian ambassadors to discuss a possible \nCaribbean-Canadian police force for Haiti. I support the State \nDepartment in its efforts to forge a negotiated political solution \nbrought about by dialogue, negotiation, and compromise and fully \nsupport the power sharing agreement put forth by Secretary Powell and \ninternational community. I urge the opposition groups to accept this \nproposal to share power with Aristide until he can be replaced \ndemocratically.\n  I also ask my colleagues to follow this crisis closely and to join me \nin demanding that President Bush, Secretary Powell and other foreign \npolicy advisors continue to play a leading role, facilitating \nnegotiations between the Haitian government and the opposition \nfactions.\n  If the opposition accepts the power-sharing agreement, Secretary \nPowell should enlist French, United Nations, and Caricom help to see \nthat forceful diplomatic intervention ends the current stand-off. The \nnext step is for the U.S., in concert with international organizations, \nto assist Haiti in creating a unity government, a council of advisors \nand the installation of a new prime minister. American diplomacy and \ninfluence can be effectively mustered to convince both Aristide and the \nopposition to accept these reformist measures.\n  U.S. hegemony, wealth, and power have, over the course of our \ncountry's history, generated myriad international obligations to \nresolve global conflicts and preserve peace and security. Our \nresponsibilities emerge no clearer than when conflicts arise in our own \nneighborhood. It is time to break with a recent policy of U.S. \ndismissal and neglect regarding Haiti's self-destructive government and \ndevastating economic situation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in insisting that the \nadministration, with Congressional support, rise to fulfill the \nresponsibilities of global leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/24/senate-section/article/S1514-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1514-S1515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                          spc billy jess watts\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President. I express our Nation's deepest thanks and \ngratitude to a young man and his family from Meeteetse, WY. On February \n5, 2004, SPC Billy Jess Watts was killed in the line of duty while \npreparing to deploy to Iraq to serve his country in the war on \nterrorism. While traveling in a military convoy to a final training \nexercise before leaving for duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom, SPC Watts \ndied when the vehicle he was riding in hit ice and rolled over.\n  SPC Watts was a member of the Wyoming Army National Guard's 2-300 \nField Artillery Battalion. He enjoyed the outdoors, hunting and \ncamping, and loved watching NASCAR racing and pitching horseshoes. He \nloved his family and his country. SPC Watts' profound sense of duty led \nhim to join the U.S. Army following his high school graduation, and the \nNational Guard upon his return to Wyoming. He was an American soldier.\n  It is because of people like Billy Watts that we continue to live \nsafe and secure. America's men and women who answer the call of service \nand wear our Nation's uniform deserve respect and recognition for the \nenormous burden that they willingly bear. Our people put everything on \nthe line everyday, and because of these folks, our Nation remains free \nand strong in the face of danger.\n  SPC Watts is survived by his wife Connie and his son Austin John, as \nwell as parents, Bill and Bertha, sisters Bonnie, Betty and Barbara, \nand his brothers in arms of the 2-300 Field Artillery Battalion. We say \ngoodbye to a husband, a father, a son, a brother, a soldier, and an \nAmerican. Our Nation pays its deepest respect to SPC Billy Jess Watts \nfor his courage, his love of country and his sacrifice, so that we may \nremain free. He was a hero in life and he remains a hero in death. All \nof Wyoming, and indeed the entire Nation are proud of him.\n\n\n                           2lt luke s. james\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, you don't have to do much more than open \nthe morning newspaper or turn on the evening news to understand that \nthe enemies of freedom are working hard in Iraq.\n  They lay ambushes for our troops, set off bombs by remote control, \nand drive explosive-laden autos into crowds of innocent Iraqis who want \nnothing more than a brighter future for their country and their \nchildren.\n  Terrorists connected with al-Qaida, foreign interests and Baathist \nloyalists conspire to destroy the dream of a free Iraq before it is \nfully born. They will fail.\n  But Saddam Hussein, a one-man weapon of mass destruction who preyed \non his countrymen and threatened his neighbors, is in custody. His \nmurderous sons are dead. His lieutenants and henchmen are captured, \nkilled, or moving nearer those fates with each passing hour.\n  The same fates await those who would steal the dream of liberty and \nreplace it with a nightmare of repression, corruption and domination. \nAmerica's front line in her war against terrorism is now in the fields \nof Afghanistan and the streets of Iraq instead of in the skies over New \nYork and Washington, DC.\n  Like Americans everywhere, I was thrilled to see the statues of \nSaddam Hussein knocked from their pedestals. Those images reminded me \nthat the Iraqi people needed our help, our tanks, our troops, and our \ncommitment to topple a brutal dictator. I am proud of our military and \nAmerica's commitment to make the people of the Middle East more free \nand secure.\n  Without a doubt, our military men and women will face more difficult \ndays in Iraq, and the Iraqi people will be tested by the \nresponsibilities that come with freedom. Everyone expects more \nviolence. Freedom is messy--nowhere more so than in a country that has \njust shaken off a brutal dictatorship.\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\n  Today I rise to honor who made the ultimate sacrifice one can make \nfor his country.\n  A few days ago I stood in Arlington National Cemetery to honor the \nmemory of 2LT Luke S. James.\n  Lieutenant James, 24, was a native of Hooker, OK, and a graduate of \nOklahoma State University. He was killed in Iraq on January 27 during a \nroadside ambush near Iskandariyah.\n  Lieutenant James was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 505th Infantry \nout of Fort Bragg, NC. He'd only been in Iraq a few days.\n  Our prayers and debt of appreciation now go to his family. He is \nsurvived here on the homefront by his wife Molly, his 6-month-old son, \nBradley, his parents Brad and Arleen James, his sister Sharla, and his \nbrother Kirby.\n  ``That was his dream (to serve in the Army),'' Molly James said in a \nrecent interview. ``He wasn't afraid to go. He was able to do his duty \nand die with honor.''\n  As we watch the dawn of a new day in Iraq, we must never forget that \nthe freedom we enjoy every day in America is bought at a price.\n  2LT Luke James did not die in vain. He died so that many others could \nlive freely. And for that sacrifice, we are forever indebted. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with him and his family and with the troops \nwho are putting their lives on the line in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/24/senate-section/article/S1515-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONTROL AND DISPOSAL OF RADIOACTIVE SOURCES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern that the \nthreat posed by the detonation of a ``dirty bomb'' has not been \nadequately addressed. Controlling access to the radioactive materials \nneeded to fabricate such a weapon remains a challenge today, just as it \ndid in the days immediately following the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. Security improvements have been slow to come. Dirty \nbombs continue to threaten the people and the economy of the United \nStates.\n  Radioactive sealed sources are all around us. They are used widely in \nmedicine, research, industry, and agriculture. Some of these sources \nare more risky than others, and Congress must take action to ensure the \ncontrol and safe disposal of those sources that pose the greatest risk. \nThese sources, known as ``greater-than-Class-C'' sealed sources, are of \nmajor concern because of their potential for use in the fabrication of \na dirty bomb.\n  To address this risk, I introduced S. 1045, the Low-Level Radioactive \nWaste Act of 2003, this past May. My bill addresses the efforts made by \nthe Department of Energy, DOE, to recover and dispose of thousands of \ndomestic greater-than-Class-C radiological sources. This measure was \ndeveloped after three different U.S. General Accounting Office reports \nI requested showed that the efforts being made by DOE and other Federal \nagencies to control and dispose of these radioactive sources, both \ndomestically and internationally, have not gone far enough.\n  Provisions of S. 1045 were included in H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act \nof 2003, but as debate over the energy bill continues, radioactive \nsources remain a threat to our country. Over the holidays, there was a \nserious concern about the possible detonation of a dirty bomb at one of \nthe large open-air New Year's Eve celebrations around the country. The \nDOE took serious and prudent action to detect possible terrorist \nactivities and thankfully this situation did not end in tragedy. \nHowever, next time we may not be so lucky. The lack of a safe, secure, \nand permanent disposal site for unwanted radioactive sealed sources \nplaces our country at risk.\n  Thousands of sealed sources await disposal, some requiring security \nmeasures greater than those in place at current storage facilities. The \nproblem posed by these sources will not go away by itself. Universities \nand industry do not have the means or facilities to secure these \nmaterials and are seeking Federal Government assistance. In my own \nState, the University of Hawaii is currently seeking the assistance of \nthe DOE to remove large unwanted radioactive sources, belonging to DOE, \nthat are no longer useful for their research. While DOE is working on a \nsolution, the sources remain in Hawaii awaiting disposal. My bill would \nrequire the DOE to fulfill their statutory obligation to develop a \ndisposal facility for all of these sources, in consultation with \nCongress, and would also require that DOE explore Federal and non-\nFederal alternative disposal options to make sure that the best \ndisposal method is chosen.\n  However, my concern over radioactive material does not end here. I \nwill continue my work to improve Federal oversight of radioactive \nsources and devices. Just a few weeks ago in New Jersey, a gauge \ncontaining radioactive material was damaged, and its radioactive \nmaterial is still missing. Creating a disposal facility for this class \nof radioactive waste is only the beginning of getting this problem \nunder control. We need to improve the licensing and tracking of these \nwidely used sources and devices, so that they will not fall into the \nwrong hands.\n  When the United States began non-proliferation efforts in the former \nSoviet Union, one of the first jobs was to begin consolidating nuclear \nweapons and fissile materials in secure facilities to await disposal or \ndestruction. Due to worries about terrorists acquiring dirty bombs, the \nDOE is now working to secure radiological sources in many countries \noversees. I support these efforts. A theft this month of cesium-137 in \nChina re-emphasizes the need to work with other countries to collect \nand dispose of unwanted radiological materials. The cesium, stolen by \nscrap metal thieves, ended up being melted by a steel mill. The mill is \nnow contaminated and will have to undergo expensive clean-up efforts. \nWhile this type of incident is less likely to happen in the U.S., we \nmust learn from this, and take steps to protect our nation from these \nmaterials. We should take the lead in helping other nations secure \ntheir radioactive material, for the good of us all.\n  The bill that I introduced and which is cosponsored by Senators \nBingaman and Landrieu, will give radiological sources and waste on \nAmerican soil a safe and secure, permanent disposal facility. Before \nSeptember 11, 2001, collecting and securing these sources was a matter \nof public safety, now it is a national security concern that demands \nthe attention of Congress. I urge my colleagues to support the Low-\nLevel Radioactive Waste Act of 2003, to ensure that our nation is \nbetter protected from the dangers of dirty bombs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/24/senate-section/article/S1515-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1515-S1517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LESSONS FROM A CLEAN AIR LISTENING TOUR\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have spoken many times about my \nserious concern for our Nation's deteriorating air quality. I would \nlike to speak today on behalf of those Americans who are working \ntirelessly at the regional and local levels to protect our air quality, \nand who have expressed their concerns to me. Many Americans across the \ncountry feel that the Clean Air Act has not done enough to protect \ntheir health and their environment. They also worry that, under the \nleadership of our President, things will only get worse. They are \ntaking action at the local and State levels, and State government is \nresponding with real leadership. We need to support these actions with \nstrong, Federal legislation to protect our current laws and improve our \nair quality.\n  On a nationwide Clean Air Listening Tour I initiated in 2003, I heard \nfirst-hand from Americans who are tired of getting sick from breathing \ndirty air, and tired of putting their children's health at risk from \neating mercury-contaminated fish. In Asheville, NC, and in Boston, MA, \nthe public demands that the Federal Government work immediately to \nclean their air.\n  Asheville is situated in close proximity to the Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park, the most visited National Park in the Nation at nine \nmillion visitors every year. Sadly, this majestic park is also the \nNation's most polluted, as reported by the National Parks Conservation \nAssociation. Its visibility is tied for the worst with Mammoth Cave \nNational Park, at a mere 14-mile range during the summer months. Under \nnatural conditions, the vista should average around 80-miles.\n  The Smokies have the highest rate of acid precipitation among the \nparks, at thirty-five kilograms per hectare. This is six to seven times \nthe nitrogen pollution that local soils can process. In fact, the \nhighest peak in the Smokies can be as acidic as vinegar.\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\n  The total number of hourly ozone exceedences in the Smoky Mountains \nfar outnumbers other parks at over one hundred and thirty-three \nthousand per year. Ozone exposure in the Smokies is twice that of the \nregion's most ozone-ridden cities--Knoxville, TN, and Atlanta, GA.\n  These statistics mean that in the Smoky Mountains, dozens of tree and \nplant species are damaged, streams are dying, aquatic wildlife \npopulations are declining, and area residents face increased mortality \nand chronic lung ailments. Plus, the fish that people consume are \npoisoned with toxic mercury, which can cause a number of birth defects \nand health problems in adults.\n  What is causing all this dreaded pollution? While cars and industry \ncontribute substantially to the problem, old, dirty power plants are my \ngreatest concern. About 30,000 premature deaths occur every year due to \npower plant pollution alone. Incredibly, North Carolina loses 1,800 \npeople each year because of this pollution. And, hundreds of thousands \nof children are born annually at risk of birth defects and neurological \ndamage from their mothers' exposure to mercury.\n  These are shocking figures, and we should be responding immediately \nto this crisis. Power plants are still the Nation's single largest \nsource of air pollution in this country. They are responsible for most \nof our Nation's smog and haze pollution, and asthma- and lung disease-\ncausing particulate matter, by emitting 60 percent or more of national \nsulfur dioxide emissions, and 25 percent of nitrogen oxides. In fact, \nthe country's oldest and dirtiest plants are responsible for 75 to 85 \npercent of the haze in the southwestern Appalachians. Power plants also \nemit more than one-third of the Nation's poisonous mercury into the \nair.\n  We should also know that power plants emit 25 percent of our \ncountry's emissions of carbon dioxid--the greatest greenhouse gas. Our \nNation's utilities alone send forth 10 percent of the world's carbon \ndioxide emissions. They are, in part, responsible for the global \nwarming that is occurring today and will continue into the future. \nGlobal warming will seriously affect the 130 species of trees and the \n4,000 other plant species in the Smokies, as well as worsen the already \ndangerously unhealthy ozone pollution problem. Many local residents are \nnot only highly concerned, but they are frustrated with our Federal \nGovernment's absent leadership.\n  State officials and others in Asheville and the Smoky Mountain region \nare tired of waiting on the Federal Government to protect their air and \ntheir climate. They are already acting to reduce this power plant \npollution. The North Carolina legislature has made great strides with \nthe passage of the Clean Smokestacks Act. Other States are quickly \nfollowing suit. However, States are keenly aware that since much of the \npollution they experience blows in from elsewhere, a national solution \nis crucial. In my listening session at the Grove Park Inn on May 19, \n2003, I heard witnesses testify in compelling language how air \npollution affects Smoky Mountain communities, and how citizens are \nbanding together to protect public health.\n  North Carolina State Senator Steven Metcalf, Buncombe County \nCommissioner and Chair of the Land of Sky Regional Council David Gantt, \nas well as John Stanton, Vice President of the National Environmental \nTrust, joined me in a press conference to launch the listening session. \nHugh Morton, Owner of Grandfather Mountain, which is a scenic travel \nattraction near Linville, NC, began the public forum with a slide show \nillustrating the devastation that air pollution has on his business. \nSlide after slide showed trees made bare by acid rain, and vistas \nclogged with haze. There is no doubt in his mind that such pollution \nthreatens the environmental health and economic productivity of the \nmountain.\n  Don Barger, Senior Director of the Southeast Regional Office of the \nNational Parks Conservation Association, Brownie Newman, Executive \nCoordinator of the Western North Carolina Alliance, Elizabeth Ouzts, \nState Director of the North Carolina Public Interest Research Group, \nand Michael Shore, Managing Director of the local Environmental \nDefense, added to the dialogue by describing how grassroots action has \nled to a high level of public awareness about air pollution and its \neffects, and how that action has resulted in State legislation to begin \ncleaning the air.\n  Dr. Clay Ballantine, an Asheville physician and medical expert on \npower plant-related health damage, also provided excellent testimony. \nGiven that air pollution decreases lung function, causes pneumonia and \nrespiratory infection, increases lung cancer rates similar to those of \nsecond-hand smoke exposure, causes asthma and asthma attacks, and leads \nto premature death, Dr. Ballantine is concerned about the suffering he \nsees first-hand. I am grateful to all of these witnesses for \nparticipating in the listening session, and for sharing their expertise \nwith me.\n  Since Asheville ranks sixth in the Nation in per capita deaths caused \nby power plant pollution, and since North Carolina is facing millions \nof dollars in additional pollution-related health costs, local citizens \nthere have every reason to be concerned, and every right to be outraged \nthat this administration plans to do nothing to help them. The \nadministration has worked to effectively neutralize and eviscerate \nnearly all major protections in the Clean Air Act. From dropping all \nenforcement cases against the worst violators of New Source Review, to \nthe recent proposal to delist utilities for mandatory mercury control, \nthis administration should make all of us angry. These actions are an \ninsult to all Americans, and a slap in the face. From Asheville, NC to \nBoston, MA, Americans made clear to me their desperation and \nfrustration at being told they have to wait a decade or more for this \nadministration and this Congress to clean their air, while the hundreds \nof thousands of asthma attacks and birth defects continue across the \ncountry.\n  Residents of Boston, MA are especially worried about the potential \ndangers of mercury pollution from power plants, as the Boston economy, \nwhich is highly reliant on commercial and recreational fishing and \ntourism, may become affected by declining consumer confidence in the \nsafety of local fish. Fortunately for some New England residents, \nstates such as Massachusetts and Connecticut are already moving ahead \nwith emission reduction plans.\n  I sincerely appreciate the participation and support of my \ndistinguished colleagues Senator Ted Kennedy and Congressmen Mike \nCapuano, Jim McGovern, and Bill Delahunt, and Massachusetts Attorney \nGeneral Tom Reilly in standing with me on September 22, 2003, at the \nNew England Aquarium to bring attention to the serious mercury \npollution problem facing New England. Also lending their support during \nthe press conference were Ed Toomey, Aquarium President and CEO, and \nArmond Cohen, Executive Director of the Clean Air Task Force in Boston. \nThe Aquarium and Task Force have been leaders in mercury and air \npollution-related research, education, and advocacy.\n  At the public forum, Cindy Luppi, Organizing Director of Clean Water \nAction in Boston, and Jane Bright of HealthLink in Marblehead, \nMassachusetts spoke about the grassroots Northeast Clean Power \nCampaign, representing over 300 organizations from Maine to Connecticut \nthat are all fighting to reduce power plant pollution in the region.\n  Ms. Luppi also provided compelling findings from a Tufts University \nstudy: direct costs of environmentally-attributable neurobehavioral \ndisorders, such as those caused by mercury pollution, in Massachusetts \nalone total between $40 million and $150 million each year, with \nindirect costs totaling an additional $100 million to $400 million. \nAlso, Ms. Luppi presented the findings of a 2002 Massachusetts \nDepartment of Environmental Protection study which determined, ``The \nDepartment believes that the removal of 85 to 90-plus percent of \nmercury in flue gas has been demonstrated to be technologically and \neconomically feasible.'' In other words, there is no excuse to delay \nmandating tough national mercury reductions under the Clean Air Act.\n  Massachusetts and Connecticut are moving now to require an 85 to 95 \npercent reduction in mercury emissions in the next 5 to 9 years. Like \nin Asheville, the witnesses stressed that such State-level progress is \nencouraging, but that real relief from air pollution can only come from \nreductions made across the country.\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\n  During the listening session, Dr. Jill Stein, a physician and \nPresident of the Massachusetts Coalition for Healthy Communities, and \nDr. Bill Bress, State Toxicologist for the Vermont Department of \nHealth, detailed the serious and often life-threatening health effects \nof mercury exposure through consumption of contaminated fish. Nearly 10 \npercent of American women have high mercury blood levels above EPA's \nsafe health threshold. Pregnant women who consume even small amounts of \nfish can inadvertently put their developing babies at risk of mental \nretardation, seizures, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing problems, \nabnormal gait and speech, and learning disabilities. EPA has estimated \nthat 630,000 children are born at risk each year due to mercury \nexposure in the womb. This is twice EPA's previous estimate.\n  An astonishing 50 percent of Americans who eat fish regularly exceed \nthe mercury health limit, and 10 percent exceed the limit by a factor \nof four. Adults are also susceptible to developing heart, kidney, and \nimmune system disorders due to mercury consumption. Anglers and certain \nethnic groups who eat large amounts of fish face two to five times \nthese health risks. Clearly, dramatically curbing mercury pollution \nwill improve all of our lives.\n  Dr. Steve Petron, Board Member of the National Wildlife Federation \nand Senior Ecosystems Scientist for CH2M Hill, demonstrated how toxic \nmercury pollution from power plants harms our Nation's aquatic \nwildlife. Those species that depend on fish for food are the most at \nrisk. Because of this, loons, bald eagles, otters, amphibians, and \nother animals are already facing or could soon face decline. And \nlastly, Dr. Praveen Amar, Director of Science and Policy for the \nNortheast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, NESCAUM, \nrepresented State air quality regulators by stressing that mercury \ncontrol technologies are available and affordable, and by expressing \nthe need for smart Federal environmental laws to drive technology \ninnovation and application. As a recent NESCAUM report found, ``Where \nstrong regulatory drivers exist, substantial technological improvements \nand steady reductions in control costs follow.''\n  That's where Congress comes in. We are elected to serve the people of \nthis Nation. Where people are becoming sick and are dying because of \nair pollution, something must be done. We must never knowingly allow \nsuch suffering to continue if we have the ability to act, and we do. \nTime and time again, mothers and fathers, doctors, scientists, and \ncommunity members ask for our help.\n  At the bare minimum, we should be protecting current law. But to \ntruly benefit the public good, we must pass tough legislation to force \ndirty power plants and other polluters to start behaving like good \ncitizens. The air is not their toxic waste dump. It is not theirs to \npollute for free, even though this administration is encouraging them \nto think that way. If it belongs to anyone, the air belongs to those \nchildren who play outdoors, or those families who go fishing and take \ntrips to our scenic national parks, or to the poorest of us who are \nunlucky enough to live next to a smokestack. The air belongs to all of \nus. We should treat it like the most precious resource we know. \nAmericans from around the country have learned this important lesson. \nCongress and this administration must now do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/24/senate-section/article/S1517-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In February 1999, Steve Garcia was returning to his home from a party \nwearing women's clothing and shoulder length hair.

Mr. President, March 1 marks a very special occasion--\nalthough it is with mixed feelings I report that Tom Ryan, the key \nDepartment of Labor Budget Analyst for employment and training programs \nis retiring following more than 32 years of a most distinguished \ncareer. As the members of the Appropriations Committee can attest, Mr. \nRyan's work in this area has been extraordinary, in its breadth, its \ndepth, and in its effectiveness. As needs arose and even when crisis \nhas come to the lives of so many job seekers throughout our Nation, Mr. \nRyan has been a pillar of strength in helping people as he worked \ntirelessly with us to ensure that funding for the right training \nopportunities were available when job seekers needed them.\n  On behalf of the members of the Appropriations Committee, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to Mr. \nRyan for his vision which has so often guided us in formulating \ncreative solutions to funding jobs training programs, in caring for the \npeople we serve--many of those who are in critical need of assistance. \nThe complexities of funding these programs during the challenging years \nof fiscal austerity have been met with a determination to find \nsolutions, and the countless people receiving job training and \nemployment assistance are well-served, due in no small measure, to Mr. \nRyan's efforts and his devotion to these endeavors. For these efforts \nand so many more, we extend our congratulations to Mr. Ryan and wish \nhim an enjoyable and well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/24/senate-section/article/S1517-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ERNIE MARX\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I take a moment today to pay \ntribute to Ernie Marx of Louisville, KY for his service to the people \nof Kentucky and his willingness to teach understanding and compassion \nto our Commonwealth's youth.\n  Mr. Marx is a survivor of the Holocaust and has used this tragic \nevent in human history as an inspiration to educate the youth of our \ncountry about tolerance and respect. He has focused his efforts on \nmiddle and high school students, speaking about his experiences before \nhundreds of different groups.\n  One such event was on Tuesday, April 29, 2003, when Mr. Marx spoke at \nthe annual Yom HaShoah commemoration at Fort Knox, KY. Yom HaShoah, or \nHolocaust Remembrance Day, is an important day of reflection for \nAmericans and people throughout the world. His own message to our \nsoldiers at Fort Knox was about hate and tolerance. He told the \nsoldiers that they can prevent a Holocaust, saying, ``You are our hope \nand are fight for our freedom.''\n  This fall Mr. Marx led his 54th trip to Washington, DC to educate \nchildren and citizens about the Holocaust. He brings these groups, \nprimarily students, to visit the holocaust Museum and teaches them \nabout tolerance and understanding. I am certain he will continue to \nlead these trips in the tradition of the Holocaust Museum's mission of \neducation.\n  From Atherton High School in Louisville, KY to the Henry County \nMiddle School in New Castle, KY, Ernie Marx has had a profound impact \non the youth of the Louisville region. I would like to honor his \ndedication, leadership and commitment to the people of \nKentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/24/senate-section/article/S1517-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       H.R. 3783.

A bill to improve the Federal shore protection program; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Coastal \nRestoration Act of 2004 for myself and Senator Corzine. Since 1995, the \nFederal beach nourishment program has been a regular target of the \nWhite House Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Under two separate \nadministrations there have been at least five efforts to radically \nchange or terminate the program.\n  The 1996, Congress passed the Shore Protection Act as Section 227 of \nthe Water Resources Development Act of 1996. That legislation was the \nfirst statement by Congress since 1946 of its intent that the Nation \nneeded an ongoing Federal beach nourishment program. Unfortunately, \nthat has not stopped OMB from trying to change Federal policies by \nmaking budget proposals that would cripple the program.\n  The Coastal Restoration Act, CRA, restates the congressional intent \nregarding the importance of the Federal beach nourishment program. The \nCRA makes it clear that changes in administration policy will not \nprevent feasibility and other types of studies from being processed \nthrough the Corps of Engineers and sent to Congress. The legislation \nemphasizes the role of Congress in determining which beach nourishment \nprojects should be authorized for construction. It also re-states and \nstrengthens existing law that periodic renourishment is an integral \npart of the ongoing construction of a beach nourishment project.\n  This bill states the intent of Congress that preference shall be \ngiven to areas 1, where there has been a previous investment of federal \nfunds; 2, where regional sediment management plans have been adopted to \nintegrate coastal beach nourishment, navigation, and environmental \nprojects; 3, where there is a need to prevent or mitigate damage to \nshores, beaches, and other coastal infrastructure where that damage is \ncaused at least in part by Federal activities; or 4, where the project \npromotes human health and safety as well as the quality of life for \nindividuals and families. This recognizes that a primary purpose for \nestablishing the Federal beach nourishment program in 1946 was the \npromotion of public recreation.\n  My bill will also raise the low priority now accorded by the U.S. \nArmy Corps to the recreational benefits of beach nourishment, giving \nequal consideration to all national projects. It also establishes the \ncost share for beach nourishment projects whose primary net benefit is \nrecreational at the same level of Federal cost share participation as \nit applies to storm damage and environmental restoration beach \nnourishment projects. Congress retains the prerogative to authorize the \nproject and appropriate funds based on the Corps' report findings.\n  These changes are needed to protect and restore our beaches as the \nnational treasure they are. According to a recent study, travel and \ntourism is the world's largest industry, contributing $3.5 trillion to \nthe world's economy in 2001. In the United States, nearly 17 million \npeople are employed in the tourism industry.\n  Beaches are the leading tourist destination in the Nation. Each year \nabout 180 million Americans make 2 billion visits to the ocean, the \nGulf, and our inland beaches. That is almost twice as many visits as \nthose made to State and national parks and wilderness areas combined. \nIn its ``State of the Beach 2003'' report the Surfrider Foundation \nstates that tourist expenditures in 16 of our coastal States topped \n$104 billion.\n  My home State, New Jersey, has 127 miles of shoreline and we are \nproud of every mile. A significant portion of our tourism industry, \nwhich generates $10 billion a year, is due to our beaches. I know many \nof my colleagues in the Senate have similar situations in their States.\n  Our beaches also provide vital habitat for numerous species of \nplants, and for animals such as claims, snails, and crabs. Every time a \nwave hits the shore it brings nutrients and oxygen to support the tiny \nbut necessary life forms that live there.\n  Not to be overlooked are the peace and relaxation that a day, or \nweek, at the beach can provide. The poet Lord Byron put it so \nexquisitely nearly two hundred years ago when he wrote:\n\n     There is a rapture on the lonely shore,\n     There is a society, where none intrudes,\n     By the deep sea, and music in its roar:\n     I love not man the less, but Nature more.\n\n  The shore's economic, environmental, and aesthetic benefits are truly \nlimitless. That is why I am introducing the Coastal Restoration Act of \n2004. My legislation will revitalize the Federal beach nourishment \nprogram by placing beach nourishment projects on a par with other Army \nCorps projects, and assigning recreational benefits the same priority \nas storm damage protection and environmental restoration, correcting \nthe inequities in our current practices.\n  Since the 1980s, when medical waste, sewage, and garbage began \nwashing up on the Jersey shore I have been working hard to protect and \nnurture our beaches. I wrote the Ocean Dumping Act of 1988, which ended \nocean dumping of sewage sludge and industry waste. And I have led the \nfight to ban oil and gas drilling off the Jersey shore. We have made a \nlot of progress since the 1980s, but our work is far from over.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of my bill be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2105\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coastal Restoration Act of \n     2004''.\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncapital gains treatment for certain self-created musical works; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I applaud Senator Bunning for \nintroducing the bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nprovide capital gains treatment for certain self-created musical works, \nand I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill.\n  This bill will make songwriters eligible for the capital gains tax \nrate when\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\nthey sell their portion of a song catalogue. It treats the taxation of \nsongwriters fairly so that they are on equal footing with musical \npublishers. Many songwriters are self-employed small business owners, \nbut they are distinguishable from other similar small business owners, \nsuch as authors, because the rate of pay for songwriters is set by the \nFederal Government.\n  Historically, almost all professional songwriters assigned their \ncopyright to a music publisher. As a result, the songwriters did not \nown the song or receive any royalty payments from the song. The \nsongwriters did not own the copyright, and therefore, were not required \nto participate in any expenses toward exploiting it.\n  Currently, songwriters and music publishers are equal, joint-venture \nbusiness partners. The publisher serves as the songwriter's agent in \ngetting songs recorded or placed, otherwise known as ``co-publishing.'' \nUnder this scenario, the songwriter and publisher equally share \nexpenses of, among other things, demos costs and legal fees, and they \nequally share in any royalty income. Alternatively, the songwriter is \nthe music publisher and bears all of the expenses of, among other \nthings, demo costs and legal fees. Under the first scenario, the \nsongwriter is subject to ordinary income tax, rather than capital gains \ntax, despite the fact that the sale of the song catalogue was actually \na capital gain and should have been taxed at a lower rate. A capital \ngain is the result of a sale of a capital asset. Clearly, a song \ncatalog is a capital gain because it is an asset of the songwriter.\n  Under current law, music publishers are eligible for the capital \ngains tax rate when they sell their portion of a song catalogue, but \nsongwriters are not. When the publishing rights or the song catalogue \nis sold, music-publishing companies are allowed to claim the capital \ngains tax rate on their portion of the sale. However, because the \nsongwriter wrote the song, they must pay ordinary income tax on their \nshare of the same sale even though they share in expenses toward \nexploiting the copyright.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill because it levels the tax \nplaying field between songwriters and music publishers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2107. A bill to authorize an annual appropriations of $10,000,000 \nfor mental health courts through fiscal year 2009; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould reauthorize America's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project. \nThis program addresses the impact that mentally ill offenders have had \non our criminal justice system and the impact the system has had on the \noffenders and their special needs.\n  My interest in, and experience with this issue began over thirty \nyears ago, when I was working as Assistant County Prosecuting Attorney \nin Greene County, OH, and then as County Prosecutor. What I learned \nthen--and what I have continued to encounter throughout my career in \npublic service--is that our State and local correctional facilities \nhave become way stations for far too many mentally ill individuals in \nour Nation.\n  A recent Justice Department study revealed that 16 percent of all \ninmates in America's State prisons and local jails today are mentally \nill. The American Jails Association estimates that 600,000 to 700,000 \nseriously mentally ill persons each year are booked into local jails, \nalone. In Ohio, nearly 1 in 5 prisoners need psychiatric services or \nspecial accommodations.\n  Far too many of our Nation's mentally ill persons have ended up in \nour prisons and jails. In fact, on any given day, the Los Angeles \nCounty Jail is home to more mentally ill inmates than the largest \nmental health care institution in our country. What happens is that all \ntoo often, the mentally ill act out their symptoms on the streets. They \nare arrested for minor offenses and wind up in jail. They serve their \nsentences or are paroled, but find themselves right back in the system \nonly a short time later after committing additional--often more \nserious--crimes.\n  Throughout this destructive cycle, law enforcement and corrections \nspend time and money trying to cope with the unique problems posed by \nthese individuals. Certainly, many mentally ill offenders must be \nincarcerated because of the severity of their crimes. However, those \nwho commit very minor non-violent offenses don't necessarily need to be \nincarcerated; instead, if given appropriate care early, their illnesses \ncould be addressed, helping the offenders, while reducing recidivism \nand decreasing the burdens on our police and corrections officials.\n  That's why, four years ago Senator Domenici and I introduced \nAmerica's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project, to begin to \nidentify--early in the process--mentally ill offenders within our \njustice system and to use the power of the courts to assist them in \nobtaining the treatment they need.\n\n  This program has been a success. In pilot programs around the \ncountry, mental health courts have begun to help local communities take \nsteps toward effectively addressing the issues raised by the mentally \nill in our justice system, and these steps must continue. That's why \nSenators Leahy and Domenici join me in cosponsoring this bill to \nreauthorize this important program.\n  America's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project established a \nFederal grant program to help States and localities develop mental \nhealth courts in their jurisdictions. These courts are specialized \ncourts with separate dockets. They hear cases exclusively involving \nnonviolent offenses committed by mentally ill individuals. \nFundamentally, mental health courts enable State and local courts to \noffer alternative sentences or alternatives to prosecution for those \noffenders who could be served best by mental health services. These \ncourts are designed to address the historic lack of coordination \nbetween local law enforcement and social service systems and the lack \nof interaction within the criminal justice system.\n  To deal with the separate needs of mentally ill offenders, these \nmental health courts are staffed by a core group of specialized \nprofessionals, including a dedicated judge, prosecutor, public \ndefender, and court liaison to the mental health services community. \nThe courts promote efficiency and consistency by centrally managing all \noutstanding cases involving a mentally ill defendant referred to the \nmental health court.\n  Mental health court judges decide whether or not to hear each case \nreferred to them. The courts only deal with defendants deemed mentally \nill by qualified mental health professionals or the mental health court \njudge. Similarly, participation in the court by the mentally ill is \nvoluntary; however, once the defendant volunteers for the Mental Health \nCourt, he or she is expected to follow the decision of the court. For \ninstance, in any given case, the mental health court judge, attorneys, \nand health services liaison may all agree on a plan of treatment as an \nalternative sentence or in lieu of prosecution. The defendant must \nadhere strictly to this court-imposed treatment plan. The court must \nthen provide supervision with periodic review. This way, the court can \nquickly deal with any failure of the defendant to fulfill the treatment \nplan obligations. The mental health courts provide supervision of \nparticipants that is more intensive than might otherwise be available, \nwith an emphasis on accountability and monitoring the participant's \nperformance. In this sense, the mental health courts function similarly \nto drug courts.\n  Mr. President, mentally ill persons who choose to have their cases \nheard in a mental health court often do so because that is the first \nreal opportunity that many of these people have to seek treatment. A \njudicial program offering the possibility of effective treatment--\nrather than jail time--gives a measure of hope and a chance for \nrehabilitation to these defendants.\n  The successes of mental health courts are encouraging and show that \nwe can improve the health and safety of our communities through these \nprograms. For example, in Ohio, the Fairfield Municipal Mental Health \nCourt began its program on January 1, 2001. Of those participating in \nthe Fairfield program, 46 percent are bipolar, 42 percent suffer from \ndepression, and 13 percent are schizophrenic. It recently conducted its \nfirst ``graduation'' ceremony of program participants. The program's\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\nfirst graduate came to them hostile, uncommunicative, and unable to \nfunction in society due to her bipolar mood disorder. Two years later, \nshe left the program confident, talkative, healthier, and reconnected \nto her family and her life.\n  Many jurisdictions across America have established mental health \ncourts as a result of the program that we established four years ago. \nOur Nation's communities are trying desperately to find the best way to \ncope with the problems associated with mental illness. Law enforcement \nagencies and correctional facilities remain challenged by difficulties \nposed by mental illnesses. Mental health courts offer a solution.\n  Mental health courts have shown great success, and we must ensure \ntheir continuation. Our Nation has long been enriched by the dual \nideals of compassion and justice, and these programs are a wonderful \nembodiment of both ideals. I urge my colleagues to join in support of \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 1001(a)(20) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control \n     and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3793(a)(20)) is \n     amended by striking ``fiscal years 2001 through 2004'' and \n     inserting ``fiscal years 2004 through 2009''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lieberman, and Mrs. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 2108. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nensure that consumers receive information about the nutritional content \nof restaurant food and vending machine food; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, the Menu \nEducation and Labeling Act, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, \nSenators Kennedy, Lieberman and Cantwell.\n  More than 65 percent of American adults are overweight, and more than \n30 percent are clinically obese. We lead the world in this dubious \ndistinction, which is growing worse. In the past 20 years, obesity \nrates have doubled among American adults and children, while they have \ntripled among teens. If we do not change course, kids attending school \ntoday will be the first generation in American history to live a \nshorter lifespan than their parents.\n  The issue is far from merely cosmetic. It is medical and economic. \nThe obesity epidemic has huge consequences. Overweight people have an \nincreased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers and other \nillnesses. Sixty percent of overweight youth already have at least one \nrisk factor for heart disease which is the No. 1 killer of adults in \nthe U.S. Obesity also causes or contributes to $117 billion a year in \nhealth care and related costs, more than half borne by taxpayers.\n  There is no single solution to the complex problem of obesity, but we \nmust start taking meaningful steps to address this growing problem by \ngiving people the tools necessary to live healthier lifestyles. That is \nwhy my colleagues and I are introducing this bill today to extend \nnutrition labeling beyond packaged foods to include foods at chain \nrestaurants with 20 or more locations, as well as food in vending \nmachines. This common-sense idea will give consumers a needed tool to \nmake wiser choices and achieve a healthier lifestyle. It is a positive \nstep toward addressing the obesity epidemic.\n  In 1990, Congress passed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, \nNLEA, requiring food manufacturers to provide nutrition information on \nnearly all packaged foods. The impact has been tremendous. Not only do \nnearly three-quarters of adults use the food labels on packaged foods, \nbut studies indicate that consumers who read labels have healthier \ndiets.\n  Restaurants, which are more and more important to Americans' diet and \nhealth, were excluded from the NLEA. American adults and children \nconsume a third of their calories at restaurants at the very time when \nnutrition and health experts say that rising caloric consumption and \ngrowing portion sizes are causes of obesity. We also know that when \nchildren eat in restaurants, they consume twice as many calories as \nwhen they eat at home. Consumers say that they would like nutrition \ninformation provided when they order their food at restaurants, yet, \nwhile they have good nutrition information in supermarkets, at \nrestaurants they can only guess.\n  Vending machine food sales also plays a large role in contributing to \nthe diets of Americans. Over the last three decades vending machine \nsales have shot up eighty-five percent after inflation. Most vending \nmachine sales include foods of low nutritional value. The Menu \nEducation and Labeling Act will require fast-food and other chain \nrestaurants, as well as vending machines, to list basic nutritional \ninformation clearly--so consumers can make better choices about the \nfoods that they eat.\n  Let there be no doubt: obesity is indeed an epidemic, and it is \ncontinuing to grow. This is a public health crisis and we must address \nit. Although this bill alone will not halt rising obesity in its \ntracks, it provides consumers with an important tool with which to make \nbetter choices about the food that they and their children consume.\n  In the coming weeks I will be offering additional initiatives to give \nAmericans the tools they need to stay healthy and address risk factors \nlike obesity and mental health that are associated with the rising \nmedical and financial costs of chronic illnesses. The common thread \nwill be an emphasis on preventing unnecessary disease and illness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mr. Levin, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2109. A bill to provide for a 10-year extension of the assault \nweapons ban; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and \nSenators Warner, Schumer, DeWine, Levin, Chafee, Dodd, Jeffords, Boxer, \nClinton, Reed and Lautenberg to offer legislation that will reauthorize \nthe 1994 assault weapons ban--which is now set to expire on September \n13, 2004--for another ten years.\n  I would first like to thank my courageous colleague from Virginia, \nSenator Warner, for joining me in this effort. Senator Warner voted \nagainst the assault weapons ban in 1994.\n  But this year, Senator Warner was willing to revisit his position on \nthe issue. He saw that--contrary to the fears of many in 1994--the ban \nhas done nothing to hurt innocent gun owners. Instead, the ban has only \nmade it harder for criminals to get access to military style firearms. \nA willingness to look at issues like this with an open mind, \nparticularly this issue, shows a courage and a commitment to making the \nright decisions that should be emulated by all public servants, and I \nwant to again thank Senator Warner for this.\n  Second, I would like to speak about who else supports this \nlegislation.\n  Those who join us in supporting a reauthorization of the assault \nweapons ban include: Fraternal Order of Police; National League of \nCities; United States Conference of Mayors; National Association of \nCounties; International Association of Chiefs of Police; National \nAssociation of Police Organizations; International Brotherhood of \nPolice Officers; U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops; National \nEducation Association; Americans for Gun Safety; The Brady Campaign/\nMillion Mom March; NAACP; American Bar Association; and the list goes \non, and on.\n  More than ten years ago--on July 1, 1993--Gian Luigi Ferri walked \ninto 101 California Street in San Francisco carrying two high-capacity \nTEC-9 assault pistols. Within minutes, Ferri had murdered eight people, \nand six others were wounded. This tragedy shook San Francisco, and it \nshook the entire Nation.\n  The American people saw in that incident and so many others that came \nbefore and after it the incredible destruction that could be inflicted \nwith military-style assault weapons--weapons designed and manufactured \nwith one goal in mind--maximum lethality.\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\n  It all started, really, on August 1, 1966, when Charlie Whitman \nclimbed the clock tower at the University of Texas and killed more than \na dozen people in an hour and a half shooting spree before he was \nfinally killed himself.\n  The day Whitman climbed that tower was the first time Americans \nrealized that they could become the random victims of gun violence no \nmatter where they were, and no matter what they were doing.\n  What made the Texas shooting so terrible was the total inability of \nlaw enforcement to get to Charlie Whitman until he had been firing \nshots for almost 96 minutes. The tower allowed him to do this. The \ntower made him, at least for that amount of time, invincible.\n  But gunmen no longer need the protection of clock towers, because \nthey now have assault weapons.\n  We saw in the Columbine shooting, in the Long Island Rail Road \nshooting, and so many others, that high capacity assault weapons can \nmake those who wield them temporarily invincible to law enforcement, \nbecause it is so difficult to get close to the shooter.\n  It is often only when a gunman stops to reload that bystanders or the \npolice can move in to stop the shooting. And if the gun's magazine \nholds hundreds of bullets, that could take a long time, and result in a \nlot of deaths.\n  This is vitally important, because grievance killings by disgruntled \nmembers of society have taken an increasing number of lives in recent \nyears. And when those grievance killers wield high capacity weapons, \nthe toll on lives is exponentially increased.\n  The grievance killings have been across the Nation, in every forum: \nIn a San Ysidro, CA, McDonald's in 1984, when a gunman with an Uzi \nkilled 21 and wounded 15 others. In Stockton, CA, in 1989, when drifter \nPatrick Purdy walked into a schoolyard with an AK-47 and killed 5, \nwounding 30 others. In Long Island, NY, in 1993, when a gunman killed 6 \nand wounded 19 others on a commuter train--he was only brought down \nwhen he finally stopped to reload. In Pearl, MS, in 1997 when 2 \nstudents killed. In Paducah, KY, in 1998 when 3 students were killed. \nIn Jonesboro, AR, in 1998 when 5 were killed, and 10 more wounded. In \nSpringfield, OR, in 1998 when 2 were killed, and 22 wounded. In \nLittleton, CO, when 12 teens and one teacher were killed in Columbine \nHigh School. In Atlanta, GA in 1999 when a troubled day trader killed \nhis wife, 2 children and several people trading stocks. At a Granada \nHills, CA, Jewish Community Center when a gunman wounded three and \nkilled a Filipino-American postal worker--many of us remember that one \ntouching photo of small children being quickly led across the street to \nescape the gunfire. No child should have to go through that. At a Fort \nWorth, TX, Baptist church where seven were killed and seven more \nwounded at a teens church event, all by a man with two guns and 9 high \ncapacity clips, with a capacity of 15 rounds each.\n  Recognizing the earliest of these shootings as a problem that needed \nto be dealt with, Congress finally took notice in 1993. In the \naftermath of the 101 California shooting, we in Congress did something \nthat no one had succeeded in doing before--we banned the manufacture \nand importation of military-style assault weapons.\n  We were told it could not be done--but we did it. I was even told by \ncolleagues on my own side of the aisle that I was wasting my time--that \nthe gun lobby was just too strong. I hear many of the same arguments \ntoday. But we succeeded in 1994, and we will succeed this year. We \nsucceeded, and we will succeed, because the American people will accept \nno less of us.\n  The goal of the 1994 legislation was to drive down the supply of \nthese weapons and to make them more difficult to obtain, and to \neventually get them off our streets. And in the years following the \nenactment of the ban, crimes using assault weapons were indeed reduced \ndramatically--in fact, the percentage of crimes using banned assault \nweapons fell by more than 65 percent between 1995 and 2002.\n  The ATF has found that the proportion of banned assault weapons used \nin crime has fallen from 3.57 percent in 1995 to just 1.22 percent by \n2002. Now these are not big percentages--most crimes are not committed \nby assault weapons.\n  But it is important to note that crimes committed with assault \nweapons often result in many more deaths than crimes committed with \nother guns. A simple robbery with a handgun is far less likely to \nresult in multiple deaths than a drive-by shooting with an Uzi, or a \ngrievance killing in a school using an AK-47 with a large capacity \nammunition magazine.\n  And contrary to the near-hysterical rhetoric coming from the NRA at \nthe time, no innocent gun owner lost an assault weapon. No gun was \nconfiscated as a result of the ban. The sky did not fall. And life went \non--but it went on with fewer grievance killers, juveniles, and drive-\nby shooters having access to the most dangerous of firearms.\n  Despite these results, House Majority Leader Tom Delay said last year \nthat House Republicans will let the Assault Weapons ban die when it \nsunsets after ten years.\n  To those of us who have been in Congress for some time, this comes as \nlittle surprise--after all, the House actually voted to repeal the \noriginal assault weapons ban soon after it was signed into law.\n  But the good news is that the President of the United States does \nsupport reauthorizing the ban.\n  In April of last year, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said of \nthe assault weapons ban, ``The president supports the current law, and \nhe supports reauthorization of the current law.''\n  That is what we are doing with this legislation--reauthorizing the \ncurrent law. Period.\n  I know the President agrees with me when I say that I don't believe \nthat banned guns like the AK-47, the TEC-9, or the Street Sweeper \nshould once again be manufactured or imported into the United States. \nThese are military guns, with no purpose but the killing of other human \nbeings. They have pistol grips and other features designed solely to \nallow the weapons to be more easily concealed, and more easily fired \nfrom the hip in close quarters combat--or, tragically, in places like \nthe schoolyard in Stockton, where five children died, the McDonalds in \nSan Ysidro, the law firm at 101 California Street in San Francisco, \nColumbine High School, or so many other places where maniacs with their \nmilitary guns were able to shoot large numbers of people in short \nperiods of time.\n  That is why I believe that Congress should reauthorize the 1994 law, \nwhich expires next September 13. And that is undoubtedly why the \nPresident also supports our efforts.\n  I know there will be some who will say that the current law doesn't \ngo far enough--and frankly, I agree. I would prefer to expand the ban \nto California law, so that we prohibit the copycat assault weapons that \nmanufacturers so cravenly designed following the ban.\n  Senator Lautenberg has introduced legislation to do this, and I co-\nsponsored that bill. Ideally, we would pass legislation that fully \nprevents craven manufacturers from circumventing the ban.\n  But in an environment where the NRA has such a stranglehold on gun \nlegislation, we will need all the help we can get just to keep the \ncurrent ban.\n  The current ban has been effective in limiting the supply of these \nmost dangerous guns. Even the copycat guns are less dangerous, because \nthey are harder to conceal, harder to fire from the hip.\n  And no matter whether the ban has been entirely effective or not, \nwhat is the argument for letting these banned guns back on the streets?\n  Who is clamoring for newly manufactured AK-47s?\n  Who is clamoring for new TEC-9s?\n  These are guns that are never used for hunting. They are not used for \nself defense, and if they are it is more likely that they will kill \ninnocents than intruders.\n  These guns--and everyone knows it--have but one purpose, and that \npurpose is to kill other human beings. Why would we want to open the \nfloodgates again and let them back on our streets? There is simply no \ngood reason.\n  This debate should not be about whether the assault weapons ban is \nperfect. This debate should be about whether these guns need to come \nback--and the American people know that they do not.\n  With the President, law enforcement, and the American people behind \nus, we\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\ncan succeed. We can beat the NRA's narrow, special interest agenda and \nkeep these guns off the streets.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the dozens of editorials in support of \nthe ban, to listen to their constituents, to ask us questions, and to \nmake the only decision that makes sense--to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2109\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Assault Weapons Ban \n     Reauthorization Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. 10-YEAR EXTENSION OF ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN.\n\n       Section 110105 of the Public Safety and Recreational \n     Firearms Use Protection Act (18 U.S.C. 921 note) is amended \n     to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 110105. SUNSET PROVISION.\n\n       ``This subtitle and the amendments made by this subtitle \n     are repealed September 13, 2014.''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of reauthorizing \nthe Assault Weapons Ban.\n  Signed into law in 1994, the Assault Weapons Ban placed a 10-year \nprohibition on the domestic manufacture of semi-automatic assault \nweapons and high capacity ammunition clips. The 10-year ban ends on \nSeptember 13, 2004. Consequently, unless Congress and the President act \nprior to September 13, 2004, weapons like Uzis and AK-47s will once \nagain be produced in America, and more and more often, these weapons \nwill fall into the hands of criminals who lurk in our neighborhoods.\n  For a number of years now, President Bush has indicated that he \nsupports reauthorizing the assault weapons ban. To date, though, no \nlegislation has been introduced in the Senate to accomplish the \nPresident's goal. While measures have been introduced to make the ban \npermanent or to even expand the ban further, no legislation has been \nintroduced to simply reauthorize the Assault Weapons Ban for another \nten years.\n  I am pleased today to introduce, with Senator Feinstein, legislation \nthat models exactly what the President has indicated he would sign into \nlaw: a straight 10-year reauthorization of the Assault Weapons Ban.\n  Not only does President Bush support this legislation--law \nenforcement does as well. The men and women of law enforcement know \nthat this legislation makes communities safer. In a letter dated \nFebruary 18, 2004, the Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police \nwrites, ``It is the position of the Grand Lodge that we will support \nthe reauthorization of current law, but we will not support any \nexpansion of the ban.'' This endorsement comes in addition to the \nendorsement of just about every other major law enforcement \norganization, and in addition to the endorsements of chiefs of police \nall across Virginia.\n  Now, admittedly, I have not always been a supporter of the Assault \nWeapons Ban. When the ban legislation came before the United States \nSenate for a vote in 1993, I opposed it. At the time, I believed \nSenator Feinstein's legislation would do nothing to help reduce crime \nin this country, and I believed it would be a back door way to take \nfirearms out of the hands of law abiding gun-owners and hunters.\n  Ten years have since passed from the day of that vote. Over the \ncourse of those ten years, I have watched the bill be signed into law, \nand I have watched its implementation. I have studied the law and its \naffect on crime, and I have watched carefully to see how it affects law \nabiding gun-owners.\n  Based on the ten years of history of the Assault Weapons Ban, my \nthoughts on the ban have evolved.\n  Ten years of experience provides us with key facts. The Assault \nWeapons Ban has helped to dramatically reduce the number of crimes \nusing assault weapons. It has made America's streets safer, and it has \nprotected the rights of law abiding gun-owners better than many of us \npredicted. In fact, the law explicitly protects 670 hunting and \nrecreational rifles.\n  Moreover, we all know that the world has dramatically changed since \nthat Senate vote in 1993. September 11, 2001, has forever changed our \ncountry and has taught us many lessons.\n  No longer is America protected by the great oceans. The war on terror \nis not only being fought abroad, but now here at home. September 11 \nshowed us that terrorism lurks in the shadows of our own backyard. \nGiven the world today, now is not the time to make it easier for \nterrorists to acquire deadly rapid fire assault weapons and use them in \nour neighborhoods.\n  Now, over my 25 years plus in the United States Senate, I have always \ntried to stand up for what is right, regardless of politics. I believe \nthat is why the good people of the Commonwealth of Virginia have given \nme their trust and elected me to represent them in the United States \nSenate for five terms.\n  I know that reauthorizing the Assault Weapons Ban is the right thing \nto do.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Feinstein in introducing this \nlegislation, and it is my hope that the Senate will act expeditiously \nand send this legislation to President Bush to sign into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2110.

Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know H.R. 3740 is an important piece of \nlegislation. It extends the highway bill now in effect for 4 months. I \nhave not spoken to Senator Inhofe today, but we have communicated \nthrough staff. He and I would rather have a 1-month extension. It is my \nunderstanding that the two leaders have met and think that 60 days \nwould be an appropriate time. I want everybody to be on notice that if \nthere is any effort to extend this beyond 60 days, I will do whatever I \ncan to make sure that is not the case.\n  It is so important that we move this most important piece of \nlegislation to 4 months, as there will be no bill this year. We have \nspent too much time over here. It now appears that the debate is over \ndollars. It is not about the content of the bill in any way.\n  I hope the two leaders understand the grief and difficulty that \nSenators Inhofe and I and Kit Bond and Senator Jeffords have gone \nthrough to get to the point where we are. I will agree with the \ndecision of the two leaders, but when it comes back from the House, I \nhope there will be an agreement to split the difference after that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in all likelihood, we will be looking at 2 \nmonths. Again, for those listening now, a lot of people said 1 month. A \nlot of people said 4 months. A lot of people said a year. So this was \nnegotiated again with both sides, and we understand the immediacy and \nthe importance of this bill, which I do also strongly support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/24/senate-section/article/S1529-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
