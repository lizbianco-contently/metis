Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately \nresume consideration of the Defense appropriations bill. Last night, we \nlocked in an order of amendments to be offered over the course of the \nday. Although we have not locked in time agreements on these \namendments, we expect to be voting on a couple of them as early as 11 \nor 11:30 this morning. The chairman is here and is prepared to work \nthrough the remaining amendments to the bill. It is our expectation to \ncomplete this bill today or tonight.\n  As I stated yesterday, and as stated by the chairman as well, if--it \nis an ``if''--we complete the Defense bill today and we are able to \nbegin with the Homeland Security appropriations bill on Monday, there \nwill be no rollcall votes during Friday's session. Again, that is if we \ncomplete the bill today. If not, we will go into tomorrow and have \nrollcall votes tomorrow.\n  Monday is a no-vote day. However, as has been mentioned on the floor, \nwe would expect Members to be present on Monday to offer amendments to \nthe Homeland Security bill.\n  As a reminder to all Senators, at 4 p.m. today the Prime Minister of \nBritain, the Right Honorable Tony Blair, will deliver an address to \nboth Houses of Congress.\n  Senators have been notified--but I will remind them--that they are \nasked to gather in the Senate Chamber no later than 3:40 this afternoon \nin order to proceed to the Hall of the House of Representatives.\n  As we look ahead to next week, we will continue on the appropriations \nbills that are available. We will continue to have busy sessions \nthroughout.\n  I remind Members that the last week prior to the recess will be \ndevoted to completion of the Energy bill. I have been hoping to reach \nan agreement so that Members will file their amendments on the Energy \nbill no later than Wednesday of next week. That would enable the \nchairman and the ranking member to begin to work through the amendments \nprior to that final week of consideration.\n  I remind my colleagues that we began consideration of the Energy bill \non May 6 of this year. I believe there has been more than adequate time \nto draft amendments, and therefore I hope we can set this reasonable \nfiling deadline. I know at this time there are objections on the other \nside of the aisle. However, I will continue to work with Senator \nDaschle and the assistant Democratic leader in an effort to reach this \nconsent.\n  I thank all Members. As always, we will notify Senators as votes are \nscheduled throughout the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9515-6", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9515-S9516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, Senator Dodd has agreed to a \ntime limit. As soon as the Senator has an opportunity to review his \namendment, I am sure he will agree to that time limit.\n  Senator Byrd has an amendment he will offer following that. He said \nhe would not agree to a time on this amendment, but he said he wouldn't \ntake long.\n  As the leader knows, we have agreed to vote on Senator Byrd's \namendment, and then Senator Dodd wants a vote on his amendment after we \ncomplete the debate.\n\n  We have a list of the amendments we are going to offer. Senator Byrd \nhas three. Other Senators have one each.\n  We should be able to move through this in a reasonable period of \ntime--hopefully before too long. I assume the majority leader will have \nthe Senate in recess from 3:30 until the time the Prime Minister of \nBritain completes his speech. I hope he follows the model and precedent \nof the most recent President as far as length is concerned so he \ndoesn't take too much of our time off the floor.\n  The Senate will bring up the Energy bill. We worked hard on the \nEnergy bill. Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici have worked hard. \nBut we have not even spent 2 full weeks on that bill. Last time we had \n8 weeks. I\n\n[[Page S9516]]\n\nacknowledge that the last time, one of the reasons it took more time \nwas ANWR, which this bill doesn't have in it. That will help us \nsignificantly. We will do what we did to cooperate with the majority on \nthis bill.\n  As everyone knows, the Democratic leader wants this bill passed very \nbadly. But I say to the distinguished majority leader, he can only do \nso much. There are more than 300 amendments on both sides. It will be a \nheavy task to get through this in a week.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate those comments. As I \nmentioned, we started on the Energy bill on May 6. We had 12 days of \nconsideration on the floor of the Senate. The bill was marked up prior \nto that.\n  I have tried to lay this out from the outset recognizing that we are \ngoing to address the bill--and we spent 12 days on it--during the last \nweek of this month so we can plan, so we can get amendments considered \nand get the list down to a manageable number.\n  The reason I come to the floor every day is that I want to encourage \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to focus on this right now. I get \nthis feeling and sense that people are going to say we are going too \nfast and we are running out of time. That is the only reason I stress \nthis in just about every other statement and in every meeting. I think \neverybody understands that and is working. But I do want to complete \nthis bill. We are setting adequate time to do that.\n  If we can come to some sort of agreement by midweek next week as to \nwhat amendments we will be looking at, it will be hugely helpful. That \nis what we are working for on both sides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9516-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR'S ADDRESS TO A JOINT MEETING OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me comment briefly on Prime Minister \nTony Blair's address to the joint meeting of Congress this afternoon. \nIt is a historic time.\n  This afternoon, the Senate and the House of Representatives have that \ndistinct honor of welcoming British Minister Tony Blair to address this \njoint meeting of the Congress. This type of address is the highest \nhonor which Congress can bestow. Prime Minister Blair will be the \nfourth sitting Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to address a joint \nsession of the United States and Congress, preceded only by Winston \nChurchill, Clement Richard Atlee, and Margaret Thatcher--three of \nhistory's greatest leaders.\n  Today's historic tribute signifies our abiding friendship and our \ndeep respect not only for the Prime Minister but for the great people \nof the United Kingdom.\n  Throughout the last century, the United Kingdom and the United States \nhave stood shoulder to shoulder to defend the free people of the world. \nThat is because our two nations share more than just history. We share \ndeeply held principles of devotion to governance with the consent of \nthe electorate, a devotion to justice based on the rule of law and the \nprinciples of due process and devotion to economic freedom based on a \nbelief that every individual should be free to express his or her God-\ngiven talents.\n\n  Together, the United States and the United Kingdom defeated the twin \nevils of fascism and communism. Today, we stand together to defend \ndemocracy everywhere.\n  In Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, Prime Minister Blair has led \nthe way to bring freedom to the oppressed, relief to the suffering, and \nthe promise of peace to those living in war-torn regions.\n  In Sierra Leone, Prime Minister Blair led the effort to end a brutal \nand senseless civil war. In Kosovo and the Balkans, the Prime Minister \nrallied our two great nations to bring stability and security to that \ntroubled region. In our great time of need, Prime Minister Blair has \nshown tremendous courage; he has shown tremendous resolve to defeat our \nenemies no matter how deep their caves or how fearsome their arsenal.\n  In Afghanistan, the United Kingdom contributed forces to Operation \nEnduring Freedom and led the International Security Assistance Force. \nIn Iraq, Prime Minister Blair worked tirelessly to build the coalition \nto free the Iraqi people from the savagery of Saddam Hussein, a man \nwho--and we should never forget this--used chemical weapons to commit \nmass murder against his neighbors as well as his own people.\n  Under the Prime Minister's leadership, the United Kingdom sent over \n30,000 troops--nearly a fourth of the British military--to fight \nalongside our valiant women and men.\n  We are grateful for the Prime Minister and the British people for \ntheir strength and their resolve.\n  This afternoon, on behalf of the people of the United States, we will \npay tribute to the Prime Minister for his courage and his vision. We \nwill listen to his counsel. We will reaffirm the bond between our two \ngreat nations, purchased not by treasure or self-interest but by \nloyalty and brave mutual sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9516-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2658, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2658) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Harkin, is recognized for not to exceed 25 minutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, some of this week's news headlines and \nlead stories on the evening news, when looked at together, raise \nimportant questions about our direction as a country and about key \nFederal Government policy--both economic policy and foreign policy. The \neconomic issues raised affect the quality of life of every American \nfamily and the future of our children. The foreign policy issues touch \non the reasons that thousands of Americans are deployed today in \nperilous circumstances in Iraq. As we all know, our soldiers are \nrisking their lives daily in Iraq, and daily American troops are being \nkilled.\n  On the economic front, the front page of the Washington Post reported \nearlier this week that the White House now projects that the Federal \nbudget deficit will top $450 billion this year: ``Budget Deficit May \nSurpass $450 billion.'' That is 50 percent higher than the \nadministration predicted just 6 months ago. In 6 months it has \nincreased by 50 percent. The administration's Office of Management and \nBudget also predicts a $475 billion deficit for next year.\n  Now, a couple times in my remarks this morning I will be talking \nabout low-balling. I think the $450 billion budget deficit figure is a \nlow-ball figure. I think the $475 billion budget deficit estimate for \nnext year is also a low-ball figure. I think they are both going to be \nin the neighborhood of $\\1/2\\ trillion or more.\n  Why could I possibly say that? One reason is that the projected $475 \nbillion deficit for next year does not include any accounting for the \ncost of the war in Iraq, or for our continued operations in \nAfghanistan. It is simply not there, as though it costs us nothing.\n  We now know, thanks to the recent hearing held by the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the continued questioning of Secretary Rumsfeld, \nwho at first did not have the figures for how much it was costing us on \na monthly basis in Iraq, but was pressured by the Senators on the Armed \nServices Committee to get the figures during a break when the Senators \ncame to vote--well, he came back, and what did we learn? We learned \nfrom Secretary Rumsfeld that the cost of our operations in Iraq are now \nrunning at about $4 billion a month. That is $1 billion a week.\n\n  Again, to those of us who have been around here for some time, and \nhave seen how these figures have been skewed in the past, I also think \nthat is a low-ball figure. I think the figures of our operations in \nIraq, when all is said\n\n[[Page S9517]]\n\nand done, is going to be much closer to $5 to $6 billion per month. But \nwe will take their figure, the administration's figure of $4 billion a \nmonth.\n  Again, that number has been escalating. At the beginning of the war, \nthe Defense Department said that the occupation costs would only be \nabout $2 billion a month. In June, it rose to $3 billion a month. Now \nit is $4 billion a month. That is just in Iraq. In Afghanistan, we are \nspending another $1 billion each month. When you add up those two, that \nis about $60 billion a year. That is not even in our budget.\n  We are on the Defense appropriations bill right now--a record $369 \nbillion for defense and not one penny in there for Afghanistan or Iraq. \nSo when you see the figure of a $450 billion deficit, hold your breath \nbecause it is going to go up. It is going to be bigger than that \nbecause of these costs in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  But there is another reason why these deficits are going up. The \nbasis for the $450 billion deficit is certainly not the war in Iraq, \nand it is not what we are doing in Afghanistan; it is because of the \nPresident's massive tax cuts enacted in 2001 and this year--tax cuts \nthat benefited the wealthiest in our society.\n  Over one-half of the benefits of the tax break bill in 2001 went to \nthose people making over $1 million a year. This year, we just added on \nto that. Based on the tax cuts enacted this year, a person making $1 \nmillion a year in America now will get over $93,000 a year in a tax \ncut. You wonder why we are having a $450 billion deficit.\n  So those are the two paths our country is going down that I believe \nis putting us in dire jeopardy: The economic path of more and more \nmassive tax breaks for those at the top--not investing in education, \nnot investing in basic medical research, not investing in rebuilding \nour schools and our highways and bridges and roads, not investing in \nour infrastructure in our country, not investing in Early Start and \nHead Start, not investing in Well Start programs, not investing in \nhigher education so our kids can get a chance to go to college, not \ninvesting in that--but taking the great wealth of this country and \ngiving it, in tax breaks, to the wealthiest few.\n  That is the basis for why our economy is in a shambles. Then you add \non to it the foreign policy debacle of the last 2 years. The foreign \npolicy debacle is now leading us to spend $60 billion a year on \nAfghanistan and Iraq, the foreign policy debacle that is leading to \nU.S. troops being killed every day in Iraq.\n\n  The headline in this morning's Washington Post: `` `Guerilla' War \nAcknowledged.''\n\n       The U.S. military's new commander in Iraq acknowledged for \n     the first time yesterday that American troops are engaged in \n     a ``classical guerilla-type'' war against remnants of former \n     Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's Baath Party and said \n     Baathist attacks are growing in organization and \n     sophistication.\n\n  I guess we didn't learn anything from Vietnam, did we? I guess we \njust didn't learn a thing. No, we were so anxious to rush headlong into \nthis war without getting the support of our allies, making this a \nUnited Nations effort, at least at a minimum a NATO effort, rather than \na solo effort by the United States. Now when we look around and we need \nhelp in paying the bills, it is only the U.S. taxpayers who are being \nasked to pay. Make no mistake, the bills will be paid. We will pay \nthose bills. And I will vote for this bill, too, because we can't pull \nthe rug out from underneath our military. No one is talking about \npulling our troops suddenly out of Iraq now that they are there. \nCertainly no one here in the Senate would suggest that we don't provide \nall that we can for their security and their success.\n  But we have to ask the tough questions of what got us here, what led \nus here, what policy decisions put us in this terrible situation. As we \nconsider defense spending, it is appropriate to examine the cause of \nwhy we are committing $1 billion a week in Iraq in addition to the cost \nof human lives.\n  Again, we can look at a second story from Tuesday's Washington Post. \nPresident Bush on Monday defended his State of the Union remarks on \nIraq by saying:\n\n       I think the intelligence I get is darn good intelligence. \n     And the speeches I have given were backed by good \n     intelligence.\n\n  ``President Defends Allegation on Iraq.'' Well, the President \nessentially, with these remarks, seems to be sticking with the story he \ntold in his State of the Union Address. His spokesman days before had \nacknowledged that the President should not have claimed that Iraq was \ntrying to buy uranium from Africa; that this claim was based on bad \nintelligence, forged documents. But the President did not renounce this \nclaim. In fact, he seemed to stand by it.\n  President Bush also said the CIA doubts about the intelligence \nregarding Iraqi efforts to buy uranium in Africa were ``subsequent'' to \nthe State of the Union Address. That is what the President said. \nHowever, we know this is not true. The CIA insisted last October that \nsimilar claims be removed from a speech the President delivered at that \ntime.\n  And wonder of wonders, on July 14, the President said we went to war \nwith Saddam Hussein ``after we gave him a chance to allow the \ninspectors in, and he wouldn't allow them in.'' Just driving in this \nmorning from home into the Senate, I was listening to the radio, and \nthis was brought up on the radio. And you could hear the President's \nown words:\n\n       We gave him a chance to allow the inspectors in, and he \n     wouldn't allow them in.\n\n  That has got to be one of the most bizarre statements I have ever \nheard not only any President but any public official ever make.\n  The fact is, last November, the inspectors were let in, led by Hans \nBlix. They went into Iraq on November 18 last fall. And they were there \ndoing their job. But continually President Bush said they couldn't do \nit, that they couldn't find anything. We kept trying to support the \ninspectors, some of us, but the President kept saying, no, they \ncouldn't operate. The inspectors only left Iraq just before the bombs \nstarted falling.\n\n  And now for this President to say that Saddam Hussein wouldn't let \nthem in has got to be something really bizarre. What could the \nPresident possibly be thinking? How could the President even utter such \nwords?\n  The administration's claims about Iraq's nuclear program have always \nbeen at the center of their justification for the war in Iraq. In a \nspeech in Cincinnati last October laying out the case for the \nresolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, President Bush used \nthe word ``nuclear'' 20 times in one speech. Perhaps his most dramatic \nstatement raised the specter of a nuclear attack on the United States. \nPresident Bush warned in that speech:\n\n       Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the \n     final proof--the smoking gun--that would come in the form of \n     a mushroom cloud.\n\n  In March, shortly before the war began, Vice President Cheney went \nfurther. He said: Hussein ``has been absolutely devoted to trying to \nacquire nuclear weapons.'' And here is what the Vice President said in \nall seriousness:\n\n       And we believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear \n     weapons.\n\n  That is what Vice President Cheney said last March.\n  We ask, where are the facts? We have yet to see any facts, only \nspeculation based upon forged documents. That is a claim with \nabsolutely no evidence behind it. And this is the Vice President of the \nUnited States.\n  So we have to ask, does President Bush stand by his claim that Iraq \nwas trying to purchase uranium, or was that statement a mistake? It is \nnot enough to blame an aide who stopped that claim once but allowed \nit--attributed to another source--the second time. It is not enough to \nclaim, as another aide did, that the statement was technically true \nbecause it said that ``the British Government has learned'' about the \nalleged purchase attempt even though our own Government believed the \nallegations wrong.\n  It is time for President Bush to come clean. Does he believe his own \nclaim? Did Iraq even have an active nuclear weapons program when we \ninvaded? If so, then why have we not found any evidence for it in the \nmonths since the war ended? And if not, then why did we invade in the \nfirst place?\n  This is not just about one statement. It is about a war justified by \nclaims that Iraq was actively pursuing nuclear weapons, by dire \nwarnings about mushroom clouds. Yet the U.N. could not find any \nevidence of a continuing nuclear weapons program, and now apparently we \ncan't either.\n\n[[Page S9518]]\n\n  The administration can't hide that fact behind conflicting statements \nand wrong information. They can't continue to mislead and misdirect the \nAmerican public and the Congress. The cost in money and in lives and in \nreputation is too great.\n  Is this really the culmination of a misguided policy started by a few \nindividuals in the early 1990s, expounded and developed in the later \n1990s, and now encompassed by some in this administration, a new \ndoctrine called ``preemption''; preemption, that we can somehow go in \nand militarily invade a country based not upon evidence, based not upon \nhard facts but based upon a kind of feeling, a supposition, maybe a \nbelief, just a belief that they may, in fact, some day come to harm us?\n  George Will had a column in the newspaper on June 22 talking about \nthe doctrine of preemption. He said something I thought was very \ninteresting. He said:\n\n       To govern is to choose, almost always on the basis of very \n     imperfect information. But preemption presupposes the ability \n     to know things--to know about threats with a degree of \n     certainty not requisite for decisions less momentous than \n     those for waging war.\n\n  If I can interpret Mr. Will, I think he was saying that sometimes you \ncan take certain actions, the consequences of which, if you are wrong, \nare not momentous. But to base military action under a doctrine of \npreemption on potential threats about which you do not have adequate \nfacts, and based only upon a belief or a feeling, the results of that \ncan be terribly momentous.\n  Mr. Will goes on to say:\n\n       Some say the war was justified--\n\n  That is what we are hearing now.\n\n       --even if [weapons of mass destruction] are not found nor \n     their destruction explained, because the world is ``better \n     off'' without Saddam. Of course it is better off. But unless \n     one is prepared to postulate a U.S. right, perhaps even a \n     duty, to militarily dismantle any tyranny--on to Burma?--it \n     is unacceptable to argue that Saddam's mass graves and \n     torture chambers suffice as retrospective justifications for \n     preemptive war.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Will's entire column of June 22 be \nprinted at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Times Union (Albany, NY), June 22, 2003]\n\n                     The Missing Weapons Do Matter\n\n                            (By George Will)\n\n       Washington.--An antidote for grand imperial ambitions is a \n     taste of imperial success. Swift victory in Iraq may have \n     whetted the appetite of some Americans for further military \n     exercises in regime change, but more than seven weeks after \n     the President said, ``Major combat operations in Iraq have \n     ended,'' combat operations, minor but lethal, continue.\n       And overshadowing the military achievement is the failure--\n     so far--to find, or explain the absence of, weapons of mass \n     destruction that were the necessary and sufficient \n     justification for pre-emptive war. The doctrine of pre-\n     emption--the core of the President's foreign policy--is in \n     jeopardy.\n       To govern is to choose, almost always on the basis of very \n     imperfect information. But pre-emption presupposes the \n     ability to know things--to know about threats with a degree \n     of certainty not requisite for decisions less momentous than \n     those for waging war.\n       Some say the way was justified even if WMDs are not found \n     nor their destruction explained, because the world is \n     ``better off'' without Saddam. Of course it is better off. \n     But unless one is prepared to postulate a U.S. right, perhaps \n     even a duty, to militarily dismantle any tyranny--on to \n     Burma?--it is unacceptable to argue that Saddam's mass graves \n     and torture chambers suffice as retrospective justifications \n     for pre-emptive war. Americans seem sanguine about the \n     failure--so far--to validate the war's premise about the \n     threat posed by Saddam's WMDs, but a long-term failure would \n     unravel much of this President's policy and rhetoric.\n       Saddam, forced by the defection of his son-in-law, \n     acknowledged in the mid-1990s his possession of chemical and \n     biological WMDs. President Clinton, British, French and \n     German intelligence agencies and even Hans Blix (who tells \n     the British newspaper The Guardian, ``We know for sure that \n     they did exist'') have expressed certainty about Iraq having \n     WMDs at some point.\n       A vast multinational conspiracy of bad faith, using \n     fictitious WMDs as a pretext for war, is a wildly implausible \n     explanation of the failure to find WMDs. What is plausible? \n     James Woolsey, President Clinton's first CIA director, \n     suggests the following:\n       As war approached, Saddam, a killer but not a fighter, was \n     a parochial figure who had not left Iraq since 1979. He was \n     surrounded by terrified sycophants and several Russian \n     advisers who assured him that if Russia could not subdue \n     Grozny in Chechnya, casualty-averse Americans would not \n     conquer Baghdad.\n       Based on his experience in the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam \n     assumed there would be a ground offensive only after \n     prolonged bombing. U.S. forces would conquer the desert, then \n     stop. He could manufacture civilian casualties--perhaps by \n     blowing up some of his own hospitals--to inflame world \n     opinion, and count on his European friends to force a halt \n     in the war, based on his promise to open Iraq to \n     inspections, having destroyed his WMDs on the eve of war.\n       Or shortly after the war began. Saddam, suggests Woolsey, \n     was stunned when Gen. Tommy Franks began the air and ground \n     offenses simultaneously and then ``pulled a Patton,'' saying, \n     in effect, never mind my flanks, I'll move so fast they can't \n     find my flanks. Saddam, Woolsey suggests, may have moved fast \n     to destroy the material that was the justification for a war \n     he intended to survive, and may have survived.\n       Such destruction need not have been a huge task. In \n     Britain, where political discourse is far fiercer than in \n     America, Tony Blair is being roasted about the missing WMDs \n     by, among many others, Robin Cook, formerly his foreign \n     secretary. Cook says: ``Such weapons require substantial \n     industrial plant and a large work force. It is inconceivable \n     that both could have been kept concealed for the two months \n     we have been in occupation of Iraq.''\n       Rubbish, says Woolsey: Chemical or biological weapons could \n     have been manufactured with minor modifications of a \n     fertilizer plant, or in a plant as small as a microbrewery \n     attached to a restaurant. The 8,500 liters of anthrax that \n     Saddam once admitted to having would weigh about 8.5 tons and \n     would fill about half of a tractor-trailer truck. The 25,000 \n     liters that Colin Powell cited in his U.N. speech could be \n     concealed in two trucks--or in much less space if the anthrax \n     were powdered.\n       For the President, the missing WMDs are not a political \n     problem. Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, says Americans \n     are happily focused on Iraqis liberated rather than WMDs not \n     found, so we ``feel good about ourselves.''\n       But unless America's foreign policy is New Age therapy to \n     make the public feel mellow, feeling good about the \n     consequences of an action does not obviate the need to assess \n     the original rationale for the action. Until WMDs are found, \n     or their absence accounted for, there is urgent explaining to \n     be done.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, again, there is one statement after another. Here \nis a speech that the Vice President gave on August 26, 2002, to the VFW \nnational convention.\n  ``Simply stated,'' said the Vice President, ``there is no doubt that \nSaddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt \nhe is amassing them. I think that is important. He is amassing them to \nuse against our friends, against our allies, and against us.''\n  Well, if he was amassing them, where are they? What information did \nVice President Cheney rely upon last August 26 when he uttered those \nwords? Words have import. Words have consequences, especially when \nthose words are uttered by the President of the United States or the \nVice President--even more so than words uttered by us on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I believe the consequences of those words led us into a war in Iraq \nthat, quite possibly, either could not have happened because we could \nhave had inspectors and we could have weakened Saddam more and more \nover the months and years; or it could have been a war in which we were \nthere with the world community. But, no, the President wanted to rush \ninto this. The words he used and the words that were used by the Vice \nPresident were used to frighten the American people, to stampede the \nCongress into passing a resolution.\n  Mr. President, I think, as we look at our duties here--and, of \ncourse, we have to support our troops and we have to pass this bill--\nthe hard questions need to be answered. What did the President know? \nWhen did he know it? What did the Vice President know and when did he \nknow it? Why did they use the words they used when, in fact, the \nintelligence showed just otherwise? And why underneath it all do we \ncontinue a policy of getting further and further in debt in this \ncountry--to the point that it jeopardizes our children's future? These \nare the hard questions this President has to answer.\n  With that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. What is the \npending business?\n\n[[Page S9519]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Defense appropriations bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1276\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1276.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a review and report regarding the effects of use \n of contractual offset arrangements and memoranda of understanding and \n related agreements on the effectiveness of buy American requirements)\n\n       On page 120, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8124. (a) The Secretary of Defense--\n       (1) shall review--\n       (A) all contractual offset arrangements to which the policy \n     established under section 2532 of title 10, United States \n     Code, applies that are in effect on the date of the enactment \n     of this Act;\n       (B) any memoranda of understanding and related agreements \n     to which the limitation in section 2531(c) of such title \n     applies that have been entered into with a country with \n     respect to which such contractual offset arrangements have \n     been entered into and are in effect on such date; and\n       (C) any waivers granted with respect to a foreign country \n     under section 2534(d)(3) of title 10, United States Code, \n     that are in effect on such date; and\n       (2) shall determine the effects of the use of such \n     arrangements, memoranda of understanding, and agreements on \n     the effectiveness of buy American requirements provided in \n     law.\n       (b) The Secretary shall submit a report on the results of \n     the review under subsection (a) to Congress not later than \n     March 1, 2005. The report shall include a discussion of each \n     of the following:\n       (1) The effects of the contractual offset arrangements on \n     specific subsectors of the industrial base of the United \n     States and what actions have been taken to prevent or \n     ameliorate any serious adverse effects on such subsectors.\n       (2) The extent, if any, to which the contractual offset \n     arrangements and memoranda of understanding and related \n     agreements have provided for technology transfer that would \n     significantly and adversely affect the defense industrial \n     base of the United States and would result in substantial \n     financial loss to a United States firm.\n       (3) The extent to which the use of such contractual offset \n     arrangements is consistent with--\n       (A) the limitation in section 2531(c) of title 10, United \n     States Code, that prohibits implementation of a memorandum of \n     understanding and related agreements if the President, taking \n     into consideration the results of the interagency review, \n     determines that such memorandum of understanding or related \n     agreement has or is likely to have a significant adverse \n     effect on United States industry that outweighs the benefits \n     of entering into or implementing such memorandum or \n     agreement; and\n       (B) the requirements under section 2534(d) of such title \n     that--\n       (i) a waiver granted under such section not impede \n     cooperative programs entered into between the Department of \n     Defense and a foreign country and not impede the reciprocal \n     procurement of defense items that is entered into in \n     accordance with section 2531 of such title; and\n       (ii) the country with respect to which the waiver is \n     granted not discriminate against defense items produced in \n     the United States to a greater degree than the United States \n     discriminates against defense items produced in that country.\n       (c) The Secretary--\n       (1) shall submit to the President any recommendations \n     regarding the use or administration of contractual offset \n     arrangements and memoranda of understanding and related \n     agreements referred to in subsection (a) that the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to strengthen the administration buy \n     American requirements in law; and\n       (2) may modify memoranda of understanding or related \n     agreements entered into under section 2531 of title 10, \n     United States Code, or take other action with regard to such \n     memoranda or related agreements, as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate to strengthen the administration buy American \n     requirements in law in the case of procurements covered by \n     such memoranda or related agreements.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, the President pro tempore, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Inouye, for their cooperation on this \namendment. As I understand it, this amendment has been accepted by both \nsides.\n  I will briefly describe the amendment. My intention is not to ask for \na recorded vote so we will move the process along. I will enter into a \nbrief colloquy perhaps with the ranking member about the prospects of \nthis being held on in conference.\n  Briefly, as all of my colleagues, I am deeply troubled by the state \nof our economy. I spent last week--part of it--in my State, as I am \nsure many colleagues did over the July 4th break, talking to \nmanufacturers, labor unions, and others.\n  As most of my colleagues know, my State is heavily dependent on \ndefense contract work--if not the most dependent on a per capita basis, \ncertainly one of the top States on a per capita base. We have been very \nproud of this tradition over the years. It dates back to the \nRevolutionary War when Connecticut was known as the Provision State. In \naddition to its nomenclature of being the Constitution State, it is the \nProvision State as well.\n  As a result of the cooperation of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee over the years, Connecticut's contribution has continued \nto grow in a variety of areas. Like everything else, there are areas \nfor improvement in how we can help sustain this quality of work that is \nbeing done by some of the finest technicians, some of the finest \nworkers the world has ever seen, producing the most sophisticated \nequipment and hardware that has ever been produced by any nation.\n  Yet we are also seeing, as a result of the realities of the world, \nmore and more people are losing their jobs in the technology area. The \nindustrial base is eroding. In fact, we are told in one article, which \nI placed on this chart, that roughly 27,000 technology jobs moved \noverseas in the year 2000, and this research organization predicts the \nnumber will mushroom to 472,000 by the year 2015 if companies continue \nto farm out as much of our technology work at today's frenzied pace.\n  The jobless issue is important. More than 9 million Americans are out \nof work, and nearly 400,000 jobs have been lost just since January of \nthis year. Job losses continue to mount in the manufacturing sector, \neven in the defense industry, I might add.\n  Manufacturing is the engine that drives our economy, sustaining the \nindustrial base. I note to all of my colleagues that this is critically \nimportant. This is what made America a leader over the years. It is \nwhat made us the great industrial and military power we are today.\n  Manufacturers produce $1 out of every $6 of our economy's gross \ndomestic product. During the last decade, U.S. manufacturing has been \nresponsible for 21 percent of the total economic growth and one-third \nof productivity growth in the United States.\n  In my State, Connecticut, manufacturers are also a critical part of \nour local economy. More than 5,600 individual manufacturing companies \nin the State of Connecticut employ more than 240,000 people who are \npaid over $10 billion a year in salaries and income. These \nmanufacturers create more than $27 billion in added value and generate \n$45 billion in annual sales.\n  Yet despite the importance of this manufacturing sector, \nmanufacturers across the country are struggling today to survive. In an \neconomy where 9.4 million Americans are out of work, it is particularly \nupsetting to learn that the U.S. defense contractors are continuing at \na rapid pace to outsource a considerable number of manufacturing \npositions overseas.\n  This is being done under the so-called offset contracts. Under these \narrangements, foreign governments buy major weapons programs from \nAmerican companies only if the manufacturer contracts out a significant \nportion of that work in that country.\n  For example, when Poland agreed to buy several Lockheed Martin F-16 \naircraft, United States contractors agreed to outsource over 40 \ncomponents of this work to Polish companies, amounting to hundreds of \nUnited States job losses to foreign workers.\n  No one disputes there is an important role for these offset \nagreements, and this amendment does not eliminate them at all. Quite \nthe contrary. The jobs that may be lost may be offset by other gains \nfrom better commercial and defense relations in foreign countries.\n  The issue is whether or not the trend that these arrangements are \nfollowing is headed in the wrong direction. U.S. companies are \noutsourcing more and more, and I am worried this could result in a loss \nof sensitive technology\n\n[[Page S9520]]\n\noverseas, a loss of segments of the national industrial base, and a \nloss of jobs during this economic downturn.\n  As I mentioned, there were 40 different contracts in 1 particular job \nand 1 particular country. When American companies enter into future \ncontracts with the U.S. Government, it means that our taxpayer dollars \nwill now go to work in another country rather than to support our own \neconomic needs.\n  With certain components being built in other countries, offset \narrangements may actually undermine existing ``buy American'' laws that \nrequire specific military machinery--everything from naval circuit \nbreakers to machine tools and ball bearings--to be manufactured by \nworkers in the United States.\n  For these reasons, I am offering this amendment this morning that \nwill add a measure of accountability to these offset contracts. The \namendment requires the Secretary of Defense to review these \narrangements and report to the Congress on, among other things, the \neffect on the industry's industrial base and what actions have been \ntaken to minimize damage to American defense industries, what financial \nimpact these arrangements might have on U.S. manufacturing, the \nimplications of technology transfer arising from these arrangements, \nand, lastly, how consistent some of the business arrangements, \nresulting from these offset arrangements, are with existing ``buy \nAmerican'' laws that pertain specifically to defense policy.\n\n  Armed with this information, we will be better able to ensure that \nwhen American companies enter into foreign contracts, the U.S. \nindustrial base will be preserved and the general interests of the \nAmerican people will be protected.\n  This amendment also allows the Secretary discretion to modify \nexisting memoranda of understanding with other countries affecting \noffset agreements if he or she finds it necessary upon reviewing this \ninformation. He may also submit to the President any recommendations he \nthinks might be necessary to strengthen ``buy American'' laws.\n  This added protection is particularly important to all of us at a \ntime when people all over the Nation are experiencing the highest \nunemployment rate in 9 years, most recently measuring 6.4 percent.\n  I appreciate the consideration of this amendment by the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the committee. This is not a radical approach. As \nI said, it does not in any way eliminate these offset arrangements but \nmerely requires a greater accountability so we can watch carefully what \nis happening, so we do not end up with more jobs being lost, \nparticularly in these critical technologies that are so vital not only \nto our economic success and well-being but also to preserving the \nindustrial base for our national security needs in the 21st century.\n  I ask that the amendment be agreed to. If I may say to my colleague \nfrom Hawaii, I am not going to ask for a recorded vote. I appreciate \ntheir review of the amendment and their acceptance of it. I hope steps \nwill be taken to try to preserve this amendment in conference if that \nis possible.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I can assure my distinguished colleague \nfrom Connecticut that we will do our utmost in convincing the House \nconferees to accept this.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii very much \nfor his continued support.\n  I have no further need for additional time. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate? If there is no \nfurther debate, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1276) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1428 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I inquire of the Chair the pending business before \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1277\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1277.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the availability of funds for the Intelligence \n Community Management Account pending a report on the development and \n   use of intelligence relating to Iraq and Operation Iraqi Freedom)\n\n       Insert after section 8123 the following:\n       Sec. 8124. (a) Limitation on Availability of Certain \n     Funds.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, of the \n     amount appropriated by title VII of the Act under the heading \n     ``Intelligence Community Management Account'', $50,000,000 \n     may only be obligated after the President submits to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report on the role of \n     Executive branch policymakers in the development and use of \n     intelligence relating to Iraq and Operation Iraqi Freedom, \n     including intelligence on--\n       (1) the possession by Iraq of chemical, biological, and \n     nuclear weapons, and the locations of such weapons;\n       (2) the links of the former Iraq regime to Al Qaeda;\n       (3) the attempts of Iraq to acquire uranium from Africa;\n       (4) the attempts of Iraq to procure aluminum tubes for the \n     development of nuclear weapons;\n       (5) the possession by Iraq of mobile laboratories for the \n     production of weapons of mass destruction;\n       (6) the possession by Iraq of delivery systems for weapons \n     of mass destruction; and\n       (7) any other matters that bear on the imminence of the \n     threat from Iraq to the national security of the United \n     States.\n       (b) Additional Matters on Uranium Claim.--The report on the \n     matters specified in subsection (a)(3) shall also include \n     information on which personnel of the Executive Office of the \n     President, including the staff of the National Security \n     Council, were involved in preparing, vetting, and approving, \n     in consultation with the intelligence community, the \n     statement contained in the 2003 State of the Union address of \n     the President on the efforts of Iraq to obtain uranium from \n     Africa, including the roles such personnel played in the \n     drafting and ultimate approval of the statement, the full \n     range of responses such personnel received from the \n     intelligence community, and which personnel ultimately \n     approved the statement.\n       (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committees on Appropriations, Armed Services, and \n     Foreign Relations and the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committees on Appropriations, Armed Services, and \n     International Relations and the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yesterday as a member of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, I sat through a 5-hour hearing with the \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. George Tenet. It was \none of the longest hearings I have ever been a party to in that \ncommittee. Virtually every member of the committee was present for the \nentire hearing. I think we can accurately draw the conclusion from that \nthat it was a hearing of great importance because it addressed an issue \nwhich is central to our foreign policy and our national security, and \nthat is the intelligence agencies of our Government.\n  We are asking now some very difficult but important questions along \ntwo lines. First, was the intelligence gathered before the United \nStates invasion of Iraq accurate and complete? Secondly, was that \ninformation relayed and communicated to the American people in an \nhonest and accurate fashion? Those are two separate questions that are \nrelated.\n  Yesterday, Director Tenet reiterated publicly what he has said before \non July 11, that he accepted responsibility for the fact that in the \nPresident's State of the Union Address last January a sentence was \nincluded which was at best misleading. The sentence, of\n\n[[Page S9521]]\n\ncourse, related to whether or not Iraq had attempted to obtain uranium \nfrom the African nation of Niger. What I am about to say is not from \nthe hearing yesterday but rather from public disclosures and press \nreports relative to that issue.\n  What we know is this: The allegations and rumors about Iraq obtaining \nuranium and other fissile materials from the country of Niger had been \ndiscussed at some length for a long period of time. In fact, documents \nhad been produced at one point that some believed implicated the Iraqis \nand the Niger nation in this particular transaction. It is also true, \nthough, that the people who are expert in this area had looked \ncarefully and closely at that documentation and many had come to the \nopposite conclusion. Some had concluded this information, whether it \nwas from British intelligence sources or American intelligence sources, \nwas dubious, was not credible. Then it was disclosed that the \ndocumentation was actually a forgery.\n  Many of those documents have been made public. Yesterday a leading \nnewspaper in Italy published the documentation and it was reported on \nthe news channels last night in the United States that when those \ndocuments were carefully reviewed, it was found that, in fact, they \ncontained things which on their face were ridiculous, names of \nministers in Iraq and Niger who had not been in that position for \nyears, supposedly official seals on documentation which, when examined \nclosely, turned out to be patently false and phony.\n  So it was with that backdrop that the President, in his State of the \nUnion Address, considered a statement concerning whether or not Niger \nhad sold these fissile materials to Iraq.\n  It has been disclosed publicly and can be discussed openly on the \nSenate floor that there was communication between the Central \nIntelligence Agency and the White House on this issue. It is apparent \nnow to those who have followed this story that there was a discussion \nand an agreement as to what would be included in the speech. The 16 \nfamous words relative to this transaction have now become central in \nour discussion about the gathering and use of intelligence.\n  What I heard yesterday during the course of 5 hours with Director \nTenet is that we have been asking the wrong question. The question we \nhave been asking for some period of time now since this came to light \nwas, Why didn't Director Tenet at the CIA stop those who were trying to \nput misleading information in the President's State of the Union \nAddress? That is an important question. Director Tenet has accepted \nresponsibility for not stopping the insertion of those words. But after \nyesterday's hearing and some reflection, a more important question is \nbefore the Senate. That question is this: Who are the people in the \nWhite House who are so determined to include this misleading \ninformation in the State of the Union Address and why are they still \nthere?\n  That goes to the heart of the question, not just on the gathering of \nintelligence but the use of the intelligence by the Executive Office of \nthe President. That is an important question. It is a question we \nshould face head on.\n  An attempt was made last night by my colleague from New Jersey, \nSenator Corzine, to call for a bipartisan commission, a balanced \ncommission, to look into this question about intelligence gathering and \nthe use of the intelligence leading up to the war on Iraq. His \namendment was defeated by a vote of 51 to 45 on a party-line vote--all \nRepublicans voting against it; all Democrats supporting it. Senator \nCorzine's effort for a bipartisan, balanced, evenhanded commission was \nrejected by this Senate.\n  The amendment which I bring today offers to the Senate an \nalternative. If the Senate does not believe there should be a \nbipartisan commission to investigate this question, this use of \nintelligence, then what I have said in this amendment is that we are \ncalling on the President to report to Congress, the appropriate \ncommittees in the classified and unclassified fashion, whether or not \nthere was a misuse of intelligence leading up to the war on Iraq. Those \nare the only two options before the Senate.\n  In this situation, we have the Intelligence Committee in the House \nand the Senate looking at the classified aspect of this issue. We have \nsaid in the Senate that we do not accept the idea--at least, the \nRepublican side does not accept the idea--of a bipartisan commission \nlooking at this issue. So, clearly, the responsibility falls on the \nshoulders of the President.\n  This amendment says that the President will report to the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress on this use of the intelligence information.\n  Why is this an important discussion? It is particularly important \nfrom several angles. First, if we are engaged successfully in a war on \nterrorism, one of the greatest weapons in our arsenal will be \nintelligence. We will have to depend on our intelligence agencies to \nanticipate problems and threats to the United States. We will have to \ngather credible information, process that information, determine its \ncredibility, determine its authenticity, and use it in defense of the \nUnited States. Now, more than ever, intelligence gathering is \nabsolutely essential for America's national security.\n\n  Second, the President has said we are now following a policy of \npreemption; we will no longer wait until a country poses an imminent \nthreat to the United States or our security. If the President and his \nadministration believe a country may pose such a threat in the future, \nthe President has said we are going to protect our right to attack that \ncountry to forestall any invasion or attack on the United States.\n  How do you reach the conclusion that another country is preparing to \nattack? Clearly, again, by intelligence gathering. Now, more than ever, \nin the war on terrorism and the use of a policy of preemption, we \ndepend on intelligence. Those are the two central points.\n  Equally, if not more important, is what happened in the lead-up to \nthe invasion of Iraq. For months, the President, the Vice President, \nand his Cabinet all sought to convince the American people this \ninvasion of Iraq was not only inevitable but was, frankly, in the best \ninterests of America's national security. The administration, the \nPresident, gathering the intelligence data, presented it to the \nAmerican people in a variety of different fashions. We can all recall \nhow this started. It was almost a year ago that in Crawford, TX, we \nfirst heard the President while he was in summer retreat suggest that \nsomething had to be done about Iraq and used the words ``regime \nchange.''\n  Then, over the months that followed, a variety of different \nrationales came forward for the need to invade Iraq and remove Saddam \nHussein. First and foremost--and nobody argued this point on either \nside of the aisle--Saddam Hussein was a very bad leader, not just for \nthe people of Iraq but for the region and a threat to the world. His \nremoval from power from the beginning was certainly something that \neveryone understood would be in the best interest of the people of \nIraq.\n  But the obvious question was, if you are going to set out just to \nremove bad leaders of the world, where would you draw the line and what \nwould those leaders do in response? So the administration said there \nare more arguments, even more compelling rationales.\n  First and foremost, in Iraq they were developing nuclear weapons. We \nrecall that conversation. As evidence of that, administration officials \ntalked about the fact that Iraq had obtained certain aluminum tubes \nthat could likely be used for the development of new nuclear weapons.\n  Now, in fact, we know on reflection that there was even a debate \nwithin the administration whether these aluminum tubes could be used \nfor nuclear weapons. Despite that, the administration said \ncategorically, we believe they will be used for nuclear weapons and we \nbelieve that is a rationale for the invasion.\n  Second, on other weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological \nweapons, the administration went so far in its presentation to suggest \nthat there were 550 sites where there was at least some possibility of \nweapons of mass destruction. They went into detail about how these \nweapons could threaten Israel, could threaten other countries in the \nregion, might even threaten the United States. That information was \ngiven repeatedly.\n  The fact is, we are 10 weeks after the successful completion of our \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S9522]]\n\ninvasion of Iraq. More than 1,000 inspections have been made in Iraq. \nNo weapons of mass destruction have been found. There has been some \nsmall evidence related to the discovery of something buried in a rose \ngarden that could have been a plan for the use of a nuclear device. \nThere has been the discovery of these mobile units in trailers which \nmight have been used for the development of biological weapons. Those \nthings have been discovered but of the so-called 550 sites, the fact is \nwe have not discovered or uncovered one as I stand here today.\n\n  I am confident before this is over that we will find some evidence of \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq. It could happen as soon as \ntomorrow. I think that will happen. I believe that will happen. But we \nwere told we were dealing with 550 sites. Statements were made by the \nPresident, the Vice President, Ms. Condoleezza Rice and others, that \nSaddam Hussein had arsenals of chemical and biological weapons. They \nhave not been apparent.\n  To think in that lightning-fast conquest of Baghdad, somehow Saddam \nHussein had the time to literally wipe away or destroy any evidence of \nweapons of mass destruction strains credulity.\n  What we have now is a serious question as to whether the intelligence \nwas valid and accurate or whether it was portrayed to the American \npeople in a valid and accurate way.\n  We also had allegations that Saddam Hussein was linked with al-Qaida. \nOf course, this is something of great concern to the American people. \nWe know that the al-Qaida terrorists are responsible for September 11, \nthe loss of at least 3,000 innocent American lives on that tragic day. \nWe would and should do what we can in any way, shape, or form to \neliminate al-Qaida's threat to terrorism. I joined the overwhelming \nmajority of the Senate, giving the President the authority and power to \nmove forward on this question as to whether or not we should eliminate \nal-Qaida and its terrorist threat. The fact is, now, as we reflect on \nthat information provided by the administration prior to the invasion \nof Iraq, there is scant information and scant evidence to link Saddam \nHussein and al-Qaida.\n\n  The list goes on. It has raised serious questions about the \nintelligence gathering leading up to the invasion of Iraq and the \nportrayal of that information to the American people. There is nothing \nmore sacred or important in this country than that we have trust in our \nleaders when it comes to the critical questions of national security. \nWhen a President of the United States, with all of his power and all of \nhis authority, stands before the American people and says: I am asking \nyou to provide me your sons, your daughters, your husbands, your wives, \nyour loved ones, to stand in defense of America--that, I think, is the \nmost solemn moment of a Presidency. That is what is being questioned \nnow. Was the information, for example, in the State of the Union \nAddress, accurate in terms of America's intelligence? Two weeks ago the \nPresident conceded at least that sentence was not.\n  What I have asked for in this amendment is that the Bush White House \ncome forward with information on the gathering and use of this \nintelligence. With this information, they will be able to tell us with \nmore detail exactly how the intelligence was used, intelligence related \nto the possession by Iraq of chemical and biological and nuclear \nweapons and locations, the links of the former Iraqi regime to al-\nQaida, the attempts of Iraq to acquire uranium from Africa, the \nattempts of Iraq to procure aluminum tubes for the development of \nnuclear weapons, the possession by Iraq of mobile laboratories for the \nproduction of weapons of mass destruction, and the possession by Iraq \nof delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction, and any other \nmatters that bear on the imminence of the threat from Iraq to the \nnational security of the United States.\n  I go into particular detail in paragraph B of this amendment where it \nrelates to the acquisition of uranium from Africa because I think this \nhas become abundantly clear. Some person or persons in the White House \nwere bound and determined to include language in the President's State \nof the Union Address which was misleading, language which the President \nhas disavowed, language which in fact Director Tenet said should never \nhave been included.\n  When you look at the uranium claims that were made in the President's \nState of the Union Address, and then read the statements made \nafterwards by members of the Bush White House, we can see on their face \nthat we need to know more. Bush Communications Director Dan Bartlett, \ndiscussing the State of the Union Address, said last week that:\n\n       There was no debate or questions with regard to that line \n     when it was signed off on.\n\n  I will tell you point blank that is not factual, based on statements \nmade by Director Tenet.\n  On Friday, July 11 of this year, National Security Adviser \nCondoleezza Rice said there was ``discussion on that specific sentence \nso that it reflected better what the CIA thought.''\n  Miss Rice said, ``Some specifics about amount and place were taken \nout.''\n  Director Tenet said Friday that CIA officials objected and ``the \nlanguage was changed.''\n  White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Monday, July 14, that \nMiss Rice was not referring to the State of the Union speech, but she \nwas, instead, referring to President Bush's October speech given in \nCincinnati--even though Miss Rice was not asked about that speech.\n  We have a situation here where the President and his advisers and \nspeech writers were forewarned in October not to include in a speech in \nCincinnati any reference to the acquisition of uranium by Iraq from the \nnation of Niger or from Africa. That admonition was given to a member \nof the White House staff and that element was deleted from the \nPresident's speech.\n  Now we have statements from the President's National Security Adviser \nsuggesting that there was still some discussion that needed to take \nplace when it came to the State of the Union Address. I will tell you \nthat is not a fact. This amendment which I am offering is asking that \nwe have final clarity on exactly what happened in the White House on \nthis critical piece of information that was part of the President's \nmost important speech of the year, his State of the Union Address.\n  White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer also said on Monday, July \n14, that while the line cut from the October speech in Cincinnati was \nbased on Niger allegations, the State of the Union claim was based on \n``additional reporting from the CIA, separate and apart from Niger, \nnaming other countries where they believed it was possible that Saddam \nwas seeking uranium.''\n  But Fleischer's words yesterday contradicted his assertion a week \nearlier that the State of the Union charge was ``based and predicated \non the yellowcake from Niger.''\n  Consider the confusion and distortions which we have already received \nfrom this administration about that line in the speech, and what it was \nreferring to. That is a clear indication that more information is \nneeded, more clarity is needed. We need from the President leadership \nin clearing this up and, frankly, clearing out those individuals who \nattempted to mislead him in his State of the Union Address.\n  Miss Rice was asked a month ago about the President's State of the \nUnion uranium claim on ABC's ``This Week,'' and here is what she \nreplied:\n\n       The intelligence community did not know at the time or at \n     levels that got to us that there was serious questions about \n     this report.\n\n  But senior administration officials acknowledged over the weekend \nthat Director Tenet argued personally to White House officials, \nincluding Deputy National Security Adviser, Stephen Hadley, who is in \nthe office of Condoleezza Rice, that the allegations should not be used \nin the October Cincinnati speech, 4 months before the State of the \nUnion Address.\n  CIA officials raised doubts about the Niger claims, as Director Tenet \noutlined on July 11, last Friday. The last time was when ``CIA \nofficials reviewing the draft remarks'' of the State of the Union \n``raised several concerns about the fragmentary nature of the \nintelligence with National Security Council colleagues.''\n  Here is what it comes down to. We now have a battle ongoing within \nthe administration over the issue of gathering and use of intelligence. \nThe American people deserve more. They\n\n[[Page S9523]]\n\ndeserve clarity. They deserve the President's disclosure. They deserve \nthe dismissal of those responsible for putting this misleading language \nin the President's State of the Union Address. I think what is at stake \nis more than a little political embarrassment which this administration \nhas faced over the last several days. What is at stake is the gathering \nand use of intelligence for the security of the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n  This issue demonstrates the administration's intelligence-derived \nassertions about Iraq's levels of weapons of mass destruction-related \nactivities raised increased concern about the integrity and use of \nintelligence and literally the credibility of our Government.\n  We now know that when Secretary Colin Powell, the Secretary of State, \nwas to make his address to the United Nations several days after the \nPresident's State of the Union Address, he sat down and, it has been \nreported in U.S. News and World Report, for a lengthy gathering with \nDirector Tenet at CIA headquarters and went through point by point by \npoint to make certain that he would not say anything in New York at the \nUnited Nations which could be easily rebutted by the Iraqis. Secretary \nPowell wanted to be careful that every word that he used in New York \nwas defensible. And one of the first things he tossed out was that \nelement of the President's State of the Union Address which related to \nacquiring uranium from Africa.\n  Secretary Powell took the time and, with the right advisers, reached \nthe right conclusion that certain things being said about Iraq that \nwere being hyped and spun and exaggerated could not be defended. And he \nwas not about to go before the United Nations Security Council and to \nuse that information. He was careful in what he did because he knew \nwhat was at stake was not only his personal credibility but the \ncredibility of the United States. That is why this incident involving \nthe State of the Union Address is so important for us to look into.\n  On the question of weapons of mass destruction, on August 26 of last \nyear, Vice President Cheney said:\n\n       Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now \n     has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt he is \n     amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, \n     and against us.\n\n  On September 26, 2002, the President said:\n\n       The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons.\n\n  On March 17, 2003, President Bush told the Nation:\n\n       Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves \n     no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and \n     conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised.\n\n  On March 30, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, said:\n\n       We know where they are. They're in the area around Tikrit \n     and Baghdad and east, west, south, and north somewhat.\n\n  Not only did the administration tell us that there were over 500 \nsuspected sites Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was even specific as to their \nlocation.\n  Here we are 10 weeks later and 1,000 inspections later with no \nevidence of those weapons of mass destruction.\n  On the al-Qaida connection, last year Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld described evidence about a connection between Iraq and al-\nQaida as ``bulletproof.'' But he did not disclose that the intelligence \ncommunity was, in fact, uncertain about the nature and extent of these \nties.\n  In his speech before the United Nations Security Council on February \n5, 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell said, in addition to the al-\nQaida-affiliated camp run by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in areas not \ncontrolled by the Iraqi regime, two dozen extremists from al-Qaida-\naffiliated organizations were operating freely in Baghdad.\n  The claim of a close connection between the Iraqi regime and al-Qaida \nwas key to the fears that Iraq could team up with terrorists to \nperpetrate another devastating attack on the United States. It is \ncritical that the truth of these assertions be examined in light of \nwhat the United States has found during and after the war.\n  On the issue of reconstituting its nuclear weapons program in \naddition to the dispute about whether Iraq was trying to acquire \nuranium from Africa, the intelligence community was divided about these \naluminum tubes that Iraq purchased and whether they were, in fact, \nintended to develop nuclear devices or only conventional munitions. \nAdministration officials made numerous statements, nevertheless, \nexpressing certainty that these tubes were for a nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly on December \n12, 2003, the President said,\n\n       Iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength \n     aluminum tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon.\n\n  On September 8, 2000, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice said \non CNN's ``Late Edition'' that the tubes ``are only really suited for \nnuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs.''\n  On August 26, Vice President Dick Cheney told the Veterans of Foreign \nWars that ``many of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear \nweapons fairly soon. Just how soon we cannot gauge.''\n  On March 16, the Vice President said:\n\n       We believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons.\n\n  Consider these assertions and these statements leading up to our \ndecision to invade. The hard question which has to be asked is whether \nthe intelligence supported the statements. If the intelligence did not, \nthen in fact we have exaggerated misleading statements which have to be \nmade part of our record.\n  On the question of mobile biological warfare laboratories, Secretary \nof State Powell said in his speech to the United Nations Security \nCouncil that ``we know that Iraq has at least seven of these mobile, \nbiological agent factories.''\n  On May 28, 2003, the CIA posted on its Web site a document it \nprepared with the Defense Intelligence Agency entitled ``Iraqi Mobile \nBiological Warfare Agent Production Plants.'' This report concluded \nthat the two trailers found in Iraq were for biological warfare agent \nproduction, even though other experts and members of the intelligence \ncommunity disagreed with that conclusion, or believe there is not \nenough evidence to back it up. None of these alternative views were \nposted on the CIA's Web page.\n\n  Did this Nation go to war based on flawed, incomplete, exaggerated, \nor misused intelligence?\n  I am a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which \nis conducting this review. I support that review because there is a lot \nwe need to get into. We have oversight responsibilities over the \nintelligence agencies.\n  I commend our Chairman, Senator Roberts, and our ranking member, \nSenator Rockefeller, on that committee. They have requested that the \nInspectors General of the Department of State and the Central \nIntelligence Committee work jointly to investigate the handling and \ncharacterization of the underlying documentation behind the President's \nstatement in the State of the Union Address. I certainly support that \ninvestigation.\n  But the question of how intelligence related to Iraq was used by \npolicymakers is a different question that simply must be determined.\n  What we are saying now is if the Senate, as it did last night, \nrejects the idea of a bipartisan commission to look into the question, \nat the very least we should say in this Department of Defense \nappropriations bill that the President has a responsibility to report \nto Congress on this use of intelligence and information. It really goes \nto the heart of the President's responsibility as the head of our \ncountry and as Commander in Chief. He needs to have people near and \naround him giving him the very best advice based on the best \nintelligence. It is not only good for his administration, but it is \nessential for the protection of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, before the Senator leaves, I wish to \nsay categorically that had I been the Vice President of the United \nStates, based upon the intelligence briefings that I have participated \nin now for over 20 years, I would have made exactly the same statements \nthe Vice President made.\n  I believe sincerely that the record of history shows clearly that \nIraq has tried to acquire and did acquire nuclear capability in the \npast. The Israelis destroyed it once. We know he was trying again to \nreestablish them.\n  There is no question that he had weapons of mass destruction. He used\n\n[[Page S9524]]\n\nthem on the Iranians. He used them on the Kurds. Gas is a weapon of \nmass destruction.\n  There is also no question at all that he had the vehicles to \ntransport weapons of mass destruction. Why did he build the vehicles if \nhe didn't have them?\n  This nit-picking at the language that was used--it was used, we now \nknow, in error in terms of veracity as far as the reliance upon the \nconcept of what the British had because it was later disclosed that one \nof the things they had was a forged document. Why did the United \nNations, 17 times, ask to examine that country to find the weapons of \nmass destruction if the world did not believe he was after weapons of \nmass destruction, after he used them on the Iranians more than 15 years \nago? They bombed the plant that absolutely had the reactor in it. And \nwe knew he had weapons then.\n  I have to say that when we look at what has happened, when our troops \nwent into those barracks after the war commenced, they found that the \nIraqis had special masks to protect them against weapons of mass \ndestruction. We don't have those kinds of weapons.\n  The Senator is a member of the Intelligence Committee. I am reliably \ninformed that at a classified session yesterday he asked CIA Director \nGeorge Tenet the very questions which he has asked on the floor, and he \nreceived the answers. Some of the Members don't like the answers, but \nthey received them. Had Director Tenet took responsibility for a \nmistake in his agency--clearly he had problems about the way that \ndocument was handled and in terms of the speech.\n  This is the third time this has come up now on this bill. This \namendment would fence the Community Management Agency of the CIA, one \nof the most important and vital works of the agency. It would take $50 \nmillion from them.\n  I am not going to do it now, but sometime in the future I am going to \nask the Senator whether he believes that he never had weapons of mass \ndestruction. Does he believe Iraq never had weapons of mass \ndestruction? Does he believe there was no reason to go in there and do \nwhat we did?\n  The problem is this amendment standing alone would deny the following \nprograms funding:\n  Assistant Director of the CIA to allocate their collection efforts \nagainst terrorists and other high-priority target activities. This is \ntheir central community program.\n  Talking about the intelligence community, one of them is the National \nDrug Intelligence Center's Analysis of Information for \nNarcotraffickers--a vital concept that deals with counterterrorism \nactivities.\n  The second is the National Counterintelligence Oversight Analysis \nAssessment of Vulnerabilities to Foreign Intelligence Services.\n  The next is efforts to improve the intelligence community's expertise \nin foreign languages.\n  This was identified as the key unmet need by the joint inquiry that \ninvestigated the 9/11 activities.\n  Each of those programs is essential to our national security.\n  In order to make his point on this concept, the Senator again seeks \nto fence off $50 million for those vital activities. I hope the Senate \nlistens to us about what he is willing to do in order to make this \nstatement again.\n  I shall move to table this amendment. But, again, I have been asked \nthis question many times personally at home by the press and by family \nfriends. Some of us are exposed to intelligence at a very high level of \nGovernment. We can't come out and talk about it.\n  I noticed in the paper yesterday that some of our people because of \nthis issue are starting to ``lip off'' about intelligence matters that \nshould be classified. The Senate and the Congress should come back to \norder on that. We are allowed access to classified information--and to \nhave us, because of some question about one phrase in the President's \nspeech, suddenly decide that classification means nothing, is wrong, \nand it is not in the best interest of the United States.\n\n  Now, Senator Inouye and I have been involved in extremely classified \ninformation for years. As a matter of fact, at our request, there was \nwhat we call a ``tank'' built in our building so we could have those \npeople come visit us and we would not have to go out and visit the CIA \nor the other intelligence agencies. And we do listen to them.\n  Based on everything I have heard--everything I have heard; and the \ntwo of us have shared the chairmanship of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, which is defense intelligence related, since 1981--\neverything I have heard convinces me, without question, that Iraq tried \nto develop a program of weapons of mass destruction, and did, in fact, \nhave weapons of mass destruction. And we were justified--just as the \nIsraelis were over 15 years ago when they went in and bombed one \nplant--we were justified to go in and just absolutely disestablish that \nadministration because it had rebuked the U.N. 17 times in terms of the \nattempt to locate those weapons of mass destruction and to do what \nSaddam Hussein agreed he would do after the Persian Gulf war. He agreed \nto destroy them. He admitted he had them. He agreed to destroy them. \nAnd we tried to prove he destroyed them. Now, what is all this question \nabout whether he had them? Because he admitted he had them.\n  It is time we settle down and get back to the business of providing \nthe money for the men and women in uniform around the world, and to \nensure that the people who conduct our intelligence activities have the \nmoney to do what they have to do.\n  The extended debate on this floor about intelligence activities \nbecause of that one 17- or 16-word--I don't remember--the small phrase \nin the President's State of the Union message is starting to really \nhave an impact on the intelligence-collecting activities of this \ncountry. We do not want to besmirch that. We have the finest \nintelligence service in the world. If someone made a mistake--and now \nit has been admitted there was a mistake; not in whether or not he was \ntrying to put together his nuclear weapons program--the mistake was in \nreference to what the British did have; and it was later found that the \nfoundation for what the British thought they had was a forged document.\n  Intelligence is absolutely essential to a nation that bases its \ncapability to maintain peace on force projection, and we have to rely \non many people to provide us information. Human beings make mistakes. \nGod forbid that anyone would ever say because of one mistake we should \nharness the core efforts of our intelligence efforts and deny them the \nmoney this bill has for them to proceed until this commission, which \nthe Senator wants to create, reports. I cannot believe we would delay \nthe release of these funds for those reasons.\n  The ongoing efforts of the Intelligence Committee are known. The \nSenator is a member of the Intelligence Committee. We who are members \nof the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations have access to everything \nthey have access to, because we manage the money that finances the \nagencies they investigate. So there is a whole series of us here who \nhave access to extremely classified information.\n  We classify it primarily because there are so many people involved \nthat many lives might be in jeopardy if we disclose the sources of that \ninformation or we disclose the impact of that information in terms of \nthe relationship to some of the programs we are funding today.\n\n  I urge the Senate to settle down. I urge the Senate to settle down. \nWe do not need this continued debate about the words in that State of \nthe Union message. That is history, and it is going to be examined in \nterms of politics in the future.\n  Now we had arranged the schedule this morning so we could conduct our \nbusiness and still start the markup of four separate appropriations \nbills. I must be absent now as chairman of the committee for a period \nof time.\n  I move to table the Senator's amendment, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the vote on that occur at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader after consultation with the minority leader. At the time of the \nstacking of votes on this and other amendments, I shall seek approval \nfor a recorded vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nwhat the Senator's intention is regarding the schedule right now after \nthe Senator concludes his remarks?\n\n[[Page S9525]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I have a motion to table. Has the \nmotion to table been accepted by the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nfor that vote be determined by the majority leader after consultation \nwith the minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I reserve the right to object. The Senator \nfrom Illinois is also a member of the Appropriations Committee, but he \nwants to have an opportunity to respond.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do.\n  Mr. REID. He can do it any way he chooses. We are not going to have a \nvote right away, so he can attempt to have the floor. I wonder if the \nSenator from Alaska would--we have no right to object in any way to the \nmotion to table, but the Senator from Illinois has more to say.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection if the Senator wishes to respond. I \nwish to get my motion to table on the record, and I am happy for the \nSenator to speak after that motion in relationship to the amendment. I \nhave no problem with that. I just want to get my part of this business \ndone so I can go chair that committee markup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there an objection to my request that the motion to \ntable vote be postponed until a time certain to be determined by the \nmajority leader after consultation with the minority leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am prepared to yield the floor, and you can talk as \nmuch as you want.\n  Mr. REID. Has the unanimous consent request been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it has not.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The request is agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee leaves the floor, the Senator from Minnesota \nasked a question: What are we going to do now? We have a number of \namendments lined up. We are not going to do those because the two \nmanagers of this bill are members, of course, of the Appropriations \nCommittee, as are Senator Durbin and myself.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  I would be prepared to make a request that after Senator Durbin makes \nhis remarks there be a period for morning business during which the \nSenator from North Dakota may be able to speak for up to 30 minutes on \na matter not related to this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Wyoming \nwishes to speak for 10 minutes, I am told, on the bill itself.\n  Is that right?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes. I was going to follow up on what has been said.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota has no objection to him going \nfirst, he being the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is fine.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nWyoming have 10 minutes to speak on the bill, and following that time, \nthe Senator from North Dakota have 30 minutes as in morning business, \nand following that the Senator from----\n  Mr. DAYTON. Minnesota.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I would like to speak on Senator Durbin's amendment. I \nwould agree to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Could it be that we agree to 30 minutes of debate \npertaining to matters relating to this amendment, notwithstanding the \nmotion to table has been made? Is that agreeable? That will give us \nenough time to get back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Also, Mr. President, if I could, Senator Kennedy is going \nto be here at around 11 o'clock. Of course, that has slipped.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is roughly 11 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. He will offer the next amendment. Perhaps then Senator Byrd \nwill. Really, we are narrowing the number of amendments that are going \nto be offered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I don't know what the Senate would do \nwithout the assistance of the distinguished Democratic whip. We have in \nhistory Light Horse Harry, and this is our ``Heavy Horse'' Harry. He \ndoes the heavy work around here, and we all appreciate him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nagreement, I can assure my colleagues I will not take 30 minutes. I \nwill be extremely brief because I already stated my case in support of \nthis amendment. But I would like to respond to the Senator from Alaska.\n  He and I have had some titanic struggles on this floor over a variety \nof issues, but I have the highest regard and respect for him \npersonally. I am certain he did not mean to suggest nor did he say I \nhave disclosed any classified information in my statement this morning. \nI would not do that, not knowingly. What I have disclosed to the \nSenate, in preparation for a vote on this amendment, has all been a \nmatter of public record and published information.\n  There are many other things I have learned as a member of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee to which I can't make reference, because it is \nclassified and very important, that remain classified. But I don't know \nwhich bill you would go to if you didn't go to the Defense Department \nbill to deal with questions of intelligence. It is one of the few, if \nonly, bills coming before the Senate relating to intelligence \ngathering. We don't have a full blown discussion here about \nappropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency and all the \nintelligence aspects of the Federal Government. It is a carefully \nguarded secret of our Government as to how much is being spent and how \nit is spent. Many people have objected to that over the years. I \nunderstand their objections. I also understand the wisdom that we try \nto keep in confidence exactly what we are doing to gather information \nto protect America. About the only place where we openly discuss the \nfunding of intelligence is in this bill. If you don't come to this \nfloor on this bill to suggest that we can do a better job in gathering \nintelligence to protect America, then, frankly, there is no other \nappropriations bill to which you can turn.\n  I assume you might argue that the Department of Homeland Security, \nour new Department, has some aspects of intelligence. Maybe that \nargument can be made. But the most compelling argument is on this bill, \nthe Department of Defense bill. That is why this amendment is not \nsuperfluous or out of line. This is where the amendment needs to be \noffered because what we are saying is, America is only as safe as the \nmen and women who are protecting it, men and women who are in uniform, \nliterally putting their lives on the line, and men and women working \nfor our Government gathering information so that we can anticipate \nthreats and make certain we protect the people.\n  What I have said in this amendment is we, clearly, know now that in \nthe President's State of the Union Address statements were made which \nthe President has disavowed as not being accurate and which the \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency has said should not have \nbeen included because they were misleading. That is a critical element.\n  We gather across this Rotunda in the House of Representatives once a \nyear, the combined membership of the House and the Senate, the Cabinet, \nthe Supreme Court, the diplomatic corps, to hear the President deliver \nthe State of the Union Address. It is his most important speech of the \nyear. He outlines to the people the accomplishments of our Nation and \nthe challenges we face.\n  This President came before us last January in an atmosphere leading \nup to an invasion of Iraq, a war. I don't think there is any more \nserious undertaking by a government than to say we are going to war. We \nare asking our citizens to put their lives on the line for the security \nof America. The President came to the people with that message.\n  We now know that at least one major part of that message--they say it \nis only 16 words but it was a major part of his message--was not \naccurate.\n  Do I think the President intentionally misled the American people?\n\n[[Page S9526]]\n\nThere is no evidence of that whatsoever. I have not heard a single \nperson say he intentionally misled the American people in making that \nstatement. But I will tell you this, there were people in that White \nHouse who should have known better. They had been warned 4 months \nbefore not to use the same reference in a speech the President was \ngiving in Cincinnati. They had been told by the CIA that \nthe information was not credible, could not be believed, should not be \nstated by the President of the United States, and that section was \nremoved from the President's speech in October.\n\n  Those same people in the White House, bound and determined to put \nthat language in the President's State of the Union Address, put in \nmisleading language which attributed this information not to our \nintelligence, because our intelligence had disavowed it, discredited \nit, said we can't believe it.\n  No, they attributed it to British intelligence. Our people believed \nthe British intelligence had been wrong from the start and yet we \nallowed that to be included in the speech.\n  Across America and around the world, people heard our President say \nthat Iraq was acquiring uranium--or attempting to--from Niger in Africa \nto develop nuclear weapons. That is a serious charge. It is as serious \nas any charge that has been made against Saddam Hussein's regime. \nSomeone in the White House decided they would cut a corner and allow \nthe President to say this by putting in that phrase ``based on British \nintelligence.''\n  I would think the President would be angered over the disservice done \nto him by members of his staff. I would think the President would \nacknowledge the fact that even if Director Tenet could not discourage \nthat member of the White House staff and stop them from putting in that \nlanguage, the President has within his ranks on his staff some person \nwho was willing to spin and hype and exaggerate and cut corners on the \nmost important speech the President delivers in any given year.\n  That is inexcusable. This amendment says that this President will \nreport to Congress on exactly what happened in reference to that State \nof the Union Address, that finally we will know the names of the people \ninvolved, that they will be held accountable for this misconduct which \nhas caused such embarrassment, not just to the President, not just to \nhis party, but to our Nation.\n  We need to be credible in the eyes of the world. When statements such \nas the one made by the President are clearly disavowed by the \nPresident, it affects our credibility.\n  Last night we tried to create an independent bipartisan commission to \nlook into this question in an honest fashion. It was rejected on a \nparty-line vote with every Republican voting against it.\n  Now I have taken the second option. Now we call on the President \nhimself. Harry Truman from Independence, MO, used to say ``the buck \nstops here,'' when it comes to the President. The buck has stopped on \nthe President's desk. The question is, What will he do to establish his \ncredibility, to make certain that the next State of the Union Address \nis one that is credible in the United States and around the world and \nto make sure those people who misused the power of their office to lead \nhim to make those misleading statements are removed once and for all?\n  It is a painful chapter in American history but it is one we cannot \navoid. So long as it is unresolved, there will be a shadow over the \nintelligence gathering and use of this administration. That is not in \nthe best interest of national security. It is not in the best interest \nof the people.\n  We in Congress have our responsibility, as a coequal branch of \nGovernment, to enforce oversight and to make certain that the American \npeople are well served.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Following the custom of alternating back and forth, I am \nprepared to defer to my colleague from Wyoming. I would like to inquire \nas to his intentions to speak.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, my understanding was that I was going to \nhave 10 minutes, then we would go to Senator Conrad, and then the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is correct that the Senator from Wyoming \nhas 10 minutes, to be followed by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Is the consent agreement, as interpreted by the Chair, that \nthe two morning business matters will be completed prior to debate on \nthe motion to table? That seems a little unusual.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is speaking on the \namendment for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I have asked unanimous consent that following the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Wyoming, I might speak on \nthe amendment for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I rise to discuss similarly what our \nfloor leader said a few moments ago in terms of this bill before us. We \nare here to talk about the Defense appropriations. We have gone on now \nfor a couple of days focusing on this matter of uranium from Africa. It \nseems to me that we need to focus on the issue that is before us and \nthat is supporting our troops where they are, the Defense \nappropriations that we have, and probably the most important, certainly \nthe largest appropriations that is before us.\n  I have been listening now for some days and listening to the media, \nthe charge that the 16 words President Bush uttered during his January \nState of the Union have been false. This is what he said:\n\n       The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein \n     recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \n     Africa.\n\n  That is what was said. So we say this may be false because in fact \nthe British Government continues to stand by the assertion even if the \nCIA does not. So what Mr. Bush said about what the British believed was \ntrue in January, and it is still true today. That is what the British \nbelieved.\n  Now do we need to take a look at our intelligence system? Of course, \nthat is very important to us. But anyone who thinks every piece of \nintelligence is going to have certified truthfulness behind it, of \ncourse, is being naive. Because that is not the way things work.\n  It is so clear this is so political that it really is kind of hard to \naccept. In fact, there are ads out now, political ads, assailing the \nPresident's credibility, and they go ahead and quote what the President \nsaid. But interestingly enough, they leave off the words ``the British \ngovernment has learned.''\n  They leave those off. Doesn't this give you some feeling that we are \ntaking this a little more politically than we are anything else? It \nseems to me that is the case. We are here now and this whole matter of \nweapons of mass destruction is an issue we are all concerned about. But \nthis matter of uranium is not the reason we are in Iraq. Saddam Hussein \nused chemical weapons on his own people, his neighbors. Clearly, the \nproduction facilities were making chemical and biological weapons. \nThere is no question about that.\n  In September 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, and Iraq used chemical weapons. \nIn 1988, chemical weapons were used against Iraqi Kurdish, killing \n5,000 Kurds. After Operation Desert Storm, February 18, 1991, in the \nterms of the cease-fire, Iraq accepted the conditions of the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution. That resolution required Iraq to fully \ndisclose and permit the dismantling of the weapons of mass destruction. \nThat did not happen. That is why we are there.\n  This idea of leading us off the track because of the uranium is not \nreally the issue. Should we look at our intelligence system? Of course. \nWe do that constantly. But we don't need to take away the dollars that \nare in this bill for those agencies while we take a look at it. There \nis nothing more important in the world today than to have intelligence.\n  I just think we need to cut through some of the things that have been \ngoing on here and we need to get down to what issues there are that \naffect our defense and the American people and deal with those. \nPolitics is fine, but this is not the place to continuously\n\n[[Page S9527]]\n\nuse items that are obviously just political and try to take away the \ncredibility of the President, which is one of his greatest assets, and \nI understand that. I understand that we are in an election cycle and so \non. I really think it is time to deal with the important issues. We are \nhaving hearings. I think we need to move on and deal with the issues \nbefore us--to continue to clean up the situation in Iraq, look for \npeaceful solutions. That is really what it is all about.\n  I will not take any more time. For a couple of days, I have been \nlistening to this constant recital of the same sort of thing. It seems \nto me it is pretty clear where we are. We are in Iraq for a number of \nreasons, this being a very slight impact on the decisionmaking. What we \nare really intent on doing is getting on with these appropriations \nbills, supporting our military, providing a strong military so we can \ncontinue to do the things we have to do. But this idea of continuing to \ntry to contain an issue and make it something more than it really is \nseems to me to be worn out.\n  I hope we can move forward. We have a lot to do. We need to deal with \nthe issues that are before us. I don't think this particular amendment \nis useful. We already have a system for looking at this. Withholding \nmoney pending a third-party operation simply doesn't make sense. I hope \nwe will table this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I fully concur with my colleague that we need to conclude \nour work on this bill. This is the third day we have been on this \nmatter. There are several hundred billion dollars involved; it is one \nof the most costly measures we consider every year. The majority leader \nsaid we will complete work on the bill tonight. I expect we will do so \nwith that instruction. I am prepared to stay late, as others of my \ncolleagues are, to talk about these issues. I cannot think of anything \nthat is more profoundly important to this country today and to the \nfuture of this Nation and to the world today and to the future of the \nworld than what we are addressing, which is the circumstances that \ncaused the President of the United States to make, as my colleague from \nIllinois said, an onerous and fateful decision to start a war, doing \nsomething that was unprecedented in our Nation's history--to initiate a \nwar against another country, invade another country.\n  Now, there may be other reasons cited for doing so, but under \ninternational law, under the U.N. Charter, of all the reasons cited by \nthe administration for this action, the one that has no credence is the \nthreat of an immediate and urgent attack against the United States by \nweapons of mass destruction with the missile capability to deliver \nthem. That is what was stated and implied on a frequent basis by \nmembers of the administration last fall.\n  This is not about one 16-word inclusion in the President's State of \nthe Union speech, as important as that is. This is about questions, as \nthe Senator from Illinois said, that dictated the actions or influenced \nthe actions of Congress last October in voting to give the President \nthe authority to initiate military action, which the President followed \nthrough on 6 months later, for which we have 145,000 sweltering \nAmericans in Iraq today. I was there 2 weeks ago in 115-degree \ntemperatures. If anything, they are even hotter than that at this point \nin time. Some of those incredibly brave young men and women won't come \nhome to their families and friends alive. They will give the ultimate \nsacrifice on behalf of their country.\n  So these are profound matters. I commend my colleague from Illinois \nfor his careful choice of words and his reasoned approach to these \nmatters, in recognition of his position on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, his restraint in sharing only unclassified information to \nsupport his amendment, which I am proud to support myself.\n  We have tried on this side of the aisle in the last days to strike \nsome bipartisan agreements about how to address matters of disclosure \nof financial expenditures for this military undertaking. We talked with \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee about \nwhere the money is in this bill for the purposes of the ongoing \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The chairman informed us that 2 days ago, in the 2003 supplemental \nappropriations, those funds were provided that are being drawn down for \nthe purpose of conducting these military operations in those two \ncountries and we should expect another supplemental appropriations \nrequest to be forthcoming early in the next calendar year. That same \nday, however, the comptroller for the Department of Defense was quoted \nas saying there remains only $4 billion in that account. Given the \nstatement of the Secretary of Defense to our Senate Armed Services \nCommittee the week before that we are spending, on a monthly basis, \n$4.8 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan combined, it is quite obvious that \nthat $4 billion is going to last them less than another month.\n  So we have tried and we have not been as successful as we should be \nbecause it ought to be transparent to this body exactly what is being \nspent, where it is being spent, and we ought to be appropriating, as \nothers have pointed out--Senator Byrd first and foremost among them--\nthat we ought to be doing this through proper channels.\n  Yesterday, as the Senator from Illinois said, we tried to get an \nagreement for a bipartisan independent commission that would be \nestablished and that would bring, it is my conception, the \ndistinguished senior Americans, those whose credibility and integrity \nand experience and wisdom are unquestioned and would bring forth for \nthe benefit of this body, but most importantly for the benefit of all \nthe American people, what are the facts in these questions that have \nbeen raised and how do they instruct us in terms of the veracity of our \nintelligence information and the veracity of our political leaders.\n  Yesterday there was an editorial in the Washington Post which stated \njust that. It said: ``Wait for the facts.'' It cited the President's \nremarks in his State of the Union Address, the 16-word sentence that \nhas received so much attention. It went on to say:\n\n       If so, that would represent one of several instances in \n     which administration statements on Iraq were stretched to \n     reflect the most aggressive interpretation of the \n     intelligence.\n\n  That, I believe, is a carefully phrased way of saying what I said \nearlier in my remarks. There were several times last fall when the \nimplication was made or the assertion was stated that these weapons of \nmass destruction were not only developed but were poised to be used \nagainst the United States and that they constituted an immediate and \nurgent threat to our national security which, as I said before, both \nunder U.N. charter and international law, is the single legal basis for \nthe United States to invade another country: The threat of imminent \nattack or the actual attack itself.\n  As the most powerful nation in the world, the one that has led the \nway for over the last half century in not starting wars--finishing wars \nsuccessfully, but not starting them--for us to engage in now the first \nof what the President has articulated as the doctrine of preemption, \nwhere we will initiate those wars, we will attack first, in the \njudgment of this Senator is a very unwise course which will dangerously \ndestabilize the world if it becomes the normal practice of nations, \nother than the United States--and we have to expect it will--to launch \nthose kinds of attacks.\n  Last August, before the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Nashville, Vice \nPresident Cheney said:\n\n       There's no doubt that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n\n  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in September in Atlanta said \nthat American intelligence had ``bulletproof'' evidence of links \nbetween al-Qaida and the government of President Saddam Hussein of \nIraq.\n  In each case, officials have offered no details to back up those \nassertions. Mr. Rumsfeld said today doing so would jeopardize the lives \nof spies and dry up sources of information.\n  As was stated by a couple of my colleagues, we have to rely on this \nhidden information which can be alluded to, to prove just about any \npoint anybody wants to make, but we cannot know the facts.\n  In October, the President himself made his argument, quoting an \narticle\n\n[[Page S9528]]\n\nin the Chicago Tribune, for invasion, emphasizing the notion Hussein \ncould strike the United States first and inflict ``massive and sudden \nhorror.''\n  Finally, Secretary Rumsfeld, again testifying before the Armed \nServices Committee, said:\n\n       The United States must act quickly to save tens of \n     thousands of citizens.\n\n  I could go on with illustrations. My point is, we should let the \nfacts speak for themselves. We deserve to know the facts. We deserve \nand must know, for the sake of our national security, whether the \ninformation we received from intelligence agencies was accurate, and we \nneed to know for the sake of our democracy whether the representation \nof those facts by our leaders was accurate.\n  That is the intent of the Durbin amendment. It is the reason it \nshould be approved by this body. It is the reason this body should do \nwhat is right, which is to seek together to know the facts.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for raising these \nimportant issues. I am going to take the first few minutes of my 30 \nminutes to talk on what has been discussed this morning because I think \nit is so important to the country, and then I will turn to another \nsubject.\n  I have not previously spoken on these issues on the floor because my \nprimary responsibility in the Senate is representing the State of North \nDakota, and I have special responsibility for budget issues in my \nposition as ranking member on the Budget Committee and as a senior \nmember of the Finance Committee for matters that relate to Social \nSecurity and Medicare and the financing of the U.S. Government, and, of \ncourse, in my role on the Agriculture Committee dealing with questions \nof agricultural policy. I am not on the committees that deal with \nforeign policy and defense policy.\n  All of us have a responsibility to speak out when we believe the \ncountry is headed in a wrong direction. I believe the President is \ntaking us down a road that is fraught with real danger for the country.\n  The President asked this Congress--the Senate and the House--for \nauthority to launch a preemptive attack on another nation, an attack \nbefore that country had attacked us or attacked any of our allies. In \nfact, Iraq had not engaged in an attack on anyone for more than a \ndecade. The President told us and told the world that they, Iraq, \nrepresented an immediate and imminent threat to America.\n  I personally believe there may be a place for preemptive attack in \nprotecting the American people. I believe if we have clear and \nconvincing evidence that a country represents an imminent threat to our \npeople, we have a right to act first, especially in a world where \nweapons of mass destruction do exist, to prevent catastrophic loss to \nour Nation.\n  When we launch a preemptive attack on another country, we had better \nhave it right. We had better make certain that what we are saying and \ntelling the world is correct. This President and this administration \ntold the world and told this Congress that Iraq had weapons of mass \ndestruction. There were many reasons to believe that statement, but now \nthe harsh reality is, those weapons of mass destruction have not been \nfound. This administration and this President told the Congress and \ntold the world that Iraq was trying to develop a nuclear capability, \nand they gave as their best evidence that Iraq was seeking to buy \nuranium from Niger. That has proved to be wrong.\n  The President told the world and told this Congress that there was a \nclear connection to al-Qaida, and repeatedly we were told the best \nevidence was there was a terrorist camp in Iraq training al-Qaida \noperatives. Now we learn that camp was in a part of Iraq not controlled \nby Saddam Hussein but controlled by the Kurds.\n  The day before yesterday, the President made the most astonishing \nstatement of all. In the Washington Post, the President is quoted as \nsaying that he attacked Iraq because Saddam Hussein would not permit \nthe U.N. weapons inspectors into the country.\n  I do not know if the President was misquoted. I have seen no attempt \nto correct the record. I said nothing about this yesterday because I \nhoped that the White House would say the President was misquoted. There \nhas been no attempt to correct the record.\n  We all know the weapons inspectors of the U.N. were in the country. \nThey were in Iraq. They were going site to site trying to determine if \nthere were weapons of mass destruction, trying to determine if there \nwas a nuclear program underway in that country. For the President to \nnow say he attacked Iraq because they would not permit inspectors \nabsolutely stands the facts on their head. The inspectors were there. \nThe reason the inspectors left is because we were threatening to attack \nIraq. So saying that Saddam Hussein did not permit inspectors in as a \nrationale for war is mighty thin.\n  We have a fundamental problem of the credibility of the Nation. Our \ncountry told the world a set of assertions, one after another, that \nhave proven to be wrong or have proven not to be demonstrably the case. \nThat puts our country's credibility at risk. When we are talking about \nattacking other nations preemptively, as I said in the beginning, we \nbetter make certain we have it right because if we start going around \nthe world attacking countries and cannot prove our assertions that they \nrepresented an imminent threat to us, then I think America is in very \nserious risk of alienating the world community. That is not in our \ninterest.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Durbin had to go to an appropriations meeting, but \nhe asked that I relate to the Senate, and I will do it through the \nSenator from North Dakota--is the Senator from North Dakota aware there \nis a Web site the President has--I am sure the Senator is aware of \nthat; is that right?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Well, I am aware of the fact that there was a part of that \nWeb site that one can no longer get into. ``Behind the Scenes'' is what \nit was entitled. I hold up in front of the Senator now something that \nwas on the Web site that one could go to, but one cannot anymore, \ntalking about how the President prepares the State of the Union \nMessage.\n  It says: Behind the Scenes, State of the Union preparation.\n  And it shows the President with his hands out there. It shows the \nPresident going over his speech word by word.\n  Under this, it says: While working at his desk in the Oval Office, \nPresident Bush reviews the State of the Union address line-by-line, \nword-by-word.\n  I want the Senator from North Dakota to know that Senator Durbin--\nthis is on his behalf but certainly I underline and underscore what he \nwanted to be printed in the Record--we are to a point that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota said we are. It is the credibility of not necessarily \ngoing to war in Iraq, which is certainly part of it, but the \ncredibility of this country in the world. Can the United States of \nAmerica, the great country that it is--can people depend on the word of \nthe President of the United States? And certainly in that they have \ntaken this off the Web site, it indicates that there is certainly a \nproblem with the President going over his speech word-by-word, line-by-\nline.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to the Senator, I have not said anything for weeks \non this issue, but with each passing day I become more concerned about \nthe credibility of our Nation. When a policy is announced of preemptive \nstrike, something we have never done before in our country's history--I \nremember going to grade school and being taught that America never \nattacked first, but if somebody attacked us, we countered and we always \nwon. That was what we were taught growing up. I was proud of it. I was \nproud that America never attacked first.\n\n  Now the world has changed. I would be the first to acknowledge the \nworld has changed. I can see a role for preemptive strike in a world \nwhere weapons of mass destruction do exist in order to prevent \ncatastrophic loss to this country. But we better be very certain before \nwe launch an attack on another nation that that attack is justified and \nthat, in fact, that nation represents an imminent threat because, if we \nstart attacking nations and we cannot prove our assertions, very \nquickly\n\n[[Page S9529]]\n\nthe rest of the world is going to doubt our word, our credibility, and \nour basic goodness as a nation. Now, that is serious business.\n  The fact is, this administration told the world Iraq had weapons of \nmass destruction; that they were trying to develop nuclear capability; \nthat there was a connection to al-Qaida. Each and every one of those \nclaims now is in question. It is not just 16 words in the State of the \nUnion. It is far more serious than that.\n  For the President, the day before yesterday, to compound it by saying \nhe attacked Saddam Hussein because he did not permit U.N. weapons \ninspectors in that country is false on its face. We all know the \nweapons inspectors were there. We all know they were going site to site \ntrying to find weapons of mass destruction. The question of whether or \nnot they were effective or not is another question but to assert to the \nworld that we attacked Iraq because there were not inspectors there, I \nam afraid it makes us look as though we are not very careful with our \nclaims.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Conrad are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Durbin amendment is before us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that it be temporarily laid \naside so that my amendment will be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the use of funds for converting to contractor \n     performance of Department of Defense activities and functions)\n\n       Beginning on page 46, strike line 24 and all that follows \n     through ``: Provided further, That the'' on page 47, line 23, \n     and insert the following:\n       Sec. 8014. (a) None of the funds appropriated by this Act \n     may be used for converting to contractor performance an \n     activity or function of the Department of Defense that, on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, is performed by \n     Department of Defense employees unless the conversion is \n     based on the results of a public-private competition process \n     that--\n       (1) applies the most efficient organization process except \n     to the performance of an activity or function involving 10 or \n     fewer employees (but prohibits any modification, \n     reorganization, division, or other change that is done for \n     the purpose of qualifying the activity or function for such \n     exception);\n       (2) requires a determination regarding whether the offers \n     submitted meet the needs of the Department of Defense with \n     respect to items other than costs, including quality and \n     reliability;\n       (3) provides no advantage to an offeror for a proposal to \n     save costs for the Department of Defense by offering \n     employer-sponsored health insurance benefits to workers to be \n     employed under contract for the performance of such activity \n     or function that are in any respect less beneficial to the \n     workers than the benefits provided for Federal employees \n     under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code; and\n       (4) requires a determination regarding whether, over all \n     performance periods stated in the solicitation of offers for \n     performance of the activity or function, the cost of \n     performance of the activity or function by a contractor would \n     be less costly to the Department of Defense by an amount that \n     equals or exceeds the lesser of (A) 10 percent of the most \n     efficient organization's personnel-related costs for \n     performance of that activity or function by Federal \n     employees, or (B) $10,000,000.\n       (b) The Secretary of Defense may, in the Secretary's \n     discretion, apply the tradeoff source selection public-\n     private competition process under Office of Management and \n     Budget Circular A-76 to the performance of services related \n     to the design, installation, operation, or maintenance of \n     information technology (as defined in section 11101 of title \n     40, United States Code).\n       (c)(1) This section does not apply to a conversion of an \n     activity or function of the Department of Defense to \n     contractor performance if the Secretary of Defense (A) \n     determines in writing that compliance would have a \n     substantial adverse impact on the ability of the Department \n     of Defense to perform its national security missions, and (B) \n     publishes such determination in the Federal Register.\n       (2) This section and subsections (a), (b), and (c) of \n     section 2461 of title 10, United States Code, do not apply \n     with respect to the performance of a commercial or industrial \n     type activity or function that--\n       (A) is on the procurement list established under section 2 \n     of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 47); or\n       (B) is planned to be converted to performance by--\n       (i) a qualified nonprofit agency for the blind or a \n     qualified nonprofit agency for other severely handicapped (as \n     such terms are defined in section 5 of such Act (41 U.S.C. \n     48b); or\n       (ii) a commercial business at least 51 percent of which is \n     owned by an Indian tribe (as defined in section 4(e) of the \n     Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 450b(e))) or a Native Hawaiian Organization (as \n     defined in section 8(a)(15) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 637(a)(15))).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this is an issue which we have \nconsidered a number of different times. I know the manager of the bill \nis familiar with the amendment. I know he is necessarily absent at this \ntime, but he does know the substance of the amendment, and he is \ninvolved in the activities of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I will make a presentation and then engage with him when he returns \nto elaborate and summarize again the reasons and the rationale for this \namendment.\n  I also understand it is both the desire of leadership and the floor \nmanagers to move the process along. I will be glad to work out with the \nmanagers of the bill a time for the Members to consider this amendment \nin a timely way.\n  Basically, this is the issue. I will go through it in more careful \ndetail in just a few moments.\n  In 1993, we had approximately 1 million Federal employees. It has \nbeen the desire and the plan of this administration in the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears to see that the number of Federal employees is reduced \ndramatically and that there be outsourcing.\n  The amendment which we are proposing today follows and embraces the \nCommercial Activities Panel recommendations on outsourcing so that it \nwill be fair to employees and fair to the taxpayers. This is an \nexcellent report that was made up of contractors and other \ndistinguished panel members. It was recommended in the Defense \nAuthorization Act of 2001. The panel adopted as its mission to improve \nthe current sourcing framework and process so that they reflect the \nbalance among taxpayers' interests, Government needs, employee rights, \nand contractor concerns.\n  That is what this panel recommended.\n  The administration has been selective in part of the recommendations \nthis panel has taken.\n  This amendment would include the two principal recommendations which \nthe current administration has refused to include. They are included on \npage 50 of the Commercial Activities Panel. I will describe them in \ngreater detail. But the sum and substance of this amendment is \neffectively to follow the recommendations that were made in a \nnonpartisan way which is going to ensure we are going to get the best \nfor the taxpayer dollar and treat the Federal employees fairly.\n  The current administration has carefully eliminated two very \nimportant protections the panel recommended. This amendment \nincorporates those two recommendations in the administration's \nconsideration for the outsourcing which will, if accepted, ensure that \nas the administration is considering the most efficient way to get the \nmost efficient result as a result of contract competition we will carry \nforward the mission, in this case, of the Federal employees and the \ntaxpayers.\n  That is what I think we ought to try to do. We ought to do what is \nfair to the taxpayer and to the employees. The current system does not. \nThis amendment will.\n  Of the Federal employees that we are talking about, 40 percent are \nveterans. At the current time, 9,000 of these workers have been \nactivated. A great many of them are over in Iraq. This is a wonderful \nset of circumstances.\n\n[[Page S9530]]\n\n  While on the floor of the Senate, we say we care about our service \nmen and women in Iraq, and we have several thousand of them over in \nIraq who happen to be Federal employees. Forty percent of the Federal \nemployees are veterans, and we are about to do them short shrift, if we \ndo not accept the amendment which I offer. I think that is something \nwhich would be unworthy of this body at any time and would be unworthy \nof this body at this particular time.\n\n  The Office of Management and Budget put in place this year the most \nsweeping changes in rules on outsourcing of Government work in half a \ncentury. These rules contain no requirement for fair competition that \nwould enable the Government employees an opportunity to demonstrate \nthat they can do the work more effectively and for lower cost than \nprivate contractors.\n  Now the administration wants to use these new rules to privatize at \nleast 225,000 Department of Defense civilian jobs in the years ahead. \nThat is too much work, too many jobs, and too much of our national \nsecurity to contract out without fair competition.\n  As I mentioned, nearly 40 percent of the civilian employees in the \nDepartment of Defense are veterans who served this Nation proudly. More \nthan 8,000 are activated reservists serving in Iraq and other parts of \nthe world defending our Nation. We owe it to these patriotic Americans \nnot to privatize their jobs without fair competition.\n  At a time when we are spending $4 billion a month in ongoing \noperations in Iraq, we should ensure the taxpayers are getting the best \nvalue for their money. Yet one of the most significant parts of the \nadministration's proposal for the Department allows so-called \n``streamlined'' competition for activities involving 65 or fewer \nemployees. The streamlined rules emphasize speed in privatizing Federal \njobs at the expense of quality and cost. The process must be finished \nin 90 days. The rules eliminate important fair competition \nrequirements.\n  Federal employees are at a competitive disadvantage because the rules \ndo not allow them to submit their best bids known as the ``most \nefficient organization'' plans. That is in contrast to the \nrecommendation. They effectively prohibit Federal employees from being \nable to submit their best bid.\n  The rules also eliminate the guarantee of cost savings because they \nfail to require contractors to show appreciable savings by privatizing \nthe work.\n  That is why I offer this amendment today, to ensure that no funds are \nspent on contracting out Defense Department jobs without fair \ncompetition. This amendment is about fair competition.\n  Federal employees must be allowed to offer their best bids. \nCompetition must take into account both the cost savings and the \nquality. And the health care costs for employees cannot be a deciding \nfactor because Federal employees would obviously be at a disadvantage, \nand contractors would have an incentive to deny health benefits at all.\n  There are companies that do not provide the health care benefits. If \nthey are in competition with the Federal employers who do provide it, \nit obviously skews it in favor of the private companies. We do not want \nto use the competition, in terms of Government contracts, to encourage \nemployers to drop their health insurance for their employees. That \ncertainly would be counterproductive in terms of all of the challenges \nwe are facing in the health care area. Under this amendment they are \nnot disadvantaged, therefore, by providing the health benefits to the \nFederal employees.\n  This amendment in no way prevents public-private competition. It is a \nmoderate approach to ensure that competition is fair and leads to cost \nsavings.\n  The Commercial Activities Panel, the group charged with reviewing \noutsourcing policies, has recommended that any replacement for the \ncurrent competition process should include ``the right of employees to \nbase their proposal on a more efficient organization, rather than the \nstatus quo.'' This is their second recommendation under section 4, on \npage 50:\n\n       [T]he right of employees to base their proposal on a more \n     efficient organization, rather than the status quo.\n\n  That particular recommendation is eliminated, which obviously \ndisadvantages the Federal employees in terms of the competition.\n  The panel, comprised largely of contractor and administration \nrepresentatives, made no exception for functions involving 65 or fewer \nemployees. This is just a figure that was drawn by the administration.\n  The Commercial Activities Panel also recommended that any replacement \nin the current competition process should include a minimum cost \ndifferential, which requires the private contractor to be at least 10 \npercent or $10 million more efficient than the Federal Government.\n  Without the minimum cost differential, a private contractor could be \njudged just a few dollars more efficient and take the work away from \nthe Federal employees. Taxpayers would actually lose money on such a \ncontract because of the significant costs of conducting the \ncompetition, shifting the work to the private sector, and administering \nthe Government's role in the contract. Unless the private sector can \nshow a significant reduction in the cost, it makes no sense to \nprivatize the work.\n  That has been thoroughly reviewed in this panel, and yet their \nrecommendations on the 10 percent or $10 million requirements are \neffectively eliminated. This panel reviewed the various minimum \nstandards that ought to be included and made their recommendations, but \nthe administration has effectively eliminated those. This amendment, \nagain, embraces their overall recommendations.\n  On the issue of health care costs, the amendment would reduce the \nperverse incentive for contractors to provide inferior health care \nbenefits to the employees. The amendment would require the Defense \nDepartment to determine the average cost of health insurance for a \nFederal employee, which remains the same each calendar year for each \nemployee.\n  If the health care costs for Federal employees and private \ncontractors are the same or the contractor's contribution is in excess \nof the standard established by Congress for the Federal workforce, then \nthe provision will have no effect. But if the contractor's contribution \nis less than the Federal standard, the contractor cannot receive an \nunfair advantage in the cost comparison process.\n\n  This provision addresses a bipartisan concern about inferior or \nnonexistent health insurance coverage for employees, particularly for \nthose who perform the Federal Government's work.\n  At a time when we are more concerned than ever about homeland \ndefense, these OMB rules give an unfair advantage to private \ncontractors who have little accountability. Yet critical aspects of our \nnational security could be privatized.\n  The repair of planes, ships, and tanks, and the storage and \ndistribution of vital weapons and supplies can be contracted out under \nthese rules. We all know what a disaster it was when the private \ncompanies screened bags at our airports. Now Federal workers are doing \nthe job better and Americans are feeling safer.\n  Today, there is far too little real competition for contracts to \nprovide goods and services to Federal agencies. We should be getting \nthe most out of every taxpayer dollar. But less--listen to this--less \nthan 1 percent of Department of Defense service contracts today are \nsubject to full public-private competition.\n  Adoption of this amendment will lead to a better and more efficient \nprocurement policy for the Department of Defense. No jobs would be \noutsourced without an analysis showing cost savings. Government \nprocurement should be based on what is best for taxpayers and national \ndefense and national security. The amendment will produce real savings \nfor the taxpayers and more reliable equipment for our courageous men \nand women in uniform.\n  We face great challenges to the Nation's security in these difficult \ntimes. More than ever, we rely on the Department of Defense, its \ndedicated members of our Armed Forces, and its dedicated civilian \nemployees. We owe it to all of them to see that any competition process \ntreats them fairly.\n  Let's not spend money on outsourcing that results from unfair \ncompetition and produces inefficient results. Public-private \ncompetition\n\n[[Page S9531]]\n\nshould be fair to Federal employees. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kennedy \namendment. A-76 is a program that was implemented by the Government \nseveral years ago to try to make sure that contracts let in the public \nand the private sector are actually saving money. Are the taxpayers \ngetting the best bang for the buck that was intended at the time the \ncontracts were let?\n  Folks in the public sector have never minded competing with the \nprivate sector for any type of public contract. The problem with A-76 \nis, when they go back and review those contracts that have been let, it \nseems they always go review the contracts that were awarded to the \npublic sector and they never go to the contracts that were awarded to \nthe private sector.\n  If A-76 is going to be fairly applied to the public sector, it ought \nto be applied to the private sector. That is simply not the way A-76 \nhas worked over the years.\n  I complained about the previous administration on this issue, I \ncomplain to the current administration on this issue, and we have \nsimply seen no change in the policy with respect to A-76.\n  Competition is what makes our country go round and round in the \nbusiness community. Nobody minds competing if they are in business for \nthe right reason. And when it comes, in my case, to the instances where \nI have the most experience--in the public depots--we have never minded \ncompeting with the private sector for a contract when it comes to \nrepair or improvement of our military weapons systems. But every time \nwe get awarded a public contract, it seems that 1 year, 2 years, or 3 \nyears out, all of a sudden we are seeing an A-76 that is submitted and \nthe folks come in and review the contract that has been awarded to the \npublic depot, while, on the other side of that coin, the dozens and \ndozens and dozens and billions of dollars in contracts that are awarded \nto the private sector are never subject to the A-76 review.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment goes a long way toward righting that \nwrong. I support that amendment. I support making competition open, \nmaking competition fair between the public sector and the private \nsector. And if the administration is not going to take the initiative \nto do that, and make sure that is the fact of the matter in contracts \nthat are awarded to the public sector, then this is the type of action \nwe have to take.\n  I support the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, can \noffer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. What is the pending business at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kennedy amendment has been set aside in \norder for the Senator from Wisconsin to present an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1279\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1279.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate on a report on the detention \n and April 11, 2003, escape in Yemen of the suspects in the attack on \n                            the U.S.S. Cole)\n\n       Insert after section 8123 the following:\n       Sec. 8124. It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of \n     Central Intelligence and taking into account limitations \n     connected with ongoing legal proceedings, submit to Congress \n     a report on the circumstances surrounding the detention and \n     April 11, 2003, escape in Yemen of the suspects in the attack \n     on the U.S.S. Cole; and\n       (2) the report should--\n       (A) describe the efforts undertaken by the United States \n     Government to investigate security at the Yemen detention \n     facility holding individuals suspected of being involved in \n     the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, including information on when \n     such efforts were undertaken;\n       (B) describe the efforts undertaken by the United States \n     Government to monitor the status of such individuals \n     throughout their detention and to question such individuals \n     about their relationship to al Qaeda and their involvement in \n     the attack on the U.S.S. Cole; and\n       (C) describe the efforts undertaken by the United States to \n     determine how the escape occurred and to determine who was \n     involved in aiding and abetting the escape.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise today to offer an amendment directly relevant to \nthe most important national security priority before this country \ntoday. That, of course, is the fight against international terrorist \nnetworks that have murdered Americans.\n  We have heard a good deal recently about some questionable assertions \nmade by the administration in the lead-up to the military action in \nIraq. We still have not satisfactorily resolved concerns that I and \nsome of my colleagues raised in the lead-up to the war in Iraq that I \nreferred to and have referred to for almost a year as the ``ever \nshifting justifications for United States action in Iraq.''\n  Congress is right to keep asking questions. The American people are \nright to demand answers. They deserve a complete and public accounting \nof how a piece of intelligence that was removed from a Presidential \nspeech last fall because of doubts of its veracity then found its way \ninto this year's State of the Union Address.\n  I rise to point out the administration's shifting justifications and \nflawed intelligence are not the only problems. There is another \nproblem, and I argue it is as alarming or even more alarming. The \nproblem is while all of this was underway--that is, the Iraq \nactivities--while we were hearing less-than-accurate information as \npart of the administration's hard sell, we may well have been dropping \nthe ball when it comes to addressing the most urgent threat to our \nnational security; that is, combating the al-Qaida terrorist network \nand other international terrorist networks of global reach.\n  Of course, the horror of September 11, 2001 is seared into the memory \nof all Americans, but there have been other horrors: The African \nembassy bombings of 1998 and, yes, there was the attack on the USS Cole \nin Yemen. On October 12, 2002, the USS Navy destroyer Cole was attacked \nby a small boat laden with explosive during a brief refueling stop in \nthe harbor of Aden, Yemen. The attack killed 17 members of the ship's \ncrew, including a sailor from my home State of Wisconsin, and wounded \n39 others. The evidence clearly indicates al-Qaida was responsible for \nthe attack on USS Cole.\n  However, how many people know on April 11, 2003, just a few months \nago, 10 men suspected of involvement in the Cole bombing escaped from a \nprison building in Aden, Yemen? How many people have heard about that? \nIt is not only the basic information that has been in short supply; \nexplanations for this escape of these al-Qaida suspects is also hard to \ncome by.\n  In early May, the Yemeni foreign minister suggests in remarks made to \nthe BBC that ``part of the problem is the long period of time during \nwhich they [the suspects] were held.'' The Yemeni government called for \nsending them to court, but Washington also asked for postponement until \nthe conclusion of its investigations into the Cole explosion or the \nfile of terrorism in general.\n  The comments continue: ``Incidents like this happen, especially when \nprisoners spend a long time in one place and guards become reassured \nthat the prisoners have become used to prison and will not escape.''\n  This Yemeni statement suggests the U.S. Government was certainly \naware of the detainees and involved in the issue. That is, of course, \nsomething we\n\n[[Page S9532]]\n\nwould expect in this case, about people who were in prison in Yemen \nwhom we knew to be the likely people involved in the bombing of our USS \nCole.\n\n  On May 15, the Justice Department unveiled a 51-count indictment \nagainst two of the escapees, Jamal al-Badawi and Fahd al-Qusaa. The two \nwere indicted on various terror offenses, including murder of United \nStates nationals and murder of United States military personnel. The \nindictment said Badawi was recruited by senior members of Osama bin \nLaden's inner circle and he bought the attack boat in Saudi Arabia and \nobtained the trailer and truck used to tow the boat to Aden harbor. The \npress conference at which the indictments were announced underscored \nthe seriousness of this matter. Obviously, given the press conference \nheld by the administration official, this is not a small or a marginal \nissue.\n  We are talking here about the escape of operatives of Osama bin \nLaden. We are talking about people here who murdered 17 Americans. \nFighting those forces, the forces of al-Qaida, must be our first \npriority.\n  When I wrote to the State Department and the Justice Department to \ngain some answers about just what happened here, I have to tell my \ncolleagues, the answers were not satisfying in the least. In fact, a \nnumber of questions remain.\n  What were the circumstances surrounding the detention of the \nsuspects? Where were they held? Were they moved? Where were they moved? \nWhat steps did the administration take to ensure the United States was \nfamiliar with the status of people suspected of involvement in a \nterrorist attack on our sailors? Did anyone representing the United \nStates Government ever question these suspects? Did anyone ever visit \nthe facility where they were being held? Did anyone even bother to \nvisit the facility after the escape to try to understand how they \nescaped? Was the U.S. Government involved in any way in monitoring \nthese detainees prior to their escape?\n  Again, I am talking about al-Qaida operatives. The indictment of \nJamal al-Badawi indicates he was recruited by members of Osama bin \nLaden's inner circle. If he was a known al-Qaida operative, why didn't \nthe United States take steps to monitor the detention facility where he \nwas held? What do we know about the circumstances surrounding their \nescape? What kind of help did they have? Do the facts tell us anything \nabout whether the decisions to facilitate the escape were taken only at \na low level or were they taken at a higher level? If these escapees had \nhelp, what happened to the people who helped them? What does the U.S. \nGovernment know about these people and about what they are doing now? \nWhat steps have we taken to urge that those people be held accountable \nfor their actions? What steps are currently being taken to find and \ndetain the escapees? What steps are being taken to ensure they do not \nreach United States soil?\n  It is not unreasonable to expect answers to these questions. My very \nmodest amendment simply expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nadministration should provide them in the form of a report on this \nincident. If such a report needs to come in a classified format, I \nunderstand that, of course, and that is fine. What is not fine, though, \nis the prospect of letting this issue go unexamined. This escape \noccurred just as our brave troops were entering Baghdad, at least in \npart, in the name of stopping the threat of terrorism.\n  We cannot afford to be easily distracted, incapable of focusing on a \nglobal effort to stop terrorists because of our intense focus on other \nissues with only a nebulous connection to this most important priority \nof stopping international terrorist networks. I fear we have wondered \nfar afield from the urgent task at hand. I am troubled that the same \nadministration that was recklessly threading together any and all \njustifications for a war with Iraq a few months ago may have at the \nsame time been complacent about the status of the USS Cole attackers.\n  This past Sunday on Meet the Press, Secretary Rumsfeld suggested that \nfinding Saddam Hussein was more important in terms of providing, in his \nwords, ``closure'' than finding Osama bin Laden. I know the al-Qaida \nnetwork consists of far more than one man, but I fear the Secretary's \nremarks are emblematic of the problem. First and foremost, I believe \nthe American people want to defeat the forces that attacked us. But \nthis administration is leading us in some unrelated directions. We \nshould be focused on stopping al-Qaida, stopping other terrorist \nnetworks, and denying terrorists access to resources, opportunities, \nand safe havens.\n\n  We all deserve to know what happened with this escape. All of us \nshould join together in determining what lessons we can learn from this \nincident and what it tells us about where we have been placing our \nnational security focus and priorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I intend to withdraw the amendment at this time, but we will \ncertainly be revisiting this issue. I hope the administration will hear \nthose words and respond to the need for the answers to these questions. \nThe legislative option certainly remains available on other, perhaps \nmore appropriate, vehicles. But given my inability to get answers to \nthese questions thus far, I believe it is necessary to begin the \nprocess of raising this matter in the legislative process itself.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1279 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I ask at this time to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield to my colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was speaking on the floor the other day \nabout a statement on President Bush's Web site. I read from that one \nsite. I had been told earlier that part of the Web site was no longer \navailable to the public. Since that time, I have been advised that is \nnot true. If that were the case, I would want that stricken from the \nRecord. I would, however, say that doesn't take away from the fact part \nof the President's Web site indicates that he reads every word of his \nspeeches, especially his State of the Union speeches, and works on it \non a word-by-word basis.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, we are currently debating the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  I wanted to call to the attention of my colleagues reports in the \nmedia this morning that the new U.S. military commander in Iraq has \nacknowledged now for the very first time that American troops are \nengaged in what he calls a ``classical guerrilla-style war'' against \nthe remnants of the former Iraq President Saddam Hussein's Baath Party. \nHe acknowledges that the attacks are growing in organization and \nsophistication.\n  These statements by Army GEN John Abizaid in his first Pentagon \nbriefing since taking charge of the U.S. Central Command last week are \nin stunning and sharp contrast with earlier statements from Defense \nSecretary Donald Rumsfeld. It was only 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago that Secretary \nRumsfeld insisted that the U.S. military was not involved in a \nguerrilla war. As Secretary Rumsfeld said as recently as Sunday on ABC \nNews, the fighting in Iraq did not fit the definition of a guerrilla \nwar.\n  I think it is important that the American public and we in the Senate \nacknowledge the circumstances that our troops now find themselves in a \nnear unilateral circumstance because of the unwillingness or the \ninability of this administration to attract an international coalition \nfor the aftermath of the Iraqi war.\n  Now it was also reported yesterday yet another American was killed in \na rocket-propelled grenade attack, making him the 33rd U.S. soldier \nkilled since President Bush declared major combat over, and the seventh \nsoldier killed since President Bush, 2 weeks ago, said ``bring 'em on'' \nto the Iraqi militants. In addition, the pro-American mayor of an Iraqi \ncity was also assassinated.\n  Minnesota Public Radio this week quoted Mary Kewatt, the aunt of a \nsoldier killed in Iraq, saying:\n\n\n[[Page S9533]]\n\n\n       President Bush made a comment a week ago, and he said \n     ``bring it on.'' Well, they brought it on, and now my nephew \n     is dead.\n\n  Our Nation would be better served, and the security of our troops \nwould be better served, if our President would spend less time trying \nto look and sound like a grade-B movie cowboy and a little more time \nproviding some leadership to internationalize this situation in Iraq, \nand to give our troops some notion of when they are coming home.\n  I have to believe if President Bush had his two daughters in service \nto the military in Iraq, and his family's blood was on the line--as are \nthousands of American families', including thousands of America's \ndaughters whose lives are also at risk--he may have thought twice \nbefore goading the Iraqi guerrilla war fighters to take another shot at \nAmerica's military's finest in that country.\n  So we find ourselves now in a circumstance where we have morale \nproblems reported because our troops have no idea when they are coming \nhome. We now have an indication that there are few troops readily \navailable to sustain a force of the 148,000 we have in Iraq.\n  The Army has 33 Active Duty combat brigades. There are now 16 in \nIraq, two in Afghanistan, two in South Korea, and most of the rest are \neither committed to other missions or reconstituting, leaving just \nthree brigades to send to Iraq as replacement forces.\n  The recruitment of multinational forces has been largely a failure \nbecause of the administration's insistence that everything be run \nthrough the United States rather than through the United Nations or \nNATO.\n  The Army indicates they are likely to activate two or more enhanced \nNational Guard brigades by the beginning of next year for rotation to \nIraq by March or April. And I quote: ``Every possible unit worldwide is \nbeing considered for the possible rotations.''\n  It is troubling that we continue not to see a long-term strategy that \nis international in nature. We continue to see the blood being the \nblood, almost exclusively, of American troops. We see the financial \ncost as being almost exclusively the burden of American taxpayers, as \nwe are being told now the expenditures will run easily $4 billion per \nmonth for as far as the eye can see.\n  To put that in some perspective, we are not able to fully fund the VA \nhealth care program for the entire year for all of the veterans of our \nNation who have served our country because we cannot find the $2 \nbillion for the entire year, but we are spending $4 billion in a month \nin Iraq. We cannot fund our schools; we cannot fund our prescription \ndrug program at a decent level.\n  So I think people have to wonder, How long will this go on? We cannot \ncut and run. The decision has been made. We are there. The world is a \nbetter place without Saddam Hussein, there is no question about that. \nBut we do have to wonder why it is the United States should have to \nserve as a unilateral police force for the world, why the \nadministration has not found ways to internationalize this issue, given \nthe good will that was extended to us from allies all around the world \npost 9/11. That seems now to have been badly eroded.\n\n  So I hope our President will spend a little more time on \ninternational diplomacy, a little more time rethinking his budget \npriorities, a little less time posing for photo opportunities and \ntrying to sound like a tough guy, when, at the time, it is our young \nmen and women whose lives are at great risk, and will be at great risk \non and on and on into the future if things do not change soon.\n  We can take great pride in the courage, the professionalism, the \nskill of our American military. They are second to none. They are the \nfinest military in the world. But these unending deployments are going \nto cause great morale problems, are going to cause problems with \nrecruitment and retention of our military. It is making a shambles of \ntoo many of their families' lives and their businesses.\n  We need to find a way so that it is not the United States that has to \ncarry single-handedly this kind of burden on into a limitless future. I \nthink the circumstances we find ourselves in now are testimony to, \nfrankly, inadequate planning, unrealistic planning about what was, in \nfact, going to occur after the major military portion of the attacks in \nIraq. Somehow there were these naive notions that the expatriates from \nIraq would step in, we would decapitate the leadership, and all would \ngo on well and easily. That is not the case. Now we find ourselves in a \nfull-blown guerrilla war. The United States is in up to its neck now.\n  We owe tremendous gratitude to our soldiers who are fighting in these \ncircumstances. We need to find a way, this administration needs to find \na way so we do not find this lasting forever, that our taxpayers wind \nup being drained, that families all across this country wind up going \nthrough such tremendous emotional and other hardships, as we find \nourselves virtually exclusively out on our own on the front lines in \nthis very difficult part of the world.\n  So as Prime Minister Blair comes to visit with us later on this \nafternoon, I am hopeful perhaps this will be the beginning of a more \nrealistic assessment on the part of the Bush administration about what, \nin fact, will have to come next. And what will have to come next will \nhave to be an international alliance, not the exclusive energy and \nbudget and blood of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from South Dakota leaves \nthe floor, I want to make everyone aware of the fact that Senator \nJohnson and his wife Barbara have a son, as we speak, in the United \nStates Army. In 5 years, this young man has been to war four times. So \na lot of people could come to the floor and speak as Senator Johnson \nhas spoken and not have the credibility or the foundation or the \nunderstanding he has. But he and his dear wife have spent many a \nworried hour wondering if their son was going to come home.\n  So I applaud my friend, the distinguished junior Senator from South \nDakota, who is such a fine Member of the Senate, for yesterday and \ntoday coming in and giving the Senate the benefit of his thoughts, \nthoughts no one can render but for having had a son in harm's way as a \nresult of being in the United States military.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, to follow up on the comments of the \nSenator from South Dakota, he alluded to the presence of over 100,000 \nUnited States troops in Iraq. As it turns out, if you look across the \nglobe today, we have United States forces stretched around the world in \nplaces and numbers we have not seen for a long time--not only Iraq but \nAfghanistan, Bosnia, Korea, Japan, Germany, and many other places.\n  We support the deployment of those military personnel through a \ncombination of sealift and airlift. When I served on active duty during \nthe Vietnam war, we were fortunate in having so many more overseas \nbases from which we could forward deploy or resupply. Many of those \nbases are closed today, and we rely instead on a mixture of different \nkinds of aircraft, military and civilian, and on sealift, a variety of \nships to serve as a bridge, a sea bridge or an air bridge, to connect \nthis country to our troops deployed around the world.\n  The air bridge is changing. In this country we are seeing the \nretirement of an older aircraft built in the 1960s. The C-141 is being \nretired. It is being replaced by a newer aircraft, a very good aircraft \ncalled the C-17. To date, we have received about 100 of those new cargo \naircraft and about another 80 have been placed on order and will be \ncoming into the fleet in the coming years. We have as part of that air \nbridge C-5s, perhaps the largest cargo aircraft in the world, 74 C-5As \nbuilt in the 1970s, about 50 C-5Bs built in the 1980s. A third part of \nthis air bridge is the C-130. We have them in the Delaware Air National \nGuard, and they are in air guards throughout the United States. But it \nis really those three aircraft--the C-5, C-17, the C-130s--that enable \nus to resupply our troops and to move our men, women, materiel, and \nweaponry around the globe.\n  The C-5 carries enormous amounts of cargo, roughly twice the amount \nof a C-17, at distances roughly twice the distance of a C-17, even more \ncargo than a C-130 and greater distances than the C-130. The C-5s have \nbeen used in the Iraqi war and Afghanistan to move\n\n[[Page S9534]]\n\nmen, women, and materiel, equipment, from the United States into \ntheaters. And the movement of those personnel and that equipment within \ntheater has fallen largely to C-17s and to C-130s.\n  I wish I could stand here today and say the combination of ships we \nhave in our sealift capability and aircraft as part of our air bridge \nis sufficient to meet our needs. Our sealift capability is inadequate. \nOur airlift capability is in even worse shape.\n  I have an article--this is a June 2 edition of Air Force magazine--\nwhere they talk a good deal about the squeeze on air mobility--not just \nmy words but the words of the top people in military airlift in the Air \nForce who cite examples of how our inability to move as much personnel, \nas much equipment as we sought made it difficult in some cases for us \nto implement our game plan in that part of the world. If the current \nassets, especially the current air assets we have within the Air Force, \nare insufficient to provide sufficient airlift, what might be \nsufficient?\n  Every so often, the Air Force is asked or directed to do another \nupdate to look at their assets and what we expect to be the need for \nairlift in the years to come and to tell us and the administration what \ntheir needs are. We need a new analysis and we need an update.\n  My hope is the language in the Defense bill, the authorization bill \nwhich is now in conference--that out of that conference will come clear \ndirection for the Air Force, authorization for the Air Force to update \nthat last study which is called MRS-05, out of that update will flow a \ngood deal of the information we need.\n\n  We don't need another study or another analysis to tell us that the \nresources we have on the airlift side are woefully inadequate. The \nanswer is more, not less. A critical question for us in this body, \nespecially as we face a budget deficit this year of $450 billion, is \nhow do we go about meeting our woefully inadequate airlift capability, \nhow do we do that in a way that is cost-effective and in a way that \nrecognizes that we have these huge deficits and that as far as the eye \ncan see they continue. I want to talk about that.\n  I would like to talk for the next several minutes about a cost-\neffective airlift, and then later today Senator Biden and I, along with \nSenator Chambliss and others, will offer an amendment that we believe \naddresses in good faith how we might make some progress on that front \ntoday.\n  There are some who would like to take our C-5s, the fleet--there are \n74 C-5As and 50 C-5Bs--some would like to get rid of all the C-5As, \nsend them to the boneyard and let that be that. They have some interest \nin upgrading or modernizing the C-5Bs but less interest in doing \nanything for the C-5As.\n  As it turns out, we are going to be flying C-5As and C-5Bs for a good \nlong while, probably for the remainder of this decade on both As and Bs \nand, for Bs, well beyond that; even programs for As well beyond this \ndecade. There has been a lot of debate in this Chamber in the last \ncouple years on how we might upgrade the capability of the C-5 to make \nit more mission capable.\n  The Air Force pays a lot of attention to a number called the mission \ncapable rate for aircraft. The mission capable rate for the new C-17 is \nin the mid 80s--it does a really fine job--the mission capable rate \nover the last 12 months for the C-5As, about 60 percent; the mission \ncapable rate for the C-5Bs over the last 12 months, 72 percent. Two \nupgrades have been proposed to both aircraft. One of those upgrades is \nfairly inexpensive, the second expensive.\n  The less expensive upgrade is the Avionics Modernization Program. The \nAvionics Modernization Program would enable us to take a 1970s cockpit \nof a C-5A or a 1980s cockpit of a C-5B and turn it into a 21st century \ncockpit. Not only would it look different, the plane would fly \ndifferently, would be controlled differently. The communication gear \nwould become 21st century communications equipment. Its reliability and \neffectiveness would be enhanced as would that of the crew--new \ntraining, avoidance equipment, the ability to actually fly at very \naccurate levels of altitude to enable us to get the maximum advantage \nout of the airspace in the skies in which we fly.\n  The avionics modernization package costs about $3 million per \naircraft. Between fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the Congress authorized \nand appropriated money to install the avionics modernization package in \na total of 10 C-5 aircraft. This year, in the fiscal year 2004 \nauthorization bill, there was an authorization for 30 additional kits, \nfor the cockpits, communications systems, and all. In this bill, there \nis money appropriated for 18.\n  Let's go back. I talked about the number of C-5s we have: 74 C-5As, \n50 C-5Bs. The Air Force is in the process of retiring 14 of the least \ndependable C-5As, the ones that are least mission capable, that create \nthe most maintenance headaches. So we will end up with 60 C-5As and 50 \nC-5Bs later this year or next. The Air Force would like to see their C-\n5s AMPed, or fully equipped with this new upgrade, the avionics \nmodernization package, by fiscal 2007. In order for us to meet that \nschedule, we need to appropriate not AMP kits for 18 C-5As in 2004 but \nfor 30 to get us back on schedule. That 30, plus the original 10, will \ntake us to 40 AMP kits for C-5s. That would leave about 70 more we \nwould need to fund in 2005, 2006, and 2007.\n\n  What do we get out of AMPing the aircraft? Among the things that we \nget is better mission capable numbers. Last week I was privileged to \nmeet with the four star general who is the commanding officer of our \nairlift mobility command, and I asked him: In terms of mission capable \nimprovement, what can we look for? For each avionics modernization \nprogram that we put in a C-5, how much improvement would we get?\n  He said it would be anywhere from 3 to 5 points of improvement of \nmission capability in each aircraft. That could mean taking the C-5 \nnumbers, the A numbers, for the last year where the mission capable \nrate was 60 and bring it up to 63, or even as high as 65. It would take \nthe 72 percent mission capable rate from the C-5Bs from the last 12 \nmonths and raise it to 75 percent, or maybe as high as 77 percent.\n  If you think about it, if we were to actually install the AMP kits in \nall C-5As and Bs, at roughly $3 million apiece, the cost to the \nTreasury is about $350 million. If you multiply 3 percentage points or \n5 percentage points--let's take somewhere in between, say a 4-percent \nincrease in the mission capability rate for AMPing C-5s. If you \nmultiply that 4 percent across the whole 110 C-5As and Bs we have in \nour inventory at the end of this year, we end up with the equivalent of \nabout--because of improvements in mission capability rates--4.4 \nadditional C-5 aircraft.\n  The cost of getting those four additional C-5 aircraft is about $350 \nmillion. The cost of a new C-5 or a new C-17 is a whole lot more than \nthat. We can get four equivalent C-5s simply out of being more mission \nready and mission capable by AMPing, installing the avionics \nmodernization package in all the C-5s.\n  I want to talk a moment, if I could, about those who are interested \nin doing something about the As, not the Bs. I have talked about this \nfirst improvement, this first retrograde, the avionics modernization \npackage.\n  The second piece is reengining, referred to as RERP. Reengining the \nC-5s would be a next step and a far more expensive step. We would not \nonly change up the engines and install the same kind of engines that \nare on Air Force One, we would make major changes in the hydraulics and \nlanding gear. Those are the major areas that cause downtime on the C-\n5s.\n  If you put together the improvements in mission readiness for AMPing \nthe aircraft and another 3 to 5 percentage points, and from 10 to 15 \npercentage points by reengining the aircraft, you are talking about \nimprovement in mission capability rates for the C-5As from roughly 60 \npercent to somewhere in the mid-70s, and improving the mission capable \nrate of the Bs from the low 70s to somewhere in the mid-80s.\n  There was a big debate a year or two ago on whether or not we ought \nto go forward and install both the first inexpensive fix, the avionics \nmodernization package, and the reengining, just appropriate money to do \nboth. The agreement that was struck was to do both fixes on a total of \nthree aircraft. We are going to install the avionics modernization \npackage on one C-5A and two C-5Bs. We are going to install the \nreengining package, new engines, hydraulics and landing gear and other\n\n[[Page S9535]]\n\nchanges, on one C-5A--the same A--and two C-5Bs. We are going to fly \nthem for a while and see how they work. If they work as advertised, or \nif they continue to have a high failure rate--and I have a hunch they \nare going to work--we are not talking about developing a new engine, we \nare talking about taking the same engine as on Air Force One, a modern \naircraft engine, and it will give us 10,000 hours between changes of \nengines instead of 1,000, and it will make a huge difference in our \nmission capable rate.\n\n  Somewhere down the line we will have the opportunity to have those \ntest aircraft--three of them--in the air, flying for a year or so; we \nwill see how they are performing and we will then make the decision as \nto whether we want to invest more money in either of those retrofits.\n  I think that is smart. When we are talking about spending that kind \nof money, we ought to upgrade the planes and fly them for a while and \nsee if they work as advertised.\n  The avionics modernization package has already been installed in at \nleast one aircraft, and more are coming. The aircraft that it has been \ninstalled in was actually installed ahead of schedule and within \nbudget. The early test is going well.\n  The Air Force has chosen a site on the east coast and one on the west \ncoast to continue the work that has begun on the avionics modernization \npackage installation for the C-5s.\n  We should go forward and put the C-5 avionics modernization package \nin as many C-5s as quickly as we can. Those are not my words. Those are \nthe words of the four star general who actually heads up military \nairlift command. Those were his words as recently as last week. He \nsaid: Provide for us as many AMPed C-5s as you can, as quickly as you \ncan.\n  The reason is that it is a fairly cheap fix to get aircraft readiness \nup and to give him the aircraft tails, if you will, that he needs in \norder to support our troops in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, and other \nplaces around the world--probably Liberia next. Who knows.\n  Let me close with this thought. Sometimes we are asked to appropriate \nmoney on this floor and we are asked to appropriate money for defense \nprojects and others that have not been authorized by the authorizing \ncommittee. These 12 additional AMP kits, avionics modernization \npackages, for the C-5s have been authorized in both the House \nauthorization bill, the Defense bill, and the Senate authorization \nbill. The authorizing committees are on board.\n  Sometimes we are asked to appropriate money when a branch of our \nArmed Forces has not expressed interest in a particular kind of weapons \nsystem or project or gizmo. In this case, these 12 kits, on top of the \noriginal 18 in the bill, are in the Air Force's list of unfunded \npriorities.\n  Sometimes we are asked to appropriate money when neither the aircrews \nwho fly these planes nor the maintenance folks who maintain them nor \nthe four-star generals in charge of the whole show really think it \nmakes a lot of sense. In this case, the aircrews who fly them, the \nmaintenance crews who maintain them, and the four-star general who is \nin charge of the whole show say we need as many C-5s AMPed as quickly \nas we can.\n  Sometimes we are asked to appropriate dollars to buy a capability \nthat is not needed. In this case, we need airlift. We need it. We need \nit today; we needed it last month; we needed it last year; and we are \ngoing to need more of it next year. We cannot meet the current demands \nfor airlift.\n  If we actually put on all of our C-5s between now and 2007 the \navionics modernization package, it is the equivalent of giving the Air \nForce three, four, or as many as five additional C-5 aircraft with \nwhich to meet their missions.\n  Sometimes we are asked to appropriate dollars for items that are not \ncost-effective. I am going to tell my colleagues, to get the effect of \nthree or four or five additional C-5 aircraft for $350 million by \nsimply raising mission capability by anywhere from 3 to 5 points per \naircraft for $3 million apiece is a bargain in this world, and it is \none we should not pass by.\n  If we end up with a mix of C-5As and C-5Bs--let's say in C-5Bs you \nhave a cockpit that is 21st century--modern communications equipment, \nmodern terrain avoidance, altitude separation equipment--and you end up \nwith C-5As that have not been modernized or a 1970 cockpit with the old \naltitude separation equipment, the old terrain avoidance, the old \ncommunications gear--we put our crews in a difficult or maybe dangerous \nsituation.\n  Today, C-5 aircrews move from C-5As to C-5Bs and fly them \ninterchangeably. It does not matter because one aircraft is very \nsimilar to the other. The people who maintain the aircraft maintain the \nC-5As as easily as they can maintain a C-5B. Most of the spare parts \nfit interchangeably with the C-5Bs. I would not want to say to a crew \ntoday: You are going to fly the C-5B with the new avionics \nmodernization, you are going to get in a 21st century cockpit and fly \nthis aircraft, and then say to the same crew: Tomorrow you are going to \nfly the old aircraft with the old cockpit, with the old equipment.\n  I would not want to say to the maintenance crews: We expect you to \nmaintain this old aircraft, and a lot of them are located at the same \nbases. Do we expect them to maintain the same aircraft--it is a \ndifferently configured aircraft in the cockpit--and expect them to have \nthe expertise and training to do maintenance on an entirely different \ncockpit?\n  Finally, in terms of keeping spare parts, we do not put the spare \nparts at Air Force bases that have C-5As. There are Air Force bases \naround the world and in places where we support troops and have \nairlift.\n  I would not be making a big deal about this if the wings on the C-5As \nor C-5Bs were about to deteriorate and fall off. They are not. The \nwings and fuselages of the C-5As and C-5Bs, according to the experts, \nhave another 30 or 40 useful years of life on them.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CARPER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware is a pilot and \nI am a pilot, and we are quite interested in this subject. We have had \nfairly long discussions about C-5As and C-5Bs. As I have told my friend \nfrom Delaware, I have conferred at length with the Air Force, and the \nAir Force just does not want to have money earmarked solely for C-5As. \nThey will agree, if we want to do so, to specifically state that this \nmoney we have in the bill can be used for C-5As or C-5Bs for the kits. \nSome of the C-5As may, in fact, be eligible for such new kits, making \nthem, as the Senator would say, 21st century capable.\n  The Air Force, however, objects to this amendment because this \namendment--the Senator from Delaware has not offered it yet, but the \nSenator from Delaware is considering it, and I have reviewed it--would \ntake money from the overall account. It would, in fact, diminish the \nmoneys that are available for C-17s and other procurement of aircraft.\n  We are more than willing to allow the Air Force to make the \ndetermination which C-5As should be modified by these kits, but, again, \nI have to state to my friend, we must oppose the concept of having this \nmoney taken from the procurement account for the purpose of modernizing \nthe C-5s against the wishes of the Air Force.\n  There is a study underway, as I understand it, which may identify C-\n5As that would be kept. I would even be willing to specify the money \ncould be used for any of those planes that were designated in that \nmobility study to be eligible for the kits. But the Senator's amendment \nis still not acceptable.\n  I hope he will work with us and work with our staff in the remainder \nof the afternoon and see if we can work out something that is \nagreeable.\n  We have deterred from the regular order to which we agreed last \nnight, and that was that Senator Byrd would offer the next amendment. \nSo I hope my friend from Delaware will allow a distinguished senior \nMember of the Senate to proceed with his amendment, and we will try to \nwork out some kind of accommodation with regard to the amendment of the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  I know Senator Biden is also very much involved. Perhaps between now \nand the time we return from the address to be given to us by the \ndistinguished leader of the British Parliament, we can come to some \nsatisfactory agreement with the Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S9536]]\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, Senator Biden indicated he is interested \nin offering the amendment after Prime Minister Blair addresses our \njoint meeting. So I will not do it at this time. If I can accept the \nkind offer of the chairman to find some common ground, I would very \nmuch like to discuss that with him and Senator Inouye and their staffs.\n  Let me close, if I may. I see Senator Byrd is on his feet. I want to \nclose.\n  Sometimes we are asked to appropriate money in ways that will not \nhave much effect in a positive respect for those who fly our aircraft \nor for those who maintain our aircraft. As sure as we are gathered here \ntoday, a decision to put an avionics modernization package on our C-5As \nand C-5Bs will make those aircraft safer for the crews who fly them, it \nwill make them easier to maintain for the folks in this country and \naround the world who are trying to maintain the aircraft as they meet \ntheir missions throughout the world, and it is a bargain for the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n  Finally, it is a cost-effective--a highly cost-effective--way to \nmaintain and to strengthen the air groups that connect us in this \ncountry to our disparate forces around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1281\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 216 years ago yesterday, in a sweltering \nroom in Philadelphia, 55 men of extraordinary talents reached a most \ncritical decision on the design of a new government for the United \nStates. Days and weeks of acrimonious debate had failed to resolve \ndisputes on the representation of each of the original 13 colonies. Men \nlike Washington, Madison, Franklin, and Hamilton struggled over the \nissue of how the people of our Nation would be represented in their \nGovernment.\n  But then, on July 16, 1787, the Framers of what came to be our \nConstitution reached a breakthrough.\n  On that date, yesterday, 216 years ago, they struck a bargain that \nhas come to be known as the Great Compromise. States with large \npopulations would have the benefit of more numerous representation in \nthe House of Representatives and States with small populations would be \nprotected by equal representation in the Senate. Without that landmark \nagreement, work on a new constitution to replace the failed Articles of \nConfederation might have foundered.\n  Without the Great Compromise, we in this Chamber might never have met \nto debate the issues of the day. But as we debate the bill before us, \none cannot help but recognize the perilous situation in which the \nUnited States finds itself with respect to our foreign commitments. We \ntake up the fiscal year 2004 Defense appropriations bill at a time when \nnearly 150,000 of our troops are facing guerrilla attacks as they \npatrol Iraq.\n  While the administration had once predicted that our liberating \nforces would be greeted with smiles and covered with flowers, the \nSecretary of Defense is now warning that attacks on our troops may \nincrease during the rest of July. In light of all of these facts, some \nmay argue that we need to pass this bill soon in order to show support \nfor our troops who remain under fire, nearly 17 weeks after the war in \nIraq began and nearly 11 weeks after the President delivered his \nvictory speech on the USS Abraham Lincoln where there was a banner over \nhis head which proclaimed, ``Mission accomplished.'' There it was, that \nbanner streaming above his head proclaiming, ``Mission accomplished.''\n  If we rush to pass this bill to show support for our troops in Iraq, \nwe will be rushing for naught because not one thin dime, not one copper \npenny, contained in this Defense bill is for the additional cost of war \nin Afghanistan or Iraq.\n  There is not one red cent in this bill for the additional costs to \nsupport 150,000 troops in Iraq or the nearly 10,000 troops who remain \nin Afghanistan. Linking speedy action on this bill to support for our \ntroops who are now standing in harm's way is what is known as a bait \nand switch routine. This is a bill that only funds our military as if \nwe were in a time of peace, but we all know we are going to be hit with \na massive bill for wartime costs in a couple of months.\n  Let there be no doubt, the amount of money we are spending in Iraq \nand Afghanistan is massive. Since September 11, 2001, Congress has \nappropriated $104.3 billion to the Defense Department for homeland \nsecurity missions in pursuit of al-Qaida in Afghanistan and elsewhere, \nand the war in Iraq.\n  The total bill in Iraq so far, according to the Pentagon's \ncomptroller, has reached $48 billion. The Secretary of Defense reported \nlast week, I believe it was, to the Armed Services Committee that we \nare spending $3,921,000,000 each month for our occupation of Iraq, a \nfigure nearly double that of its prewar estimates. Secretary Rumsfeld \nalso reported that we are spending nearly $943 million each month for \nmilitary operations in Afghanistan.\n  I opposed the war in the beginning. I opposed the war in Iraq. \nContrary to White House charges of revisionist history--which I \nmaintain, as far as the revisionist part is concerned, is on the side \nof the White House--I never believed that Iraq posed a clear and \nimminent threat to the United States, and I stood right on this floor \nand said that. I never believed, and so stated at the time, that Iraq \nposed a clear and imminent threat to the security of our country. But \nwhen the war in Iraq began, I stated I would do everything in my power \nto provide our troops with the funds needed to ensure their safety, \neven though I disagree with the policy that took them into Iraq.\n\n  GEN Tommy Franks said to the House Armed Services Committee on July \n11 that our troops could be patrolling Iraq for the next 4 years, and \nthe new commander in Iraq, GEN John Abizaid, acknowledged that our \ntroops are facing guerrilla attacks. In today's papers he so stated.\n  We know our troops need money for food, fuel, ammunition and pay. \nThere is no reason we must wait to provide for these needs until the \nadministration requests its next stopgap spending measure. Congress \nshould insist that these costs be included in the President's regular \nbudget request.\n  I am sure it will come as a surprise to many Americans to know that \nthe administration has not presented Congress with any request nor any \nexplanatory detail regarding the costs that are racking up right now, \nthis very minute, during our occupation of Iraq. The President has not \nrequested any funding for the additional costs of the 150,000 troops \nwho are expected to remain in Iraq for an extended period of time, nor \nhas the President requested any additional funds for the cost of \nrooting out al-Qaida from Afghanistan.\n  The American people would be stunned to learn that the Senate is \ntaking up a $368 billion appropriations bill for the Department of \nDefense that does not include one thin dime for the additional costs, \nthe incremental costs, of the war in Iraq or the mission in \nAfghanistan.\n  When we start talking about appropriations, budget resolutions, and \nsupplemental spending bills, the eyes of many Americans start to glaze \nover. While John Q. Public may not know the intricacies of Federal \nbudgeting, he fully expects that somebody in Washington is watching \nover his taxpayer money and that somebody is making sure of its \neffective use, that somebody is asking questions about the expenditures \nof his monies. But when it comes to financing military missions \noverseas, the White House continues to try to turn the Constitution on \nits head. The White House wants to spend the money first and have \nCongress approve the funding later. When it comes to this war in Iraq \nand the aftermath of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the \nadministration views Congress like an automatic teller machine: Just \nput the request into the machine, into the ATM, and the money slides \nout in seconds, no questions asked.\n  Last October, Congress approved a resolution authorizing military \naction in Iraq. I voted against that. I am proud I voted against it. As \nlong as I stay in the Senate, I shall keep the tally sheet right in \nfront of me, as I sit at my desk in my office, showing the votes on \nthat matter.\n  At the time, the White House and the Department of Defense asserted \nthat the cost of the mission was not knowable. That is what the \nadministration witnesses said before our committee--that the costs were \nnot knowable.\n  The message from the White House was basically, trust me, trust me. \nIt is your money.\n\n[[Page S9537]]\n\n  We have heard that. We have heard that old saying right here. But in \nthis instance, it is your money, trust me. They said they would send \nthe bill, the costs to Congress when they knew more about the details \nof the mission.\n  Well, when the President submitted his FY 2004 budget to the Congress \nin February, he continued to keep Congress in the dark. He requested no \nfunding for the war in Iraq. Why? The House and the Senate needed to \npass budget resolutions that the President hoped would include $1.5 \ntrillion of additional tax cuts. Perhaps the White House feared that a \n$60 billion bill for Iraq, just for FY 2003, might worry some Members \nwho are concerned about deficit spending when it came to voting on the \nbill to cut taxes. On March 13, 2003, the Senate Budget Committee \napproved the budget resolution with $1.3 trillion of additional tax \ncuts and assumed no additional costs for the war in Iraq. On March 21, \n2003, the House passed their budget resolution, including $1.3 trillion \nof tax cuts and assumed nothing about the cost of the war in Iraq. On \nMarch 26, the Senate passed a budget resolution that assumed over $800 \nbillion in tax cuts. What was curiously missing from the conference \nreport was an amendment that had been offered by Senator Feingold and \napproved by the Senate to set aside $100 billion for the war in Iraq.\n  When did the White House finally send up their request for a \nsupplemental for the costs of the war in Iraq? The White House waited \nuntil March 25, 2003, to submit a massive $62.6 billion request for the \nDepartment of Defense--6 months after the Congress considered the \nresolution to authorize military action in Iraq, 2 months after the \nPresident submitted his FY 2004 budget to Congress, and 1 week after \nthe war in Iraq began.\n  Once the request was made to the Congress, the White House put its \nfoot on the gas pedal and insisted that Congress move rapidly to pass \nthe request in order to support the troops that were already deployed \nin the field. One hearing was held on March 27. As I recall, the \nhearing was so compressed for time that Members were not even allowed \nto make opening remarks. On April 1, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee approved the President's total funding request for DoD. On \nApril 3, the Senate approved the request. Thirteen days later, the Iraq \nsupplemental for FY 2003 was public law.\n  So the administration strategy worked. The strategy goes like this. \nForce the Congress to make difficult choices with either inadequate \ninformation or bad information. Deploy the forces. Get the funding hook \nin the nose of Congress by putting the troops in the field. Go to war. \nSpend the money. And insist that Congress move promptly to approve the \nfunding again, after it is spent and more is needed to replenish \naccounts.\n  Now the Senate has before it the FY 2004 Defense Appropriations bill. \nOnce again, the White House is hiding the ball when it comes to facing \nup to the true costs of the mission in Iraq. Apparently, there will be \nno request for the additional costs of this mission until next \nFebruary--after the fact. In other words, it will be a replay of last \nyear. Meanwhile, there are 150,000 troops in the field in Iraq and \n10,000 in Afghanistan, but no dollars to support them; no submission to \nCongress for how the money will be used; no oversight to ensure \naccountability; no plan for when the troops might come home; no plan \nfor how to manage troop strength so that we do not have to keep our \nreserves deployed overseas for years at a time; no plan for attracting \ntroops from other countries; no plan for seeking contributions from \nother countries to help cover the costs of the war and the peace in \nIraq.\n\n  No, this White House wants to simply dictate the decisions and have \nthe congressional ATM machine spit out the money.\n  The administration's only proposal so far is to slap down the \nnational credit card and stick Congress and the taxpayer with a huge \nbill for supplemental appropriations somewhere down the road.\n  This is not an acceptable way to pay for our overseas missions. This \nis a blatant attempt to mislead the American people about \nadministration policies that are leading to fiscal disaster. That is \nwhy I offer an amendment that states the sense of the Senate that the \nPresident should include in the budgets that he submits to Congress a \nspecific request for funds to pay for our incremental costs in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  We should put an end to this financial shell game of allowing the \nadministration to hide the cost of occupation by using supplemental \nappropriations bills. My amendment would stop allowing this \nadministration to hide the costs of these foreign adventures from the \npublic. My amendment calls on the President to be up front with the \nAmerican people about how much money we will really need to support our \nongoing military operations overseas.\n  Congress needs to start holding the administration accountable for \nthe funds that it spends for our military. We need to scrutinize the \nPresident's budget to make sure that we are getting the best value for \nour taxpayer money. If the administration keeps secret how it is \nspending the money appropriated to it for Iraq and Afghanistan, there \nis no check on its activities.\n  In the weeks before the war, the chief U.N. weapons inspector \nlambasted Saddam Hussein for playing a game of ``catch as catch can.'' \nThe chief U.N. weapons inspector excoriated the Iraqi regime for \nsubmitting misleading documents that did nothing to reveal what that \nsecretive regime was up to.\n  Why in the world is the U.S. Congress settling for a game of ``catch \nas catch can'' when it comes to having this administration be honest \nabout how we are going to pay for the huge costs of occupying Iraq?\n  Why would the Congress, which holds the power of the purse--the \nConstitution has not been amended but 27 times, but not once in this \nmatter. Congress still holds the power of the purse. It rests here in \nthe people's branch.\n  Why would the Congress, which holds the power of the purse, settle \nfor misleading budgets from the President that are intended to disguise \nthe enormous budget deficit by excluding the costs of occupation of \nIraq and Afghanistan?\n  We have to plan for these huge costs. There ought to be some tough \nquestions asked about some of these expenditures. For example, we are \npaying $3.9 billion per month to support 150,000 troops in Iraq, and \n$950 million per month to support nearly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan. \nMany Americans must wonder, why does it cost $26,000 a month to support \none soldier in Iraq but $95,000 a month to support one soldier in \nAfghanistan?\n  By using supplemental appropriations bills to fund the costs of \nextensive military deployments, the administration has found a tactic \nto avoid elementary questions such as that one.\n  The folks at the Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget \nonly need to wait until the right moment to send a supplemental funding \nrequest to Congress, and use the old cattle prod that we must pass the \nbill immediately, no matter what its cost, or our troops will run short \nof supplies.\n  It works. It works like a charm. Yes, like a charm. In the end, it is \na budget tactic that is deceitful, allows for abuse and misuse of the \npublic treasure, and cynically uses the very real emotional attachment \nthat all Americans have for our troops.\n  The American people are coming to grips with the dangers of postwar \nIraq. They read about them every day. They have read the headlines of \ndaily attacks on American soldiers and they understand that the stakes \nare very high. The American people want a plan for postwar Iraq, so \nthat they can be assured their loved ones will stay in harm's way only \nas long as absolutely necessary.\n  Congress must come to grips with the costs of postwar Iraq, as well \nas those associated with our continuing mission in Afghanistan. Yet a \nlook at this defense budget leaves one wondering how these costs are \nbeing covered. There is no additional money for Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Yes, I do.\n  (Mr. ALEXANDER assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Am I correct in understanding this Defense \nAppropriations Committee bill has no money in it for Iraq, either the \nmilitary costs or the reconstruction costs? Is that correct?\n\n[[Page S9538]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct, with reference to incremental \ncosts, additional costs. Of course, we will be paying salaries there \nthat we would pay whether the personnel were there or whether they were \nback in West Virginia or in Maryland or wherever. The incremental costs \nfor Iraq and Afghanistan, there is not one thin dime in this budget, \nnot one.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield for a further question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How is the Congress expected to play its role with \nrespect to appropriations, and overseeing the expenditure of the public \nmoneys, if we are not furnished this information?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Congress, apparently, is expected to just go along and \nhear all this talk about the ``Commander in Chief,'' and not dare to \nraise a head to ask a question. You are not supposed to ask questions. \nYou are supposed to put the money down. And that is the way we did it \nlast year. The troops are there and by the time we got around to \nconsidering the supplemental appropriation bill, they had already spent \nseveral billion dollars, between $30 and $40 billion or some such--\nalready spent. So we have to pay the bills. That is already spent. We \nhave to do that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield to me for a further question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, last year we were just getting into this \nsituation. I understand in the past there have been instances in which, \nprior to actually going into operation, we weren't given figures \nbecause it is so hard to estimate them. Then they come to you for a \nsupplemental. Of course, when they come for a supplemental, what can \nyou do but give the supplemental? At that point you have no choice.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But now we are a year later and it seems to me it ought \nto be possible to make some estimates that would be contained in the \nbudget.\n  It is my understanding that in the past, although we may not have \ngotten estimates before operations began, once they commenced and \ncontinued for a period of time, then estimates were contained in the \nbudget requests because it was a continuing matter and you were in a \nperiod where you could make such calculations. Of course, that is not \nbeing done in this instance.\n  Mr. BYRD. No.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We are now well into it. It ought to be possible to \nmake some estimates and contain those in the budget so we have an \nopportunity to review them. Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, absolutely, I agree with that. That is what my \namendment is about. Here we were, over in the Armed Services Committee. \nI asked the Secretary of Defense how much is our country spending per \nmonth in Iraq, on the war in Iraq, on the occupation of Iraq, and how \nmuch in Afghanistan? In both instances the Secretary said he didn't \nknow. He would have to wait a while and get back to me.\n  Well, that is an old game.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. If I may finish, and then I will be glad to.\n  That is an old game. You put it off. You don't want to answer on the \nrecord. You don't want to answer in public. And you don't want to \nanswer that question lest there be a followup question. So you just put \nit off. Say, ``Senator, I am sorry, I don't have that figure. I will \nhave to take a while. It may take me a while, take us a while to give \nyou that figure.''\n  I said, Well, no, we want the figure now.\n  That is the way we are being handled. That is the way Congress is \nbeing handled, and I think it is wrong.\n  Then the answer came back, after a short recess of 20 or 30 minutes. \nThe answer came back from the Secretary of Defense that the war in Iraq \nis costing about $3.9 billion per month, and almost $1 billion, $943 \nmillion, I believe, per month, in Afghanistan.\n  Those answers we needed, and with that kind of information. I am sure \nthe Defense Department had this estimate long before I asked them the \nquestion in the committee. They had these estimates. They should have \nincorporated them into a request in the budget bill. That could have \nbeen done. They could have foreseen--well, we are spending on the \naverage of $1 billion a week in Iraq. Let's put it in the budget. Let's \nput $52 billion in the budget. That would be the way they ought to deal \nwith Congress. That is the way they ought to deal with the people's \nrepresentatives in Congress. But they are not doing it. They didn't do \nit then.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the distinguished Senator. I think his answers \nhave only underscored the importance of his amendment, which I very \nstrongly support.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. I now yield to my friend \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, with regard to the question of the \nSenator from Maryland, does the Senator from West Virginia know that \nyesterday I pointed out the report we have from the Congressional \nResearch Service is that no President has ever asked for funds for war \nin advance? No Senate has ever appropriated moneys based upon \ncontingencies, predictions of how much would be spent for war.\n  In the Balkan situation, President Clinton did send money for the \npeacekeeping operations following the conflict in the Balkans. But I am \nreally informed--does the Senator realize no President has ever \nconducted war financing the way the amendment of the Senator would \nrequire the President to do it, if it were a legislative mandate?\n  Parenthetically, as part of that question, though, I wonder if the \nSenator understands, we are prepared to accept the Senator's amendment \nbecause it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which would indicate a \nrequest from the Congress that the President consider, in effect, to \nchange that policy and submit a budget request in this instance which \nwe are perfectly willing to support, to send to the President. But does \nthe Senator realize, the statement of the Senator from Maryland \nindicates he thinks we should have before us now to include in the 2004 \nbudget an amount that someone predicts will be necessary to fight a war \nwhen we don't know what the contingencies are, we don't know what the \nrequirements are?\n  I wonder if the Senator heard the distinguished Senator from Hawaii \nyesterday when he explained his position as a platoon leader, and as a \nplatoon leader if he had been asked how many grenades he was going to \nuse in the next engagement, or how many rifle bullets he would need in \nthe next engagement, or whether he could tell how much he would need \nfor the next engagement so it could be passed on up to the President of \nthe United States as to how much money we would need to conduct the war \nin Italy, it couldn't have been done. It can't be done now.\n  Does the Senator understand why we are opposing this? It is contrary \nto the tradition of the United States. And it is contrary to common \nsense to ask for a contingency budget request in the budget itself for \noperations considering what is going on in Iraq today. This could \nexpand tomorrow or cease the next day. The contingency concept for a \nwar like this cannot be predicted for a Presidential budget to be \npresented to the Congress. And it is presented 9 months before it goes \ninto effect.\n  We are saying the President, in his submission in January, should \ngive us a budget to tell us how much we will spend in a war and that \nthe spending would commence at the start of the following October.\n  With due respect, does the Senator not agree that the problem we have \nhere is to understand the President submitted this 2004 budget before \nthe war began? How in the world can we expect the President to include \nin this 2004 budget request a request for expenses that may occur after \nOctober 1 of this year in terms of Iraq? Every President has financed \nthose in the same way. Every single war has been financed the way this \nPresident is trying to finance this war.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am asking that question of my friend from West \nVirginia. He has the floor. I would like to get into this debate some \nkind of a balance with regard to how we are doing it. The Senator has \nthe right to send a request to the President saying it ``should'' be \ndone in a different way. But to say it ``must'' be done a different \nway, we oppose.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield.\n\n[[Page S9539]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding--and I phrase the question \ncarefully in this regard--that while it is accurate to say we have not \nhad these figures requested prior to entering into hostilities, that \nonce we have gone into hostilities which have continued over a period \nof time, that has not prevailed.\n  Second, President Bush landed on an aircraft carrier out in the \nPacific and said it was all over--``mission accomplished.''\n  We are now into--presumably by his own statement--a postwar period in \nwhich we are trying to do a lot of reconstruction and peacekeeping. It \nseems to me under that premise put forward by the President himself \nthat we ought to be receiving budget estimates. They can put an \nasterisk on it that says this is our best estimate. It may prove out to \nbe different as circumstances develop. But we are not being given any \nfigures on which to pass judgment.\n  Then after the fact, we receive a supplemental. Of course, a \nsupplemental is going to be approved. There is no meaningful review at \nthat point because it has already been done.\n  Then we are told this money has already been expended. You have to \nreplenish the coffers without having a chance to subject the figures to \nthe requirement that they pass muster.\n\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Does the distinguished Senator from Alaska have any further questions \nat the moment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is very kind. I have a whole \nlot of questions to ask. But I prefer to get on with the debate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Questions of me?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The only question to the Senator is that I would \nrespectfully ask if he understands that we are willing to take the \namendment as the Senator has drafted it because it seeks a change in \npolicy and it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. We are seeking that \nchange in policy.\n  Again, parenthetically, I believe the time may come when we have wars \nor postwar engagements of such magnitude that we should find a new way \nto budget contrary to past procedures.\n  But, again, I urge the Senator from Maryland to understand that \nhistory goes against the policy he has suggested.\n  I hope the Senator from West Virginia understands my feeling in terms \nof the way we are handling things now. Does the Senator realize there \nis $32 billion left from what we provided in the supplemental for the \nwar in Iraq? It is no-year money. It is not money that would cease to \nbe available after September 30. We gave the President $62.6 billion, \nand it was no-year money. It did not have to be spent by the end of \nSeptember.\n  We have, in fact, appropriated money which, if this afterwar \nresistance--whatever it is--diminishes, should be enough money. We \nshould not have to have another request.\n  That is the position this Senator takes. Does the Senator understand \nmy position on that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, since before this war began, I have asked \nrepeatedly of this administration what their estimate of the cost of \nthis war is. Do you have any estimate? We get a blank stare.\n  I cannot believe that an administration is going to lead a country \ninto war without having some inside estimates by the very capable \npeople who surround the President about what this war would cost. Of \ncourse, nobody--least of all me--would ever expect the administration \nto be able to say it is going to cost $2.785 trillion. But I, others, \nand the American people were seeking some kind of a realistic range--\nand now more so than then.\n  Now we know that it has been testified to in the Armed Services \nCommittee that the war in Afghanistan is costing $3.9 billion a month. \nWe know that. That wasn't known just at the beginning of that day. I am \nsure the Defense Department had already run the estimate and had come \nout with the figures. Why couldn't the administration use those figures \nand say to the Congress, well, we estimate that it is costing in Iraq \n$3 billion, $3.5 billion, between $3.5 billion and $4.1 billion, or \nsomething like that?\n  We just get stonewalled when we ask questions of that kind. I think \nCongress is entitled to better than that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This will be my last interruption. Will the Senator \nyield to me for one other question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator recall that in the 2003 budget request \nPresident Bush asked for $10 billion for contingency operations for \ndefense emergency response funds for Afghanistan, the war on terrorism, \nand the activities that were going on at that time, and that he and I \njoined together in denying that request? We denied the request because \nwe did not believe we should appropriate moneys based upon a \ncontingency request.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. We approved it in the omnibus bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. We turned it down in the omnibus, also.\n  Mr. BYRD. We approved it in the omnibus bill. That is the information \nI have.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator was talking about the money we put in in \nJanuary. That was money that already had been spent in Afghanistan and \nthe war on terrorism. And we included those funds at that time in the \nomnibus bill. But we turned down the $10 billion for the contingency \noperation. I didn't like the defense emergency response fund. The \nSenator from West Virginia didn't like the defense emergency respond \nfund that just sits out there--a big pot of money which they can take \nmoney out of without telling us what they are going to spend it for.\n  We face two different problems: One is that we have a request in the \nbudget for a big pot of money that they are going to spend any way they \nwant when we have always requested that we get money based on how much \nexpenses had actually been incurred in fighting an engagement.\n  Does the Senator disagree with that?\n  Mr. BYRD. What we are advocating is that funds would be provided in \nthe Appropriations Act to specific accounts set forth in such act.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is why we support the Senator's request. That is \nwhy the Senator's request for the sense-of-the-Senate resolution is \nimminently sensible. And I would like to follow that procedure. That is \nnot the procedure we followed in the past. This President is following \nprecedence in connection with the way he has, in fact, presented the \nbudget for 2004 and the supplemental request for the war in Iraq.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator.\n  The Senator from Alaska has been in conversation with the \nadministration, evidently, regarding funds already available. I was \nhere 2 days ago when the same statement was made about the need for \nfunds and when that would occur next year. Then I read yesterday \nmorning in the paper that same day--the day before, on Tuesday--the \ncomptroller for the Department of Defense said in a supplemental \nappropriation that was made earlier this fiscal year there is $4 \nbillion remaining for the purpose of war activities which, as the \nSenator pointed out, at the rate of $3.9 billion a month in Iraq, plus \nin Afghanistan $.9 billion a month--that would be $4.8 billion a \nmonth--there would not even be enough remaining amongst the funds to be \nexpended to cover that.\n  So I ask the Senator from West Virginia, doesn't that underscore what \nthe Senator said about the difficulty in getting the same numbers from \nthe same principals?\n  Mr. BYRD. It does.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield just for a clarification?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My staff informs me that the Senator has the numbers \nturned around. There were $15 billion, of which $4 billion have been \nused. We are certifying there are $11 billion left now.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I read the figures differently. If I am incorrect, I will \nstand corrected. If the Senator's staff is correct, then that would be \nenough money for about 2\\1/2\\ months of the next fiscal year--I \nshouldn't say the next fiscal year because my understanding is they are \ndrawing down that money now.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia still has\n\n[[Page S9540]]\n\nthe floor. If he will let me respond, parenthetically, again, the \nSenator is correct, if the expenses continued at the rate of the \nexpenditures for the months of June and July--the two 4 weeks just \npreviously--the Senator is correct, the account was $3.9 billion a \nmonth for those operations. We do not consider that even today the \nactivities are continuing at the same rate they were in the average per \nday for the last 4 weeks.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. In addition to that, there is $45 billion in specific \nservice accounts that are in fact going to be used in Iraq. So we are \nnot dealing with something where there is no money provided. There is \n$45 billion in specific unit accounts where that money will be spent in \nIraq. And it is an augmentation because of the Iraqi conditions.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my amendment reads as follows:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--any request for funds \n     for a fiscal year for an ongoing overseas military \n     operation--\n\n  The word is ``ongoing''--\n\n     for an ongoing overseas military operation, including \n     operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, should be included in the \n     annual budget of the President for such fiscal year as \n     submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31 \n     United States Code. . . .\n\n  These are ongoing--ongoing operations.\n  What is to keep this administration from sending up an amended budget \nrequest right today? The administration has already said we are \nspending $3.9 billion a month in Iraq and almost $1 billion a month in \nAfghanistan. Why doesn't the administration send up an amended budget \nrequest right now and let us include that money in this appropriations \nbill?\n\n  Now, the administration knows that is what it is spending. Why \ncouldn't we at least include it in this bill that is before the Senate, \nrather than wait until next February when the administration will send \nup a request for that amount plus a great deal more? And why not \nanticipate the remaining months the administration expects to be in \nIraq and Afghanistan and anticipate for the same amount on into the \nfuture?\n  It is this thing that I feel very strongly about: the Congress of the \nUnited States being held at bay when it comes to getting information \nfrom this administration. When it comes to appropriations, the Congress \nhas control of the purse strings. And when we asked the administration \nwitnesses, at least one of them said these figures are not knowable, \nthis information is not knowable. Well, they have these estimates. They \nhad them then, and they could have been included. So the Congress can \nexercise its constitutional oversight over these moneys that are being \nappropriated and spent.\n  I am glad the distinguished Senator from Alaska has indicated he \nintends to accept this amendment. But while we are on this subject, I \nhave a chart here.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator from Alaska--and he is a distinguished \nSenator, a very distinguished Senator, my friend--time and time again \nhe has said something about the moneys during the Clinton \nadministration.\n  The supplementals for Kosovo and Bosnia were in the range of $2 \nbillion to $3 billion for each mission. The Iraq supplemental that was \npassed this April was $62.6 billion. If we are to believe the cost \nestimates of Secretary Rumsfeld, that he testified to at a recent Armed \nServices hearing, the current cost of supporting 150,000 troops in Iraq \nand 10,000 troops in Afghanistan is $4.8 billion per month, or $58 \nbillion if our troops are to remain in Iraq and Afghanistan for all of \nfiscal year 2004. The fiscal situation is completely different today \nthan it was in 1998 and 2000 when supplementals were approved for \nBosnia and Kosovo.\n  As one can see on this chart, in those years, we were running large \nsurpluses: $69 billion in fiscal year 1998 and $236 billion in fiscal \nyear 2000. The issue of how to finance a $2 billion supplemental was \nnot and did not need to be a critical element of the debate.\n  Just this week, the White House released their Mid-Session Review. \nAnd the White House projections are on this chart.\n  The White House projects deficits of $455 billion for fiscal year \n2003 and $475 billion for fiscal year 2004. The estimate of $475 \nbillion for fiscal year 2004, the year of the Defense appropriations \nbill that is now pending before the Senate, does not include any cost, \nnot one dime, for the incremental cost of the war in Iraq or the \nmission in Afghanistan. Therefore, if the President had requested a \nbudget amendment or a supplemental for these missions, the deficit for \nfiscal year 2004 would likely be over $500 billion. And if you exclude \nthe Social Security surplus, the deficit for fiscal year 2004 could \nexceed $650 billion.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me just finish briefly.\n  The cost of the war in Iraq and the mission in Afghanistan is over $1 \nbillion per week. General Franks has said that it is likely we will \nneed to retain significant numbers of troops in Iraq for years to come. \nWe know that now. We should not hide the ball from the American people \nuntil next year.\n  If we want to talk about then, we were running huge surpluses back in \nthose days. Yet the cost was small, talking about $2 billion, $3 \nbillion, when surpluses were running $69 billion, $125 billion, $236 \nbillion, $127 billion. Now we are talking in a deficit situation. We \nare running huge deficits, astronomical deficits, never to be heard of \nbefore deficits. The costs we are talking about hiding here and waiting \nuntil the supplemental comes before Congress are many, many times \nhigher than they were during the Clinton administration. So it is a \nlittle like trying to equate apples and oranges.\n  Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for the point he has made. I would like to underscore it. By \nthe administration's own figures, they are projecting the budget \ndeficit--that is, the amount of money that we have to go out and borrow \nto pay our existing debts--in this fiscal year as $455 billion as \nillustrated by the chart the Senator has just shown. They are \nprojecting next year $475 billion of deficit spending. Yet they will \nnot come forth with a supplemental request when finally the Senator \nfrom West Virginia got the Secretary of Defense to admit in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee that the monthly cost for carrying on the war \nis $3.9 billion a month, just in Iraq, plus about $750 million a month \nin the war being prosecuted in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. BYRD. Nine hundred and forty-three million.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. And thus, as the Senator has pointed out, it \nbrings it to well over some $60 billion additional.\n  Isn't it curious that if they are projecting $475 billion by their \nown figures in deficit financing for next year, that they do not add \nthe additional $60 billion of anticipated war expenses, and that \ndoesn't even count for the additional interest that will have to be \npaid on that newly incurred debt. Therefore, the deficit gets larger \nand larger and larger. To the average person what that means is, it is \ngoing to stall the recovery. It is going to cause the cost of money to \ngo up in the interest rates.\n  But if we, as dictated by the Constitution, are to fulfill our \nappropriations duty, is it not logical that this Senate and the House \nof Representatives should have the information as to what the projected \ncosts are of carrying on the function of the Government of the United \nStates, including the defense of the United States? That is the \nquestion.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. They should have. The President, I say, should send up a \nsupplemental budget request today for $58 billion.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would not the Senator wonder, then, since they \nrefused to do that, and here we are in the middle of a war and a \nsoldier is getting killed every day, would the Senator not wonder why \nthey don't? I think that it might be that it just shows that annual \ndeficit spending exploding higher and higher, which is ultimately going \nto have an effect on the financial markets of this country and make it \nall the more difficult for the economic recovery to occur.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Well, I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida \nfor his thoughtful observations. I would hope that the administration \nwould send up a supplemental request. Otherwise, I think we ought to \ntry to add to it this\n\n[[Page S9541]]\n\nbill. Why not? Why not? That is the anticipated cost. In any event, let \nme finish my statement. I am almost at the end.\n  The administration has reported to Congress that we are spending $4.8 \nbillion each month in Iraq and Afghanistan. These costs can be \nanticipated, can be budgeted, and can be controlled. They are costs \ndriven by policy emanating from the White House. There is absolutely no \nreason why they should not be included in the Defense appropriations \nbill that is now before the Senate.\n  If we truly want to support our troops, we should have truth in \nbudgeting. My amendment calls on the President to be up front about the \ncosts of our deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would stop the \npractice of gimmicks and secrecy which hide the true cost of these \nforeign entanglements from the American people, the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1281\n\n(Purpose: To state the sense of Congress on funding of ongoing overseas \n    military operations, including overseas contingency operations)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1281:\n       Insert after section 8123 the following:\n       Sec. 8124. It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any request for funds for a fiscal year for an ongoing \n     overseas military operation, including operations in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq, should be included in the annual budget \n     of the President for such fiscal year as submitted to \n     Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States \n     Code; and\n       (2) any funds provided for such fiscal year for such a \n     military operation should be provided in appropriations Acts \n     for such fiscal year through appropriations to specific \n     accounts set forth in such Acts.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the reliance of the Department of Defense \non supplemental appropriations for contingency and peacekeeping \noperations began with the end of the last Persian Gulf War, and the \nintroduction of United States military forces into the Balkans.\n  Excluding the costs of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the incremental costs \nof U.S. peacekeeping and contingency operations from fiscal year 1991 \nto 2003 total $36.8 billion.\n  Congress has debated and passed a supplemental appropriations bill \nfor the Department of Defense every year from fiscal 1991 to the \ncurrent fiscal year. The Congress has debated funding these operations \nfrom offsets within other discretionary programs, or from within the \ndefense topline.\n  Beginning with the supplemental request of the Clinton Administration \nfor fiscal year 1998 Congress has provided defense spending as an \nemergency or provided funding without offsets.\n  The Appropriations Committee attempted to mitigate the need for \nemergency supplementals by creating the Overseas Contingency Operations \nTransfer Fund in the defense bill, and the Clinton Administration still \nfound it necessary to request emergency supplementals.\n  In March of fiscal year 1998, the Clinton Administration sought $1.9 \nbillion for ongoing operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia. In fact, \nthe Senate considered an amendment to strip the emergency designation \nfrom those funds. That amendment was defeated 92 to 8.\n  Since the 105th Congress, supplemental defense appropriations have \nbeen provided as emergencies or without offsets. The Congress passed \ntwo supplemental defense bills in fiscal year 1999 totaling $19.1 \nbillion.\n  The Senate will recall that the President requested a $10 billion \ncontingency fund for the global war on terrorism as part of the fiscal \nyear 2003 budget request.\n  The Congress rejected that request until the Administration could \nbetter define the costs of contingencies. Those funds were appropriated \nas part of the Omnibus Bill passed earlier this year.\n  The Clinton Administration was aware that operations in Southwest \nAsia and the Balkans were ongoing, yet chose not to fund fully those \noperations in the budget request. As I stated earlier, the Congress \npassed emergency supplementals for fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, \nand 2002.\n  The Congress has passed nine consecutive supplemental emergency \ndefense appropriations without offsets.\n  Funding from the fiscal year 2003 supplemental was used to offset the \ndifference between the President's budget request for fiscal year 2004 \nand the discretionary total in the budget resolution.\n  As operations progress in Iraq the Administration will better define \ncontingency costs. That is the position taken by the Congress last \nyear--and the approach to funding used by the Clinton Administration to \nfund peacekeeping in the Balkans.\n  The Appropriations Committee will examine the costs of operations in \nIraq as they are identified. The Senate will have the opportunity to \nconsider those costs in any necessary supplemental. That has been the \napproach to funding contingencies taken by this body for 6 years.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague, Senator Byrd. I was not able to \nspeak in support of this amendment when it was being debated because I \nwas in a meeting with the distinguished Prime Minister of the United \nKingdom, Tony Blair. This was an important amendment, and I am pleased \nthat it was adopted earlier today.\n  This amendment calls upon the Bush administration to tell the \nCongress and the American people ``up front'' in its annual budget \nsubmissions, what it plans to spend on foreign military operations, \nparticularly those in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also asks the \nadministration to identify the specific Department of Defense accounts \nthat will be tapped to pay for those activities.\n  Greater fiscal accountability is clearly needed, especially in light \nof an explosion in the size of the Federal deficit that has occurred \nsince the Bush administration took office. Increased defense spending \nhas undoubtedly played a role in that growing deficit.\n  This year's fiscal deficit will reach $455 billion--the largest \nFederal deficit in the history of this Nation. Just five short months \nago, the Bush administration estimated that the fiscal year 2003 \ndeficit would be $305 billion--no small amount. But more than $150 \nbillion short of what it now estimates will be the fiscal gap. \nObviously, this is more than simply a question of a rounding-off error \non the part of the administration's budget experts.\n  I for one am skeptical that the administration really believed that \nits original estimates were on target.\n  What is not debatable is that our Nation's fiscal house is in \ndisarray. We urgently need to get a handle on Federal spending. A first \nstep in getting that handle is for the administration to come clean \nwith the Congress and with the American people about what our \ncommitments in Iraq and Afghanistan will mean in monetary terms.\n  Up until now, the administration has consistently ``low balled'' the \ncost of our military operations in these countries. They have skirted \ncost questions by being intentionally vague about their plans.\n  We now know that the military phase of the Iraq operation--the period \nfrom January thru April--cost approximately $4.1 billion per month.\n  Beginning in May, we were told that the cost of the pacification \nphase of the operations would be much lower--closer to $2 billion per \nmonth. That turned out to be untrue.\n  This past Sunday, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld admitted what has become \nevident--that these costs were running closer to $4 billion per month. \nThe costs of operations in Afghanistan add an additional $1 billion per \nmonth to Department of Defense military expenditures. At current rates \nof spending we will have spent more than $70 billion dollars for \nmilitary operations in Iraq by the end of the year.\n  On the non-military side in Iraq, $7 billion--$2.4 billion in U.S. \nappropriated funds--will have been spent by\n\n[[Page S9542]]\n\nthe end of the year on humanitarian and reconstruction efforts. And \nthat is just the beginning. The total bill for nation building in Iraq \ncould go as high as $100 billion when all is said and done.\n  The Byrd amendment attempts to address a larger concern that simply \nthe dollars and cents of our commitment in Iraq; it really goes to the \noverall conduct of our policy there.\n  Let me say very clearly that I am in no way critical of what our \nbrave men and women serving in our armed forces have been doing in \nIraq, or elsewhere. We are all very proud of our U.S. Service members--\nthose who have served or are now serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. We \npray for the speedy recovery of those injured in the service of their \ncountry, and our hearts go out to the families who have lost loved \nones.\n  Nor do I mourn the removal of Saddam Hussein--the world is far better \nplace now that he is no longer the dictator of his people.\n  The bottom line is the U.S. military has done and is doing a \ntremendous job--under very difficult conditions.\n  Having said that, it is increasingly apparent that the Bush \nadministration was ill prepared for what is now confronting on the \nground in Iraq--both in terms of the extent of hostilities and the \ncosts of the operations.\n  Last year when the Congress debated the resolution authorizing the \nPresident to use force in Iraq, many of us were concerned that the \nadministration had not done sufficient thinking or planning for what we \ncould expect in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq.\n  Such concerns were dismissed by administration officials.\n  I do not like to say the following, but I must.\n  There has been a level of arrogance on the part of some in the \nadministration when it comes to foreign policy generally and most \nespecially Iraq. That arrogance has caused senior policymakers in the \nadministration to be closed to advice from career government military \nand foreign policy experts and dismissive of congressional concerns \nabout the challenges that we might confront in post-Saddam Iraq.\n  I supported the congressional resolution authorizing the use of force \nlast year. And, I would do so again today. But I firmly believe that \nthe concerns I expressed during consideration of that resolution--about \nthe importance of getting broad international support for whatever we \nwanted to do in Iraq--take on even more significance today.\n  We will never know whether more patience would have gained us the \nU.N. Security Council endorsement for our efforts to rid Iraq of Saddam \nHussein. I for one believed that it would have been worthwhile to give \nthat U.N. process a little more time to get that endorsement.\n  I did not believe at the time that Saddam Hussein was an imminent \nthreat to the United States, although I never doubted that he \npossessed, or at the very least sought to possess some quantity of \nweapons of mass destruction. Clearly, nothing found in Iraq thus far \nhas caused me to change my assessment about the level of threat Iraq \nposed to the United States.\n  There is no doubt that had we gotten a U.N. endorsement for our \ncampaign, we would be in a far stronger position today to convince \nother governments to participate in ongoing peacekeeping efforts and to \nshare the costs of Iraq relief and reconstruction.\n  It is also very clear that the administration got it wrong with \nrespect to the mix of combat forces and military police that would be \nrequired for the post war phase of the operations. If there had been \nmore of a police presence at the outset, it might have served as a \ndeterrent against the vigilantism that is now occurring.\n  The Bush administration has consistently asserted that we are not \nalong in Iraq--that there is a ``coalition'' of governments helping us \nrestore security and build a democratic Iraq.\n  That really isn't the case.\n  There are currently 148,000 American troops in Iraq. The non-American \ncomponent of the military coalition is only 13,000 strong. The \nadministration states that there will be an additional 17,000 foreign \nmilitary deployed to Iraq later this summer. Should that come to pass, \nU.S. troops will still represent roughly 75 percent of the forces on \nthe ground in Iraq.\n  Moreover, if current levels of violence continue, more troops are \ngoing to be needed to stem the American casualties that are now being \nsustained--some experts estimate that double the current number of \ntroops there may be needed.\n  Where are those additional troops going to come from? I strongly urge \nthe administration to turn to the U.N. and to NATO for that assistance. \nIt is in our national security and foreign policy interests for the \nU.N. and NATO to become partners in rebuilding Iraq.\n  However, if we are unable to persuade our friends and allies to help \nin this effort, the deployment of addition U.S. troops may be needed to \nprotect those already deployed. This could include American Reservists \nand members of the National Guard. And, while I agreed in principle \nwith what my colleague, Senator Byrd, was seeking to do on Tuesday with \nan earlier amendment, namely to prevent unlimited deployments of \nreservists and members of the Guard to Iraq and Afghanistan, I was also \nconcerned about the safety of our troops.\n  Unfortunately, the fluidity of the situation in Iraq may require the \ndeployment of these forces for an unspecified time. That is why I \nreluctantly opposed that amendment.\n  Why is there such uncertainty surrounding Iraq? Because I believe \nthat U.S. policy is adrift. The administration has not been able to get \nits arms around what is going on there.\n  One day the administration says it wants to put Iraqis in charge of \ntheir own country as quickly as possible. Another day it announces that \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority, headed by retired U.S. Ambassador \nPaul Bremer, is the Government of Iraq. One day the administration \ntells us that Iraq's oil revenues will be sufficient to rebuild Iraq's \neconomy. Another day it calls for the convening of an international \ndonors conference to raise billions of additional dollars it says are \nneeded to restore Iraq's economy.\n  As this policy drifts, increasingly the Iraqi people blame America \nfor the ongoing chaos in their country. And who is the face of America \non the streets of Iraq? Americans in uniform. They have become the \ntargets.\n  Growing hostility has already cost 82 American lives since May. Every \nday we pick up the newspaper and read about another two or three \nAmerican service members being attacked or killed by unknown \nassailants. Yet the administration continues to tell us that all is \ngoing as planned.\n  And the need for administration officials to be up front with the \nAmerican people about Iraq goes beyond simply telling them how much it \nis going to cost or how many troops will be necessary.\n  It also goes to the matter of the administration's credibility--its \ncredibility about what it has told the American people concerning \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction. There are mounting questions as to \nwhether some in the administration manipulated or distorted \nintelligence in order to justify what they wanted to do for other \nreasons.\n  President Bush has hurt U.S. credibility by overstating the case \nabout the dangers of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction--particularly \nwith respect to its nuclear weapons capacity.\n  Attempts to construct a ``coalition of the willing'' within our own \nintelligence community, in order to tilt intelligence was also \ndangerous, divisive, and unnecessary. We all accepted that Saddam had a \nclear track record with respect to WMD--they didn't have to ``gild the \nlily'' with information which we now know was false. And more \nseriously, which some administration officials knew at the time to be \nfalse. Even more serious is the willingness of these officials to \npressure career intelligence analysts to sign up to conclusions about \nIraq's WMD program that they didn't believe to be accurate. This calls \ninto question the integrity of our entire intelligence community.\n  This issue does not seem to be going away. The administration has yet \nto give an acceptable explanation for what really happened or to \nidentify who was responsible. We need to get to the bottom of this and \nput in place safeguards to prevent future manipulation of intelligence. \nIt is extremely unlikely at this juncture that closed congressional \nhearings dominated by one party are going to allay the American \npeople's concerns.\n\n[[Page S9543]]\n\n  I recognize that the Byrd amendment does not attempt to address the \nintelligence issue I have just mentioned. I raise it in the context of \nthe debate on this amendment because it is part of an administration \npattern with respect to all matters related to Iraq--a pattern of \nsecrecy, stonewalling, and obfuscation.\n  With the adoption of this amendment, the Congress has sent a modest \nsignal to the administration that, at least on the spending side of our \nengagement with Iraq, we expect more transparency from our government.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 1281 \noffered by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia to H.R. 2658.\n  I am disappointed that the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota was tabled yesterday. I have been a consistent advocate of \ntransparency in our budgeting practices, and this amendment would have \ngone a long way to promoting such good practices. I am happy that we \nhave a second chance to address this issue with the amendment offered \nby the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The Office of Management and Budget recently announced that they \nexpect this year's budget deficit to reach $455 billion and predict a \n$475 billion deficit for fiscal year 2004. The estimates for fiscal \nyear 2004 do not even include the cost of operations in Iraq. Such a \ndire fiscal picture makes it even more important that we get a better \nsense of the costs of future operations and make our decisions \naccordingly.\n  When we are conducting military operations or know that such \noperations are imminent, the budget must reflect it. We should not \nblithely go along as if it were a time for business as usual. We should \nbudget responsibly for what is happening.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues about how much trouble we have \nhad trying to get realistic figures from the administration about the \ncost of the Iraqi operations. We should not be operating in the dark. \nWe must be presented with all of the facts so that our judgments on \nthese tough issues are sound. Honest budgeting demands it.\n  As my distinguished colleagues have noted, we are no longer in the \nsituation where the costs of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are \nunknown. The Secretary of Defense recently told us that we can expect \nto be spending almost $4 billion a month in Iraq and almost $1 billion \na month in Afghanistan. The Pentagon comptroller has publicly stated \nthat the administration has a good idea of what our overseas military \noperations will cost over the next year. Why are we pretending \notherwise?\n  It is interesting to note that before the operations in Iraq, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimated that occupation costs would be \nbetween $1 billion and $4 billion a month, showing that we can get \nreasonable estimates. We can use those estimates to better the \nbudgeting process.\n  We should continue to try to improve the process to ensure that we in \nthe Senate and the American people can clearly see the facts and set \npriorities accordingly.\n  This amendment is not limited to this year or to the operations in \nIraq or Afghanistan. Some may say that budgeting for potential future \noperations is not possible. I agree that predicting an exact cost is \ndifficult, but that does not mean we cannot prepare a rough estimate. \nIn fact, doing so will help us better analyze our options and make \nbetter decisions about any future engagements. The Senate wisely chose \nthis path with the recent budget resolution when it adopted the \namendment offered by myself and the senior Senator from New Jersey \nsetting aside $100 billion of the tax cut for operations in Iraq.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment. When we ask \nthe American people to support future operations they should know what \nwe expect the operations to cost. We owe the American people this \nhonesty. I commend the distinguished ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee for offering this amendment and for repeatedly \nraising important questions about the administration's policy on Iraq. \nHe has performed a valuable service, and I thank him for it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to try out a unanimous \nconsent request. There is pending my motion to table the Durbin \namendment and there is pending the Byrd amendment. The Senator from \nWest Virginia wishes to have a rollcall vote. Senator McConnell would \nlike to have 5 minutes to speak before these votes commence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we vote on the Durbin amendment \nfollowing Senator McConnell's statement of not to exceed 5 minutes, and \nthat is on or in relation to the amendment. I have made a motion to \ntable that. After that, I ask that we have a vote on Senator Byrd's \namendment, which I shall support. That will have everyone here in time \nto go and listen to the Honorable Tony Blair, if we can get started in \na few minutes.\n  I support Senator Byrd's amendment because it is a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution saying that any request for funds for the fiscal year \nfor the ongoing operations in Afghan and Iraq should be included in the \nannual budget and that any such funds provided should be provided in \nthe Appropriations Act for such fiscal year to appropriate specific \naccounts for such acts.\n  I support that concept. I do say what it really says to me is that \nthe President's budget would contain an estimate of the costs for an \nongoing operation and we would allocate the funding to the specific \naccounts subject to our approval of the estimates based upon specific \nhearings before our committee and listening to the representatives of \nthe various services of the military. I think that makes eminent sense. \nIt is a change of policy, in my judgment, and therefore it is a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution seeking the President's concurrence in that \npolicy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Kentucky be recognized \nfor 5 minutes and, following that, we vote on the amendment of Senator \nDurbin; and I ask that it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays on \nmy motion to table the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, and I do not object, I \nwonder if the Senator would mind having the vote on my amendment as the \nfirst vote. It would occur 5 minutes after the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am willing to reverse that order. I modify the request \nand ask that the Senator from Kentucky speak for 5 minutes, and \nfollowing that the vote on Senator Byrd's amendment, and following that \nthere be a vote that would occur, with a limitation of 10 minutes, on \nmy motion to table the Durbin amendment. Following the Durbin \namendment, we will be walking down the hall to go over to a joint \nsession of Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object. There would be no second-\ndegree amendments in order, right?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the yeas and nays are ordered on the motion to \ntable the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have the yeas and nays on Senator Byrd's amendment been \nordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have witnessed a parade of Democrats \ncoming to the floor to lob accusations against the President about the \nwar in Iraq. Ostensibly, they are concerned about a potentially \nmistaken piece of intelligence regarding Iraq's efforts to procure \nuranium from abroad. In their zeal to score political points, they have \nsacrificed the national interest on the altar of partisan politics and \nare making accusations that are grossly offensive against the President \nand those of us who believe--and continue to believe--that our \nliberation of Iraq was the right thing to do.\n  Senator Conrad, only hours ago, said:\n\n       This administration told the world Iraq had weapons of mass \n     destruction, that they are trying to develop nuclear \n     capability, there is a connection to al-Qaida, and each and \n     every one of those claims is now in question, every one of \n     them. It is not just 16\n\n[[Page S9544]]\n\n     words in the State of the Union. It is far more serious than \n     that.\n\n  Mr. President, that charge is stunning. It is an accusation that all \nof us who voted for the war, who viewed classified intelligence about \nIraq and who believe this war was just, should repudiate. Perhaps the \nSenator should tell the family of the Kurdish woman and her child that \nSaddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction and that we were \nwrong to have liberated his oppressed people. They will not be so \nsanguine as these Senators, because she and hundreds of fellow \nvillagers were murdered in a gas attack ordered by Saddam Hussein. This \nattack occurred in 1987. She won't be able to defend this because she \nis deceased as a result of an attack using weapons of mass destruction.\n  There were two victims of the town of Halabja, where some 5,000 died \nfrom a chemical attack in 1987. And 3,000 died that year from a similar \nchemical attack in Sumar. Another 5,000 died from mustard gas in Al \nBasrah also in that year. In fact, there are documented 10 different \noccasions upon which Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against his \nown people.\n  So it is not in doubt that Iraq was using weapons of mass \ndestruction. No one has doubted that Iraq had weapons of mass \ndestruction. I don't doubt we will find further evidence of weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq. The French didn't doubt it; the Germans \ndidn't doubt it; the Russians don't doubt it; the U.N. weapons \ninspectors never claimed Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. \nThere may have been a dispute over the best way to uncover and dispose \nof these weapons, but no responsible expert--I repeat, no responsible \nexpert--said Iraq doesn't have a weapons-of-mass-destruction program. \nNo one said that, Mr. President.\n  No responsible country confirmed that Iraq didn't have a weapons-of-\nmass-destruction program, because it was glaringly apparent that Saddam \nwas vigorously committed to obtaining and maintaining an arsenal of \nchemical, biological and, yes, nuclear weapons.\n\n  That is why the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed Resolution \n1441, which declared Iraq in material breach of its obligations under \nnumerous previous resolutions, which declared that Iraq failed to \naccount for weapons of mass destruction that it previously admitted \nhaving stockpiled. That is why Saddam Hussein never let inspectors have \nunfettered and free access to the suspect sites. Why would he have done \nall of that had he not had weapons of mass destruction? That is why he \nled inspectors on a wild goose chase through the Iraqi desert for 12 \nlong years. That is why he buried research facilities, why he \nintimidated scientists, why he removed the tongues of those who \nquestioned his regime. That is why he built the mobile biological \nweapons labs we uncovered in the Iraqi desert. He did all of those \nthings because he had weapons of mass destruction.\n  It is amazing that the very individuals who were willing to give U.N. \ninspectors up to 12 years to conduct these ``Keystone Cops'' \ninspections are now unwilling to give the United States military 10 \nweeks--not 12 years, but 10 weeks--to search for weapons of mass \ndestruction while simultaneously hunting Baath party loyalists and \nrestoring order to a nation wrecked by decades of misrule.\n  There are thousands of suspect sites capable of producing weapons of \nmass destruction and weapons-of-mass-destruction components. There are \nmillions of places in which weapons of mass destruction could be \nhidden.\n  I am confident, the President is confident, the Secretary of State is \nconfident, and the Secretary of Defense is confident that evidence of \nHussein's WMD programs will be found. But keep in mind that Iraq is a \ncountry the size of California, and that for more than a decade Hussein \nand his cronies perfected the art of concealment. Still we have already \nfound mobile biological weapons--already found--mobile biological \nweapons, various centrifuges to process uranium, and shells \nspecifically designated to hold chemical weapons. The programs are \nthere and we will find them.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of the Defense appropriations bill \nfollowing the statement of the right honorable Mr. Blair, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia be recognized to offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I make an inquiry of the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska? The Senator is prepared to accept my amendment, \nand the Senate will vote on it. Does he think that amendment will have \nany impact on the procedures? Does he think that will result in any \nchange in the procedures which we have been experiencing heretofore? It \nis a sense-of-the-senate resolution but, in his opinion, may we expect \nto see it carried out?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Respectfully, that is sort of asking me the same thing \nas the contingency question. I am prepared to argue with the Office of \nManagement and Budget and the White House that the procedures should be \nchanged. After the initiation of war Congress should have estimates, as \nindicated by the Senator's amendment. Therefore, I support it. Whether \nwe will be successful, God knows.\n  This is a 15-minute rollcall vote and will be followed by a 10-minute \nrollcall vote on the Durbin amendment. I urge Members to vote promptly \nso we may leave the body at 3:40 p.m. to listen to Mr. Blair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will take 1 minute.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for his \ncourtesies and for the cooperation he has given. He has sought to get \naction by the Senate on various and sundry amendments. He has tried to \nmove the bill forward, and he has lived up to what I think is the \nreputation of not only fairness but also of integrity. I am thankful to \nhim for accepting this amendment.\n  I was interested in his response to my question a moment ago. I \nbelieve he means what he says, and I hope he will join me in urging the \nOffice of Management and Budget and the White House to live up to the \nintent, the spirit of this amendment whether it is the current \nadministration or a following administration, which may be Democratic \nor Republican.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1281 offered by the Senator from West Virginia. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

Mr. President, fellow Senators, I think today we watched a \npiece of history made on the floor of the U.S. House in a joint meeting \nwhen Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern \nIreland, spoke to us. Not only was it a brave and proud speech, but it \nwas a speech of neighbor to neighbor, friend to friend, as truly Great \nBritain has become over the years and Tony Blair has become during this \nperiod of joint effort in Iraq.\n  In that speech, he mentioned places out West: Idaho and Nevada. Prime \nMinister Blair, Idahoans invite you to come visit, to come and meet us. \nWe are a great people, a part of this great country of which we are so \nproud. And, yes, there are Idahoans who question our outreach in \nforeign policy and scratch their heads and say: Why now? But there are \nmany of us who recognize the leadership role that we play that you \nchallenged us to today.\n  So on behalf of all of Idaho--our Governor and the congressional \ndelegation of our State--Prime Minister Blair, come see us, come visit \nus. You will find that we are a people who stand with you in your call \nto the world for leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand why the Senator from Idaho \nsaid that, but I would encourage the Senator to read a little book \ncalled ``Coming into the Country'' by McPhee. That is a book about a \nplace in Alaska where people live who the British leader says he thinks \nhe wants to talk to--in the wilds of Alaska, in the great frontier of \nAmerica.\n  The British leader thought he was going to the wilderness when he \ntalked about Idaho. If he wants to see the wilderness in this country, \nhe has to go to Alaska today. That is where 77 percent of the federally \ndeclared wilderness exists.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in commending the distinguished \nPrime Minister for his eloquent remarks in which I think he captured \nthe essence of what all of us would like to see in the coming weeks and \nmonths and years; that is, a joint coalition of peaceful, liberty-\nloving nations to address the scourge of terrorism. I think he properly \ndescribed what needs to be done by leaders of this Nation and others \naround the globe if we are going to succeed in that effort.\n  It was also wonderful to hear the English language spoken with such \neloquence. It was refreshing not to see a teleprompter, I might add, \nand to hear a political leader with a sense of humor, a sense of \ncommitment and passion, and a deep sense of understanding of the values \nthat our two nations have shared--and, as he properly described, not \nWestern values but human values of freedom-loving peoples everywhere.\n  I join my colleague from Alaska, and others, in thanking the Prime \nMinister for his eloquence, for his commitment, for his friendship, and \nfor his loyalty. I look forward to a continuing relationship with this \nremarkable leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have never heard a speech that \nbetter charted the values of free peoples--not only of free peoples in \nour country but I think free peoples all over the world. I have never \nheard a speech that was as incredibly positive as this speech, that\n\n[[Page S9546]]\n\ncalled on everyone to rise to their best value, to stand to their best \ncommitment, and to perform as free-loving peoples should everywhere.\n  On a scale of 1 to 10, Mr. President, that speech, in my book, was a \n10. I have never heard better. And I have never seen a course charted \nthat is sounder, truer, or can redound in better benefits for freedom-\nloving people.\n  I salute Tony Blair, the distinguished Prime Minister of the United \nKingdom.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in commending the \nPrime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair, for his outstanding, \narticulate, and insightful remarks.\n  While we worry sometimes on minutia, he brought back the \ninternational global perspective while we are in the midst of a war \nagainst terrorism.\n  These were historic remarks that I think got us, as Americans, \nrenovated, invigorated, and re-resolved in this war on terror. He also \nserved, I think for us as Americans and the United States, as a bridge \nto our friends in Europe. While most of them were with us in this most \nrecent conflict in Iraq, some were not. But there are so many of those \nshared values that bring us together. Indeed, Prime Minister Blair \nbrought those forward. While in some areas the Germans and the French \nare helping, we want others to join in the United Nations and NATO.\n  I would say the most important things the Prime Minister mentioned \nwere not that we have shared interests in trade or shared interests in \nsecurity but that we have a shared love of individual liberty.\n  And if Thomas Jefferson--not a very well-loved person, I am sure, in \nGreat Britain--were on that floor of the House just a moment ago, he \nwould have said: Well done, Mr. Prime Minister. Those are good, sound \nJeffersonian principles that he advocated.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise very briefly to state the obvious \nand what everyone else has stated. The Prime Minister made a remarkable \nspeech today. We should listen to our friends. I took away much of what \nothers did as well, but I took away one very important message we heard \nfrom a friend; that is, don't give up on Europe, that France and \nGermany are our friends.\n  By reference, Mr. Kagan and those who believe Europe is an \nanachronism and is an ``Old Europe'' are dead wrong, and that if Europe \nand the United States stand together, the world will stand with us. If \nEurope and the United States are divided, the world will be divided. It \nis that basic.\n  I hope everyone listened to not only the rhetoric but to the \nsubstance of his message. The substance of his message: The neo-\nconservative notion that Europe is no longer an asset, that Europe no \nlonger shares our values, will be the very thing that will undo this \ngreat country of ours. We are united. We are together. We have to work \non it. And if we stand together, the world will stand with us.\n  For that, I thank the Prime Minister for delivering his message and \nreminding us, his friends, of how valuable that alliance is. There is \nnone more valuable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I echo the comments of the senior Senator \nfrom Delaware and recognize his expertise as a former chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee and assure him that I took the same message \nhe did, that Tony Blair is trying to remind us all of that which we \ninstinctively know: the importance of friends.\n  I took great pleasure in the fact that he cited America's history in \nestablishing friends and, indeed, spoke a little bit against his own \nhistory when he talked about empires that sought for land or territory \nor power but that the Americans seek only to export liberty to those \nplaces where it has not yet taken hold. And that is the cause around \nwhich the entire world must repair.\n  I would add one other thought to the thoughts that have been made. I \nagree with the Senator from California that was the best explanation \nshe has ever heard in a speech. And I must add, not only is it the best \none that I have ever heard, that includes speeches I have given, which, \nfor a politician, is a tough thing to have to admit.\n  I was struck by his comment that I think should resonate throughout \nthe current debate, and that is the debate over Iraq, the motivations \nfor going into Iraq, the prelude that built up to the decision in Iraq; \nthat is, when he said, as best I can recall: If we were wrong, all we \nhave done is free a people from a horrible tyrant and brought freedom \nto millions, and history will forgive us that error. But if we were \nright, history would not forgive us for hesitating, if we had done so.\n  I think while he was not injecting himself into the debate here in \nAmerica at the time, that summary is the best I have heard of the way \nwe should be conducting our examination of the decision to go forward \nin Iraq. If, in fact, the decision was built on some flawed \nassumptions, the results of the decision are still worth it.\n  But if the assumptions turn out not to have been flawed and we \ndiscover, in fact, that things were as we had anticipated, I agree with \nthe Prime Minister that history would treat us very badly if we had \nwalked away from that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks that \nhave gone on before. It was a truly inspiring speech. I think there is \na little bit of irony to the fact that we have a Brit inspire us on \nfreedom and liberty. That was the most inspiring speech I have heard \nsince Margaret Thatcher did the same thing. They somehow have the \nability to look into our past and explain our present and move us on \ninto the future. I appreciate the fact that he was here and spoke and \nshared those words with us. It was awe inspiring.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry: Has the time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five o'clock has arrived. The time for morning \nbusiness has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator seek to speak in morning business?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would like to speak for about 1 minute.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Tennessee \nmay speak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I believe Tony Blair taught us a lot \nabout the world. I think he taught us more about ourselves. His speech \nwas historic, but it will be remembered more because it reminded us of \nwhat it means to be an American. The assistant Democratic leader and I \nand other Senators have worked on legislation this year to put back \ninto its rightful place in our schools the teaching of American \nhistory. I would suggest that in the first chapter of those textbooks \nwe put Tony Blair's speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know that euphoria is here, and Tony Blair \nrendered a great speech. I thought it was tremendous. But I have to \nrecall the speeches President Clinton gave. I can remember during those \nspeeches that there were times when I didn't realize I was listening to \na speech. President Reagan was really good. And Tony Blair, of course, \nwas extremely good. I was so impressed when he did it without a \nteleprompter; he did it from his written speech. He was very \nimpressive. When I met him an hour or so ago, I introduced myself and \nsaid I was a Senator from Nevada, Las Vegas and Reno. He said at that \ntime he had always wanted to go to Nevada. And so when he was searching \nfor a State to identify in his speech, I am glad he mentioned Nevada. I \nsay to my friend from Idaho, who has invited him to Idaho, I certainly \nhave no objection to the Prime Minister of Great Britain going to \nIdaho, but I am confident he will stop in Nevada as well.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, someone told me they thought it was a \nnice thing to have conservatives applaud a liberal. Do you know, when I \nlistened to Tony Blair, I didn't think about being conservative or \nliberal. I thought about the fact that here is a man who has had \nadmitted difficulties in his own country but was willing to come on our \nstage and tell us he believes in American principles and he is willing \nto be a\n\n[[Page S9547]]\n\npartner with us. That is a sign of a great man. I think he is a great \nleader for the world as well as for Great Britain. I hope that people \ndon't think of it as a speech of a liberal or even of a conservative. \nHe was speaking to us as Americans and bringing out the best in us. I \nreally am delighted that we gave him the opportunity to speak to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9547-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9547-S9558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004--Continued\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are awaiting an amendment to be \noffered. I hope Senators will come and bring their amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished comanager of the \nbill, we are waiting for Senator Byrd to come and offer his two \namendments, one dealing with adding some money to the bill, the other \ndealing with adding some money for AIDS, rearranging the bill, I should \nsay.\n  The Senator from Delaware is considering offering an amendment and \nalso the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and Senator Schumer. \nI would say to those Senators or their staffs who are within the sound \nof my voice that Senator Byrd is not here. I am sure we could move \nforward on one of their amendments. I would recommend that they work \ntheir way to the floor or at least call the cloakroom so we can get \nthem lined up to offer one of their amendments. There is really a down \ntime here now.\n  I think it would be to everyone's advantage that we move forward on \nthis most important bill. As has been indicated, we are going to \ncertainly try to finish this bill tonight. It appears we can do so. We \ndon't have a lot of amendments remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. What is the will of the Senate?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1283\n\n  (Purpose: To rescind $1,100,000,000 of the amounts appropriated for \n  procurement and research, development, test and evaluation, and to \n  appropriate $1,100,000,000 for fighting AIDS/HIV, tuberculosis, and \n                                malaria)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I shall send to \nthe desk shortly.\n  This January, in his State of the Union Address, President Bush \nannounced a 5-year, $15 billion global AIDS initiative. The President \nreceived a lot of praise for that announcement, as he should have. AIDS \nis a dreadful disease which is currently inflicting an almost \nunimaginable toll on the African continent, devastating entire \npopulations.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than \nany other part of the world. According to UNAIDS--the Joint United \nNations Program on HIV/AIDS--in 2002, there were 29.4 million people \nliving with HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Africa has about 10 \npercent of the world's population but more than 70 percent of the \nworldwide total of infected people. In fact, the infection rate among \nadults is about 8.8 percent in Africa, compared with 1.2 percent \nworldwide.\n  More than 17 million Africans have died from AIDS since its \nemergence, and UNAIDS estimates that by 2020, an additional 55 million \nAfricans will lose their lives to the epidemic. The sheer brutality of \nthese statistics is hard to fathom and must tug at the hearts and souls \nof all of us in this body.\n  AIDS' severe social and economic consequences are depriving Africa of \nskilled workers and teachers while reducing life expectancy by decades \nin some countries. An estimated 11 million children in Africa have been \norphaned by AIDS--having literally watched their AIDS-inflicted parents \nslowly slip away before their eyes. These AIDS orphans are now facing \nincreased risk of malnutrition and reduced prospects for education. \nAIDS is being blamed for declines in agricultural production in some \nnations, and is regarded as a major contributor to the famine \nthreatening southern Africa. The United Nations Development Programme \nAnnual Report for 2003 states that, ``HIV/AIDS is a catastrophe for \neconomic stability and may be the world's most serious development \ncrisis.''\n  For far too long, the world has turned a blind eye to the suffering \non the African continent. Does the United States, as the wealthiest \nNation on Earth, not have a special moral responsibility to act to \nalleviate some of the worldwide misery caused by AIDS? Americans have \nalways been generous and caring people, and I have no doubt that they \nwould expect their elected officials to rise to the occasion and take \nthe lead in ridding the world of this horrid disease, wherever it takes \nroot.\n  I am pleased by Congress' initial response to the President's call \nfor action to combat the AIDS crisis in Africa--with passage of the \nUnited States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \nAct of 2003. And I was encouraged that our President publicly touted \nthe legislation's passage as a moral triumph.\n  However, I have seen far too many fancy White House bill signing \nceremonies and dressed-up press releases in the last 2\\1/2\\ years to be \nentirely confident that this Administration would simply keep its \npromise to fully fund this legislation. Once the cameras stop rolling \nand the headlines fade away, this administration seems to have \nestablished a troubling pattern of repeatedly making promises but \nfailing to deliver the dollars needed to keep them. The drastically \nunderfunded No Child Left Behind Act and the President's skimpy funding \nrequests to meet our homeland security needs are perfect examples.\n  Last week, as President Bush visited five African countries, he again \npledged that the United States would play a leading role in combating \nAIDS. The President repeatedly promised to do all in his power to make \nsure that Congress fully financed his proposed 5-year, $15 billion \nprogram to attack the disease in the world's poorest countries. I \ncommend him for having gone to Africa, and for promoting greater \nefforts to fight AIDS.\n  He should be held to his commitment to those in Africa who are \nsuffering from AIDS.\n  Clearly, an expectation has been created that the administration and \nCongress will provide $3 billion toward this noble initiative in fiscal \nyear 2004, as language explicitly authorizing that amount for fiscal \nyear 2004 is spelled out in the new Global AIDS law that the President \nproudly signed.\n  Unfortunately, despite all the recent headlines, photo-ops, and White \nHouse promises regarding the African AIDS crisis, the simple fact \nremains that the President did not put enough money behind his \npromises, as he failed to include $3 billion to fight AIDS in his \nfiscal year 2004 budget. That is right! He requested only $1.9 billion, \nnot the $3 billion that the world now expects. That is $1.1 billion \nless than what he promised.\n  Just last Thursday, Members of this body went on record, by a vote of \n78-to-18, in support of a Sense of the Congress Resolution that stated \nour intent to provide full appropriations for the $15 billion AIDS \ninitiative touted by our President, including $3 billion in fiscal year \n2004.\n  The lives of millions worldwide are at stake. Now is the time to \nhonor the financial commitment made by Congress and the President to \ncombat Global AIDS. My amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill \nwould do just that by allocating $750 million in fiscal year 2004 to \nthe Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/\nAIDS Globally for the purpose of making a contribution to the Global \nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and $350 million for the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services for programs to combat AIDS \noverseas. This amendment would be completely offset by a $1.1 billion \nacross-the-board cut in the amounts appropriated for the Department of \nDefense under Titles III and IV of this legislation for Procurement, as \nwell as for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation.\n  The bill before the Senate includes $73,976,000,000 in procurement \nspending,\n\n[[Page S9548]]\n\nan amount that is $1,255,000,000 above the President's request. This \nbill also includes $63,565,000,000 for research and development \nprograms, a level that is $1,738,000,000 above the President's request. \nCertainly, the Senate should be willing to reduce the current \nprocurement and research funding by less than eight-tenths of 1 percent \nin order to fulfill the President's promise. It is his promise. He had \npledged our Nation's help with one of the most dreaded and destructive \nscourges on the globe. But he is trying to shift the burden to Congress \nto make up the difference in the underfunded budget request. Congress \nshould step up to this challenge and appropriate the money that we have \nalready authorized by an overwhelming vote.\n  My amendment would allow us to fulfill the humanitarian promise made \nby our Government to fight the worst public health crisis that history \nhas ever known with a total $3 billion appropriation in fiscal year \n2004.\n  This amendment would help to alleviate some of the misery endured by \nmillions of AIDS-inflicted families around the globe for roughly what \nwe spend in a single day to fund the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, AIDS is a catastrophe for millions around the globe. \nWhat better message can we send than to reduce our behemoth military \nbudget ever so slightly in order to keep our national word to help \nfight this dread disease. It is the right thing to do. It is the noble \nthing to do. Let's do it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that the following cosponsors be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, \n     Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Corzine and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1283:\n       On page 120, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n\n                         (rescission of funds)\n\n       Sec. 8124. (a) Of the amounts appropriated under titles III \n     and IV of this Act, $1,100,000,000 is hereby rescinded. The \n     Secretary of Defense shall allocate the rescinded amount \n     proportionately by program, project, and activity.\n       (b) In addition to other amounts appropriated or otherwise \n     made available under this Act, funds are hereby appropriated \n     to the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2004 in the \n     total amount of $1,100,000,000.\n       (c) Of the amount appropriated under subsection (b), the \n     Secretary shall transfer $750,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended, to the Coordinator of United States \n     Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally, for an \n     additional contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis and Malaria, which shall be expended at the \n     minimum rate necessary to make timely payment for projects \n     and activities.\n       (d) Of the amount appropriated under subsection (b), the \n     Secretary shall transfer $350,000,000 to the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services for global HIV/AIDS programs of the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National \n     Institutes of Health.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the cosponsors are Senators Clinton, Pryor, \nLautenberg, Murray, and Corzine. I ask they be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, AIDS has been a matter of attention by \nour subcommittee since 1982. It was our subcommittee that initiated the \nfirst AIDS research with public funds that I know of in the world. That \nresearch is still going on by the Department of Defense. We were \nlooking for some way to prevent the transmission of AIDS. I am sad to \nsay we have not been successful.\n  In the period just prior to our bill in the eighties, I had listened \nto a lecture at the Cosmos Club where the lecturer had predicted we \nwould witness AIDS becoming a plague--more than an epidemic; it \nactually would become a plague. That prediction has become too true, \nand the President has committed $15 billion over a period of 3 years \nfor our contributions to the AIDS program.\n  We have in our budget so far total spending of $2.4 billion that is \ndirected to global AIDS spending. I am trying to get the total figures. \nI think we have over another $2 billion in our total budget directed \ntoward AIDS spending.\n  It is true that money is going to agencies other than USAID, but in \nforeign operations, there is $1.5 billion, and Labor, Health and Human \nServices has $683 million.\n  My point is, we have an enormous amount of money in the bill before \nus already for AIDS spending. I am compelled to oppose the Senator's \namendment because it transfers from defense procurement and research \nand development programs to another bill, the Health and Human Services \nbill and the Agency for International Development, which is in a third \nbill, the State-Justice-Commerce bill, portions of money allocated by \nour committee to those two other subcommittees. In effect, Senator \nByrd's amendment would transfer from the Defense Department to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the Department of State \n$1.1 billion.\n  I have to oppose this amendment in the first place because I believe \nwe have already met the commitment of the President. There is no reason \nI know of to accelerate that and provide more than the $3 billion. We \nhave already committed to--as a matter of fact, because of the request \ninitially, I believe we have in excess of $4 billion in this budget \navailable to us for AIDS already.\n  The fund the Senator from West Virginia would take the money from is \nfor the modernization of our aircraft. We are trying to modernize this \nforce. We need to replace aging C-130s and the aging C-46 helicopters. \nWe have an enormous number of vehicles and aircraft that have to be \nreplaced because of the damage they have suffered from activities in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  The modernization funding in this account is also for the National \nGuard and Reserve. We all have some real concern over the amount of \nmoney that is already available for those activities. Bluntly, I do not \nthink we can afford to take $1.1 billion out of defense and put it into \nthe Department of State and the Department of Health and Human \nServices, or Education--wherever it goes--at this time.\n  We are going to lose a sizable number of the weapons systems we would \notherwise modernize or replace with this $1 billion. I call attention \nparticularly to the fact that despite the authorization and request of \nthe President, we were unable to fund the F-18 fighter the \nadministration seeks to procure. We are unable to fund the total amount \nof F-22s. We have reduced the number of ships in the Virginia class \nfrom seven to five. I am already mentally confused over why we have to \nbe so constricted, but that was the problem in the overall budget. We \nalready have taken $3.1 billion out of the Defense budget and spread it \nthrough the nondefense budgets in order to meet the objections that \nwere raised by so many Senators to the allocations we initially \nintended to make without that $3.1 billion. This would make it $4.2 \nbillion out of Defense.\n  I say to my friend from West Virginia, we just cannot do that. There \nis no way we can take any more money out of the funds we have set aside \nto replace the aging fighters, helicopters, and the equipment that was \ndamaged or destroyed in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We do have a letter from Dr. O'Neill, the Director of Office of \nNational AIDS Policy. He says this:\n\n       By careful design, the President's 2004 budget request is \n     for $2 billion--\n\n  On this set-aside fund. As I said, our accounting is that set-aside \nfund for global activities is $2.241 billion.\n  In any event, to continue Mr. O'Neill's letter, he said:\n\n       This request was based on the sound judgment that funds in \n     excess of this amount could not be spent effectively in this \n     first year. These funds will be spent in a focused manner, \n     increasing each year, to efficiently and effectively create \n     the necessary training, technology, and infrastructure base \n     needed to ensure delivery of appropriate medical treatment \n     protocols and the long-term success of this initiative.\n\n  He stated in another paragraph, and I am pulling sentences out of \nthis letter:\n\n       For the reasons stated above, the administration strongly \n     opposes any efforts to increase funding beyond the $2 billion \n     requested in the President's FY 2004 budget.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record in \nfull after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Prior to the President's initiative, the total for AIDS\n\n[[Page S9549]]\n\nwas $1.2 billion. It is my judgment, because of the amount of money we \nare spending in all the other agencies to increase our knowledge and \nability to deal with AIDS, that this is a proper amount of money. We \nhave the commitment that this money will increase as we get more and \nmore people trained.\n  We listened to the Secretary of State the other morning tell us about \nthe problem we have in finding people to train and help with the \nmedical problems of the people we are dealing with in terms of AIDS \nthroughout Africa in particular. I thought it was a very moving \nresponse he gave to the questions about AIDS.\n  Very clearly, right now there are two issues in the amendment of the \nSenator. First, I believe we have met the initial year's objective for \nthe President's global initiative on AIDS. I believe we have an \noverwhelming amount of money in the total bills before the Congress \nthis year, all 13 appropriations bills, on AIDS. Further, the way the \nSenator from West Virginia wants to offset this amount, in my judgment, \nwill bring great harm to the area of modernization of our aging \nequipment and the replacement of the equipment that has been damaged \nand destroyed by war.\n  So I am forced to say to the Senator from West Virginia that I am \ncompelled to make a motion to table his amendment at an appropriate \ntime. I certainly do not want to do that before my friend has had a \nchance to make any comments he wants to make about my comments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the schedule of the projection of \nspending for global AIDS be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S.G.

It shows in 2004, $2.040 billion; in 2005, there is \n$2.540 billion; in 2006, there is $3.090 billion; in 2007, $3.690 \nbillion; in 2008, $3.890 billion. In all, the total is $15.250 billion \nover the 5-year period. This is a commitment that we will keep.\n  I think it is wise to start this program on a sound basis. This \nsummary I have had prepared shows all treatment of AIDS and all of our \nprograms other than defense.\n  The last chart I want to put in the Record shows zero for defense, as \nfar as AIDS is concerned.

Does the Senator from West Virginia wish to make an \nadditional statement before I make a motion to table?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I do, and there are other Senators who wish to speak \non this.\n  Has the Senator yielded the floor?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I have.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Frist: It is my understanding that an amendment \n     regarding funding for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria may \n     be offered today to the Department of Defense FY2004 \n     appropriations bill currently under consideration on the \n     Senate floor.\n       I want to reiterate the Administration's strong support for \n     the FY2004 budget request of $2 billion for all international \n     HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria activities, including $200 \n     million for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and \n     Malaria. This request is a solid first step in fulfilling the \n     President's commitment of providing $15 billion over the next \n     five years to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa, the \n     Caribbean and around the world.\n       I recently finished traveling to Africa with the President \n     where he saw first-hand the positive impact that current U.S. \n     funding is having in caring for the sick, providing treatment \n     for individuals living with HIV/AIDS and extending lives. He \n     also witnessed\n\n[[Page S9550]]\n\n     the vast infrastructure and capacity challenges that need to \n     be addressed in order to scale-up many of these efforts.\n       It is by careful design that the President's FY2004 budget \n     request is for $2 billion. This request was based on the \n     sound judgment that funds in excess of this amount could not \n     be spend effectively in this first year. These funds will be \n     spent in a focused manner, increasing each year, to \n     efficiently and effectively create the necessary training, \n     technology, and infrastructure based needed to ensure \n     delivery of appropriate medical treatment protocols and the \n     long term success of this initiative.\n       These funds are vital to our efforts to combat HIV/AIDS \n     abroad, but must be spent in the right way, at the right \n     time. Similarly, efforts to increase funding to the Global \n     Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria are not appropriate at \n     this time. Currently, the United States is responsible for \n     over 40% of all contributions made to the Global Fund. We \n     have reached a critical time in the Global Fund's \n     development, and other nations must join the U.S. in \n     supporting the work of the Global Fund.\n       For the reasons stated above, the Administration strongly \n     opposes any efforts to increase funding beyond the $2 billion \n     requested in the President's FY2004 budget. I appreciate your \n     unwavering leadership on this issue and look forward to the \n     continued strong bipartisan support of the Senate in ensuring \n     the success of this lifesaving initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Dr. Joseph F. O'Neill,\n                         Director, Office of National AIDS Policy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is ample precedent for across-the-\nboard cuts in the Defense bill. In fact, the language is taken out of \nsection 8135 of the fiscal year 2002 Defense Appropriations Act. Even \nwith these cuts, the procurement, research, and development accounts \nremain $2 billion above the President's request and $6.7 billion above \nfiscal year 2003. So the procurement, research, and development \naccounts are robustly funded.\n  This amendment provides the funds called for in the 78-to-18 vote \nlast week on the State Department authorization which called for $3 \nbillion.\n  I understand Senator Harkin wishes to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Byrd. This amendment fulfills a promise we made to \nthe entire world to fund the global AIDS initiative. When I say ``we,'' \nI mean all of us--the Congress and the President of the United States. \nPresident Bush made this promise to fund the global AIDS initiative at \n$15 billion, $3 billion per year for 5 years, in his State of the Union \nAddress last January. I was there. I remember when he said it.\n  I remember after the President made that commitment, everyone--\nRepublicans and Democrats, House Members and Senators--all stood and \ngave him a prolonged standing applause for that commitment. The \nPresident even signed a bill authorizing this money. We passed a bill \nsaying, yes, we authorize it.\n  Recently, the President has traveled through Africa restating this \ncommitment, and I was quite taken by the President's words in Africa \nsaying we were going to meet our commitment and we would provide the $3 \nbillion this year. Yet the President neglected to include this full \nfunding in his budget for this initiative. Rather than calling for $3 \nbillion in 2004 that was promised and authorized, the President's \nbudget calls for a mere $1.9 billion, falling far short of the promises \nhe made and we made.\n  Yet the President is in Africa saying we are going to provide $3 \nbillion. Basically, I think he said we have provided $3 billion. That \nis what is authorized. We know around here you can authorize anything \nbut until the Appropriations Committee appropriates the money it is \nmeaningless.\n\n  Here is the President saying we came up with the $3 billion to fight \nAIDS in Africa, the African leaders applaud him, thanking him for that, \nand yet he only put $1.9 billion in the budget.\n  Millions of people experience pain and suffering caused by the AIDS \nepidemic. People around the world are being robbed of healthy and \nproductive lives. This epidemic is ravaging families, communities, and \neconomies across the globe, nowhere more so than in Africa. The United \nStates has a responsibility to fulfill the promise we made.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia would uphold \nour commitment, our promise, to fight the AIDS epidemic and our promise \nto adequately fund the initiative. This amendment offered by Senator \nByrd provides the full $3 billion for 2004, the full $3 billion that \nthe President was taking credit for and touting in his recent trip to \nAfrica. This would be offset by taking the $1.1 billion from the \namounts appropriated for the Defense Department procurement and \nresearch account. The amendment by Senator Byrd would add to the $1.9 \nbillion the amount of $1.1 billion to bring it to the $3 billion level \npromised by President Bush on his recent trip to Africa.\n  Let me be clear: This money is not coming out of the salaries of our \ntroops or the support for our troops. It is not coming out of our work \nin Afghanistan. This money comes from two titles of the Defense \nappropriations bill that include $1.25 billion more than the \nPresident's budget request.\n  We are spending in this bill about $1 billion a day for the Armed \nForces, for defense. There is no excuse to deny the AIDS initiative \nthat we promised, the President promised, the President touted so \nearnestly on his trip through Africa. There is no excuse to deny the \n$1.1 billion more a year to bring it to the $3 billion level.\n  Again, sometimes I am sure people wonder about what we are doing. The \naverage American probably does not understand the difference between an \nauthorization and appropriation. What is the difference? That is where \nthe confusion is.\n  Last week the Senate overwhelmingly voted 78 to 18 in support of a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution stating that the global AIDS initiative \nshould be fully funded. That means we should fund it at the $3 billion \nlevel.\n  Now the Senate needs to put its money where its mouth is. This is the \namendment by which we can do it. It does not detract anything from our \ntroops. It comes out of an account that is even $1.25 billion more than \nthe President's budget request.\n  We all just returned from a joint session of Congress and we listened \nto Prime Minister Tony Blair speak. I thought it was a fine speech; \nmaybe even more than that. I thought it was a very good speech in all \nof its aspects. But there was one aspect that pertains to what this \namendment is about. Prime Minister Blair said at one point in his \nspeech that we cannot--we, being the United States--walk away from our \nother commitments in the world aside from national security. He \nmentioned specifically the AIDS catastrophe that is happening \nthroughout Africa. He said we have to meet our commitments and our \nresponsibilities there, and he got a standing ovation for that.\n  It is nice to give standing ovations to the Prime Minister of Great \nBritain when he says we should meet our responsibilities to meet the \nAIDS crisis. It is nice to vote for a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nthat says we should fully fund it. It is nice to even vote for the \nauthorizing bill authorizing we fully fund it.\n  But there is another thing that Prime Minister Blair said that I \nthought was worth noting. I am paraphrasing because I don't have the \nspeech; I am just remembering it. He said something about our \nreputation, about making sure we stood strong for what we believed in \nand that we stand up to what we have committed to. If we do not, then \nwhat is the rest of the world going to think? They will think, OK, that \nis what the United States says but the only thing the United States \never backs up is military action. I hope it does not boil down to that, \nthat the only thing we ever back up in terms of commitments is a \nmilitary commitment. We ought to look upon the other commitments in the \nsame light. Once we make the commitment and we make the promise, we \nfulfill it and we keep it. This is one that compels us to give an \noverwhelming vote to the amendment offered by Senator Byrd. This is the \namendment that does it.\n  I know there will be arguments saying we cannot take it out of \ndefense. As I pointed out, it comes out of an account that is $1.25 \nbillion more than what the President even requested.\n  Now is the time to stand up and be counted. Now is the time to back \nup our reputation for being a caring nation and for being a nation that \nstands behind its word. We gave our word. The President, 2 weeks ago, \ngave his word in Africa for $3 billion and yet we have\n\n[[Page S9551]]\n\nonly come up with $1.9 billion. Now is the time to come up with the \nfull $3 billion.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator have a quote that the President would \nspend $3 billion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't have the quote but I will get it for you in a \nshort amount of time. The President, if I remember right, said in \nAfrica that we have--again, I am paraphrasing; I don't know if I have \nthe right word--but we have pledged $3 billion this year to fight AIDS \nin Africa. He said that in Africa.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to see that. I would be happy to see that \nquote.\n  I don't want to interrupt the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will get my staff to run it down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President I will speak for a very few minutes on \nthis same issue and indicate my strong support for the amendment \nSenator Byrd has offered.\n  As my colleague, Senator Harkin, indicated, I strongly support this \namendment. I believe this is the obvious follow-on to the vote we had \nlast week where 78 Members of the Senate agreed when appropriations \nbills did come to the Senate we would vote to fully appropriate the \nfunds that were authorized in the United States Leadership Against HIV/\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003. That was legislation we \npassed earlier this year that I strongly supported. It did provide $15 \nbillion worth of funds. It authorized $15 billion worth of funding for \nthis purpose. It was a follow-on to the President's State of the Union \nspeech.\n\n  In the State of the Union speech, the President committed this \ncountry to this initiative. I strongly supported it. Then, as a follow-\non to that State of the Union speech, we passed the authorizing \nlegislation which, as I understood it, said we will appropriate $3 \nbillion a year for 5 years in order to fight this terrible epidemic of \ninfectious disease we see around the world.\n  From my perspective, the question is whether we consider this to be \nan urgent problem. If we do consider it to be an urgent problem, then I \nthink the funding that was laid out in that authorization bill is the \nright funding. I was surprised to hear the quotations from the letter \nDr. O'Neill has sent on behalf of the administration indicating the \nadministration does not want $3 billion this first year, 2004. It does \nnot want $3 billion the second year, 2005. And only in the later years \nis the administration going to be requesting $3 billion or more in \norder to make up the full $15 billion.\n  That would be an appropriate approach to a problem that is not \nurgent. That would be an appropriate approach to a problem we can just \nas well deal with 3 years from now as today. But this issue is not that \ntype of problem. This is an urgent problem. Accordingly, I think it is \nentirely appropriate that we try to fund this AIDS initiative the way \nit was designed in the authorizing legislation, the way the President \nsigned off on it in the authorizing legislation, and the way I thought \nall of us had agreed to proceed with it.\n  The statistics are devastating. We have gone through those to great \nlengths here, the number of teachers who are being lost because of HIV/\nAIDS, the number of people who are going untreated with HIV/AIDS in \nAfrica because of lack of resources. The global AIDS fund is \ndesperately in need of additional resources. We have committed $200 \nmillion rather than the full $1 billion that was anticipated we would \ncommit this year.\n  We can, obviously, fall back on a 5-year plan and say: Look, we never \ndid intend to give you $3 billion the first couple of years. We are \nsorry if you misunderstood us. But the truth is most Members of \nCongress and I think most Members of the Senate--I certainly can speak \nfor myself. When I voted for the authorizing legislation, I assumed we \nwere going to appropriate the funds we were authorizing in that bill on \nthat schedule in order to get to the $15 billion. That was my \nassumption.\n  I can understand the reluctance to take any funds out of the defense \nbudgets. I have supported defense budgets virtually every year since I \nhave been in the Senate. I intend to support the budget again this \nyear. But this is a very small amount. This is funding which can \nreadily be replaced in a supplemental. There will be a defense \nsupplemental down the road. We have all talked about that. Most of the \ndiscussion in the last 2 days is how we have the defense supplemental \ncoming. We have already passed one this year. We will have another one \nnext year. This is a very appropriate place for us to identify some \nfunds we can use for this urgent need.\n  In its January 2000 report, The Global Infectious Disease Threat and \nIts Implications for the United States, the CIA noted that over the \nnext 20 years HIV/AIDS and associated diseases in sub-Saharan Africa \nwould:\n\n       . . . kill up to a quarter of their populations . . . (and) \n     this will further impoverish the poor . . . and produce a \n     huge and impoverished orphan cohort unable to cope and \n     vulnerable to exploitation and radicalization.\n\n  The estimate predicted increased political instability and slower \ndemocratic development as a result of AIDS.\n  According to the World Bank:\n\n       The illness and impending death of up to 25 percent of all \n     adults in some countries will have an enormous impact on \n     national productivity and earnings. Labor productivity is \n     likely to drop, the benefits of education will be lost, and \n     resources that would have been used for investments will be \n     used for health care, orphan care, and funerals. Savings \n     rates will decline, and the loss of human capital will affect \n     production and the quality of life for years to come.\n\n  More than 30 percent of teachers are HIV positive in parts of Malawi \nand Uganda, 20 percent in Zambia, and 12 percent in South Africa. AIDS \nis killing people at middle and upper levels of management in both \nbusiness and government; the trained personnel to replace them are not \navailable.\n  Without a workforce, there is no productivity. Without productivity, \na country's economy quickly deteriorates and the government collapses \ninto chaos. All too often, terrorism and fanaticism springs forth from \nthis chaos and begin to spread outwards from its birthplace, inflicting \ndamage and destruction on other countries.\n  HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria are threats not just to the developing \ncountries whose citizens have been ravaged by these diseases, but they \nare also threats to regional and international stability. AIDS, TB, and \nmalaria claim the lives of 15,000 Africans each and every day. Every \nmonth that goes by in Africa, close to half a million people die from \nthese diseases.\n  AIDS has serious implications for issues of security in Africa, since \nHIV infection rates in many armies is extremely high. Domestic \npolitical stability is threatened when security forces become unable to \nperform their duties due to AIDS. Peacekeeping efforts on the part of \nmore stable African nations are at risk as well as rates of infection \namong the peacekeeping troops grow. While he was in Nigeria last week, \nPresident Bush said:\n\n       We will not allow terrorists to threaten African peoples or \n     to use Africa as a base to threaten the world.\n\n  If we underfund the efforts to fight HIV/AIDS and its associated \ndisease, we will be allowing just that.\n  The HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria pandemic in Africa is an international \nemergency. While visiting Botswana last week, President Bush declared:\n\n       This is the deadliest enemy Africa has ever faced, and you \n     will not face this enemy alone.\n\n  Congress conveyed the same message last week in passing an amendment \nthat asserted its belief that nothing short of full funding for HIV/\nAIDS, TB, and malaria should be appropriated. The Byrd amendment allows \nus to do just that, and to do so without cutting vital services to \nother international health programs. The funding to do this would \nresult from a .079 percent cut for all programs and activities within \nTitle III and Title IV. These two Titles are receiving $3 billion more \nin funding than President Bush requested in his budget for fiscal year \n2004. The Byrd amendment allows full funding for international HIV/\nAIDS, TB, and malaria programs. It allows the promise made to be a \npromise kept. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n[[Page S9552]]\n\n  HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria are threats not just to the developing \ncountries whose citizens have been ravaged by these diseases, but they \nare also threats to regional and international stability. AIDS, TB, and \nmalaria claim the lives of 15,000 Africans each and every day. Every \nmonth that goes by in Africa, close to half a million people die from \nthese diseases.\n  I hope very much we can support the amendment of Senator Byrd. I hope \nit will get the same 78 votes we got for the sense-of-the-Congress \nresolution last week when we talked about whether we were going to \nappropriate money on the same schedule and at the same level we had \nauthorized money in the earlier legislation this year.\n  I commend the Senator from West Virginia for his amendment. I will \ncertainly support it and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Senator \nByrd's amendment which I have cosponsored.\n  The Senate worked hard and passed the Global AIDS Initiative back in \nMay. At the President's request, this bipartisan authorization bill \ncalls for $15 billion to help fight the spread of HIV and AIDS in \nAfrica. The bill authorized $3 billion for this fight this year. This \nmoney is desperately needed.\n  Approximately 29 million people, including 10 million people between \nthe ages of 15 to 24 and 3 million children under the age of 15, are \ncurrently living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. The future spread of this \nepidemic depends in large measure on whether the world will accurately \nteach young people how to protect against contracting HIV and AIDS.\n  Yesterday, I learned something very disturbing. The White House sent \na letter to Congress asking to limit funding to $2 billion. That is $1 \nbillion short.\n  I don't understand why President Bush, who has talked about his \ncommitment to help fight AIDS in Africa over and over again, would ask \nfor less money.\n  We must back up our promises with real action, not phony rhetoric.\n  Successful, proven programs for prevention, care, and treatment do \nexist but they are still small in scale, with many programs starved for \nresources. At least $9.2 billion is needed to mount a response to the \nAIDS crisis according to UNAIDS.\n  Current global spending to address the crisis is far below this, at \nabout $1 to $2 billion.\n  A fair contribution by the U.S. Government to the global HIV/AIDS \nresponse would be between $2.75 and $3 billion given our share of the \nglobal economy, close to 30 percent. The United States is spending just \nover $500 million on global HIV/AIDS this year; and now President Bush \nis asking Congress to appropriate $1 billion less than it authorized \nfor next year.\n  The tragic impact of the AIDS epidemic is undeniable. One in every \nthree adults in Africa is living with HIV/AIDS. Across the world, each \nyear, 800,000 infants contract HIV before or during birth. Ninety \npercent of these HIV-infected babies are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  The global AIDS bill has the power to save lives through a \ncombination of prevention and treatment. But in order to be effective, \nwe must provide the necessary resources.\n  In a speech last week during his trip to Botswana the President \npledged that the U.S. would be a partner in the battle against a \ndisease that has already killed more than 17 million in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, and talked of his proposal to spend $15 billion over 5 years to \nhelp the hardest-hit African and Caribbean nations battle AIDS. That \nmeans Congress should be spending $3 billion a year. Now the \nPresident's own person--the Director of the Office of National AIDS \nPolicy--is asking for $1 billion less. The message this sends to the \nworld is discouraging.\n  A failure to provide full funding is a setback that will cost lives. \nI urge the Senate to support Senator Byrd's amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support this amendment of my friend, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  A couple of months ago, at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, the \nPresident spent a good deal of time talking about the global AIDS \ncrisis, the worst public health threat in human history. I commend him \nfor that, and for going to Africa, which highlighted the devastation \ncaused by AIDS there.\n  President Bush has shown real leadership on AIDS, although it is \nimportant to mention that a bipartisan group in Congress has been \npushing for stronger action on AIDS for years.\n  A short time after the President's Coast Guard Academy speech, we \npassed the United States Leadership Against AIDS, TB and Malaria Act, \nwhich authorized $15 billion over 5 years to combat AIDS, tuberculosis \nand malaria. That was consistent with what the President proposed in \nhis State of the Union address back in January. It was an important \nstep. It showed that we are beginning to take the AIDS pandemic \nseriously.\n  But that was an authorization bill. It did not appropriate any money. \nFor all intents and purposes, it was like writing the check with out \nenough money in the bank.\n  Let me explain. The President's budget request contains only $1.9 \nbillion of the $3 billion we authorized for AIDS for fiscal year 2004. \n$1.9 billion is a good step, but we should do more. It remains to be \nseen whether the promise of that authorization bill--a promise with \nwhich I agree--will be fulfilled.\n  The amendment of the Senator from West Virginia is the first real \ntest of that.\n  The United States Leadership Against AIDS, TB and Malaria Act also \ncalled for up to $1 billion for the Global Fund to fight AIDS and TB \nand Malaria. Again, a promise. For fiscal year 2004, the President has \nonly budgeted $200 million for the Global Fund, which is one-fifth of \nthe amount authorized. It is also a cut of $150 million from what was \nappropriated last year.\n  There is another problem. While the President's fiscal year 2004 \nbudget for Foreign Operations includes approximately $1.3 billion to \ncombat HIV/AIDS, it robs Peter to pay Paul to pay for increases in HIV/\nAIDS programs, as the President's budget would cut other essential \ninternational health programs from 5 to 63 percent.\n  Child survival and maternal health programs are cut by 12 percent. \nThese are the programs that provide lifesaving child immunizations. \nThey also help to reduce the 600,000 pregnancy-related deaths each year \nthat could be avoided. Instead, the President's budget cuts these \nprograms by 12 percent.\n  It would cut programs to combat other infectious diseases like \nmeasles. Measles kills 1 million children--not 100,000 or 200,000--but \n1 million children a year. Again, this is something which is easily \npreventable. Every one of us can just go to the doctor's office and get \nour children and grandchildren immunized against measles. In many poor \nnations, parents and grandparents do not have that luxury. They need \nour help.\n  The President's budget cuts funding for programs which combat \nmeasles, polio, SARS, ebola and other deadly diseases by 32 percent.\n  These are not my numbers, these are the administration's numbers. \nThese numbers are in the President's budget.\n  These cuts will hurt children the most in countries where vaccines \ncosting a few pennies make the difference between life and death. That \nis not acceptable.\n  If somebody said to us, look at those five children, you can save \ntheir lives by spending a dollar, would we do it? Of course, we would \ndo it.\n  These are not Democratic or Republican programs. I have been joined \ntime and again by colleagues on the other side of the aisle who support \nthese health programs in both the Senate and the House.\n  Anyone who knows anything about public health knows that building the \nhealth infrastructure in developing countries is essential if you are \ngoing to effectively combat AIDS. It is the same thing with child \nnutrition. It is the same thing with maternal health. You don't fight \nAIDS in a vacuum. It isn't an either/or proposition. People who are \nmalnourished, who are in poor health, who have weak immune systems, who \nare at risk of other infections, are far more vulnerable to AIDS. It is \ncommon sense.\n  Mr. President, we hear a lot of speeches here. We may feel good about \ngiving those speeches, but I do not feel\n\n[[Page S9553]]\n\ngood about lofty rhetoric that bears little resemblance to reality, \nespecially when it deals with a catastrophe like AIDS. The President's \nbudget falls short. The allocation for Foreign Operations falls short. \nWe have to do something.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment builds on an amendment offered by Senator \nBingaman to the State Department Authorization a couple of weeks ago. \nThat amendment, which passed 78-18, called for full funding--$3 \nbillion, for the first year of the President's $15 billion AIDS \ninitiative, even if it means exceeding the budget ceilings. This \namendment does not exceed the ceilings.\n  This amendment would provide full funding of the United States \nLeadership Against AIDS, TB and Malaria Act. It is what we said we \nwould do. Senator Byrd's amendment would do it.\n  His amendment would provide the additional $750 million we authorized \nfor the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. And it would provide \n$350 million for CDC and NIH programs to combat AIDS. That is what we \nsaid we would do when we passed the AIDS authorization bill, and again \nwhen we passed the Bingaman amendment.\n  If we are going to lead, and especially if we are going to ask others \nto do more, we are going to have to stop playing shell games with the \nforeign aid budget. We are going to have to start keeping our promises.\n  Leadership is good policy. Leadership means resources. Leadership is \nnot a press release.\n  Let's stop the rhetoric. Let's do what needs to be done to stop the \n15,000 new HIV infections that occur each day. Then the United States \ncan show the promise and the moral leadership a great Nation should \nshow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Byrd has once again laid before \nthe Senate a critical challenge. The numbers he has cited are \nstaggering, confirming what we all know too well: that the world has \nnever known a pandemic greater than the AIDS pandemic.\n  At the end of last year, there were nearly 43 million people living \nwith HIV. Since January 1, there have been at least 15,000 new HIV \ninfections daily, meaning that we can expect another 45 million \ninfections by 2010. These numbers do not begin to tell the story of the \nsuffering--that story I have seen in the faces of suffering mothers and \nfathers, daughters and sons throughout Africa and Central Asia.\n  We simply must do more to stop this crisis.\n  Given the enormity of this challenge, I regret that I cannot vote for \nSenator Byrd's amendment. The amendment would pay for this vital \nincrease with a rescission in other defense programs. Just as I have \nobjected to the President's cuts in other vital global health programs \nto fund the limited AIDS funding increase in his budget, I must vote \nagainst this important amendment.\n  But this will not be the last word. As soon as we can--on the Labor \nappropriations bill or on the foreign operations appropriations bill--I \nwill work with my colleagues to provide new money for this vital fight. \nNew resources that will fund the promise we made earlier this year with \nthe global AIDS authorization. New resources that will not come out of \na bill that must fund our Armed Forces and other emerging threats. New \nresources that will help us get a leg up on this deadly pandemic.\n  We must not--we will not--stand down in this battle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the subject of how much money it takes to \ncomply with the authorization and requests on AIDS is not a matter for \nthe Defense bill. This is an attempt to take defense money and shift it \nover to the Health and Human Services bill and the State bill in \nanticipation that those bills will not meet the satisfaction of those \nwho want to see this money put out on $3 billion a year rather than $15 \nbillion over 5 years.\n  I understand the motivation for that: to put up more money. But that \nmoney is divided between the Labor, Health and Human Services \nsubcommittee on the one hand and the State-Justice-Commerce bill on the \nother hand. Or perhaps some of it might go into the foreign operations \nbills. I don't know. But it is not defense.\n  What this is doing is suggesting we take defense money that is needed \nto replace the helicopters we have lost, to repair damage to the \nequipment we have had damaged in Afghanistan and Iraq, and it also goes \nto eliminate other items that are needed in terms of modernization.\n  I oppose this amendment for that reason alone right now. I am not \nprepared to get into the argument about the total amount we have for \nAIDS, in terms of whether or not there is a commitment for $3 billion a \nyear or $15 billion over 5 years. The point is, as the manager of this \nbill, my task is to assure we get the money we need for defense.\n  It is an enormous amount, I say to those who say it is $1 billion, \nthat is true--$1 billion a day. We are spending approximately $1 \nbillion a day for defense globally and that is a whale of a lot of \nmoney. I am often reminded of Senator Dirksen saying a billion here and \na billion there and it becomes real money. There is no question about \nit, this is real money.\n  But this is not the bill on which money is allocated for AIDS under \nglobal AIDS. On that basis alone I ask the Senate to support my motion \nto table the amendment of the Senator. Does the Senator from Nevada \nwish to speak before I make that motion?\n  Mr. REID. I would, very briefly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would rather the money for this amendment \nwould come from someplace else. I hate to see it coming from the \nDefense bill. But as the Senator from New Mexico indicated, this is a \nvery large bill.\n  My problem is, however, we have people in this administration going \naround giving speeches about things that have been authorized and not \nappropriated.\n  We had the problem with the Leave No Child Behind. The State of \nNevada is in desperate shape in education for a number of reasons, not \nleast of which is the obligations the State of Nevada has because of \nthe unfunded mandate given as a result of the Leave No Child Behind. \nThe State of Nevada still, as we speak, doesn't have a budget. They \nshould have had one months ago.\n  We had the same situation on homeland security. We finally passed the \n11 appropriations bills. As the distinguished ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee would acknowledge, he and a number of us tried \nin many different ways to have money added to take away from the burden \nof State and local governments for homeland security. We couldn't get \nthat money. We got some money but not enough money.\n\n  Then when the President signed those 11 bills, you will remember, \neven Republicans got upset because he said: I like the bill for \neverything except there is not enough money for homeland security.\n  We did everything possible to get more money for homeland security \nand we simply were not supported by the administration. Even \nRepublicans said that was going too far.\n  Education, homeland security, and now we have the President and \nmembers of his administration going around talking about global AIDS \nand what a terrible thing it is. And it is. I was in Africa with the \nSenator from New Mexico and the distinguished Democratic leader last \nAugust. On the continent of Africa, over 6,000 people are dying every \nday from AIDS. Over 6,000 people every day, 7 days a week, and no \nholidays.\n  Last week I offered an amendment on the State Department \nauthorization bill to get money for Mexico, a free enterprise system, \nmicrolending to help that country pick themselves up and help so people \nare not streaming across our borders because they are poverty stricken.\n  I got an e-mail saying, Why are you giving money to those Mexicans? \nWe need money at home. Why give money to those Mexicans? It was the \nright thing to do, not simply because it helped the Mexican people but \nbecause it helped us. That amendment helped us. It helped the United \nStates. It helped everyone in the United States. For every person who \ndoesn't try to come across the border illegally, and doesn't get \nacross, it saves this country money.\n  Mr. President, this AIDS money also helps us as a country. We are \nbetter off\n\n[[Page S9554]]\n\nif we don't have 6,000 people dying on that continent.\n  As I said, I wish there was some other way to get this money. But we \nhave to make sure the people of America understand the difference \nbetween authorizing and appropriating. It is easy to make speeches \nsaying we authorize this. But if you do not appropriate the money, it \nwinds up being nothing.\n  Today we reported out of the Energy Subcommittee the energy and water \nbill. We did the best we could in that bill. But we have thousands of \nprojects that have been authorized and which are desperately needed in \nour various States around the country. We don't have enough money to \npay for them. We have done a disservice, in many instances, by \nauthorizing money and then not appropriating it. The Senator from West \nVirginia is not dumping money into Africa which would not help this \ncountry. That money to fight global AIDS is going to directly help the \nUnited States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me reiterate a few things that have \nalready been said. This is not an across-the-board cut on an entire \nbill. The language here is taken out of section 8135 of the fiscal year \n2002 Defense Appropriations Act. In other words, there is ample \nprecedent for the way we are providing the money. Even with these cuts, \nthe procurement and research and development accounts remain $2 billion \nabove the President's request and $6.7 billion above fiscal year 2003. \nThese are real budget funds. Here we have a $368 billion Defense bill. \nWe shouldn't hesitate to reduce it by $1.1 billion to pay for a program \nas important as global AIDS. I know the administration says it doesn't \nwant that much money this year. The administration prefers doing the \nramped-up approach.\n  People understand simple math. Fifteen billion dollars over 5 years \nis $3 billion a year. I think we should provide the full $3 billion. \nPeople understand that is certainly going to be $15 billion over a 5-\nyear period if we do it $3 billion a year. It is easy to understand \nthat. But by doing the ramped-up approach, it appears that the \nPresident is not fulfilling his commitment. I want to help him fulfill \nthat commitment.\n  I remember, as well as the distinguished Senator from Alaska does, \nwhen we were trying to provide moneys for homeland security. We tried \nto provide moneys for our firemen, our policemen, and our health \npersonnel. We were told by the then-Director of Homeland Security, \nformer Governor Tom Ridge, in a letter that they didn't need that much. \nIt seems that the administration doesn't need the money if some effort \nis being made on this side of the aisle to provide the money that the \nadministration needs. They know they don't need that then and they come \nback later and ask for it themselves. They say they need it then.\n  This is an opportunity to show the world that we mean what we say. \nThis is an opportunity to show the world that the President means what \nhe says.\n  Here we are quibbling over eight-tenths of 1 percent. We are fiddling \nover that little measly amount of money when we could adopt the \namendment. People of the world would understand what we are saying. \nThey would believe the President is backing up his commitment. Why do \nwe quibble over a few tenths of 1 percent here?\n  I have made the case.\n  I ask unanimous consent that certain letters I have received be \nprinted in the Record. These are letters of support for the amendment. \nThey come from the Global AIDS Alliance, the Episcopal Church Office of \nGovernment Relations located in Washington, DC, Physicians for Human \nRights, the General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist \nChurch, and the Center for Health and Gender Equity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Global AIDS Alliance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2003.\n     Senator Robert Byrd,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: We would like to express our deepest \n     appreciation for the amendment you plan to offer to the \n     Defense Appropriations Bill, which would increase funding for \n     the fight against the AIDS pandemic. The attached letter from \n     diverse national and international groups shows clear support \n     for the level of increase your amendment would provide.\n       Your amendment reflects a realistic appraisal of the true \n     scale of the epidemic and of the real and serious threat to \n     US national security it poses. The US National Intelligence \n     Council has warned AIDS is poised to destabilize areas of \n     high US strategic interest. On July 3, the US Centers for \n     Disease Control warned that China, India and other parts of \n     Asia were threatened by what it termed an ``AIDS \n     catastrophe.'' Humanitarian considerations alone are enough \n     to justify full US support for the fight against AIDS, but \n     these strategic considerations show that it is only \n     appropriate your amendment be approved during consideration \n     of the Defense Appropriations Bill.\n       The fight against this global threat would be significantly \n     bolstered by your amendment. The $1.1 billion increase would \n     allow the US to make good on its $3 billion commitment to the \n     global effort against AIDS and other health threats in FY \n     2004. Providing $750 million of the increase to the Global \n     Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria makes particularly good \n     sense from a public health perspective. The Fund can \n     efficiently utilize these resources, and it can provide them \n     not only to Africa but also to such seriously impacted \n     regions as Asia and Eastern Europe. We also support providing \n     a portion of the increase to AIDS programs run by the \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n       Already, twenty five million people have died from AIDS. \n     Around the world, more than 42 million people are infected \n     with the virus and few of these have access to life-saving \n     medicine. If we don't act now, there will be 25 million AIDS \n     orphans facing a bleak future by the end of the decade. Yet, \n     as the Director of UNAIDS, Peter Piot, recently noted, \n     ``[T]he mismatch between need and funding continues to be one \n     of the biggest obstacles in the struggle to control the \n     epidemic.'' Your amendment would ensure the US shows full \n     leadership in the global effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Dr. Paul Zeitz,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n                                         The Episcopal Church,\n\n                                   Washington D.C., July 17, 2003.\n       Dear Senate: We are writing on behalf of the Episcopal \n     Church to urge your support for a Byrd amendment that would \n     increase funding to help fight the global AIDS pandemic. \n     Senator Byrd is expected to offer this amendment during \n     Senator floor consideration of the Defense Appropriations \n     bill. The amendment would increase AIDS funding by $1.1 \n     billion, with $750 million of that amount to be earmarked for \n     a U.S. contribution to the Global Fund and the remaining $350 \n     million to be allocated by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services for overseas AIDS spending. This additional $1.1 \n     billion in spending would increase total 2004 global AIDS \n     spending to $3 billion a year, an amount equal to a first \n     year installment in President Bush's five-year, $15 billion \n     Emergency Global AIDS Initiative.\n       The global AIDS crisis is a priority for the Episcopal \n     Church. Our partners in the Anglican Communion, serving \n     Christians and their communities in 165 countries worldwide, \n     face the daily hardships caused by this terrible disease. In \n     parts of Africa, where over half of the Anglican Communion \n     resides, the AIDS pandemic has created more than a health \n     crisis: it has decimated the workforce, led to a collapse in \n     education systems, deepened poverty, undermined the \n     production of agriculture, and created millions of orphans \n     and vulnerable children. However, AIDS can be beaten. The \n     experience of a successful AIDS program in Uganda makes this \n     clear. Uganda implemented a national AIDS program, and in \n     just ten years, reduced that country's AIDS rate from 15 \n     percent to 5 percent.\n       Today, we have an effective new mechanism that can build on \n     success stories like Uganda's. The Global Fund to Fight TB, \n     AIDS, and Malaria allows for a coordinated global response to \n     the AIDS pandemic. Global Fund grants are putting half a \n     million people with AIDS on life-saving drugs--a six fold \n     increase in the number of people in Africa receiving these \n     drugs. The Fund focuses on providing support for successful \n     programs on the ground and leveraging our allies to do their \n     fair share to fight AIDS. Just this week, an international \n     conference was convened to review to date the progress made \n     by the Global Fund and to address funding issues. The \n     European Union is now committed to raising $1 billion for the \n     Global Fund. U.S. leadership is clearly serving as a catalyst \n     in leveraging the financial support of other major donor \n     countries. A significant U.S. contribution would further \n     challenge other donors to do more to support The Fund.\n       The Byrd amendment would allow the Senate to fulfill the \n     humanitarian promise made to fight HIV/AIDS. The Byrd \n     amendment would be offset by a small reduction in proposed \n     spending by an amount less than eight-tenths of one percent. \n     Even then, the Senate would still provide more for \n     procurement than was requested in the President's budget.\n       We urge your support for the Byrd amendment to the Defense \n     Appropriations bill. Now is the time for Congress and the \n     President to make good on the promise to fully fund the \n     Global AIDS Initiative and a U.S. contribution to the Global \n     Fund. Your support can make a significant contribution in\n\n[[Page S9555]]\n\n     the effort to launch this much-needed world health campaign.\n           Sincerely,\n     Maureen T. Shea,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Jere Myrick Skipper,\n       International Policy Analyst.\n\n\n                                  Physicians for Human Rights,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, July 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Byrd: We thank you for your efforts to ensure \n     that the full $3 billion authorized for fiscal year 2004 by \n     the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n     Malaria Act of 2003 is appropriated. These diseases kill 6 \n     million people per year, or more than 16,000 per day, making \n     it crucial that the full level of authorized funding to \n     combat them is authorized. Physicians for Human Rights \n     therefore strongly supports your amendment to appropriate an \n     additional $1.1 billion for HIV/AIDS funding, including $750 \n     million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \n     Malaria.\n       We are especially pleased that your amendment includes \n     strong support for the Global Fund. The Fund is facing a \n     shortfall of up to $600-800 million for this year, and needs \n     an additional $3 billion through 2004. The Fund is already \n     proving its efficiency at quickly distributing funds based on \n     an innovative, country-driven process that ensures the \n     participation of civil society and that proposals adhere to \n     best scientific practices. These features, along with the \n     Fund's multiple accountability mechanisms, make the Fund an \n     excellent mechanism to deliver funds to resource-poor \n     countries, and it deserves the full support of the United \n     States.\n       The proposals coming into the Global Fund demonstrate that \n     countries have plans to spend resources, what they lack are \n     the resources. When President Bush was in Africa last week, \n     he saw both the awesome need for funding and the equally \n     tremendous energy and commitment of the African people to \n     overcome the diseases that plague their continent. The \n     President and the Congress must trust that given the \n     resources, this energy and commitment will be translated into \n     results. This is already happening throughout Africa--where \n     the resources are available.\n       African health professionals, who are among those in the \n     best position to know what their countries need and what they \n     can spend, are urging the United States to appropriate $3 \n     billion this year. So are American health professionals who \n     have extensive experience in fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa. We \n     are including a letter that includes their strong support for \n     $3 billion in fiscal year 2004 appropriations to fight HIV/\n     AIDS. In a short time, it was signed by 35 African health \n     professionals from 13 countries and 67 American health \n     professionals, along with 13 health professionals from other \n     countries.\n       Again, we thank you for offering your amendment, and urge \n     your colleagues to support your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Leonard S. Rubenstein,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                                      Physicians for Human Rights.\n         General Board of Church and Society of the United \n           Methodist Church,\n                                     Washington DC, July 17, 2003.\n     Senator Robert Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: I am writing to extend our support to \n     your proposed amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill \n     that will increase the level of funding for HIV/AIDS, Malaria \n     and TB. The United Methodist Church strongly advocates for \n     full funding of the AIDS Initiative proposed by President \n     Bush in his State of the Union speech as well as the U.S. \n     Leadership Against AIDS, TB and Malaria Act of 2003. It is \n     our hope to see $3 billion for FY2004 appropriated which \n     would include one billion dollars for the Global Fund.\n        We know know that AIDS can be beaten. The experience of \n     Uganda makes this clear. The HIV rate in Uganda was reduced \n     from 15% in 1990 to approximately 5% according to UNAIDS. \n     Today, we also have effective mechanisms to build on the \n     success in Uganda because of the creation of the Global Fund \n     to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis.\n       The Global Fund, chaired by Health and Human Services \n     Secretary Tommy Thompson, is scaling up successful programs \n     on the ground and leveraging our allies to do their fair \n     share in the fight against AIDS. Grants by the Global Fund \n     are putting half a million people with AIDS on life-saving \n     drugs--a six fold increase in the number of people in Africa \n     receiving these drugs.\n       As we listen to our United Methodist brothers and sisters \n     particularly in Africa, it becomes quite clear that this bill \n     is one of the most critical pieces of legislation considered \n     by Congress. The full funding of this is necessary if we are \n     to make any significant impact in the pandemic. I thank you \n     for your leadership on this issue and wish you the very best \n     as you proceed forward with this important task.\n           Peace and grace,\n                                    Linda Bales, Program Director,\n                         Louise and Hugh Moore Population Project.\n                                             Center for Health and\n\n\n                                                Gender Equity,\n\n                                   Takoma Park, MD, July 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: I am writing to express my strong \n     support, on behalf of the Center for Health and Gender Equity \n     (CHANGE), for your effort to increase U.S. spending for \n     global AIDS programs by offering an amendment to the Defense \n     Appropriations bill.\n       CHANGE, a U.S.-based international women's health and \n     rights organization, worked hard to develop and pass an \n     effective global AIDS policy to respond specifically to the \n     needs of women and girls in preventing HIV infection. While \n     we are disappointed with some of the harmful provisions--\n     particularly in regard to HIV prevention efforts--we feel the \n     bill itself is a positive advancement and support fully \n     funding this initiative. It is critically important for the \n     U.S. government to appropriate a full $3 billion to combat \n     global AIDS and make good on our promise to do so. Cutting \n     unnecessary defense spending is an appropriate way to reach \n     the authorized funding amount and support the essential \n     Global AIDS Fund, since the President has failed to request \n     an adequate amount in his own budget and has discouraged \n     Congressional appropriators from providing sufficient funds \n     in the foreign operations budget.\n       We applaud your leadership in this effort and are working \n     to ensure passage of your amendment on the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jodi L. Jacobson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the names \nof Senators Bingaman and Cantwell be included as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska for his patience and for waiting until we could \nfinish our statements before he moves to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I stand with much reluctance to speak \nagainst the amendment proposed by the good Senator. But I would like to \ncommend him first for bringing this matter to our attention.\n  I think it should be noted that as of this moment this Nation has \nspent over $15 billion primarily in research. If this was a case where \nwe had a vaccine or we had some drug or some medicine that could cure \nglobal AIDS and that we were not purchasing it in a sufficient \nquantity, that would be another issue. Then one could say this is an \nemergency and we need more drugs or we need more vaccines. But we are \nstill in the process of developing this vaccine.\n  Experience has shown us that by merely appropriating money does not \nfind solutions with these problems. One must train technicians. One \nmust take time to do research. Men and women who are experts in this \narea and who have a schedule are much more knowledgeable to tell us at \nthis stage whether we should be spending so much. Finally, when we \nhopefully reach that moment when we can tell the world we have found \nthe vaccine and we have found the drugs that can do it, then we can \nspend huge amounts.\n  We have spent over $15 billion. It is not an easy problem. To say \nthat it is complex would be an understatement.\n  If this amount suggested by my friend and mentor would cure the \nproblem, I think all of us here would be supporting it. But I think all \nof us realize we are still at the development stage.\n  If you study the process followed by other development programs, you \nwill note that we always start small and then grow up to a point where \nwe can do the huge spending. But we still must develop the vaccine. We \nstill must develop the medicine. And just spending money is not going \nto do that.\n  Much as I want to support my dear friends, I find that I will be \nsupporting my chairman in the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I had a conversation with the Senator \nfrom Iowa concerning the President's statement. I am informed by a call \nwe made to the President's Director of AIDS Policy that in a background \nbriefing with the press it was plainly spelled out that the President's \nrequest for 2004 was $2 billion but that there was an absolute \ncommitment for $15 billion over 5 years.\n  I will say this. There is no question that the amount of money in \nthis account is higher. This is one of the things I have been trying to \nsay all day, that in this bill are substantial\n\n[[Page S9556]]\n\namounts of money that relate to Iraq. That increase is for the \nprocurement of aircraft, ammunition, and specialized equipment that was \ndestroyed in Iraq. It is not being spent in Iraq, but it is being spent \nto replenish particularly the special operations command, special \noperations forces. They consumed a considerable amount of their \nequipment and supplies. That extra money will be in this account. It \nwill be reduced $1.1 billion if this amendment is agreed to.\n  It would be my hope Senators would look at this as an amendment to \ntake money from the Defense bill to meet the AIDS obligation. We will \nbe back on this AIDS obligation next week, hopefully, when we get to \nthe Health and Human Services bill.\n  We had authorized $370 billion in the Defense authorization bill. We \nhave found here $3.69 billion, despite the fact we already took out of \nthis account $3.1 billion and allocated it to nondefense accounts.\n  I do believe we have performed literally miracles--well, my \nsquadron's motto in World War II was, ``We do the impossible \nimmediately. Miracles take slightly longer.'' So I cannot say this was \na miracle, but it sure was doing the impossible to try to find the \nmoney to try to meet the objectives of the Defense authorization bill, \nnotwithstanding the fact that we have taken $3.1 billion out of it.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that there is no one on the floor \nof this Senate who is more committed to the war on AIDS than this \nSenator. I do not know how many people understand it. I believe I do \nunderstand it in the way that it replicates cells, destroys cells. It \nreally is a total global plague now.\n  I am proud our President has made this commitment of $15 billion. \nInstead of standing here and challenging the commitment on the basis we \nhave not provided $3 billion in the first year, we should applaud the \nPresident for making the commitment for $15 billion. I applaud him \nagain today for that.\n  I also hope the Senate will understand we have reviewed every request \nfor equipment that has been made in addition to those items that were \nauthorized. We have allocated the money as best we can. The Senator \nfrom Hawaii and I have had no disagreements at all on that.\n  I, once again, am very proud of the support of my friend. And I do \nmake a motion to table the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia, \nand I ask unanimous consent that vote on that motion take place at a \ntime to be determined by the majority leader after consultation with \nthe minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Senator Byrd has \nspecifically requested, many times--and I have relayed this, I think--\nat least I tried to--that he wants a vote when he completes the debate. \nSo we should have a vote now.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senator finishes \nhis remarks, I be recognized to make a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the Senator from Alaska will be recognized \nfollowing the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Iowa.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, I just want to clarify something to make the record as \nclear as I can. Earlier in my remarks, I had said the President, \ntraveling in Africa, had stated that he wanted the full $3 billion for \nthe AIDS funding in Africa for this year. The chairman of the committee \nhad asked me about that, and I had said that I would come up with the \ndocumentation. Well, it is sort of half of this and half of that. I \nwill admit now that the President did not specifically say: ``$3 \nbillion.'' I wanted to admit that for the record.\n  However, the President did say--and I will quote his words exactly--\non July 12, in Abuja, Nigeria:\n\n       The people of Africa are fighting HIV/AIDS with courage. \n     And I'm here to say, you will not be alone in your fight. In \n     May, I signed a bill that authorizes $15 billion for the \n     global fight on AIDS. This week, a committee of the House of \n     Representatives took an important step to fund the first year \n     of the authorization bill. And the Senate is beginning to \n     take up debate.\n\n  And here is the key language:\n\n       The House of Representatives and the United States Senate \n     must fully fund this initiative, for the good of the people \n     on this continent of Africa. . . .\n\n  Well, to ``fully fund this initiative.'' I have a copy of the \nauthorizing language. The authorizing language says, specifically, \nunder paragraph A(2):\n\n       Authorize the appropriation of a total $15 billion for \n     fiscal years 2004 through 2008.\n  Specifically, the act authorized $3 billion to be appropriated in \nfiscal year 2004 for HIV/AIDS and related programs. So, specifically, \nthe authorizing bill authorized $3 billion in this coming fiscal year. \nThe President said:\n\n       The House and the Senate must fully fund this initiative.\n\n  He may not have said $3 billion, but what he said must mean $3 \nbillion because that is full funding of the bill for next year. It is \nright, he didn't use $3 billion, but he said he wanted it fully funded. \nIf it is fully funded, it must be $3 billion for this next year.\n  Secondly, the Secretary of State, on a briefing in South Africa, was \nasked a question:\n\n       The House Appropriations Committee today cut back the first \n     year's funding from about $3 billion to about $2 billion.\n\n  And Secretary Powell answered:\n\n       I would, of course, have preferred full funding of the \n     President's request to make the best use of the money that \n     Congress has provided for this. And I'll wait and see the \n     congressional action and see how this ultimately emerges from \n     the Congress.\n\n  So here we have the President saying he wanted it fully funded. He \nsays:\n\n       The House and Senate must fully fund this initiative.\n\n  That can only mean that we must come up with the $3 billion. So while \nthe President didn't specifically say $3 billion, that is the full \nimport of his words that he spoke in Africa.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I asked for and have obtained a copy of \nthe transcript that was made at the background briefing provided for \nthe President's speech in Africa. This was made by Dr. Joseph O'Neill, \nthe President's director for AIDS policy. He was asked this question by \nthe press:\n\n       Can you clarify something about the money issue? You've \n     talked about full funding, but no one has yet defined what \n     full funding is. Is it the $2 billion that the President \n     originally requested for next year? Or is it the $3 billion \n     that was in the authorization bill? Or is it something else?\n\n  Dr. O'Neill answered:\n\n       Full funding and what we are going after is $15 billion \n     over five years. Our request for this year, 2004, as you \n     know, is $1.9 billion if you exclude the tuberculosis and \n     malaria money.\n       And I want to make a very clear point on this, because it's \n     something where there has been continuing confusion. We have \n     requested and will request $15 billion over five years. Now, \n     in order to be effective with those dollars, we would be \n     foolish to think we would spend the same amount every year. \n     In order to do--particularly to do the treatment that is the \n     cornerstone of this initiative--and I can say this because \n     I'm a practicing physician myself, I still [see] HIV/AIDS \n     patients, this is a very tough thing to do--in order to do \n     that, we need to build a lot of infrastructure, we need to do \n     a lot of training, particularly of health care workers. So \n     for the first year, it's going to take less money to get the \n     job done than it will in the outyears.\n       So we've always been clear [on that], we've always tried to \n     be clear that we've always intended to ramp up these dollars \n     over five years for a total of $15 billion over five [years].\n\n  That is the statement on which we relied. Again, I come back to the \nfact that we are talking, in this instance, about the problem of the \nother bills that do handle HIV/AIDS and not this bill.\n  I understand the Senator from West Virginia would like to make a \nstatement. I ask unanimous consent that he be permitted to make the \nstatement before I renew the motion to table his amendment.\n\n[[Page S9557]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the facts are staggering. More than 5 \nmillion people are infected with HIV/AIDS each year. That is 15,000 \npeople infected each day, 625 people infected every hour, more than 10 \npeople every minute--people of virtually all ages, people in every \ncorner of the world. Last year, more than 3 million people died from \nAIDS. The longer we wait to find a cure, the longer we wait to fulfill \nthe pledge to the global HIV/AIDS trust fund, the longer we wait, the \ngreater the tragedy.\n  The Byrd amendment would allow the Senate to fulfill the humanitarian \npromise made to fight HIV/AIDS. This amendment would help to alleviate \nsome of the misery endured by millions of AIDS-inflicted families \naround the globe for roughly what we spend in a single day to fund the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  This amendment would make good on the Government's pledge to the \nworld and the effort to combat the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. The \nPresident promised $15 billion in the next 5 years. Congress has \nauthorized $3 billion for the next fiscal year. But the authorization \nwithout appropriation is a will-o'-the-wisp. The President's budget \nonly provides $1.9 billion. This amendment would increase funding for \nthe global AIDS/HIV initiative by $1.1 billion to $3 billion. The \namendment would be offset by a $1.1 billion across-the-board cut in the \namounts appropriated for the Defense Department procurement as well as \nfor research, development, test, and evaluation. We are spending more \nthan $1 billion a day for defense in this bill. Surely we can afford to \nspend $1 billion more in a year to combat AIDS and HIV.\n  I reiterate that a few days ago--last week it was, I believe--\nPresident Bush visited five African countries. He again pledged that \nthe United States would play a leading role in combating AIDS. The \nPresident repeatedly promised to do all in his power to make sure that \nCongress fully financed his proposed 5-year, $15 billion program to \nattack the disease in the world's poorest countries. This is the \nPresident's chance. Why wait? He may not be around here for 5 years. \nWho knows, right? The President may not be in power for 5 years. He may \nnot be around here 5 years. Why not help him to fulfill his commitment \ntoday? Three billion dollars in 1 year--$3 billion--to attack this \ndisease.\n  On July 10, 2003, the Senate voted in a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution 78 to 18 to provide full appropriations for the $15 billion \nAIDS initiative touted by our President, including $3 billion in fiscal \nyear 2004. Now is the time, Senators, to step up to the plate and honor \nyour commitment. Now is the time to help the President to honor his \ncommitment.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment and to vote no \non the motion to table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I renew my motion to table the Senator's \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nat the conclusion of the next vote, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession for consideration of Calendar No. 291, Allyson Duncan, to be a \nU.S. Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit; provided that there then be \n10 minutes for debate equally divided between Senators Dole and Edwards \nand, at the conclusion of that time, the Senate proceed to a vote on \nthe confirmation of the nomination without further intervening action \nor debate; provided, further, that immediately following that vote, the \nSenate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of Calendar No. 294, \nLouise Flanagan, to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of \nNorth Carolina; provided that following those votes, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume \nlegislative session; provided, further, that the time for voting on \neach of the confirmations of these judges be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska modify his \nrequest to allow Senator Schumer to be recognized after the votes are \ncompleted to speak for up to 10 minutes? He has an amendment that has \nbeen worked out and he wants to speak, and that will finalize that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. I so modify my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1283.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Texas (Mrs. \nHutchison) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are \nnecessary absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``Yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I am pleased tonight we are confirming two \nof President Bush's judicial nominees from my home State of North \nCarolina, Allyson Duncan to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and \nLouise Flanagan to the Eastern District of North Carolina. Our free \nsociety is based on reasoned, dispassionate judgment of the men and \nwomen of our judicial branch of our Government who share a sense of \nhonor and duty to our country and to our Constitution. Every indication \nis that these two talented and experienced individuals will provide \njust that.\n\n  Judges interpret and apply the laws that govern our Nation, including \nour fundamental rights and liberties protected in the Constitution. \nHowever, on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, there is a North \nCarolina vacancy that is the longest on the entire Federal bench. It \ndates back nearly a decade to July 31, 1994. In fact, North Carolina \nhas had no representation on the Fourth Circuit Court in nearly 4 \nyears, though we are the largest State in the circuit. Two seats have \nstood empty on North Carolina's Eastern District Court for 2\\1/2\\ and \n5\\1/2\\ years, respectively.\n  I am pleased the Senate has stepped up and fulfilled its duties for \nthese to nominees, taking steps to fill these vacancies to address the \ndisparity for North Carolina.\n  This vote is historic in more ways than one. Allyson Duncan is the \nfirst woman from North Carolina to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. She is also the first African-American woman to serve on the \nFourth Circuit Court. Ms. Duncan's resume is most impressive, marked \nwith numerous positions of significant responsibility in both the \npublic and private sectors. Currently, an attorney with the Raleigh law \nfirm of Kilpatrick Stockton, Ms. Duncan is the president of the North \nCarolina Bar Association, and an active member of the North Carolina \nAssociation of Women Attorneys. Prior to that, she was a judge on the \nNorth Carolina Court of Appeals, and a professor of law at North \nCarolina Central University.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to enthusiastically express my \nsupport for the nomination of Allyson Duncan for the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals and Louise Wood Flanagan for the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of North Carolina.\n  This is a historic day for my home state of North Carolina. Once \nconfirmed, Allyson Duncan will be the first North Carolinian to join \nthe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in 23 years. North Carolina is the \nonly State in the Union with no judges on a Federal appellate court. \nAnd we have the longest-standing vacancy in the Federal appeals court \nsystem.\n  I was very proud to support Judge Duncan's nomination and it was my \npleasure to introduce her during her confirmation hearing. She will \nrestore the voice of North Carolina to this very important Federal \nCourt and breaks a logjam that has damaged our state for too many \nyears.\n  This historic development shows what can be done when the President \ntruly respects the advice and consent role of the Senate. In this case, \nPresident Bush did more than just pay lip service to this important \nresponsibility. He reached out to Senator Dole and me before he made \nhis decision--he consulted with us--he sought our advice. In making his \ndecision, the President selected a nominee who represents the \nmainstream of our state.\n  I commend the President for consulting with us and for making an \nexcellent nomination. If he takes this approach to future judicial \nnominations we have a real opportunity to find common ground in the \nsearch for excellence on the Federal bench. When we work together, we \nfind outstanding nominees like Allyson Duncan who represents the best \nof North Carolina.\n  As impressive as her resume is, even more telling is her steller \nrepudiation throughout the North Carolina legal community. I have heard \nfrom folks all over the State who can't say enough about Allyson \nDuncan. What people keep telling me is that this is a woman of \nextraordinary intellect and skill, who loves the law, strives for \njustice and never allows politics to interfere with her commitment to \nfairness and equality.\n  When the Senate confirms Allyson Duncan--which I hope will happen \nsoon--her confirmation will mark a number of ``firsts.''\n  She will be the first North Carolinian to join the 4th Circuit in \nover 20 years; she will be the first African American woman to serve on \nthat distinguished court. And most important, I hope she will be the \nfirst in a series of bipartisan, consensus judicial nominations from \nour State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Allyson K. Duncan, who has been nominated to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  Ms. Duncan is truly an impressive woman and has the enthusiastic \nsupport of both North Carolina senators, along with a unanimous ``Well \nQualified'' ABA rating.\n  She graduated first in her class at Hampton University, a \nhistorically black college. She then attended Duke University Law \nSchool and was appointed an Earl Warren Legal Scholar, a scholarship \nawarded to black law students demonstrating leadership and an interest \nin the public interest.\n  Upon graduation, our nominee clerked for the Honorable Julia Cooper \nMack on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, before beginning her\n\n[[Page S9559]]\n\ntenure at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1978. Ms. \nDuncan held several positions at the EEOC, starting as an appellate \nattorney, serving as the assistant to the Chairman, and ultimately \nbecoming acting legal counsel.\n  Ms. Duncan left the EEOC for a teaching post at North Carolina \nCentral University School of Law, another historically black college, \nwhere she taught property, employment discrimination, labor law, and \nappellate advocacy.\n  Our outstanding nominee is also a pioneer. After leaving her teaching \npost in 1990, she became the first black woman to be appointed to the \nNorth Carolina Court of Appeals as an associate judge. She served in \nthat capacity for one year, after which she hit another milestone.\n  Ms. Duncan was then appointed commissioner of the North Carolina \nUtilities Commission--another first for a black woman. As commissioner, \nshe was responsible for telecommunications, natural gas and water \nregulations. She served as commissioner until she entered private \npractice with the law firm of Kilpatrick Stockton, where she is \ncurrently a partner. Her area of concentration is energy-related \nissues, but she also handles regulatory matters involving rate making, \nand mergers and acquisitions.\n  I am proud to add that if confirmed, Ms. Duncan will hit a third \nmilestone: that of being the first black woman to sit on the Fourth \nCircuit Court Appeals. A circuit, I would like to note, that has a 24 \npercent black population--the highest black population for all of the \ncircuit courts.\n  Allyson Duncan has a fine background, which will serve her well as a \ncircuit court judge. She will be a terrific addition to the Court, and \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting her nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm the first new \njudge to the Fourth Circuit from North Carolina in 23 years as well as \na nominee to the District Court for the Eastern District of North \nCarolina. I want to thank Senator Edwards for his efforts to resolve \nthe impasse that has stalled so many nominees from North Carolina. Part \nof his reward will be the service that Judge Allyson Duncan will soon \nbe providing to the people of North Carolina as a member of the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. When Senator Edwards \nobtained a hearing for Judge Duncan last month, her nomination had \nalready progressed further than the Republican majority had allowed the \nnominations of Judge James Beaty, Judge James Wynn, and Judge Rich \nLeonard to proceed when they were nominated to the Fourth Circuit by \nPresident Clinton from 1995 through 2001. This confirmation means that \nNorth Carolina once again is represented on the Fourth Circuit.\n  In addition, Judge Duncan will be the first African-American woman to \nserve on the Fourth Circuit, a circuit that did not have an African-\nAmerican judge until President Clinton appointed Roger Gregory 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago.\n  A good way to see how much faster we are proceeding on judicial \nnominations for a Republican President is to compare where we are in \nJuly of this year to July of any year during the last Democratic \nadministration when the Republicans controlled the Senate. Over the \nlast 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control under President Clinton, the \nRepublicans allowed only 19 judicial confirmations, on average, by July \n16, and included only 4 circuit court nominees, on average, by this \ntime. We have now doubled the number of judicial confirmations and more \nthan doubled the number of circuit court confirmations.\n  On this day, in 1995, only 27 judicial nominations had been \nconfirmed; in 1996, only 10; in 1997, only 6; in 1998 the confirmations \ntotaled 33; in 1999, only 9; and in 2000 the confirmation total by this \npoint of the year was 29. Today, we confirm the 37th and 38th judges so \nfar this year. We have already confirmed more judges in only the \nseventh month of this year than the Republican majority was willing to \nconfirm in all of 1999, in all of 1997, and more than twice as many as \nthe Republican majority was willing to consider during the entire 1996 \nsession. Vacancies in the courts stand at less than half of what they \nwere during the Clinton years and we have more Federal judges serving \nthan ever before.\n  Today, we confirm the 10th judge to the Courts of Appeals. This is \nmore than were confirmed in all of 4 of the past 6 years when the \nRepublicans were in the majority--in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000. And in \nthe 2 other years, the Tenth Circuit nominee was not confirmed until \nmuch later in the year.\n  As I have noted throughout the last 3 years, the Senate is able to \nmove expeditiously when we have consensus nominees. I am delighted that \nthese North Carolina nominees have the support of Senator Edwards and \nSenator Dole and that we have been able to move forward so \nexpeditiously to confirm them. Unfortunately, far too many of this \nPresident's nominees have records that raise serious concerns about \nwhether they will be fair judges to all parties on all issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded. The question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Allyson K. \nDuncan, of North Carolina, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nFourth Circuit?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison \nand the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

FLANAGAN, OF NORTH CAROLINA, TO BE UNITED \n    STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nconsider the following nomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Louise W. Flanagan, of \nNorth Carolina, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of North Carolina.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Louise W. Flanagan\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, Louise Flanagan is the first woman to serve \nas a district court judge for North Carolina's Eastern District. \nServing as a magistrate judge for the Eastern District since 1995, \nLouise Flanagan is consistently praised by her colleagues on the \nEastern District Court for her integrity and her fairness in the \ncourtroom. Whether in previous positions with the law firms of Ward and \nSmith in Greenville, NC, or Sonnenschein Nath and Rosenthal in \nWashington, DC, or at the Center for National Security Law, Ms. \nFlanagan's accomplishments are numerous on behalf of the\n\n[[Page S9560]]\n\npublic and the institutions she has served. I am certain she will bring \njudicial temperance, integrity, and character to the Federal bench.\n  For these individuals and for so many other qualified men and women, \nbeing nominated to serve on the Federal bench by the President of the \nUnited States marks the pinnacle of a long and remarkable legal career. \nFor those who are confirmed, it represents an opportunity to use their \nwisdom and legal training to uphold our Constitution and protect the \nrights and freedoms upon which our Nation was founded.\n  As I campaigned for the Senate, I told the people of North Carolina \nthat I believe each and every judicial nominee deserves a hearing and a \nvote by the full Senate. I believe in the capability, independence, and \nprudence of the Members of this institution. If a person has concerns \nabout an issue or a nominee, then I believe he or she should make a \npersuasive case to the other members of this body in a forthright, \nopen, and honest debate. This process is established in our \nConstitution, and it is what our representative democracy is all about.\n  We are here today because the process is working for these two North \nCarolina nominees. I am confident that both of these highly qualified \nwomen will meet their duties with professionalism, impartiality, and \ncompetence, and I hope that other well-qualified candidates who have \nbeen sent forth, such as Judge Terrence Boyle, might soon join them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Judge Louise Wood Flanagan to be a U.S. District Court Judge for the \nEastern District of North Carolina. Judge Flanagan currently serves as \na Federal magistrate judge.\n  After earning her law degree from the University of Virginia School \nof Law in 1988, she served as law clerk for Judge Malcolm Howard on the \nvery court to which she has been nominated. In 1990, she joined the \nNorth Carolina law firm of Ward and Smith, where she handled complex \ncommercial litigation and litigated approximately 300 cases in state, \nfederal, and bankruptcy court. Throughout her career, Judge Flanagan, \nhas consistently demonstrated the strong legal intellect, integrity, \nand judicial temperament required of a U.S. District Court Judge.\n  In 1995, Judge Flanagan was appointed to be a Magistrate Judge for \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. In \nthis position she handles both criminal and civil matters and has \nearned a reputation of fairness, honesty, and keen intellect. She will \nmake an excellent addition to the Federal bench.\n  I commend President Bush for nominating her and urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Louise W. Flanagan, of North Carolina, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Eastern District of North \nCarolina?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the votes and to lay those motions \non the table.\n  The motions to lay on the table were agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe the amendment is already part \nof the managers' package, so it does not have to be read.\n  In the interest of time, Mr. President, of the 10 minutes allotted to \nme, I will yield back 4, take 3 for myself, and yield 3 to the senior \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murray be added \nas a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. We have \nall heard the reports, which bother us, tear at our hearts, that our \nsoldiers are going to have to stay a longer period of time because of \nthe fighting, the chaos, the problems in Iraq.\n  One of the quickest ways to get them home is that we set up an \nindigenous police force. After all, our Army, the greatest Army in the \nworld, that has done such a great job in Iraq, has not really been \ntrained to be a police force to stop looting and to create civil order, \net cetera.\n  We are in the process of training Iraqis to take over this job, and I \nam sure most Americans wish it could be done as quickly as possible. \nThis amendment is a reminder of that and an importuning of the \nadministration to do just that, by requiring that every 180 days there \nbe a report from the administration to Congress and the American people \nthat talks about the progress of setting up such a police force, the \ncost of such a police force, and how it might affect the timetable and \nspeed up the timetable, more particularly, of our soldiers coming home.\n  We know we have to restore rule of law in Iraq. We know it should \nbest be done by an indigenous Iraqi police force. This amendment simply \nsays, let's get that done quickly, and let the administration report to \nus on how that progress is going. It is important to the soldiers. It \nis important to law and order in Iraq, and it is important to the \nAmerican people.\n  Nothing would make us all happier than to bring so many of our brave \nsoldiers home, and home quickly. This amendment is both a reminder and \nan importuning addressed to that fact.\n  With that, I yield back the rest of my 3 minutes, and yield the \nremaining time to the Senator from Washington, the cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support the \nSchumer amendment to the Defense bill regarding the development of an \nIraqi police force. This is an urgent amendment--one of the most \nimportant Iraq-related amendments we have considered on the defense \nbill.\n  The Schumer amendment will focus the administration's attention on \nthe domestic security issue in Iraq that threatens American servicemen \nand women, other Americans and foreigners now in Iraq, and the Iraqi \npeople.\n  One of the reasons we went to war in Iraq was to liberate the Iraqi \npeople. The military campaign was named, ``Operation Iraqi Freedom.'' \nAgain and again, from the President on down, we have been told that we \nacted on behalf of the Iraqi people.\n  We all witnessed the scenes of jubilation at the fall of Saddam \nHussein's regime. Time and again, the administration has told us that \nwe have restored freedom to the Iraqi people.\n  We all hope this is ultimately true. But the truth today is very \ndifferent for women in Iraq and particularly in Baghdad.\n  Yeserday, Human Rights Watch released a report detailing reports of \nrape, assault, and kidnapping of women and girls in Baghdad. The report \ncites 25 credible allegations of rape and abduction since the fall of \nSaddam Hussein. It is believed that the number of rapes and sexual \nassaults in Baghdad is far higher. Women are discouraged from reporting \nthe crime and face social isolation and even ``honor killings'' by \nother family members for being violently victimized.\n  Yesterday's New York Times contains a disturbing article about the \ndangers confronting women in Baghdad. I ask unanimous consent to have \nthe article, ``Rape (And the Silence About It) Haunts Baghdad,'' \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 16, 2003]\n\n               Rape (and Silence About It) Haunts Baghdad\n\n                          (By Neela Banerjee)\n\n       Baghdad, Iraq, July 15.--In her loose black dress, gold \n     hairband and purple flip-flops, Sanariya hops from seat to \n     seat in her living\n\n[[Page S9561]]\n\n     room like any lively 9-year-old. She likes to read. She wants \n     to be a teacher when she grows up, and she says Michael, her \n     white teddy bear, will be her assistant.\n       But at night, the memory of being raped by a stranger seven \n     weeks ago pulls her into its undertow. She grows feverish and \n     has nightmares, her 28-year-old sister, Fatin, said. She \n     cries, ``Let me go!'' ``I am afraid of the gangsters,'' \n     Sanariya whispered in the twilight of her hallway. ``I feel \n     like they are killing me in my nightmares. Every day, I have \n     these nightmares.''\n       Since the end of the war and outbreak of anarchy on the \n     capital's streets, women here have grown increasingly afraid \n     of being abducted and raped. Rumors swirl, especially in a \n     country where rape is so rarely reported.\n       The breakdown of the Iraqi government after the war makes \n     any crime hard to quantify. But the incidence of rape and \n     abduction in particular seems to have increased, according to \n     discussions with physicians, law-enforcement officials and \n     families involved. A new report by Human Rights Watch based \n     on more than 70 interviews with law-enforcement officials, \n     victims and their families, medical personnel and members of \n     the coalition authority found 25 credible reports of \n     abduction and sexual violence since the war. Baghdadis \n     believe there are far more, and fear is limiting women's role \n     in the capital's economic, social and political life just as \n     Iraq tires to rise from the ashes, the report notes.\n       For most Iraqi victims of abduction and rape, getting \n     medical and police assistance is a humiliating process. \n     Deeply traditional notions of honor foster a sense of shame \n     so strong that many families offer no consolation or support \n     for victims, only blame. Sanariya's four brothers and parents \n     beat her daily, Fatin said, picking up a bamboo slat her \n     father uses. The city morgue gets corpses of women who were \n     murdered by their relatives in so-called honor killings after \n     they returned from an abduction--even, in some cases, when \n     they had not been raped, said Nidal Hussein, a morgue nurse.\n       ``For a woman's family, all this is worse than death,'' \n     said Dr. Khulud Younis, a gynecologist at the Alwiyah Women's \n     Hospital. ``They will face shame. If a woman has a sister, \n     her future will be gone. These women don't deserve to be \n     treated like this.''\n       It is not uncommon in Baghdad to see lines of cars outside \n     girls' schools. So fearful are parents that their daughters \n     will be taken away that they refuse to simply drop them off; \n     they or a relative will stay outside all day to make sure \n     nothing happens.\n       ``Women and girls today in Baghdad are scared, and many are \n     not going to schools or jobs or looking for work,'' said \n     Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle east and \n     North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. ``If Iraqi women \n     are to participate in postwar society, their physical \n     security needs to be an urgent priority.''\n       Beyda Jafar Sadiq, 17, made the simple decision to go to \n     school on the morning of May 22 and never returned. Her \n     family has been looking for her ever since. They have \n     appealed to every international nongovernmental organization, \n     the Iraqi police and the American authorities. Her eldest \n     brother, Feras, 29, has crisscrossed the country, visiting \n     the morgue in Basra in the south, traveling to Amara and \n     Nasiriya on reports from acquaintances that they saw a girl \n     who looked like Beyda. ``I just want to find her,'' said \n     Beyda's mother, Zakiya Abd, her eyes swollen with grief. \n     ``Whether she's alive or dead, I jut want to find her.\n       Some police in Baghdad concede that at this point, there is \n     little they can do to help. Their precinct houses were \n     thoroughly looted after the war. Despite promises from the \n     American authorities, Baghdad police still lack uniforms \n     weapons, communications and computer equipment and patrol \n     cars. ``We used to patrol all the time before the war,'' said \n     a senior officer at the Aadimiya precinct house. ``Now, \n     nothing, and the criminals realize their is no security on \n     the streets.''\n       The Human Rights Watch report alleges that sometimes when \n     women try to report a rape or families ask for help in \n     finding abducted women, they are turned away by Iraqi police \n     officers indifferent to the crimes. Some law-enforcement \n     officials insist abduction and rape have not increased, while \n     other officials and many medical personnel disagree. Bernard \n     R. Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner and now \n     an adviser to the Interior Ministry, told of recently firing \n     a precinct chief when he learned that the official had failed \n     to pursue a family's report of their missing 16-year-old \n     daughter. ``The biggest part of the issue is a culture that \n     precludes people from reporting,'' Mr. Kerik said. ``It \n     encourages people not to report.''\n       If an Iraqi woman wants to report a rape, she has to travel \n     a bureaucratic odyssey. She first has to go to the police for \n     documents that permit her to get a forensic test. That test \n     is performed only at he city morgue. The police take a \n     picture of the victim and stamp it and then stamp her arm. \n     That is so no one else goes in her place and says that she \n     was raped, that she lost her virginity,'' said Ms. Hussein, \n     the nurse. At the morgue, a committee of three male doctors \n     performs a gynecological examination on the victim to \n     determine if there was sexual abuse. The doctors are \n     available only from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. If a victim \n     arrives at any other time, she has to return the next day, \n     without washing away any physical evidence. Hospitals can \n     check victims only for broader trauma, like contusions and \n     broken bones.\n       Dr. Younis said she had seen more rape cases in the months \n     after the war than before. Yet even when women come to the \n     hospital with injuries that are consistent with rape, they \n     often insist something else happened. A 60-year-old woman \n     asserted that she had been hit by a car. The mother of a 6-\n     year-old girl begged the doctor to write a report saying that \n     her daughter's hymen had been ruptured because she fell on a \n     sharp object, a common lie families tell in the case of rape, \n     Dr. Younis said. Shame and fear compel the lies, Dr. Younis \n     said. ``A woman's father or brother, they feel it is their \n     duty to kill her'' if she has been raped, Dr. Younis said. \n     ``It is the tribal law. They will get only six months \n     in prison and then they are out.''\n       Sanariya's family took her to a doctor three days after her \n     attack only because the bleeding had not stopped. She had \n     been sitting on the stairs at about 4 p.m. on May 22 when an \n     armed man dragged her into an abandoned building next door. \n     He shot at neighbors who tried to help the girl. He fled when \n     she began screaming during the assault.\n       Her mother refuses to let her outside now to play. Fatin \n     lied to her family and said an operation had been done to \n     restore Sanariya's hymen. But when her eldest brother, Ahmed, \n     found out otherwise, he wanted to kill Sanariya, Fatin said.\n       Out of earshot of her family, Sanariya said she feels no \n     better now, two months after the attack. ``I don't sleep at \n     night,'' she said in the hallway. ``I don't sleep.''\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The article describes a 9-year-old girl who wakes up \nscreaming, ``Let me go!'' This is a 9-year old girl whose life has been \nforever changed by unimaginable violence. She says in the article, ``I \nam afraid of the gangsters. I feel like they are killing me in my \nnightmares. Every day, I have these nightmares.''\n  The story of this young girl--one of too many stories--ought to be \nenough to focus the Congress and the administration on the urgency of \nthe domestic security situation in Iraq.\n  Have we restored freedom to the Iraqi people when women and girls \nlive in fear of abduction, rape, and murder?\n  Have we restored freedom to the Iraqi people when women are denied \nparticipation in a new Iraqi government and economy because their \nphysical security is threatened every time they go out alone? Have we \nrestored freedom to the Iraqi people when 9-year-old girls are \nvictimized in the most horrifying way?\n  I want to share with the Senate a passage from the summary of the \nHuman Rights Watch report titled, ``Climate of Fear: Sexual Violence \nand Abduction of Women and Girls in Baghdad.''\n  The summary reads:\n\n       Many of the problems in addressing sexual violence and \n     abduction against women and girls derive from the U.S.-led \n     coalition forces and civilian administration's failure to \n     provide public security in Baghdad. The public security \n     vacuum in Baghdad has heightened the vulnerability of women \n     and girls to sexual violence and abduction. The police force \n     is considerably smaller and more poorly managed when compared \n     to prior to the war. There is limited police street presence; \n     fewer resources available to police to investigate; little if \n     any record keeping; and many complaints are lost. Many \n     hospitals and the forensic institute are unable to operate \n     twenty-four hours a day as they did before the war, thus \n     preventing women from obtaining medical treatment and the \n     forensic examinations necessary to document sexual violence \n     in a timely manner.\n\n  The summary concludes with the following,\n\n       At the time of writing, plans for Iraq's reconstruction are \n     taking shape and rights of women and girls are at stake. It \n     is essential that all parties involved in these plans address \n     the state's inadequate protection of the rights of women and \n     girls. Those involved in the reconstruction process should \n     ensure that any existing and new trends toward treating women \n     and girls unequally before the law and discouraging women and \n     girls from reporting sexual violence, or punishing women and \n     girls for being the victims of sexual violence are countered.\n\n  We all know that our troops are faced with dangerous resistance \nthroughout Iraq. Just yesterday, our military leaders acknowledged that \nwe were facing a guerrilla warfare campaign of resistance. We know that \nour troops are serving honorably in a tremendously difficult \nenvironment. All of America is proud of our all volunteer force now \nserving in Iraq and the region.\n  Despite the efforts of U.S. personnel, we have not adequately \naddressed the domestic security crisis in Iraq. We cannot ignore that \nwomen and young girls are being victimized with terrible consequences. \nThese crimes do not just affect individual women but the way women are \nviewed and the role they will play in a new Iraq.\n  We cannot be silent about the abuse and violence that has come to \nwomen\n\n[[Page S9562]]\n\nand girls in liberated Iraq. The Schumer amendment is our opportunity \ntoday to tell the administration that we will not tolerate silence on \nthe treatment of women and girls in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New York for bringing this \nissue to the Senate for the reasons he stated in order to allow us to \nknow when our troops are going to be home. But, as I mentioned, I add \nanother dimension to why it is so important to put a police force and \nhave a trained police force in Iraq and on the ground there.\n  I would recommend to all of my colleagues that they take the time to \npick up the New York Times from yesterday and read the article I \nreferred to, which is a front page article: ``Rape (And Silence About \nIt) Haunts Baghdad.'' I will read from the beginning of that article:\n\n       In her loose black dress, gold hairband and purple flip-\n     flops, Sanariya hops from seat to seat in her living room \n     like any lively 9-year-old. She likes to read. She wants to \n     be a teacher when she grows up, and she says Michael, her \n     white teddy bear, will be her assistant.\n       But at night, the memory of being raped by a stranger seven \n     weeks ago pulls her into its undertow. She grows feverish and \n     has nightmares, her 28-year-old sister, Fatin, said. She \n     cries, ``Let me go!''\n       ``I am afraid of the gangsters,'' [she says].\n  Every one of our colleagues should read the Human Rights Watch report \nthat has just been released titled ``Climate of Fear, Sexual Violence \nand Abduction of Women and Girls in Baghdad.'' That report says that \nmany of the problems in addressing sexual violence and abduction that \nare increasing in Iraq against women and girls derived from the United \nStates-led coalition force's and civilian administration's failure to \nprovide public security in Baghdad.\n  We went to war in Iraq. We have heard everyone say it was to restore \nfreedom. Let's make sure the young girls in Iraq have that security and \nthat freedom as well. They do not have it today. The amendment by the \nSenator from New York puts us on track. We need to follow this in Iraq. \nI commend the Senator for the amendment and I thank the manager of the \nbill for accepting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1285 through 1298, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a series of \namendments.

(a) None of the funds appropriated by this Act \n     may be used for converting to contractor performance an \n     activity or function of the Department of Defense that, on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, is performed by \n     Department of Defense employees unless the conversion is \n     based on the results of a public-private competition process \n     that--\n       (1) applies the most efficient organization process except \n     to the performance of an activity or function involving 10 or \n     fewer employees (but prohibits any modification, \n     reorganization, division, or other change that is done for \n     the purpose of qualifying the activity or function for such \n     exception);\n       (2) provides no advantage to an offeror for a proposal to \n     save costs for the Department of Defense by offering \n     employer-sponsored health insurance benefits to workers to be \n     employed under contract for the performance of such activity \n     or function that are in any respect less beneficial to the \n     workers than the benefits provided for Federal employees \n     under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code; and\n       (3) requires a determination regarding whether, over all \n     performance periods stated in the solicitation of offers for \n     performance of the activity or function, the cost of \n     performance of the activity or function by a contractor would \n     be less costly to the Department of Defense by an amount that \n     equals or exceeds the lesser of (A) 10 percent of the most \n     efficient organization's personnel-related costs for \n     performance of that activity or function by Federal \n     employees, or (B) $10,000,000.\n       (b) The Secretary of Defense may, in the Secretary's \n     discretion, apply the tradeoff source selection public-\n     private competition process under Office of Management and \n     Budget Circular A-76 to the performance of services related \n     to the design, installation, operation, or maintenance of \n     information technology (as defined in section 11101 of title \n     40, United States Code).\n       (c)(1) This section does not apply to a conversion of an \n     activity or function of the Department of Defense to \n     contractor performance if the Secretary of Defense (A) \n     determines in writing that compliance would have a \n     substantial adverse impact on the ability of the Department \n     of Defense to perform its national security missions, and (B) \n     publishes such determination in the Federal Register.\n       (2) This section and subsections (a), (b), and (c) of \n     section 2461 of title 10, United States Code, do not apply \n     with respect to the performance of a commercial or industrial \n     type activity or function that--\n       (A) is on the procurement list established under section 2 \n     of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 47); or\n       (B) is planned to be converted to performance by--\n       (i) a qualified nonprofit agency for the blind or a \n     qualified nonprofit agency for other severely handicapped (as \n     such terms are defined in section 5 of such Act (41 U.S.C. \n     48b); or\n       (ii) a commercial business at least 51 percent of which is \n     owned by an Indian tribe (as defined in section 4(e) of the \n     Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 450b(e))) or a Native Hawaiian Organization (as \n     defined in section 8(a)(15) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 637(a)(15))).\n\n[[Page S9564]]\n\n       (d) Nothing in this Act shall affect depot contracts or \n     contracts for depot maintenance as provided in sections 2469 \n     and 2474 of title 10, United States Code.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this amendment \nto make sure that competitions between civilian Defense Department \nemployees and private companies are fair. The Department of Defense has \nstacked the deck against Federal employees. The administration is \nseeking to privatize much of the Federal workforce--to replace \ndedicated Federal workers with cronyism and patronage.\n  The Kennedy amendment does not stop privatization. Yet it ensures \nthat competitions between civilian Defense Department employees and \nprivate companies are fair. It puts Federal employees on an equal \nfooting with private contractors. It says that you cannot win \ncompetitions for Federal jobs by denying health care benefits to your \nemployees. It makes sure privatization does not come at the expense of \nhealth benefits for employees. Government contracts should not be won \nby denying health benefits to hard-working Americans.\n  The Office of Management and Budget has issued a directive calling \nfor bounty hunters in Federal agencies to privatize 850,000 jobs over \nthe next 3 years. That is nearly half of the Federal workforce. To \nspeed up the process, the Bush administration changed the rules for \npublic/private competitions. The new rules stacked the deck against \nemployees, and made it harder for them to compete for their own jobs. \nIt created streamlined competitions that are not even based on cost \nsavings. The employees cannot even submit their own lowest bid. These \nnew rules are unfair and inefficient. They will likely end up costing \nmore to American taxpayers.\n  I stand up for an independent Federal workforce. We should not \nreplace good Government jobs with bad private sector jobs. A company \nshould not be able to win a bid because it saves money by denying \nhealth care benefits for their employees. Privatization should not come \non the backs of the employees. Our economy is in trouble. Health care \ncosts are rising--and millions of Americans lack any health insurance. \nWhy does this administration want to make this problem even worse?\n  Our democracy depends on a strong civil service. We need a civil \nservice in this country that is independent, reliable, and free of \ncronyism and political patronage. We are trying to spread democracy to \nIraq and to nurture new democracies around the world. Yet right here at \nhome, there are some who want to get rid of a pillar of democracy--our \nindependent Federal workforce.\n  As a Senator from Maryland, I am so proud to serve over 100,000 \nFederal employees. I wish you could meet them the way I do--on the job \nand at the supermarket. I represent people who are Nobel Prize winners \nat the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology. I represent FBI agents. I represent the \nNational Security Agency, and the faculty of the U.S. Naval Academy.\n  I know what Federal employees do. They work hard every day. They did \nnot get their jobs because they volunteered on someone's campaign. The \ncivilian employees at the Defense Department work hard to support our \ntroops and to protect our Nation. They are committed to securing the \nhomeland, and to making sure our soldiers are ready to protect us.\n  If we are going to contract out Defense Department work, we need to \nbe very careful. It is a matter of national security. It is a matter of \nhomeland security. America's military bases and facilities are all \npotential terrorist targets. Those who work there must be trusted and \ncarefully screened. Yet the Department of Defense wants to get rid of \ntrusted employees who have served our Nation for years--and replace \nwith who knows what. What would happen if the private company changed \nownership, or is bought by a foreign company? What safeguards are there \nto protect our military and our military infrastructure?\n  That is why I am cosponsoring the Kennedy amendment. This amendment \nsimply calls for civilian Defense Department employees to be treated \nfairly when they are competing for their own jobs. Federal employees' \njobs are on the line. The independence of our Federal workforce is on \nthe line. At the very least, the competition should be fair. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it was necessary to handle it separately \nbecause it was already a pending amendment, and it had to be withdrawn.\n  I now ask for its consideration and adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1299) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just briefly let me say this: I know my tie \nisn't much, but I have been advised by staff and others it is sure \nbetter than seersucker.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1300\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send a further amendment to the desk \nand state that this is separate and apart from the managers' package. \nIt is an amendment I submit on behalf of Senator Hatch. It has not been \ncleared by my friend from Arizona. When the title is read, it will be \napparent to the Members why.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Hatch, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1300:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1300\n\n   (Purpose: To appropriate funds to settle certain claims of United \n    States prisoners of war who performed forced or slave labor for \n                Japanese companies during World War II)\n\n       After section 8123, insert the following:\n\n TITLE IX--SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR SLAVE LABOR FOR JAPANESE COMPANIES \n                          DURING WORLD WAR II\n\n     SEC. 901.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Former prisoner of war.--The term ``former prisoner of \n     war'' means any individual who--\n       (A) was a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, \n     a civilian employee of the United States, or an employee of a \n     contractor of the United States during World War II;\n       (B) served in or with the United States combat forces \n     during World War II;\n       (C) was captured and held as a prisoner of war or prisoner \n     by Japan in the course of such service; and\n       (D) was required by one or more Japanese companies to \n     perform forced or slave labor during World War II.\n       (2) Japanese company.--The term ``Japanese company'' \n     means--\n       (A) any business enterprise, corporation, company, \n     association, partnership, or sole proprietorship having its \n     principal place of business within Japan or organized or \n     incorporated under the laws of Japan or any political \n     subdivision thereof; and\n       (B) any subsidiary or affiliate of an entity in Japan, as \n     described in subparagraph (A), if controlled in fact by the \n     entity, whether currently incorporated or located in Japan or \n     elsewhere.\n       (5) World war ii.--The term ``World War II'' means the \n     period beginning on December 7, 1941, and ending on August 8, \n     1945.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today, entitled the \nResolution of Claims of American POWs of the Japanese Act of 2003, is \nimportant because it recognizes the struggle to compensate American \nPOWs once held and forced into slave labor for private Japanese \ncompanies during World War II.\n  For those of my colleagues who aren't aware of what our valiant \nsoldiers endured, please let me enlighten you.\n  On April 9, 1942, Allied forces in the Philippines were forced to \nsurrender Bataan to the Japanese. Ten thousand to 12,000 American \nsoldiers were forced to march some 60 miles in broiling heat. We have \nall heard of this deadly trek, known as the Bataan Death March.\n  What most people do not realize is, after a lengthy internment under \nhorrific conditions, thousands of these POWs were shipped to Japan in \nthe holds of freighters known as ``Hell Ships.'' Once in Japan, many of \nthese POWs were forced into slave labor for private Japanese steel \nmills and other private companies until the end of the war. During the \nwar, over 27,465 Americans were captured and interned by the Japanese; \ntragically, only 16,000 made it home.\n  Let me tell you about some of these brave men.\n  At our Judiciary Committee hearing a few years ago, we heard from \nsome of these remarkable veterans who put a human face on this tragic \npart of history. They are all heroes.\n  I remember so well Mr. Bigelow, who, during his internment lost his \nleg from a mining accident and the lack of proper medical treatment. At \na height of 6 feet, 4 inches, Mr. Bigelow weighed less than 100 pounds \nat the time of his release. Tragically, he died last week--- without \never receiving the recognition that he deserved, recognition that we as \na body can give him.\n  Mr. President, how many more have to die before we finally pay them \nthe tribute they deserve?\n  At our hearing, we heard how the POWs stuck together and helped each \nother make it through each day and endured frequent beatings for doing \nso.\n  We heard how Mr. Tenney and others kept their spirits up by \nentertaining their buddies and trading with Japanese guards for a few \nmeager supplies.\n  We heard how brave men like Terrence Kirk built a makeshift camera \nout of a stolen x-ray plate to document the condition of dying POWs so \nthey would not be forgotten.\n  Let me say to the veterans who have shared their stories with me--and \nI know some of these men personally thank you. All of them are heroes \nfor their bravery on the battlefields and in the prison camps.\n  They are heroes for the innumerable displays of compassion and love \nfor their fellow man.\n  They are heroes for their perseverance through circumstances most of \nus can barely imagine.\n  They are living testaments to the indomitable human spirit that is \nthe fabric of this great nation, the United States of America. Everyone \nhere living in freedom owes them a tremendous debt of gratitude.\n  Unfortunately, global political and security needs of the time often \novershadowed their legitimate claims for justice and they were once \nagain asked to sacrifice for their country.\n  Following the end of the war, for example, our government allegedly \ninstructed many of the POWs not to discuss their experiences and \ntreatment. Some were even asked to sign non-disclosure agreements. \nConsequently, many Americans remain unaware of the atrocities that took \nplace and the suffering our POWs endured.\n  Just ask the school children of today. Most know little about the \nBataan Death March and nothing about the fact that our soldiers were \nshipped to Japan and sold as slave labor.\n  That is inexcusable. We must recognize their sacrifice, and the \namendment I offer today supports that effort.\n  Through the years, various efforts have been made to offer some \ncompensation for the POWs held in Japan.\n  Under the War Claims Act, our government has made meager payments of \na dollar a day for missed meals and $1.50 per day for lost wages. \nClearly this is inadequate.\n  Following the passage of a California statute extending the statute \nof limitations for World War II claims until 2010 and the recent \nlitigation involving victims of Holocaust, the former POWs in Japan \nhave attempted through the courts to seek compensation from the private \ncompanies which profited from their labor.\n\n  What role has our government played in this quest?\n  In the Holocaust litigation, the U.S. played a facilitating role in \ndiscussions between the German companies and the victims. The Justice \nDepartment also declined to file a statement of interest in the \nlitigation--even when requested by the court. The efforts of the \nadministration were entirely appropriate and the settlement was an \ninvaluable step toward moving forward from the past.\n  Here, in contrast, there has been little effort by our government, \nthrough the State Department or otherwise, to help these POWs with \ntheir claims. In fact, quite the opposite has been true.\n  In response to a request from the court, the Justice Department \nactually filed a statement of interest which was very damaging to the \nclaims of the POWs--stating in essence that their claims were barred by \nthe 1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan and the War Claims Act. Personally, \nI don't think the government had the authority to waive these claims. \nUnbelievably, the Justice Department continues to argue in these court \ncases on behalf of the Japanese companies and against our POWs.\n  This contrasting treatment raises the legitimate questions of whether \nthis administration has a consistent policy governing whether and how \nto weigh in during these World War II-era cases? From a moral \nperspective, the claims of those forced into labor by private German \ncompanies and private Japanese companies appear to be of similar merit, \nyet they have spurred different responses from the administration.\n  Why?\n  I have asked this question to the State Department, and have not \nreceived a satisfactory response.\n  What can the United States of America--the country these men \nsacrificed for--do to resolve this matter in a fair and appropriate \nmanner?\n  With the help of Senator Feinstein, in 2000, we moved through the \nJudiciary Committee S. 1902, the Japanese Records Disclosure Act. This \nbill set up a commission to declassify thousands of Japanese Imperial \nArmy records held by the U.S. government after appropriate screening \nfor sensitive information such as that pertaining to national security.\n  That bill, however, was not enough. We need to do more.\n  The Senate attempted to fulfill our government's responsibility to \nthese men by including a provision in S. 2549, the fiscal year 2001 \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. This legislation would have \nallowed payments of a $20,000 gratuity to POWs from Bataan and \nCorregidor who were forced into labor. But unfortunately, the provision \nwas stripped in conference, due in large part, I believe, to pressure \nfrom the previous Administration.\n  We also passed S. Con. Res. 158, a resolution at the end of the 106th \nCongress\n\n[[Page S9566]]\n\nwhich stated the moral force of the claims of the POWs and expressed \nthe sense of the Congress that the United States government should use \nits best efforts to ``facilitate a dialogue'' to discuss a resolution \nto the claims. But this has received a less than satisfactory response \nfrom the administration.\n  We must ask ourselves--can Congress do more?\n  Can the executive branch do more?\n  I think so.\n  We must.\n  And it is for that reason that I am offering the Resolution of Claims \nof American POWs of the Japanese Act of 2003.\n  This legislation would show these POWs that we have not forgotten \nthem and that we will not let them be victimized by the Japanese \ncompanies a second time.\n  My amendment would authorize the payment of compensation to former \nprisoners of war for forced labor for Japanese companies during World \nWar II. Those surviving POWs who are still living--and there are not \nmany--would receive $10,000. This is a mere fraction of what they truly \ndeserve, and I intend to seek additional amounts next year to fulfill \nour obligation to our heroes.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is essential.\n  Congress is the last recourse for these POWs.\n  Instead of helping, our government has let them down. And so, if we \ndo not stand up for them, who will?\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in this effort to do what we can \nto show these brave POWs that their country has not forgotten them; it \nis the least we can do.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in relation to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, related to compensation for American \nprisoners of war in Japan, I do not object but must of necessity vote \n``present'' because, as a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, I cannot \nin good conscience vote in favor of a measure that sets a precedent for \ncompensation of American prisoners of war that could in some fashion be \nviewed as benefiting me personally.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a prisoner of war provision \noffered by Senator Hatch. We have agreed to start the process of \ndealing with claims of these individuals. Since our good friend from \nArizona was in fact a prisoner of war, he did not want to participate \nin the adoption or consideration of this amendment. We are honoring his \nrequest. I ask for the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1300) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Hawaii who has \nthe Democratic portion of the managers' package.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1301 through 1316, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I send to the desk 16 amendments as part \nof the managers' package and ask unanimous consent for their immediate \nconsideration en bloc.\n  They are: Senator Feinstein amendment on secure cell phones; Senator \nBoxer amendment on Shortstop, an Army program; Senator Durbin amendment \non the 932nd Airlift Command; Senator Mikulski amendment on Project \nAncile; Senator Mikulski amendment on knowledge management fusion; \nSenator Schumer amendment on Large Energy National Shock Tunnel; \nSenator Dorgan amendment on ultra-low-power battlefield sensor system; \nSenator Biden amendment on nuclear debris collection; Senator Bayh \namendment on M1A1 tank transmissions; Senator Inouye amendment on civil \nrights history in the Army; Senator Harkin amendment on airplane parts; \nSenator Wyden amendment on Iraq reconstruction contracts; Senator Boxer \namendment on travel expenses; Senator Biden amendment on C-5s; Senator \nSchumer amendment on Iraq report; Senator Byrd amendment on travel \ncredit card checks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) If a terrorist group were to acquire the necessary \n     fissile material for a nuclear explosive device, it would not \n     be difficult for the group to construct such a device, the \n     explosion of which could kill and injure thousands, or even \n     hundreds of thousands, of people and destroy a large area of \n     a city.\n       (2) If a terrorist group were to acquire a complete nuclear \n     weapon from a nation which has constructed nuclear weapons, \n     it is likely that the group would be able to detonate the \n     device with similar results.\n       (3) A nation supplying either complete nuclear weapons or \n     special nuclear material to\n\n[[Page S9567]]\n\n     terrorists might believe that it could escape retaliation by \n     the United States, as the United States would not be able to \n     determine the origin of either a weapon or its fissile \n     material.\n       (4) It is possible, however, to determine the country of \n     origin of fissile material after a nuclear explosion, \n     provided that samples of the radioactive debris from the \n     explosion are collected promptly and analyzed in appropriate \n     laboratories.\n       (5) If radioactive debris is collected soon enough after a \n     nuclear explosion, it is also possible to determine the \n     characteristics of the nuclear explosive device involved, \n     which information can assist in locating and dismantling \n     other nuclear devices that may threaten the United States.\n       (6) If countries that might contemplate supplying nuclear \n     weapons or fissile material to terrorists know that their \n     assistance can be traced, they are much less likely to allow \n     terrorists access to either weapons or material.\n       (7) It is in the interest of the United States to acquire a \n     capability to collect promptly the debris from a nuclear \n     explosion that might occur in any part of the Nation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate on Nuclear Debris Collection and \n     Analysis Capability.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense should develop and deploy a \n     nuclear debris collection and analysis capability sufficient \n     to enable characterization of any nuclear device that might \n     be exploded in the United States;\n       (2) the capability should incorporate airborne debris \n     collectors, either permanently installed on dedicated \n     aircraft or available for immediate use on a class of \n     aircraft, stationed so that a properly equipped and manned \n     aircraft is available to collect debris from a nuclear \n     explosion anywhere in the United States and transport such \n     debris to an appropriate laboratory in a timely fashion; and\n       (3) to the maximum extent practicable, the capability \n     should be compatible with collection and analysis systems \n     used by the United States to characterize overseas nuclear \n     explosions.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than March 31, 2004, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report on the feasibility of developing and \n     deploying the capability described in subsection (b)(1).\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1309\n\n    (Purpose: To make available amounts available for Operation and \n Maintenance, Army, up to $15,000,000 for upgrades of M1A1 Abrams tank \n                             transmissions)\n\n       Insert after section 8123 the following:\n       Sec. 8124.

Mr. President, two weeks ago, the company Hydroform USA, \nits subsidiary Temperform, and three company managers were indicted for \nconspiracy and making false statements. This is just the latest event \nin\n\n[[Page S9568]]\n\na long horror story that may still threaten the safety of both military \nand civilian aviation. And it raises serious questions, yet again, \nabout our ability and commitment to root out defense fraud that attacks \nour taxpayers and our troops.\n  The story is told at length in a special issue of Defense Week dated \nJuly 3 and written by John Donnelly. It starts with a company called \nWest Coast Aluminum Heat-Treating Company, which had a plant in La \nMirada, CA. Many aluminum parts on airplanes and rockets are heat-\nthreaten to stengthen the parts, reduce corrosion, and prevent cracking \nand fatigue. West Coast was paid to do this by a large number of \nairplane manufacturers and suppliers. But beginning in 1981, they did \nthe heat treatment for far less time and at lower temperatures than \nrequired. They didn't falsified testing of the parts. This fraud went \non undetected, on hundreds of thousands of parts, for fifteen years. \nThe parts ended up on a long list of military airplanes, helicopters, \nand rockets from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and other \ncontractors, as well as on many commercial planes and helicopters from \nBoeing, Airbus, and other manufacturers. In 1996, a West Coast foreman \nfinally blew the whistle to Boeing.\n  Boeing, observed by the Federal Aviation Administration, eventually \ntested 1,634 parts for hardness and electrical conductivity. They found \nthat 18 percent of the parts were critical, and that 11 percent of the \nparts did not meet specifications because of the fraudulent heat \ntreatment. Tests on hundreds of other parts had similar results. But \nthese tests may not reveal the full extent of the problems. Other, more \ninformative tests that destroy the parts are needed to assess heat \ntreatment well. And even parts supposedly tested may not be good, \nalthough Boeing claimed that subcontractors had tested many parts, the \nFAA found that six of the subcontractors could not document such \ntesting; the other three subcontractors they contacted did have test \nrecords showing the parts were good, but when the FAA tested the parts, \nthey found the parts did not in fact meet specifications.\n  Even though the fraud was revealed in 1996 and Boeing disqualified \nWest Coast as a vendor in 1997, it took another year before Boeing and \nthe Government bothered to let other customers know that the parts \ncould be defective. They finally issued alerts on the Government-\nIndustry Data Exchange Program called GIDEP, in 1998. For those two \nyears other defense contractors continued to use West Coast. In \naddition, the alert that Boeing finally issued focused on \n``discrepancies'' in paperwork, and claimed that the parts were fine.\n  Government oversight was equally weak. Although the FAA concluded \nthat Boeing had violated federal regulations because it did not \nadequately supervise its subcontractors, it said the statute of \nlimitations had expired and hence it could not pursue enforcement \naction. Worse, the Defense Logistics Agency wrote reports suggesting \nthat West Coast-treated parts were fine, based on a database of 253,736 \nparts. But they did not actually know which parts were from West Coast, \nand they knew that many of the parts in the database were not even made \nof aluminum.\n  In 1998, West Coast was sold, and in 2000 its two executives were \nconvicted, sentenced, and fined. The plant was bought by Temperform, \nwhich proceeded to commit the same fraud on tens of thousands of \nadditional parts. It has been said that history repeats itself, first \nas tragedy and then as farce. The Temperform replay of West Coast would \nbe amusing if it weren't still tragic. Temperform fired the West Coast \nemployees so that Boeing would approve the company as a vendor, then \npromptly rehired them. The same heat-treating fraud continued \nundetected, and another employee finally blew the whistle again in \n2000. Despite the plant's history, Boeing did not audit Temperform \nuntil this time, and then allegedly found 37 deficiencies in their \nquality assurance processes.\n  To this date, neither Boeing nor anyone else has ever issued a GIDEP \nalert to let other companies know of the Temperform fraud. A Government \nsafety alert, issued only in 2002, went only to Government agencies. \nThus, Lockheed Martin continued to buy parts from Temperform for more \nthan two years. Again, the Government accused Boeing of mismanagement \nbut declined to do anything about it. The plant again was sold in 2002, \nand, as I mentioned, three company executives were recently indicted. \nOne of those three, the manager in charge of heat-treating procedures, \nwas one of the West Coast employees who were rehired.\n  That is all history. But I have not yet explained a key reason why \nthis remains a continuing threat. Almost all of the testing of parts I \nmentioned was of commercial parts. The military services claim that \nthey cannot identify which parts were treated by a particular company, \neven for safety critical parts. Typically major weapon system programs \nare now managed by private contractors, which then have a large number \nof subcontractors supplying parts. West Coast and Temperform contracted \nwith many of those subcontractors. Apparently we cannot negotiate this \nmaze to find which parts, even safety critical parts, were fraudulently \ntreated. Thus, few military parts have been tested, and if they were \nfound unsatisfactory, it is not clear how they would be replaced.\n  This is not the first time this problem has come up. Not long ago the \nPentagon bought 780,000 chemical protective suits from a company called \nIsratex. We cannot find 250,000 of those suits either. And last year \nthe Navy could not find 42,000 defective oxygen masks.\n  My amendment attempts at least to examine several of these systemic \nissues. It requests that the Secretary of Defense report back to \nCongress by March 31, 2004, on efforts to find and test the parts that \nhave been improperly heat-treated, and on notification of other \ncustomers that their parts may be defective. The report also is to look \nat how to implement a system for tracking safety-critical parts, and at \nstandards and procedures for notification on future safety issues.\n  The amendment also asks the General Accounting Office to submit a \nreport on issues regarding the prime contractor system that may be \npartly at fault here. The GAO is to look at both the oversight of \nsubcontractors by the prime contractor--which is what they are paid to \ndo--and the oversight and enforcement of prime contractors by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Hunderds of thousands of aluminum parts that are in our airplanes and \nhelicopters today have not been properly strengthened. Many of these \nparts are safety-critical. Millions of people, civilian and military, \nmay be at risk if a plane crashes due to a failure of one of these \nparts. We are at risk not only because of the fraud, but also because \nof the failure all the way down the line--by small subcontractors, huge \nplane manufacturers, and the Government--to catch the fraud, stop it in \na timely manner, notify others at risk, track or test the parts, or \nhold anyone accountable for the oversight failures.\n  We must do better. This amendment is a small step toward fixing the \nproblems, and I intend to pursue this until I am confident such abuse \ncannot happen again.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1316\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last year, Senator Grassley and I had an \namendment included in the Fiscal Year 2003 Defense Appropriations Act \nto crack down on the abuse of credit cards that are issued to Pentagon \nemployees. Today, we offer an amendment to extend those provisions \nthrough fiscal year 2004.\n  The General Accounting Office has completed numerous studies on \nGovernment-issued charge cards. These reports have highlighted the \nDepartment of Defense as one of the worst abusers of those cards. \nDefense Department employees have been caught red-handed using their \nGovernment-issued credit card to pay for personal expenses such as \nluxury cruises, concert tickets, Internet gambling, and even adult \nentertainment. Incredibly, these abusive charges are being underwritten \nby the U.S. taxpayer, to the tune of untold millions each year.\n  Based on this evidence, the GAO has recommended that DOD employees \nshould undergo credit checks before they are issued a Government charge \ncard. That is exactly what the amendment offered last year by Senator \nGrassley and me required.\n\n[[Page S9569]]\n\n  The GAO recently reported to our staffs that despite progress in \ncracking down on some types of abuse, the Pentagon has not complied \nwith last year's Byrd-Grassley amendment. That is why we offer an \namendment to this Defense bill to extend last year's provision of the \nDefense Appropriations Act to apply in fiscal year 2004.\n  The Pentagon should be on notice that it has to straighten out its \nact with regard to charge card abuse, as well as a whole host of other \naccounting problems. Ignoring laws that require the Department of \nDefense to crack down on these problems is a serious mistake. Congress \nshould send the message loud and clear that we expect them to comply \nwith the Byrd-Grassley amendment on credit card abuse.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n         muscular dystrophy research/muscle research consortium\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nfunding for the Muscular Dystrophy Research/Muscle Research Consortium \nto study muscular disease. Funding will allow the consortium to conduct \ncritical research on muscular dystrophy through the Department of \nDefense Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program. I note that the \ncommittee has stated its support for this very worthwhile program, in \nthe report to accompany the fiscal year 2004 DoD appropriations bill. I \nurge the committee when conferencing with the House to include full \nfunding for this program.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. The committee has noted its \nsupport of the program, and I assure my friend from Minnesota that the \ncommittee will give its full consideration to this program while \nconferencing with the House.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I thank the chairman for his support, and I also not \nthat the House has included funding for this program. I look forward to \nworking with the chairman to protect this project during conference.\n\n\n                           Roboscout Program\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD: I would like to ask a question of the managers of the \nbill: It is my understanding that the bill zeros out funding for the \nRoboscout program, also called Combat Zones That See.\n  Mr. STEVENS: Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD: It is further my understanding that zeroing out funding \nfor this program will prohibit any research and development on \nRoboscout?\n  Mr. STEVENS: That is correct. The Department of Defense should not be \nengaging in any work on the Roboscout program.\n  Mr. INOUYE: I concur with the Chairman. His statements express our \nintent for this program quite well.\n\n\n               weapons of mass destruction Civil Support\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have long advocated the creation of 23 \nadditional full-time National Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil \nSupport Teams and have supported the location of at least one team in \neach state and territory of the United States. I am pleased that last \nyear the Congress passed--and the President signed into law--a defense \nauthorization bill that required that these important teams be created.\n  I am also pleased that earlier this year the Senate passed a defense \nauthorization bill that includes $88.4 million for 12 new teams in \nfiscal year 2004. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Armed \nServices Committee for their support on this issue, and for including \nlanguage in the report accompanying the fiscal year 2004 DoD \nauthorization bill urging the Pentagon to include funding for the \nremaining eleven teams in its fiscal year 2005 budget request.\n  I also want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee for their work on this issue. I \nwonder if the managers would engage with me in a brief colloquy on this \nsubject.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is my understanding that the bill as amended by the \nChairman includes the full $88.4 million authorized by the Armed \nServices Committee for 12 new Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support \nTeams. I ask the Chairman of the Committee and the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] if that is the case?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. So it is your understanding that the funding included \nin the bill currently before the Senate includes sufficient funding to \nman, equip, and train 12 new civil support teams?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the managers.\n\n\n                   Abrams System Enhancement Program\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as we consider appropriations for our \nmen and women in uniform for the upcoming fiscal year, I would like to \ntake this opportunity to express my strong support for the M1A2 System \nEnhancement Program.\n  As our experience in Iraq has demonstrated, the Abrams tank remains \ncrucial to the efforts to the United States Armed Forces. The tanks of \nthe 3rd Infantry Division were among the first on the ground in Iraq. \nHowever, the armed reconnaissance regiment of the CounterAttack Corps \n(CATK)--the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR)--is fighting with older, \nless capable M1A1 tanks.\n  The M1A2 System Enhancement Program retrofits existing tanks to \nincorporate the most sophisticated technologies, allowing them to best \ncommunicate with and protect the rest of the CounterAttack Corps. I \nbelieve it is critical to provide our soldiers in the 3rd Armed Cavalry \nRegiment--the eyes and ears of the CounterAttack Corps--with the most \nmodern equipment available to them.\n  The State of Ohio, home to the Lima Army Tank Plant, plays a critical \nrole in this modernization effort. The thousands of men and women who \nhave worked at the Lima Army Tank Plant have played a long and \ndistinguished role in the history of the mighty Abrams. This continued \nduring Operation Iraqi Freedom, when the plant's employees responded to \na call by the Defense Department and within the period of just one week \ndesigned, tested, produced and shipped to Iraq armored protection to \nbolster the armor around the exhaust.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives in conference to ensure that sufficient funds \nare maintained to upgrade the tanks of the 3rd Armored Cavalry \nRegiment, better serving our men and women in uniform and the U.S. \nmilitary in their efforts to promote peace, security and democracy in \nIraq and other parts of the world.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nstatement of Senator Voinovich regarding the importance of the M1A2 \nSystem Enhancement Program. I strongly support providing the necessary \nfunding to modernize the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR) tank fleet. \nI would ask Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye to work with us to find \na way to address this important issue in conference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to join the junior Senator \nfrom Ohio and my colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, to urge the \nChairman of the Senate. Appropriations Committee to ensure that the \nFiscal Year 2004 Department of Defense Appropriations bill we send to \nthe President provides funding for at least one squadron of Abrams M1A2 \nSEP tanks for the U.S. Army's 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.\n\n  Like all Americans, I proudly watched on the nightly news as the U.S. \nArmy's Abrams tanks again proved themselves an indispensable asset in \nthe recent war in Iraq.\n  A critical element in the success in those battles--and any likely \nfuture conflict--is the U.S. Army's CounterAttack Corps. The armed \nreconnaissance regiment of the CATK is the 3rd Armored Cavalry \nRegiment, which needs the most up to date equipment to best protect our \nfighting men and women. The 3rd ACR must be upgraded to the Abrams M1A2 \nSEP to reflect new technologies.\n  The ground combat vehicle defense industrial base is critical to our \nnational security as we transform our military services into more \nlethal, survivable and sustainable entities, particularly as we prepare \nfor new programs such as Future Combat Systems.\n\n[[Page S9570]]\n\n  I am proud that Scranton, Pennsylvania is a critical part of that \nindustrial base. In Scranton, some two hundred highly dedicated, highly \nskilled workers--many of whom are members of UAW Local 1193--\nmanufacture critical components of the M1A2 SEP, such as turret race \nrings, LRUs and suspensions.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in Conference to ensure \nthat the fighting men and women of the 3rd ACR and the workers that \ntogether make up the backbone of our national security are protected \nwell into the future by providing funding for at least one squadron of \nM1A2 SEP tanks in the Fiscal Year 2004 Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues to \nhighlight the absolutely critical need to fund the Abrams tank program \nand the M1A2 System Enhancement Program, specifically.\n  We have a moral obligation to our military forces to see that they \nare armed with the best equipment available when they put their lives \non the line. The M1A2 System Enhancement Program is an important step \nin achieving this goal because it will help ensure the tank crews and \nthe troops they protect get the highest, cutting edge technology \npossible. Like Senator Voinovich, I am extremely proud of the employees \nat the Lima Army Tank Plant, who themselves take such pride in the \nimportant work they do every day to make sure our tanks continue to be \nthe best in the world.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to thank my colleagues for their remarks \nregarding the M1A2 System Enhancement Program. I understand their \nconcern with the need to provide resources to allow for the \nmodernization of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment tank fleet, and I \nlook forward to working with them as we begin conference with the House \nto address this important matter.\n\n\n                             netrp program\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. As the Chairman and Ranking Member are aware, for the \nlast 7 years, since 1997, the Department of Defense has sponsored a \nunique biomedical research effort called the Neurotoxin Exposure \nTreatment Research Program or NETRP. This program conducts medical \nresearch that has wide applications in protecting and treating our \nsoldiers, as well as advancing medical research that can lead to a cure \nfor Parkinson's disease, which afflicts more than one million \nAmericans.\n  The program addresses the protection of American soldiers from a wide \nrange of exposures including chemical warfare agents, potential toxins \nin military uniforms and jet fuel, and radiation from radar and \ncommunications systems. Findings from this military research then have \nbroad application to those diagnosed with Parkinson's and other \nneurodegenerative disorders.\n  This year's House of Representatives DOD Appropriations bill includes \nan increase in NETRP funding from the 2003 level of $21.25 million to \n$31 million--a solid investment in protecting our soldiers that can \nhave the added benefit of saving or vastly improving the lives of \nmillions of Americans.\n  Will the Chairman consider accepting the House proposal in \nconference?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I can assure the Senator from Alabama that I will give \nconsideration during conference to the House proposal to increase NETRP \nfunding levels.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I join my colleague from Alabama in thanking the Chairman \nfor his assurance to give this provision all due consideration during \nconference, and urge our Ranking Member, the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii, to likewise give consideration to this vital research to \nprotect our soldiers, as well as benefit our citizens with \nneurodegenerative diseases.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would be happy to join in that assurance.\n\n\n                         ec-130j modifications\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee regarding Special Operations \nCommand's information warfare platform, the ED-130J, which is funded in \nthe Defense Appropriations bill.\n  The 193rd Special Operations Wing (SOW), Pennsylvania Air National \nGuard, conducts information warfare missions such as psychological \noperations (PSYOP) civil affairs radio and television broadcasts, \nCommand Control Communications Counter Measures (C3CM) and limited \nintelligence gathering. Because many of the missions carried out are \noften classified, the public at large usually does not know the extent \nto which this unit has shaped events prior to conflict. In many cases, \ntheir mission has made conflict unnecessary or has reduced the loss of \nlife.\n  Last year, the Senate provided $87 million for a C-130J aircraft to \nbe purchased and converted into an EC-130J platform that is used by the \n193rd SOW. This sum was enough to purchase a C-130J, but not the unique \ncomponents that are to be fitted into the platform. I thank the \nCommittee for its support of this important platform by its inclusion \nof $10 million in the Senate Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004. \nI urge SOCOM to fully fund the unique components that will allow for \nthe conversion of one C-130J into an EC-130J aircraft.\n  I ask the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee to support the EC-130J modifications for \nSpecial Operations Command.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an important platform for SOCOM, \nas we have clearly demonstrated by our support in this bill.\n  These modifications are important to the mission of SOCOM and the \nreason for inclusion of $10 million of additional funding in the fiscal \nyear 2004 Defense Appropriations bill. The Committee also approved \nfunds that could be used for these modifications in the Supplemental \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2003.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would also expect the Department to give \nfull consideration to supporting this worthwhile project.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the fiscal year \n2004 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, I urge my colleagues to \nconsider the importance of protecting our Naval ships and sailors, \nparticularly in strategic ports, such as the port of Phildelphia, where \nheavy commercial and military traffic coexist. I strongly believe that \nit is critical we do everything we can to ensure the installation of \nsafeguards against future acts of terrorism. We must avoid another \ntragedy like the October 12, 2000 terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole \nin Yemen which claimed the life of 17 U.S. Sailors.\n  Recently, quad hull steel caisson technology has been identified as \nan effective protection mechanism for such ships and their crews. I \nencourage the Defense Appropriations Committee to pursue a \ndemonstration project focusing on this technology that can lead to full \nproduction of these quad hull modules on a timely basis.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to explain my vote on the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia to \nH.R 2658.\n  I share the Senator's concerns about our National Guard troops being \ndeployed overseas for long deployments. I understand that the families \nof these troops are anxiously awaiting the return of their loved ones. \nAnd I, too, am deeply concerned about our troops being sent on \ndangerous and ill-conceived missions abroad.\n  I regret, however, that I could not support this amendment because, \nonce the brave men and women of our Armed Forces are deployed, we \nshould not micromanage their deployment. The ability of our Reserve and \nGuard Forces to work together seamlessly with the regular Active Duty \nForces is critical. I am concerned that if we limit the length of \ndeployment of our Guard and Reserve troops, we will fundamentally \nchange this ``Total Force'' capability--and that is not a step that is \nin our interest today.\n  Before making this vote, I closely consulted with the National Guard \nin my State. They expressed to me the concerns I have noted. They \nexpressed their concern that limiting the length of troop deployment \nwill make them unusable for the Defense Department and therefore \nirrelevant to the American people. They do not want to become second-\ntier forces. Any change to their status should be carefully crafted in \nconsultation with them, and should be carefully debated here to ensure\n\n[[Page S9571]]\n\nthat the national security interests of the United States are fully \nprotected.\n  But the Senator from West Virginia was right to bring this debate to \nthe floor. The Guard and Reserve have been, and continue to be, heavily \nrelied on by our country. This puts a tremendous strain on these brave \nmen and women and on their families and we should look into ways in \nwhich we can reduce this burden. We should also ensure that our leaders \nare up front with the American people about the nature of the \ncommitments that we undertake and the costs that they will be asked to \nbear in any military deployment. This clarity was not forthcoming in \nthe debate over going to war in Iraq, and it is still not forthcoming \ntoday. The elected representatives of the American people are pressing \nthe administration for answers, but too often, timeframes and budgets \nand straightforward assessments are elusive. I will continue to join my \ncolleagues in fighting to ensure that Congress and the American people \nare given the answers they deserve to these vital questions.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \naddress my strong concern with the safety of U.S. military helicopters. \nAs my colleagues may be aware, yesterday, a MH-53E Sea Dragon \nhelicopter crashed roughly 10 miles southwest of the island of Sicily, \nwhich is home to U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella. Four members of the \nU.S. Armed Forces lost their lives in this tragic accident.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have continued to raise the issue of \naviation safety with our Defense Department. I believe it is crucial \nthat we provide the funding necessary to provide for the safety of our \nmen and women in uniform who ride in military helicopters--including \nfunds for required maintenance, training, and modernization.\n  On May 6, 1999, I spoke on the Senate floor in honor of two brave \nAmerican soldiers--Chief Warrant Officer Kevin L. Reichert and Chief \nWarrant Officer David A. Gibbs--who lost their lives when their Apache \nhelicopter crashed into the Albanian mountains during a routine \ntraining exercise on May 5, 1999, as U.S. troops joined with our NATO \nallies in a military campaign against Slobodan Milosevic. As I remarked \nat that time, the United States owes David, Kevin, and so many other \nservice members a debt of gratitude that we will never be able to \nrepay, for they have paid the ultimate sacrifice. As the Bible says in \nJohn chapter 15:13, ``Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay \ndown his life for his friends.''\n  As such, I strongly support a section of the report accompanying the \nversion of the Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2004 passed \nby the House of Representatives, H.R. 2658, which calls on the Army to \nprovide a report describing mishaps sustained by Apache aircraft in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Specifically, the language reads:\n\n       The Committee is additionally concerned about the unusually \n     high number of mishaps sustained by Apache aircraft in \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom. The high incident rate may have \n     resulted from the extensive number of security support and \n     non-traditional missions flown by aircraft, as well as \n     adverse weather conditions. As such, the Army is directed to \n     provide the congressional defense committees a report, no \n     later than January 30, 2004, that enumerates and describes \n     the Apache aircraft mishaps, the cause and to the extent \n     known, the follow-up actions the Army is considering to \n     address any systemic problems.\n\n  As we begin conference on the Defense Appropriations Act of fiscal \nyear 2004, I urge my Senate colleagues to retain this important \nprovision.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr President, I rise today in support of Air Force \nProcurement funds to purchase additional kits for the C-5 Avionics \nModernization Program, AMP.\n  The Air Force requested these kits in their Unfunded Priorities List \nfor Fiscal Year 2004, and both the House and Senate Defense \nauthorization bills provided additional funding. These funds would be \nused to help put the AMP installation back on schedule to be completed \nby fiscal year 2007.\n  The Senate defense authorization bill includes a requirement to \nupdate the Mobility Requirements Study. I believe this study will \nalmost certainly conclude that we do not have enough airlift capability \nto support our requirements. With this in mind, now is not the time to \ndecommission any airlift assets. We are currently retiring C-141 \naircraft. And the C-17 is a magnificent plane which has performed \nexceptionally well in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. \nThis year's budget provides for 11 new C-17s, nevertheless we cannot \npurchase C-17s fast enough to fulfill our airlift requirements--that is \nwhy we need this C-5 avionics modernization program. This installation \nwill extend the life and improve the capability of C-5s as well as \ncontribute to our national defense for years to come.\n  The Air Force has purchased 10 AMP kits to date. The President's \nbudget request only proposed funding for 18 kits. With the addition of \nmonies to purchase more kits, the Air Force can achieve its most \ndesirable schedule for purchasing kits and enhancing the C-5 fleet. The \nprogram is currently ahead of schedule and has performed exceptionally \nwell in testing.\n  The need for the C-5s capabilities is very clear. The C-5 carried \nabout half of all the cargo, 48 percent, in both Iraqi Freedom and \nEnduring Freedom--flying 28 percent of the sorties in Iraqi Freedom and \n35 percent of the sorties in Enduring Freedom. The AMP is necessary for \nevery plane in the fleet. In fact, General Handy, the Commander of U.S. \nTransportation Command and Air Mobility Command, has said that he \nstrongly supports additional funding and wants to see the C-5 fleet get \nthe avionics and safety upgrades of AMP as soon as possible.\n  The AMP modification will make the fleet compliant with the new \nGlobal Air Traffic Management standards established by the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization. By making the planes \ncompliant with the new Global, GATM, standards, the C-5 can use shorter \nflight paths and consume less fuel, thus operating more efficiently and \nwill be cheaper to maintain.\n  Even if the Air Force decides to retire some of the older C-5s in the \nnext 10 years, or move them completely to the Guard and Reserve, the \nplanes must have these upgrades to be viable and safe in high-density \nflight areas, in particular Europe and the Pacific. These planes will \nbe less expensive to maintain for their lifespan of flight.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to add my thoughts to the debate \non the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to thank all our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, marines, and members of the Coast Guard for their hard work in \nthe ongoing fight against terrorism, their efforts in Iraq, and the \nmany other missions to which they have been assigned. These dedicated \nmen and women have volunteered to undertake, often at great personal \nsacrifice, the task of protecting the American people and our way of \nlife. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the members of the United \nStates Armed Forces for their selfless service.\n  I am pleased that this bill appropriates an average pay raise of 4.15 \npercent for military personnel and lowers servicemembers' out-of-pocket \nhousing costs from 7.5 to 3.5 percent.\n  I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee has fully funded at \nthe authorized level the 12 additional full-time Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Civil Support Teams, WMD-CST, included in the Senate-passed \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. These teams, which are \nstaffed by full-time members of the National Guard, will play an \nintegral part in aiding first responders in their crucial work in the \nimmediate aftermath of a terrorist attack. I have been a longtime \nsupporter of the creation of these teams and am encouraged that we are \nwell on our way to assuring that every State will have at least one \nfull-time WMD-CST.\n  I am also pleased that funding for controversial data-mining \nprograms, like the Terrorism Information Awareness Program and the \nCombat Zones That See Program, have been zeroed out in this bill. The \nuntested and controversial intelligence procedure known as data-mining \nis capable of maintaining extensive files containing both public and \nprivate records on each and every American. Most Americans believe \ntheir private lives should remain private. Data-mining programs run the \nrisk of intruding into the lives of individuals who have nothing to do \nwith terrorism but who trust that their credit reports, shopping \nhabits, and doctor visits would not become a part\n\n[[Page S9572]]\n\nof a gigantic computerized search engine, operating without any \ncontrols or oversight.\n  Unfortunately this enormous spending bill also contains many \nunnecessary items. I continue to be deeply concerned about the \npriorities of the Pentagon and about the process by which we consider \nthe Department of Defense authorization and appropriations bills, a \nconcern I have voiced every year that I have been a Member of this \nbody. This bill includes $9.1 billion for missile defense, despite the \nfact that it is an unproven program. We also continue to pour billions \nof dollars into duplicative fighter aircraft programs. These are just \ntwo of many examples of excess.\n  Despite the almost $370 billion appropriated, this bill still does \nnot accurately reflect the true cost of the defense budget. This bill \nstays within the Department of Defense allocation only by rescinding $3 \nbillion from prior supplemental appropriations and counting those funds \nagainst this year's spending. Even worse, this bill contains absolutely \nno funding for the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, relying instead \non future supplemental appropriations. These accounting tricks will not \nstop the ballooning of the national debt.\n  I was also disappointed that the Senate tabled the amendment to fully \nfund the President's AIDS initiative. I was thrilled by the commitment \nto fighting AIDS articulated by President Bush in his State of the \nUnion Address, and I believe that the Congress should follow through on \nhis historic and admirable pledge. Because I recognize that the AIDS \npandemic is so devastating, because the pandemic causes the kind of \ninstability and social collapse that present real security problems, I \nsupported this amendment. But before I did, I studied it carefully \nbecause I needed to be certain that the offset would not diminish the \nresources available to the men and women of our armed forces currently \ndeployed in dangerous missions in Iraq and elsewhere. Close scrutiny \ngave me confidence that the senior Senator from West Virginia had \ncarefully crafted the offset to ensure that it would not do harm to our \ntroops.\n  I will vote for this bill. This legislation includes good elements, \nsuch as the pay increases for military personnel and the funding for \nthe establishment of much-needed WMD-CSTs. However, poor fiscal \npractices and accounting gimmicks cannot hide the fact that expensive, \nunproven, and redundant weapons programs continue to drain away scarce \nresources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the next vote will be the last vote of the \nevening. The Senate will not be in session on Friday. We will reconvene \non Monday and begin consideration of the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill.\n  As I previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes on Monday, \nalthough we hope Members will be prepared to give opening statements \nand offer amendments during Monday's debate.\n  The next votes will occur on Tuesday. We will alert all Senators as \nto the timing of those votes when they are scheduled. I will have more \nto say on the schedule when we close the evening.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing final passage, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk has read the bill for the third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment NO. 1300\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was inadvertently off the floor when the \nmanager of the bill offered a managers' amendment that dealt with \nproviding certain reparations to former U.S. servicemen who were held \ncaptive in Japan during World War II and were used as slave laborers in \nJapanese companies during the duration of the war.\n  Had I been on the floor at the time that amendment came up, I would \nhave spoken about it and might have taken exception to its inclusion. I \nwould have done so not because I do not think the former slave laborers \nof Japan deserve compensation, but it is coming from the wrong source.\n  Two years ago, Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire and I offered an \namendment that basically would have stopped the State Department and \nthe Department of Justice from using taxpayer dollars to defend the \ninterests of Japanese companies. That passed 58 to 34 in the Senate. \nThe House passed the identical amendment in July in an overwhelming 393 \nto 33 vote, same provision, both Chambers. Incredibly, it was stripped \nout of conference.\n  Since then, the State Department has been wielding its influence on \nbehalf of these Japanese companies, not the World War II POWs. I think \nthis is unconscionable. The provision added tonight, basically, as I \nunderstand it, would give up to $10,000 to each former POW slave \nlaborer, but that money comes from the taxpayers of America. Senator \nSmith and I said that money ought to come from the Japanese companies \nthat are still in existence. Some of them are multinational, some of \nthem huge, such as Mitsubishi, that actually used American slave \nlaborers during World War II. Many of these\n\n[[Page S9573]]\n\nPOWs were packed into cargo holds from the Philippines.\n\n  Four thousand American servicemen lost their lives during the Bataan \ndeath march. Those who survived were shipped off to Japan for more than \n3 years to serve as slave labor for private Japanese companies. \nThroughout the war, Americans worked in mines, factories, shipyards, \nand steel mills, labored each day for as long as 10 hours a day in \ndangerous working conditions. They were beaten on a regular basis.\n  Frank Exline of Pleasant Hill, IA, was one of those POWs, a Navy \nseaman, who was captured April 9, 1942.\n  Frank Smith worked 39 months for Japanese companies in Osaka, Japan. \nHe began on the docks unloading rock salt and keg iron and later found \nhimself toiling in the rice fields. He was fed two rice balls a day and \ngiven very little water. During his time with the Japanese companies, \nhe was tortured and beaten once for taking a potato. Upon being caught, \nthe potato was shoved in his mouth and he stood at rigid attention, in \nthe Sun, for 45 minutes. If he moved or blinked, he was beaten.\n  There was Frank Cardamon, of Des Moines, a marine stationed in China. \nHis ship was attacked, and he was captured at Corregidor and sent to \nJapan to work in an auto parts factory and in the mines and was never \npaid for his work. He was fed two cups of rice a day. He went from 160 \npounds to 68 pounds in 3 years of capture.\n  Margaret Baker, of Oelwein, IA, wrote a letter about her late \nhusband, Charles Baker. Charles Baker, an Army private, survived the \nBataan death march. He was sent to work in the mines for 3 years in \nJapan. He died at age 54 in 1973.\n  In her letter she wrote: He suffered many injuries and hunger on the \ndeath march and during his imprisonment. We feel his early death was \ncaused by the suffering he endured while working long hours in the \nmines without food, rest, and clothing.\n  These men and 700 of their fellow prisoners of war and their families \nhave been trying to seek long-delayed justice over the past several \nyears. They have been to court to demand compensation from the Japanese \ncompanies that used POW slave labor. Yet our own State Department has \ncome down on the side of the Japanese companies, not our POWs. The \nState Department took the view that a peace treaty signed in 1951 \nprohibits reparations from private Japanese companies for survivors \nsuch as Frank. In fact, State Department officials have submitted \nstatements to the court in support of the view of these Japanese \ncompanies.\n  Imagine our own State Department coming down on the side of the \nJapanese companies, not the side of our POWs. I don't think that is \nright and I don't think it is fair, especially when the State \nDepartment's assertion about the treaty is inaccurate.\n  The State Department says the treaty signed in 1951 in San Francisco, \narticle 14(b), exempts Japanese companies from these kinds of lawsuits. \nI will read the entire article 14(b):\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in the present Treaty, the \n     Allied Powers waive all reparations claims of the Allied \n     Power, other claims of the Allied Powers and their nationals \n     arising out of any action taken by Japan and its nationals in \n     the course of the prosecution of the War. . . .\n\n  It says ``except as otherwise provided in the present Treaty.'' Well, \nthe present treaty provides in article 26:\n\n       Should Japan make a peace settlement or war claims \n     settlement with any State granting that State greater \n     advantages than those provided by the present Treaty, those \n     same advantages shall be extended to the parties to the \n     present Treaty.\n\n  What does that mean? It means article 14 says that U.S. citizens, \nsuch as Frank Exline, could not sue Mitsubishi for reparations. But \narticle 26 says if Japan were to conclude a different agreement or \narrangement with another country that is more advantageous to the \nnationals of that country, those same advantages apply to all the \nsignatories of the treaty.\n  Guess what. We didn't know this until the year 2000 when certain \ndocuments were declassified; we did not find out that Japan had \nconcluded a separate treaty with the Netherlands, giving the \nNetherlands' national citizens the right to go to court to seek \nreparations. Under article 26, since the Netherlands got greater \nadvantages than those under article 14, article 26 should be extended \nto those in the present treaty, including the United States.\n  The State Department ignores this. I guess they do not want to upset \nMitsubishi or some of the other large corporations in Japan. They have \ncontinued to intervene in court. The courts have come down on the side \nof the Japanese companies.\n  The amendment Senator Smith and I offered 2 years ago and adopted by \nthe Senate and the House basically said the State Department and the \nDepartment of Justice cannot intervene in these cases anymore. They \ncannot use the taxpayers' money to intervene in these cases. That \namendment was stripped from the conference report, I guess by the \nurging of the State Department.\n  This is why I am upset and stayed at this late hour to talk and why I \nwill talk about it more. I did not know until yesterday that this \nprovision was going to be slipped into the Defense appropriations bill. \nOtherwise, I would have been prepared with amendments of my own, \namendments that this Senate adopted 2 years ago.\n  It is not right. First, it was not right for Japan and these private \ncompanies to use United States POWs as slave laborers. There is a book \nthat describes the torture and what they went through working for \nprivate companies as slave laborers. It is not right they were treated \nthat way.\n  Second, it was not right that the United States concluded a treaty \nthat said you can never seek compensation from these companies. That is \nthe treaty we concluded in 1951. But there was an escape clause that \nsaid if Japan concluded a treaty with another country more advantageous \nto that country, then those same rights would accrue to our \ncitizens. But that was kept under seal from 1951 until the year 2000. \nThen we found out that article 26 applied and that our former POWs, \nused as slave laborers, should have the right to go to court to seek \ncompensation.\n\n  I am not saying they would have gotten it. At least they could have \ngone to court to press their rights, to exercise their rights to seek \ncompensation.\n  What the amendment tonight did is it said now American taxpayers are \ngoing to pay them, American tax payers are now going to pay $10,000 to \neach of these former POWs who are dying every day because of old age \nand infirmities. Why should the American taxpayer pay them?\n  These Japanese companies have a lot of money. A lot of the money they \nhave was made on the backs of slave laborers during World War II, and \nthese companies still exist today. That is why I found the inclusion of \nthis amendment so offensive. It is a slap in the face to these former \nPOWs, these slave laborers, saying: We are going to give you $10,000; \nnow shut up.\n  I understand there was a previous amendment that would have given \n$30,000 or $20,000 to the widows. That was taken away. I understand it \nis only $10,000 now. Not only is that a slap in the face, but it is a \nslap in the face to the U.S. taxpayer, that somehow our taxpayers have \nto pay for what these Japanese companies did during World War II.\n  So this is not the last I will have to say about this. I will seek \nother avenues and other venues, bills coming across the floor of the \nSenate, to make sure our POWs have the right to seek compensation from \nthese private companies. If the Dutch could get it done, if they had \nthe right to do it, then our American citizens ought to have that same \nright under article 26 of the treaty of 1951. So while this amendment \nmay have been adopted, I will seek other avenues, as I said, later on. \nAnd I will ask for record votes on it because Senators voted on it 2 \nyears ago and House Members voted on it 2 years ago overwhelmingly. \nMaybe it is time to express, again, our displeasure at the State \nDepartment for what they have been doing, for interfering with the \nrights of our citizens to seek redress in our courts.\n  With that, again, I put the Senate on notice that this amendment will \nbe coming down the pike whenever I find the first opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tonight the United States Senate accepted \nan amendment that I wrote with the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest\n\n[[Page S9574]]\n\nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, to require accountability and independent oversight \non the ``contracts for reconstruction and other services in Iraq that \nare funded in whole or in part with funds that are made available by \nthe Department of Defense.''\n  This requirement is long overdue.\n  Too much money is moving right now out of public coffers into private \nhands without adequate assurance that those hands have won the \ncontracts fairly. Suffice it to say, the sums of money involved are \nstaggering. The latest issue of Newsweek magazine says:\n       $1 billion a week, and that's the lowside. So much for \n     ``self-sustaining'' reconstruction.\n\n  The head of Iraq's State oil marketing organization thinks ``the \nUnited States is dreaming if it believes it will be able to finance the \nreconstruction with oil money alone.''\n  I was particularly troubled several weeks ago because, in the New \nYork Times magazine, there was a feature length article describing the \nletting of a multibillion-dollar oil field contract to Kellogg, Brown \nand Root. That contract was sole source, meaning that Kellogg, Brown \nwon it without having to compete at all. But now it appears that \nKellogg, Brown and Root actually developed the Army's plan for the oil \nfield restoration effort, and then was awarded the contract to carry \nout the plan, almost automatically.\n  I think it is important to be clear. This process essentially allowed \nan incumbent contractor to identify the criteria for a multibillion-\ndollar contract and virtually ensured that it would be awarded the \ncontract without competition. The inside track doesn't peter out there. \nUnder the auspices of an even larger, incredibly lucrative contract \nwith the Army, Kellogg, Brown seems to have written the Army's so-\ncalled contingency plan for rebuilding Iraq. If the news reports are \ncorrect, then the potential for sole-source custom-crafted contracts is \npractically guaranteed by Kellogg, Brown's agreement.\n  The Department of Defense recently announced that it is going to go \nback and solicit bidding for the oil field contracts. So, in a sense, \nthat ends the original controversy, the original contract that I was so \nconcerned about with Kellogg, Brown and Root. But the American people \ndeserve to know whether, in reletting this contract, the Department of \nDefense has finally acknowledged a problem with the original agreement \nand the contract processes that are being used today. The American \npeople deserve to know whether the Department of Defense, on a regular \nbasis, is letting other contracts to other companies in this fashion. \nThe American people deserve to know whether the Department of Defense \nintends to continue this practice where it has not yet been discovered.\n  If individual contractors are customarily setting the criteria for \nthe work they plan to pursue, it seems to me there are serious \nconflict-of-interest issues that the Department of Defense should be \nworking immediately to root out.\n  When you consider the Kellogg, Brown and Root contracts are so-called \ncost-plus contracts, this arrangement becomes even more unacceptable. \nCost-plus lets companies spend what they think is necessary, and after \nthat they get to tack on a percentage fee to make a profit. The more \ntaxpayer dollars the company spends, the more profit they bring home. \nIn effect, these contracts send out a message that the Treasury is \nopen. If you are wasteful and inefficient, don't sweat it because the \ntaxpayer is just going to pick up the bills.\n  A number of Iraqi reconstruction contracts, not just the Kellogg, \nBrown contract, have been designed in this way. If the Defense \nDepartment is going to spend my constituents' money in this manner \nwithout asking for a competitive bid, my constituents deserve to know \nwhy.\n  I have just been having community, townhall meetings in a number of \nour small, rural communities. I was recently in Gold Beach, OR, at a \ntownhall meeting. Folks there were talking about the difficulty they \nface getting money for dredging, which is critically important. It is \nthe lifeblood of these small, rural communities on the Oregon coast. \nThey have to battle for every dime in order to get the funds for \ndredging. I can tell you my constituents in Gold Beach, Coos Bay, \nPendleton, and Portland--across the State of Oregon--are saying there \nis no place for waste. With respect to these Iraqi reconstruction \ncontracts and various other contracts with Iraq, they want to make sure \nthat not only is there no waste, but there should not be any \npossibility for impropriety.\n  I understand that in some cases, there may be valid reasons for the \nawarding of contracts that seem suspect to the untrained eye. One \nexplanation I have heard repeatedly is the need to award some contracts \nquickly. Another is the need for security clearances. But I cannot \nimagine that the need to move quickly is a valid justification for \nignoring experience as a criterion, nor does a security clearance seem \nnecessary for rebuilding a sewer system.\n  As a Member of the Intelligence Committee, I had thought these \narguments were pretty shaky before. I said then, and I will repeat it \ntonight. I believe the Department of Defense and other agencies \ninvolved in reconstruction would have a more open process and greater \ncredibility if they knew they had to face the public on these important \nissues.\n  The fact is: The Pentagon has kept the American taxpayer in the dark. \nThe American people at present do not know how the select group of \ncontractors was chosen, how much the reconstruction of Iraq will cost \nor how long it will take.\n  Tonight, with the adoption of the legislation authored with Senator \nByrd, we are going to be in a position to finally get on top of those \nissues.\n  I want to express my appreciation to a number of the Senators on the \nAppropriations Committee, particularly Senator Stevens, the \ndistinguished chairman of the full committee, and Senator Byrd, the \nranking member of the Defense Appropriations Committee, and the \ndistinguished subcommittee chair of that committee, for working closely \nwith me and my colleagues on this legislation.\n  Recently, the New York Times reported the current supply of about $7 \nbillion for rebuilding Iraq includes $1.7 billion for Iraqi assets \nfrozen in U.S. banks, $900 million found hiding in Iraq, and about $1.6 \nbillion from Iraqi oil sold before the war. The United Nations is \nholding about $1 billion for development, and Congress has already \nappropriated $2.4 billion for reconstruction contracts. The occupation \nadministrator is reportedly seeking about $6 billion for the remainder \nof this year, and ``the amount for 2004 will be considerably higher.'' \nIndependent sources familiar with Iraq have put the price tag at \nupwards of $100 billion.\n\n  The Pentagon just last week informed Congress that the monthly cost \nof military operations is really twice what they predicted in April, or \nnearly $4 billion. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld called this a ``burn \nrate'' of $1 billion a week. My question then becomes, Will the \nadministration have to effect a similar doubling of the projected \nreconstruction costs? What sort of a ``burn rate'' can the American \npeople expect on the reconstruction side of the ledger?\n  We have seen the costs go up and up with respect to military \noperations. Suffice it to say, I think there is every reason to believe \nthat will be the case with respect to reconstruction contracts as well.\n  What Senator Byrd and I have said--and we are very pleased the Senate \non a bipartisan basis has accepted our amendment--is it is time for \nsome accountability, and it is time for real and independent oversight \nwith respect to these contracts.\n  What is needed are clear processes and standards for designing and \nawarding contracts. What is needed are clear criteria for justifying \nsole-source contracts. What is needed are mechanisms to provide \nindependent oversight over contractors. What is needed are policies to \nprevent conflicts of interest. What is needed are policies to prevent \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. What is needed are ways to assure the \npercentage of profits is determined for cost-fixed-fee contracts in a \nway that protects our taxpayers. Finally, what is needed is a list of \nall contracts for reconstruction and other services in Iraq and their \noverall expected costs and duration.\n  This week the civil administrator Paul Bremer said that just over the \nnext 6 months Iraqi oil revenues will be $2 billion short of what will \nbe needed to finance occupation and reconstruction. He admitted that \nreconstruction\n\n[[Page S9575]]\n\nof Iraq is ``not going to be self-financing.'' Newsweek magazine called \nthese numbers ``misleading.''\n  What this means, in plain English, is that U.S. taxpayers are going \nto get stuck funding the difference for a number of months and for the \nforeseeable future.\n  We believe the pattern of secretive and closed bidding for these \nconstruction contracts is unacceptable. It seems to me the American \npeople have a right to hear if there are reasons for sole-source and \ninvitation-only contracts for these projects. If something is amiss in \nthe Iraqi reconstruction contracting process, then the oversight and \nthe accountability--as Senator Byrd and I have called for in the \nlegislation accepted tonight--is going to bring that to light. It is \nhigh time Congress and the American people arrive at fair judgments \nabout these difficult issues with respect to funding the reconstruction \nof Iraq. The American people deserve real accountability at a time when \nwe need the money here at home for our schools, for our health care \nfacilities, for our roads, and for the critical needs of strengthening \nour economy.\n  I think it is a significant step the Senate has taken. It assures \nthis will now be an effort to establish true oversight and \naccountability over the billions of dollars that are being spent now \nand that will be spent with respect to reconstructing Iraq and other \nservices in that country.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for his patience and assistance in this \nlegislation.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to Chairman Stevens for helping us \nto draft this in a way that will win bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, we have had a full week, a complete week, \nthough it is Thursday evening, and almost 9 o'clock. We will not be in \nsession tomorrow, and we will not have votes on Monday but will proceed \nto the Homeland Security bill Monday during the day and, hopefully, \nmake progress.\n  As we look over the course of the week, it has been a full and \ncomplete week, with a number of amendments and a lot of debate, a lot \nof issues. I congratulate members from the Appropriations Committee, \nthe leaders on both sides of the aisle for their leadership, in \nbringing us to the point that we have now passed three of the \nappropriations bills.\n  We will have a busy week next week. We will proceed as far as we can \nin addressing, hopefully, a number of appropriations bills next week. \nAnd then, that following week, which will be the last week we are in \nsession, we will address Energy and, hopefully, complete the Energy \nbill, which is my intention, before the August recess.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished majority leader will \nyield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I know he has a lot more work to do tonight. I want to say, \nbriefly, before he completes his statement on Prime Minister Blair, and \nother things, in the National Journal's Congress Daily today, it was \nbrought to my attention that, among other things, it says--and if it is \nhere I am sure it is true; we know all things written are true that the \npress puts out--\n  GOP staffers continue to meet in an effort to flesh out a reworking \nof the bill's electricity provisions. A new proposal expected to be \nreleased some-time next week.\n\n  The only reason I bring this to the leader's attention this evening \nis that the bill, as it is, is very difficult. We know there are \nproblems with the electricity section. On both sides of the aisle, \npeople are concerned about it.\n  If there is going to be a new electricity section in this bill, we \nhave to have it next week because there is tremendous concern, \nespecially by the Senators from Washington. And as we discussed \nyesterday, there are more than 300 amendments on this matter.\n  The two leaders are sponsors of one of the main amendments in the \nbill, and I know the two leaders want to get this bill finished. But \nhaving said the two leaders want to finish the bill, we still have 98 \nother Senators to worry about.\n  I would hope there is some realization of the great difficulty of \nfinishing this bill, especially if there is a new section to be written \nabout electricity. If it is a section that everybody signs off on, that \nwould alleviate a tremendously large problem with this bill.\n  So I just want to say, we have 2 more weeks to go. I think this week, \neven though I am sure there is some disappointment in the leader in not \nbeing able to complete more appropriations bills, we did a monumental \ntask of finishing this bill in the time we did. I think the debate was \ngood. There were no nonrelevant amendments. No points of order had to \nbe raised. So I think we have done good work. But I do not want, by the \nmere fact that we keep talking about the Energy bill, for anyone to \nthink it is going to be a simple issue to get that completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from the \nassistant Democratic leader and understand that the task before us is a \nlarge one. One of the advantages we have is that we began to address \nthe Energy bill on May 6 of this year. We have spent 12 days on the \nfloor debating the bill. We made good progress on the Energy bill, and \nby saying we would spend a week, or the last week of this month, \nfocused entirely on that bill, we have given all of our colleagues the \nopportunity to work--both members on the committee and our colleagues \nnot on the committee--the opportunity to develop amendments, to discuss \nthose amendments, to work in a bipartisan way across the aisle to come \nto agreement--and not necessarily consensus but agreement--in lots of \ndifferent areas.\n  One of the good things about, at least 6 weeks ago, saying and making \nvery clear to our colleagues we are going to spend the last week on it \nis that it has given us the opportunity to work together and to look at \nthe various potential amendments as well as the underlying bill.\n  It is a huge challenge, I recognize, but one I personally look \nforward to working with the leadership on the other side of the aisle \nto accomplish as we go forward.\n  Mr. President, tonight we passed the Defense appropriations bill. I \nam very pleased with the progress today. Now we have passed three of \nthe 13 appropriations bills for the new fiscal year that begins in just \nunder 3 months.\n  In many ways, it is ironic because at the beginning of this year we \nhad 11 appropriations bills we had to pass, and now we have passed \nthree; so indeed we have passed 14 appropriations bills this year, \nwhich is remarkable. But, in truth, we have three appropriations bills \nof the 13 for the new fiscal year that we have passed. And now, well \nover an hour ago, that third one being passed is a benchmark in many \nways. I am hopeful that over the course of the next week we will pass \nas many as three more appropriations bills. I am confident we will be \nable to pass two. I would like to be able to pass three, which would \nmean six appropriations bills passed before the August recess.\n\n[[Page S9576]]\n\n  On Monday, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we will begin debate--\nfor the first time, I might add, in this Chamber--on a brand new \nappropriations bill; and that is the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill. A lot of my colleagues have not thought about it in those terms, \nbut because of our response and reorganization--our response to, in \nsome part, 9/11, but our reorganization of the Homeland Security \nDepartment--we now have a Homeland Security appropriations bill, and we \nwill be addressing that beginning Monday.\n  And, yes, each time I either open or close the Senate it seems people \nsay it is a challenging schedule. It is a challenging schedule. Indeed, \nto complete all the appropriations bills, and to send them to the \nPresident before the beginning of the new fiscal year, will be a real \nchallenge. But it is our responsibility to do so.\n  As the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee reminds us on a regular basis, one of our most basic \nresponsibilities of the Congress under article I of the Constitution is \nthat ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of \nAppropriations made by Law.''\n  Thus, we take this fundamental responsibility seriously. And thus the \ndiscipline and the focus, the patience, the collegiality, the \ncooperation must all be reflected in order to accomplish that task.\n  There is reason to be optimistic that for the first time in almost a \ndecade we can complete action on all of the 13 appropriations bills and \nhave them signed into law before the new fiscal year begins October 1. \nAgain, when we accomplish that--if we accomplish it--but when we \naccomplish that, it will be for the first time in almost a decade.\n  That optimism stems from a number of facts: first, from the fact that \nhaving adopted a budget resolution earlier this year, we now at least \nbegin this appropriations process with a defined top-line spending \nlevel for all the appropriations bills next year, that top line being \n$784.6 billion.\n\n  That optimism is also a result of the hard work of the chairman of \nthe committee and the ranking member of that committee, as well as \nothers, to establish very early a general understanding with the \nadministration how the President's priorities and the congressional \npriorities will be considered.\n  That optimism that we can accomplish completion by the end of the \nfiscal year also stems from the fact that of the 13 appropriations \nbills, the Senate and House's initial allocations are identical for 7 \nof the bills, and these 7 bills, with identical allocations, represent \nthree-quarters of all the appropriations for next year.\n  A lot of this is made possible by a very close working relationship \nwith the House of Representatives. Speaking of the House, I am \noptimistic that before they recess in about a week or 7 days from today \nor possibly tomorrow, they will have completed 11 of the 13 bills. That \nwill have been a major accomplishment and one that will expedite going \nto conference quickly to resolve any differences with the Senate bills \nin September.\n  Finally, that optimism is further strengthened by the fact that \nbecause we have a budget in place this year, because we passed a budget \nand we have a budget in place right now, we also have the tools to \nenforce the spending levels that are assumed in that budget.\n  Over this week we have made much progress on the appropriations \nprocess. We have begun the process in earnest. We have achieved a good \nfirst step. Even with this optimism, I know it will not be easy. After \nthe August recess, we will need to complete action on the remaining \nbills in the Senate and then conference those with the House.\n  We also recognize that in discussion of these appropriations bills, \nthere are many demands--we saw a number of them play out today--in the \nbills that come before us. We will see many very good programs, many \nvery worthy programs that require funding. But we will also see \nprograms--and will be talking about that on the floor--that were simply \ncreated at a different time in our history. Or we will be talking about \nprograms that simply were created but have not met their goals, \nprograms where continued funding is simply not the most effective use \nof taxpayer dollars.\n  As we saw the deficit figures come out over the course of the last \nweek, again and again we said, there are certain things that can be \ndone. It is to grow the economy. It is to reap the benefits of the jobs \nand growth package that we passed on the Senate floor with those \nmidterm and long-term effects of growing the economy, creating jobs. \nThirdly, there is the fiscal discipline that does demand tough choices, \nthat does demand tough decisions.\n  We are committed in this body to slowing rates of Government \nspending, and indeed, if you exclude the spending in the war \nsupplemental last spring, the appropriations for next year will \nrepresent less than a 3-percent increase over the current year.\n  Spending will be tight. Many worthy programs and initiatives may not \nsee the increases they have enjoyed in many recent years. Recent years' \nappropriations have grown at an annual rate of over 7 percent. That \nsimply cannot be tolerated. It is unacceptable today, growing at 7 \npercent. That is faster than the economy. That is faster than families' \npaychecks. We simply will not do that. We cannot do that. We need to \nengage that fiscal discipline.\n  Again, if you take out that war supplemental from last spring, the \nappropriations for next year will be less than a 3-percent increase \nover the current year. It is that type of fiscal discipline that we \nwill demonstrate.\n  I do know we can live within our budget that we adopted earlier this \nyear. I look forward to working with the Democratic leader and the \nleadership of the Appropriations Committee to fulfill our \nresponsibility under the Constitution to enact appropriations bills and \nto do so in an orderly and timely manner.\n  Our work this week demonstrates that disciplined, orderly manner \nagain in a timely way. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation, for \ntheir patience as we, under the leadership of Chairman Stevens, proceed \nin this disciplined manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9576-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9576-S9578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we in the Senate today had the experience \nof participating in the joint meeting in the House Chamber listening to \nPrime Minister Tony Blair. I opened the Senate this morning pointing \nout that we would be welcoming and honoring our distinguished visitor \nin this joint meeting. I mentioned that he is the fourth sitting Prime \nMinister to address a joint session of the Congress, preceded only by \nWinston Churchill, Clement Atlee, and Margaret Thatcher, three of \nhistories great leaders.\n  Today's historic tribute gave us the opportunity to reaffirm our \nabiding friendship and our deep respect both for the man, Prime \nMinister Tony Blair, as well as the people of the United Kingdom. Our \ntwo nations have stood shoulder to shoulder to defend the free people \naround the world.\n  We had the opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister before the \naddress. We were able to directly express our appreciation to the Prime \nMinister and for him to reflect to the people of Britain for their \ncourage and their resolve.\n  As you sat in the majestic House Chamber and listened to those words, \nI think we were all affected very directly because it helped elevate \nthe debate which seemed to have mired down in part of the way it has \nbeen handled by the media but also the way it has been handled by a \nnumber of our colleagues both in this Chamber and in the other Chamber.\n  The words from Tony Blair really did elevate it. There is just one \npassage I want to quote from what the Prime Minister said today in the \nChamber:\n\n       And I know it's hard on America, and in some small corner \n     of this vast country, out in Nevada or Idaho or these places \n     I've never been to, but always wanted to go. I know out there \n     there's a guy getting on with his life, perfectly happily, \n     minding his own business, saying to you, the political \n     leaders of this country, ``Why me? And why us? And why \n     America?''\n       And the only answer is, ``Because destiny put you in this \n     place in history, in this moment in time, and the task is \n     yours to do.''\n\n  The Prime Minister continued:\n\n       And our job, my nation that watched you grow, that you \n     fought alongside and now fights alongside you, that takes \n     enormous pride in our alliance and great affection in our \n     common bond, our job is to be there with you.\n       You are not going to be alone. We will be there with you in \n     this fight for liberty. We\n\n[[Page S9577]]\n\n     will be with you in this fight for liberty. And if our spirit \n     is right and our courage firm, the world will be with us.\n\n  I mention this passage because, as we sat there for that 30 minutes \nor so, this passage where he mentions that ``destiny put you in this \nplace in history'' is one that just struck a chord.\n  I contrast that with the debate that has seemed to play out in the \nmedia over the last week in regard to the quality and integrity of the \ncase made by President Bush for the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime.\n  I have to say, as I have heard people comment on the case that has \nbeen made for this war, I have been increasingly disturbed. In part it \nis because of the sound of shaking confidence by people who intend to \nshake the confidence, or who want to instill or inject into the \nAmerican people self-doubt about America's mission in Iraq.\n  But when you stepped back and listened to the Prime Minister today, \nall of a sudden you realized that a bloody tyrant no longer rules in \nIraq. It made you realize that a man who, without regret, murdered \nmembers of his own family, as well as tens of thousands of his own \ncitizens, has now been removed from power. The perpetrator of one of \nthe past century's most gruesome crimes against humanity--the use of \nchemical weapons on thousands of innocent Kurds--no longer is free to \npursue such weapons. The aggressor in the gulf war who, a decade ago, \ninvaded his neighbor, only to be driven out by a mighty coalition, no \nlonger threatens the volatile region of the Middle East.\n  Now all of this second-guessing is perplexing to me. If you look over \nthe last week, we have had things mentioned like Watergate, which was \nreferenced by candidates eager for the next election. You hear \ncandidates using words like ``impeachment'' being laid upon the table. \nWe have seen, over the last week, special e-mails going out from party \nheadquarters, saying: More money needed to fan the flames of \ncontroversy.\n  Indeed, we know all these campaigns have begun, and there are many \npeople who seem to be eager to topple the leader. I mention all that \nbecause of the contrast in what we heard today from Tony Blair, who \nelevated the facts and the greater cause of liberty, in contrast so \nmuch to what our media and the candidates have focused on. This whiff \nof politics is in the air.\n  What bothers me about it is that there is a cost if we get in and \nplay a game of politics at this juncture in history. As I listened to \nthe Prime Minister today, I thought, what does this do to the \nreputation of our country, to the position of our President? Prime \nMinister Tony Blair helped put that into perspective today.\n  Indeed, the record is replete with the case against Saddam Hussein, \nsuch as the mass graves. Our colleagues who have just come back from \nIraq so vividly described standing at these mass graves the size of \nfootball fields--thousands of graves exposed. And really only now are \nthe thousands of widows and mothers and orphans--all victims, also--\nable to openly grieve. Who will ever forget the pictures we have seen \nof those desperate citizens of Baghdad, actually clawing at the ground \nin a vain search for these hidden prisons that might hold their loved \nones. You see these images of mass graves.\n  Our colleagues have come back--and we have had two delegations over \nthere, and another one will be going shortly--with descriptions of the \nunmistakable mark which these mass graves represent of history's \ntyrants, the legacy of this regime, and the shame of anyone among us \nwho would have tolerated it for one day longer than we knew it to be a \nfact.\n  As I listen to some of the candidates and colleagues and critics, it \nleads me to ask: Are we deaf in some way to the plight of the Iraqi \npeople based on the facts that we know? Is the suffering of the Iraqi \npeople--when we think about those graves or about the thousands of \nKurdish individuals upon whom Saddam Hussein inflicted chemical weapons \nof mass destruction--it makes you ask is our moral purpose as a Nation \nso diminished that we do not see the justice of our own cause, that \nlarger purpose, that sense of liberty and fighting for liberty that \nPrime Minister Tony Blair talked about today?\n\n  We heard in this body all of the evidence on Iraq before the war. We \nhad the opportunity, through open hearings, closed hearings, classified \ninformation. I clearly was convinced. I had the opportunity to sit in \nmy office, which is just probably 200 steps from where I am speaking \nnow, and listen to about 12 Kurdish physicians who came to visit the \nUnited States. They came to see me because I am a physician. They \nsimply laid it out to me that they took care of thousands of people--\nthese are the physicians who took care of thousands of people who were \npoisoned with chemical weapons from Saddam Hussein--thousands of \npeople, not 10 or 15, but thousands. They talked about the peeling of \nskin. They talked about the suffocation. They talked about people dying \nbefore their eyes.\n  They also told me they are still taking care of those people who \nsurvived, although we know scores of thousands of people died from \nthese chemical weapons imposed or inflicted upon them by Saddam \nHussein; but, indeed, these doctors I talked to in my office months ago \nare still treating some of the victims from that atrocity. Yet, at the \nsame time, we have heard discussions this past week with some \nquestioning whether this tyrant was capable of possessing and using \nsuch weapons again.\n  There seems to be a disconnect over much of the discussion of the \nlast week. This week people said: After all, he declared himself free \nof these weapons.\n  But as we all know, he denied again and again--and it was part of the \nresolution--those inspectors the opportunity to prove him wrong. So I \nam perplexed and bewildered by those who would accept the word of an \ninhumane, callous, mass murderer at this point in time, and whose word \nthey seem to even be holding higher than that of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  It is a travesty to me. It is nonsense, and it really comes back to \nthat basic question: Is there anybody in this Chamber who would \nhonestly dispute that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass \ndestruction; that he used weapons of mass destruction; and that he \nnever abandoned that course? I really don't think so.\n  We can take it a step further. Is there anybody in this Chamber who \nbelieves that we would have been all, in some way, better off with \nSaddam Hussein still in power? The answer is clear. Indeed, 9 months \nago, 77 Members of this Chamber voted to authorize the President to use \nforce in Iraq. In that resolution, we enumerated very clearly the many \nreasons.\n  First, the Senate found--this was 9 months ago--that Saddam Hussein \nwas developing, did possess, and had used weapons of mass destruction. \nThat is No. 1.\n  No. 2, 9 months ago, based on the information that was available to \nus and the briefings that we had, the Senate found that Iraq invaded \nKuwait in 1990. And after being driven back by an international \ncoalition, Saddam Hussein unequivocally agreed to eliminate all weapons \nof mass destruction and to prove so to the world community.\n  No. 3, the Senate found that Saddam, in fact, used denial, used \ndeception, and used harassment to thwart efforts by international \ninspectors to prove compliance with those terms.\n  Fourth, the Senate reiterated its finding from 1998 legislation that \nSaddam Hussein had a continuing program to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction in material breach of his terms of surrender in the gulf \nwar.\n  Finally, and fifth, the Senate listed the myriad of United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions reaching the same conclusions that the \nSenate had reached.\n  I wish to stress once again, because it is important to understand, \nthis was 9 months ago, and 77 Members of this Chamber voted with this \nunderstanding. All of these findings were made on thorough intelligence \nbriefings. They were considered judgments by Members of this body, all \nseparate from any report about a uranium purchase from Africa, which \nhas tended to be the focus of people over the last week.\n  On October 9, 1998, 2 years before the current President was elected, \nSenators then wrote to President Bill Clinton demanding military action \nagainst Saddam Hussein. This is 1998. They wrote:\n\n       We urge you to take necessary actions (including if, \n     appropriate, air and missile strikes) to respond effectively \n     to the threat\n\n[[Page S9578]]\n\n     posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass \n     destruction programs.\n\n  This was followed by a December 17, 1998, letter calling for the use \nof military force again by then-President Clinton ``to compel \ncompliance or to destroy to the best of our ability Iraq's capability \nto build and deliver weapons of mass destruction and threaten its \nneighbors.''\n  What is incredible to me now is that some of those very same people \nwho signed those letters now are questioning whether an honest case was \nmade by President Bush that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. The \nvery same people signed those letters. So I am moved to ask, What \nreversed the conclusion that they had so confidently reached 5 years \nago? Was it in some way a change of facts or was it a change just in \nthe Presidency?\n  Yes, my implication is what we have seen over the last week is a \nmatter of politics, and I think, again, of the Prime Minister's visit \ntoday and his message of what this war has meant to free people, yes, \nin Iraq, but around the world. All of this is a serious matter. It \ndemands our attention. I say that because as I speak, we all know that \nAmerican soldiers, British soldiers, coalition soldiers stand in harm's \nway. We all sort of stand in fear of turning on the television at \nnight, in the morning, or reading in the paper once again of tragic \ncasualties.\n  All of that speaks to me that we must redouble our efforts against \nthe small but determined enemy to stabilize Iraq. A democratic and \nprosperous Iraq, just as the Prime Minister said today, will not only \nchange the Middle East, it will change the world for the better. It is \na worthy cause of our Nation and one that we simply will not--will \nnot--permit to fail.\n  Mr. President, I will, in the interest of time, probably have more to \nsay about this next week. This is the nature of the debate. Again, I \nexpress my appreciation on behalf of the Senate to the Prime Minister \nfor joining us today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9578-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9578-S9580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the day before yesterday we saw an \nannouncement of the biggest deficits in the history of the country this \nafter the President told us just 2 years ago that we did not need to \nworry about future deficits; in fact, there were going to be massive \nsurpluses. He said in a speech on March 27, 2001, when he was \ncampaigning for a massive tax cut:\n\n       Tax relief is central to my plan to encourage economic \n     growth, and we can proceed with tax relief without fear of \n     budget deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  This is what the President told the country. It has proved to be \ntotally wrong. These are now the biggest deficits we have ever had in \nthe history of the country, $455 billion, and that understates how big \nthese deficits really are. Just using that number, which the \nadministration has put out, is by far the biggest deficit we have ever \nhad. The previous record was $290 billion. So this is a very large \ndeficit by any measurement.\n  The President then told us the next year, after it became clear that \nhis earlier statements were not correct, that:\n\n       . . . our budget will run a deficit that will be small and \n     short-term . . .\n\n  Well, that has proved to be wrong again. These deficits are not \nsmall, and they are not short term. In fact, these deficits are of \nrecord size and we see no end to them. By the administration's own \nanalysis now, we see no end to these deficits.\n  This chart shows the portrayal of deficits over the last 30 years, \nand one can see that the deficit this year is the biggest of all time. \nLook at the trajectory, which is truly stunning. We have gone from \nsurpluses that we ran for a 3- or 4-year period to this extraordinary \nrise of the deficit. Still the administration is trying to downplay its \nsignificance.\n  Earlier this year, the then-OMB Director said:\n\n       I think . . . that at today's levels of 2 to 3 percent of \n     GDP--\n\n  Or gross domestic product--\n\n       these are modest and manageable deficits.\n\n  The current OMB Director has continued with that same theme. He said \nin June:\n\n       Our current deficit, as measured as a percentage of gross \n     domestic product, is not large by historical standards and is \n     manageable within the overall context of our economy. Let's \nexamine the claim that these are modest deficits as a percentage of our \ngross domestic product.\n\n  This chart looks at the record of deficits as a percentage of our \ngross domestic product. This is what it shows. If one takes out Social \nSecurity--which one should because it should not be included in the \ncalculations of the operating expenses of the Federal Government--what \none sees is, as a percentage of the gross domestic product, this is the \nsecond largest deficit in 57 years.\n  I was reading the Washington Post this morning. The writer of that \nstory said the White House makes a good point that the deficit is 4.2 \npercent of the gross domestic product and we have had deficits that \nlarge before.\n  What that neglects to take into account is the fact in 1983 there \nwere no Social Security funds to raid. This year, the administration is \nnot only running a $455 billion deficit but on top of that they are \ntaking $154 billion of Social Security money. So on an operating \ndeficit basis the deficit is over $600 billion; that is 5.7 percent of \ngross domestic product. There were no Social Security funds back in \n1983. There were no surplus funds to take. In a fair comparison, this \nis the second biggest deficit on a gross domestic product basis in 57 \nyears.\n  Previously, the President has acknowledged the importance of paying \ndown the debt, of not running deficits. In fact, in 2001 he said:\n\n       . . . my budget pays down a record amount of national debt. \n     We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. \n     That will be the largest debt reduction of any country, ever. \n     Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money that \n     we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to our \n     children and grandchildren.\n\n  Madam President, now we can check the record, words versus reality. \nThe President said he was going to pay down the debt so there would be \nalmost nothing left by 2008. Now we see, with this latest report from \nthe President's own administration, instead of almost no publicly held \ndebt by 2008, we will have $5.5 trillion of debt. When is this \nadministration going to admit its plan is not working? How much more \nevidence will they have to have before they acknowledge this whole plan \nis an absolute, abject failure? This President has told us repeatedly \nthere weren't going to be any deficits. Then when it became clear there \nare, he said they were going to be small. Now that it is obviously \napparent these deficits are massive and large, they say, don't worry, \nwe are going to reduce them in the future.\n  None of it is true. These deficits are massive. They are long \nlasting. And we have not seen anything yet.\n  This is a chart that shows what has happened to revenue as a \npercentage of gross domestic product. What this shows is that revenue \nthis year, according to the administration's own projections, is going \nto be the lowest since 1959. We have a revenue problem and the \nPresident's answer is, cut the revenue some more. Let me repeat that: \nWe are going to have the lowest revenue as a share of gross domestic \nproduct since 1959 and the President's answer is, cut the revenue some \nmore, not cut the spending to match the reduced revenues. He is \nadvocating increasing spending. But cut the revenue some more, make \nthese deficits even bigger, does that make any sense to people \nlistening? It makes no sense to me.\n  We look at the 2003 transformation from the administration telling us \nthere would be surpluses to now record deficits; 77 percent of the \nreversal is on the revenue side of the equation; 23 percent is \nspending.\n\n  Friends, we have a revenue problem. We also have a spending problem. \nBut the revenue problem dwarfs the spending side of the equation.\n  When we look at the spending side of the equation, this is what we \nsee in terms of the increases in discretionary spending that have \noccurred over the last 3 years. Where has the money gone? In 2001, \nninety-five percent of the increase went to defense, homeland security, \nand response to September 11. In fact, the lion's share, the green bar \non the chart, is defense: 73 percent of the increase in spending that \nhas occurred is because of defense; 15 percent is homeland security; 7 \npercent is New York City reconstruction and airline relief as a result \nof the attack of September 11.\n\n[[Page S9579]]\n\n  If we look at 2002, we see the same thing: 55 percent of the increase \nis defense; 17 percent is homeland security; 21 percent is for \nrebuilding New York and airline relief and international funding for \nAfghanistan and Iraq. So 93 percent of the increase in discretionary \nspending for 2002 is defense, homeland security, rebuilding New York, \nairline relief, and, of course, international aid because of the \nefforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In 2003, it is exactly the same thing. The increase in spending, \nwhere is it? Defense, 76 percent; 11 percent, homeland security; 7 \npercent, aid to New York and airline relief and the international \ninitiatives.\n  The administration says the whole problem is the attack on the \ncountry with these burgeoning deficits and the economic slowdown. They \nhave left out the biggest factor of all. The biggest factor of all is \ntheir tax cuts. The biggest chunk, 36 percent of the reversals from \nsurpluses to deficits over this budget period, is from the tax cuts \nimplemented and proposed by the President; 27 percent is lower revenue \nnot associated with the tax cuts; 28 percent is spending. As I have \nindicated, only 9 percent is the economic downturn.\n  All of this is happening at the worst possible time because right now \nthe trust funds of Social Security and Medicare are producing large \nsurpluses. But we all know those days will not last. We all know there \nis something coming called the baby boom generation; they will retire \nand the trust funds that are throwing off hundreds of billions of \ndollars of surpluses will turn to cash deficits. They will turn cash \nnegative. When that occurs, we can see what will happen to the finances \nof the Federal Government.\n  Perhaps most startling about this chart is the President's tax cuts, \nexplode in cost at the very time the cost to the Government explodes \nbecause of the retirement of the baby boom generation. So the deficits \nbeing run now, which are record deficits, are going to be thought of as \nthe good times because this is the sweet spot in the budget cycle. This \nis when things are, in fact, manageable for the moment. Why? Because \nthe trust funds are throwing off hundreds of billions of dollars of \nsurpluses.\n  This chart is not mine. This chart is from the President's own budget \nproposal, from page 43 of his Analytical Perspectives. This is the \nPresident telling the Nation what he thinks will happen if his tax plan \nand his spending plans are adopted.\n  This is what it shows. This is the period we are in now. Remember, \nthese are record deficits now, the biggest we have ever had; even on a \nGDP basis, the second biggest in 57 years. But they are nothing \ncompared to what we are headed for.\n  Is anybody paying attention? I commend the news media for recognizing \nthat the deficit this year is a record and next year is going to be \neven bigger. But they are missing the big story. The big story is where \nthis is all headed. Not according to me, this is according to the \nPresident himself. There is no end to the deficits, and they absolutely \nexplode when we get to the time the baby boom generation is retiring \nand the costs of the President's tax proposals are fully phased in.\n  These are deficits, not in dollar terms but as a percentage of GDP. \nThe President's people say they want to have their budgets evaluated on \nthat basis. This is an evaluation on that basis. What it shows is that \nwe never escape from deficits and that the deficits absolutely explode \nif the President's policies are adopted--not any additional spending by \nCongress, this is his spending plan, his tax plan. It is an unmitigated \ndisaster for this country.\n  If we had deficits of this magnitude today, instead of announcing a \n$455 billion deficit, the deficit for this year would be $1.2 trillion. \nThat is where this is all headed. That is the dirty little secret of \nwhat is going on here in Washington. This President is digging a hole \nthat is deep, deep, deep, and it is filled with red ink. It is not \ngoing to work. It is going to lead us to a future Congress and a future \nPresident who are going to have to make really stark decisions, \ndraconian decisions. Because if this plan is adhered to, a future \nCongress and a future President will have to shred Medicare, shred \nSocial Security, and most of the rest of the Federal Government as we \nknow it. Maybe that is the intention of some. Maybe that is what they \nwant to do. I am beginning to suspect it must be, because they are \nsmart people, they know where all this is headed. This is their own \nanalysis of where it is headed.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve said on July 16, in testimony \nbefore the Senate Banking Committee:\n\n       There is no question that if you run substantial and \n     excessive deficits over time, you are draining savings from \n     the private sector, and other things equal, you do clearly \n     undercut the growth rate of the economy. That is one of the \n     reasons I have argued for years about getting the deficit \n     down. So I have no question that if we do not come to grips \n     with these deficits issues, it will make it more difficult \n     for us to maintain the type of growth rates which . . . will \n     bring total employment up and bring the unemployment rate \n     down.\n\n  Is anybody listening? Is anybody paying attention? Does anybody care \nabout the economic future of this country, the economic strength of the \nNation? Because all of it is being threatened by these policies.\n  The President told us you have to do this because it is going to \nimprove economic growth. He told us 2 years ago, if we adopted his \nplan, economic growth would return and the country would be on a \nstronger course. Let's just check the record.\n  What we see is that this President's record on economic growth is the \nworst of any President in the last 50 years--and not by a little bit, \nbut by a lot. The fact is, this President's economic plan is not \nworking. If we look at the critical question of job creation, what we \nsee is that the Bush economic record shows the worst results since the \nPresidency of Herbert Hoover. This President has been in charge. His \neconomic game plan has been in place for over 2 years--2\\1/2\\ years. It \nis not working. It is failing. It is just as clear as it can be.\n\n  This is the historical record on job creation in the private sector. \nThere has not been a weaker record since Herbert Hoover. In fact, no \nPresident in the last 70 years of the history of this country--no \nPresident has lost private sector jobs over their term in office. Not \none President. This President has. As I have indicated, you have to go \nback to the Presidency of Herbert Hoover to see this kind of economic \nrecord.\n  Let me just end with the New York Times editorial of yesterday \nentitled ``The Deficit Floats Up and Away.'' It says:\n\n       Having done its utmost to choke back the revenue flow into \n     the Treasury, the Bush administration offered a running tab \n     on this year's exploding budget deficit yesterday. To hear \n     the casual patter of White House aides about the deficit, one \n     would think it was pocket change. In fact, the shortfall has \n     ballooned 50 percent in just five months.\n\n  Is anybody paying attention? The shortfall increased, according to \nthe administration's own assessments, by 50 percent in just 5 months.\n  They have been wrong every step of the way. Every single assertion by \nthis administration about the effect of their economic plan and their \nfiscal plan has been wrong, and not wrong by small amounts but by \nmassive amounts.\n  They told us 2 years ago, when they put this plan in place, that we \nwould be having surpluses now, not deficits. Instead, we not only have \ndeficits, we have the biggest deficits in the history of the country \nand next year is going to be worse. That is their own projection, and \nthey have not even counted in the cost of the war in Iraq. Oh, they put \nit in for this year, but nothing for next year.\n  Does anybody seriously believe we are going to be done with the \noperations in Iraq by October 1 of this year? Apparently the \nadministration does because they have not put one dime in their budget \nfor operations in Iraq next year. That is just irresponsible, wildly \nirresponsible.\n  The result is we are going to have deficits that are going to be so \nlarge, they will be unlike anything we have ever seen before. Remember, \nthis is the sweet spot. Because not only are they taking money from the \nMedicare trust fund, they are going to take more than $160 billion from \nthe Social Security trust fund next year. They aren't counting that. \nThey don't want to talk about that.\n  The President said, when he brought his plan forward 2 years ago, he \ncould fully protect Social Security. You know what we see now--he is \nnot protecting it at all.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Westbury, \nNY. On September 19, 2001, a 42-year-old man was charged with a bias \ncrime after assaulting a gas-station attendant. Police reported that \nthe victim was punched in the head by the assailant after he had \nquestioned the attendant about his ethnicity.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9580-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE TEN WORST ``BAD APPLE'' GUN DEALERS IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Brady Campaign to \nPrevent Gun Violence released a report entitled ``The Ten Worst Bad \nApple Gun Dealers in America.'' This report analyzed national crime gun \ntrace data from 1989 through 1996 gathered by the U.S. Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and identified the 10 gun \ndealers who sold the most crime guns and exhibited sales patterns that \nATF considers to be indicative of gun trafficking. According to the \nBrady Campaign, most gun dealers are never associated with illegal \nactivities, but guns sold by these 10 dealers turn up in the wrong \nhands over and over again.\n  According to the report, one dealer in Indianapolis, IN, sold 398 \nguns later used in crimes from 1989 through 1996. These guns were \ninvolved in at least 7 homicides, 12 assaults, and 2 robberies. In \naddition, the Brady campaign found that between October 2001 and \nJanuary 2002, one man used two straw purchasers to buy 25 handguns from \nthis dealer and then resold them on the streets of Chicago. Another \ntrafficker used straw buyers to obtain 12 and 9 guns on two different \noccasions in 2002.\n  Another gun dealer identified in the Brady report, this one in West \nMilwaukee, WI, sold 554 guns later used in crimes. These guns were \ninvolved in at least 27 homicides, 101 assaults, and 9 robberies. From \n1994 to 1996, 1 straw purchaser bought 10 guns from this dealer. \nSeveral of the weapons have been recovered from violent criminals, \nincluding a murderer, a rapist, an armed robber who later raped a woman \nat gunpoint, a man who shot at a police officer, and three juvenile \nshooting suspects.\n  The Brady report highlights the potential damage and abuse that just \n10 bad apple dealers can cause. The Brady report reveals the disregard \nof a few in the gun industry for even basic self-regulation. The Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act that recently passed the House and that has been \nreferred to the Senate Judiciary Committee would shield negligent and \nreckless gun dealers from many legitimate civil lawsuits. Certainly, \nthose in the industry who conduct their business negligently or \nrecklessly should not be shielded from the civil consequences of their \nactions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9580-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9580-S9581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INVESTIGATING PREWAR INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, for almost a week now the Senate has \nbeen debating the appropriations bill for the Department of Defense. \nSeveral amendments have been offered regarding the need to determine \nthe accuracy of our pre-war intelligence and the use of that \nintelligence by the Executive--specifically, a reference in the \nPresident's State of the Union message that has now been acknowledged \nto be erroneous. I want to take a few minutes to comment on some of \nthese continuing questions regarding the accuracy of pre-war \nintelligence which became a part of the public debate soon following \nthe invasion of Iraq. I have worked with Chairman Roberts to find a \nbipartisan approach to reviewing these issues. On June 20 we reached \nagreement on the terms of reference for what was by then an ongoing \ninquiry. I had proposed a broader, more formal approach but after some \ndiscussion agreed to proceed with a structured review and see where the \ninformation led us.\n  The committee has been poring through the volumes of material \nprovided by the intelligence community and interviewing relevant \nofficials, and has held two closed hearings and one briefing.\n  But as this process has moved forward it has become increasing clear \nthat a business as usual, oversight review is not going to be able to \naddress our expanding appreciation of the scope of the problem. Every \nday brings new information, often from the press, which requires us to \nmake sure that we have the right charter and organization for this \ninquiry.\n  Tuesday it was the story, reported in the Washington Post, that a \nfour-star general was sent to Niger last year to inquire about the \nsecurity of Niger's uranium. According to the article, the general said \nthat he came away convinced that Niger's uranium stock was secure. \nObviously, there is much to be learned about this. Why was he sent? \nWhat was his mission? Who was aware of the trip? And what happened to \nthe general's report when he returned?\n  This revelation follows on the heels of a week of accusations, \ndenials, admissions and recriminations among the senior members of the \nadministration's national security team about who was responsible for \nlanguage related to Iraqi uranium purchases appearing in the \nPresident's 2003 State of the Union speech. By week's end, Director \nTenet had stepped forward to accept responsibility. His statement, \nhowever, raised many other questions about how this information was \nhandled by those outside the intelligence community.\n  The credibility of the intelligence related to Iraq and Niger first \ncame to public attention in March when the IAEA determined the \ndocuments supporting the charges to be fraudulent. I immediately asked \nDirector Mueller to have the FBI investigate the counterintelligence \nimplications of this revelation. Subsequently, Senator Roberts joined \nme in asking the Inspectors General at the CIA and State Department to \ninvestigate how this information was handled by the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  These investigations, however, will answer only questions of how we \ncame into possession of these documents and what the intelligence \nagencies did with them. They cannot, because of the reach of these \ninvestigative organizations, deal with the questions that have \ndominated the public debate in recent days. How did information, known \nto be dubious at best, find its way into the President's State of the \nUnion speech? Who is responsible for inserting the information? Were \nreservations properly conveyed to senior officials? If not, why not? If \nso, why were those reservations not heeded?\n  It seems clear that the White House staff played a key role in this \nepisode. Unless we follow the evidence wherever it leads, we will end \nup reporting to the American people only part of the story. And the \nNiger episode is just the first example of what we can expect as we get \nfurther into this process.\n  I am committed to a complete, bipartisan investigation that covers \nthe full spectrum from collection to the analysis and use of prewar \nintelligence about Iraq. I believe that the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee has the authority to conduct that investigation. But it has \nto be willing to use the full authority that the Senate has given it, \nor to ask the Senate if it needs any additional authority.\n  We should bite the bullet and authorize a formal investigation, \nexplicitly state that it will examine the full range of activities \nconcerning prewar intelligence--which includes the use of that \nintelligence--and provide for the\n\n[[Page S9581]]\n\ndirection, organization and resources that will assure a complete and \nprobing examination of all facts.\n  In short, it is now clear that this is not an ordinary oversight \nreview but should be a full-fledged investigative effort, with a clear \ncharter and with sufficient staffing and resources. We must do whatever \nis necessary to get to the bottom of this, and answer the fundamental \nquestions of how intelligence was used to support this war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9581-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ALGERIA EARTHQUAKE RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on May 21st of this year a devastating \nearthquake shook lives in Algeria and across the world. Two thousand \ntwo hundred people were killed, 10,000 were injured, and 200,000 more \nwere left homeless. In response, support from the international \ncommunity has been overwhelming. The United Nations Disaster Assessment \nand Coordination Team estimates that 85 international flights from 27 \ndifferent countries landed in Algiers to assist in the emergency relief \neffort. Officials in Algeria state that more than 30,000 government \nworkers and 10,000 military personnel were involved in relief \nactivities. The United States alone has given over $1.3 million in \nassistance, providing blankets, tents, and medical supplies.\n  Furthermore I am pleased that many businesses from my home state of \nOklahoma are now helping in the reconstruction. They will bring to \nAlgeria the best resources and equipment available to help rebuild the \nfallen cities.

Mr. President, last week I came to the floor to object to \nthe majority leader's attempt to file a discharge petition on four of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees to the Sixth Circuit. I want to \nclarify the basis of my objection because my comment was taken out of \ncontext by the majority leader and Senator McConnell yesterday on the \nSenate floor.\n  I said last week that the four nominees should not be moved out of \nthe committee because they haven't yet had a hearing. That is indeed \none basis for our objection. I am not aware of any judicial nominee who \nhas been voted on without having a hearing--that is just not the way \nthe judicial confirmation process works.\n  But I also said that I was objecting on behalf of Senators Levin and \nStabenow, who have not returned the blue slips on these four nominees \nbecause they believe that President Clinton's nominees to the Sixth \nCircuit were unfairly denied hearings and votes. The Michigan Senators \ndo not wish to proceed with President Bush's nominees until a fair and \njust resolution has been reached.\n  I think this is a valid argument. In the 1990s, the Republicans \nblocked 65 of President Clinton's judicial nominees many by home-State \nSenators who refused to return blue slips. I believe that this blockage \nwas a coordinated attempt by Republicans to stall out the clock so that \na Republican President might have the chance to fill those vacancies \nwith right-wing ideologues after the 2000 election.\n  President Clinton nominated three people to the Sixth Circuit who \nwere never given a hearing or a vote, including two people from \nMichigan. One of President Clinton's Michigan nominees, Helene White, \nwaited 4 years and never received a hearing or vote. The other Michigan \nnominee, Kathleen McCree Lewis, waited 2 years and never received a \nhearing or a vote.\n  Why didn't these two highly qualified women ever receive a hearing or \na vote? Because then-Michigan Senator Spencer Abraham didn't return \ntheir blue slips. Now the Bush White House is trying to reap the \nbenefits of Senator Abraham's delay tactics.\n  The Republicans are ignoring the blue slip process today, but they \nhonored the Blue Slip policy in the 1990s as if it were the gospel. Not \nonce did a Clinton judicial nominee get confirmed if their blue slips \nwere not returned. Here is what the Judiciary Committee Chair, Senator \nHatch, said on the Senate Floor in October 1999:\n\n       After a fair and thorough review in committee and after \n     paying the deference to the President to obtain a vote on the \n     floor, I consider the position of a nominee's home State \n     Senators. These Senators are in a unique position to evaluate \n     whether a nominee instills the confidence in the people of a \n     State necessary to be a successful Federal judge in that \n     State. . . . Thus, there has developed a general custom and \n     practice of my giving weight to the Senators from a nominee's \n     home State. . . . When the President has not adequately \n     consulted with the Senate, it takes longer to gain the \n     consensus necessary to move the nominee. And when both home \n     State Senators of a nominee oppose a nominee on the floor of \n     the Senate, it is almost impossible to vote for the \n     confirmation of that nominee.\n\n  Senator Hatch summed it all up in an interview he gave with NPR in \n1997. He said: ``The policy is that if a Senator returns a negative \nblue slip, that person's gonna be dead.''\n  Now that the shoe is on the other foot, the Republicans have backed \naway from the blue slip policy because they have a higher mission: \npacking the courts with right-wing ideologues.\n  Not since President Roosevelt's Court-packing plan in 1937 has this \ncountry seen a President who has played politics with the courts the \nway President Bush has. Over the past 2 years, he has nominated some of \nthe most ideologically driven people in the Nation to important \njudgeships.\n  They advocate extreme positions that would turn back the clock on \nwomen's rights, gay rights, workers' rights, consumer protection, and \nenvironmental protection.\n  Maybe President Bush has selected these people because he wants to \npacify the far right wing of his party. Or maybe he truly shares their \nextreme beliefs.\n  The bottom line is this: the Republicans are changing the rules for \ntheir own partisan gain. They are violating two longstanding principles \nwith the Michigan nominees: 1. not honoring the blue slip process that \nthey so zealously honored when the shoe was on the other foot, and 2. \nnot honoring the Judiciary Committee confirmation process by attempting \nto confirm these nominees without giving them hearings or a committee \nvote.\n  There is an easy resolution to the problem that the Republicans have \ncreated. As Senator Stabenow said earlier today on the Senate floor, \nshe and Senator Levin have made numerous proposals--including the \ncreation of a bipartisan selection commission like Wisconsin's--to \nselect Michigan's judicial nominees. Unfortunately, the White House has \nrejected these very reasonable proposals.\n  I hope that the Bush White House will reconsider its position and \nwork with the Michigan Senators to ensure justice and fairness for the \npeople of Michigan.\n  In the meantime, it is not appropriate to have hearings on the \nMichigan nominees.\n  One final note: The debate over the Michigan nominees should not \novershadow the fact that the Senate has confirmed the vast majority of \nPresident Bush's nominees. To date, we have confirmed 139 of his \njudicial appointments 134 to Article III courts, and 5 to the Article I \nCourt of Federal Claims. We have held up just two nominees.\n  So the score is 139 to 2.\n  Democrats are accused of being obstructionist, yet we have confirmed \nso many of President Bush's judges that we now have the lowest judicial \nvacancy rate in 13 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9581-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9581-S9582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n\n                          physician referrals\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Section 453 of S. 1, the Prescription Drug and Medicare \nImprovement Act, makes changes to current law regarding physician \nreferrals to hospitals in which they have an ownership or investment \ninterest. I would like to engage in a colloquy with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Mr. Feingold and Mr. Baucus, the Ranking Member of the \nSenate Finance Committee, related to the ``exception'' language \nincluded in the bill.\n  Specifically, I would like to know whether the ``exception'' language \nis\n\n[[Page S9582]]\n\napplicable to The Wisconsin Heart Hospital, a hospital which is \ncurrently under construction in the state of Wisconsin. This facility \nis scheduled to open in January of 2004.\n  My understanding is that this provision will not apply to facilities \nwhich are ``under development'' as of June 12, 2003. The following is a \nsummary of the status of the development of The Wisconsin Heart \nHospital:\n  One, architectural plans for the hospital have been completed.\n  Two, construction of the facility is approximately 55 percent to 60 \npercent complete as of June 12, 2003. This estimate can be supported by \ninvoices for materials, labor and planning, as well as the timeline for \ncompletion dictated by the projected opening date of the hospital. \nFurthermore, more than $13.3 million in construction costs have been \nexpended.\n  Three, all applicable zoning requirements have been satisfied by \nlocal governing authorities and can be supported by documentation. In \naddition, The Wisconsin Heart Hospital has committed $260,000 to \nimprove the fresh water supply to surrounding community, unrelated to \nthe hospital construction.\n  Four, State and local building approval processes are ongoing. The \nfacility is subject to monthly inspections by state and local \nofficials.\n  Five, nearly $20 million in equipment purchases and/or vendor \ncontract commitments can be documented by officials from the facility.\n  Six, medical staff bylaws, policies and procedures have been adopted \nby The Wisconsin Heart Hospital Board.\n  Seven, all equity funding has been received. In excess of $35 million \nin temporary debt financing has been secured for the facility. Of that \n$35 million, approximately $10 million has been borrowed; the remaining \n$25 million will be borrowed prior to the end of 2003. Permanent bond \nfinancing for the facility has already been initiated and is expected \nto be secured by November 2003. This permanent bond financing will be \nused to replace the temporary financing referred to above, as well as \nto provide additional financing for the facility.\n  Based on the information stated above, is it your understanding that \nthe ``exception'' language would apply to The Wisconsin Heart Hospital?\n\n     START OF CORRECTION.  \n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, it was clearly not the intent of the Senate Finance \nCommittee in adopting this amendment to apply the prohibition to \nspecialty hospitals that already exist. Nor was it the intent of the \nCommittee to apply the prohibition to those facilities which, meeting \nspecified criteria, are under construction currently.\n\n     END OF CORRECTION.  \n\n  Mr. KOHL. Additionally, the language of the bill specifically states \nthat in determining whether a hospital is ``under development as of \nJune 12, 2003, the Secretary shall consider whether . . . necessary \napprovals from appropriate state agencies have been received.'' You are \nprobably aware that laws in many states, including Wisconsin, prohibit \nhospitals from receiving a license to operate from relevant state \nagencies until the facility is structurally complete and fully capable \nof operating as a hospital. Would you please clarify the Committee's \nintent with respect to this potential licensure issue for hospitals \nwhich are already under development\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The committee certainly understands that many states will \nnot license a hospital as operational until the facility is \nconstructed. I believe the committee's intent was to ensure that \napprovals with respect to the construction of the hospital (i.e., \nbuilding permits, etc.) have been secured by June 12, 2003. The lack of \na license to operate would certainly not prohibit a hospital, which is \ndeemed to be ``under development,'' from the purpose of the statute.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Furthermore, is it the Senator's understanding that for \nfacilities falling under the ``Exception'' provision, language speaking \nto the number of ``beds'' would relate to the number of beds a facility \ncurrently under development expects to license upon completion? When \nfully operational, The Wisconsin Heart Hospital will operate a maximum \nof 52 inpatient beds. State regulation requires the facility to be open \nand operational before any beds can be licensed.\n\n     START OF CORRECTION.  \n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, again, in adopting the amendment, it was the \nunderstanding of the Senate Finance Committee members that this \nprovision would not apply to facilities which, provided they meet \ncertain criteria, are already under development.\n\n     END OF CORRECTION.  \n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Her commitment to serving Oregonians is \na shining example to us all.\n  Like many in her field, Ms. Kane has gone above and beyond the call \nof duty to help patients in need. In addition to healing broken bodies, \nshe has also worked to support the spirits of those in pain. Over the \npast two years, Ms. Kane has sewn over 6,000 multi-colored pillows to \nhelp comfort patients at the Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in \nCorvallis.\n  However, Ms. Kane's benevolence is not limited to Oregonians; she \nrecently offered boxes of pillows to soldiers wounded in Operation \nIraqi Freedom. Her gift to our country's soldiers is one of \nimmeasurable value. By offering her time and talent to this cause, Ms. \nKane has helped remind American soldiers abroad that their sacrifices \nare not being forgotten at home.\n  Despite the hardships currently facing the nursing profession, Ms. \nKane has not failed in her drive to serve those in need. All states are \nexperiencing an increasing shortage of health care workers, and \nparticularly, of nurses. Last year, the Senate passed the Nurse \nReinvestment Act to better recruit and retain nurses. Nevertheless, we \ncan and should do more.

Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \ncongratulate an outstanding and historic church from my home State of \nMichigan. This year, Saint Hedwig Catholic Church, located in southwest \nDetroit, is celebrating its centennial anniversary.\n  Saint Hedwig Catholic Church grew out of a flourishing Polish \nneighborhood in 1903 and has continued to serve those in the community \never since. Over the course of the next 100 years, the church supported \na school, a convent, and many civic organizations. The church community \nprovided a safe haven of support for many Polish immigrants as they \nfled Europe during the first half of the twentieth century--a time when \nwar ravaged the continent. During the mid-1950s, Saint Hedwig was one \nof the largest Polish-speaking parishes in the United States. Weekly \nservices were delivered to 1,500 families and the church's school \npopulation grew to nearly 3,000 students.\n  Today, the church and rectory still stand at the corner of Junction \nand St.\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\nHedwig Streets. The beautiful stained glass, statues, murals, and \nfacade are a tribute to the history of the church as well as southwest \nDetroit. Saint Hedwig continues to serve people outside the \ncongregation by maintaining a food pantry for low-income families and \nhomeless members of the community. The church also holds special events \nthroughout the year such as a giving tree at Christmas and baby showers \nfor expectant mothers with low incomes.\n  The church has survived the effects of the Great Depression, disease, \nand urban sprawl because of the faith and dedication of its members. \nThe service provided by the members of Saint Hedwig has been invaluable \nto the Detroit community and is worthy of recognition.

Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise \ntoday to congratulate the University of South Dakota School of Medicine \nand Health Sciences Center for Disabilities in Vermillion, SD, which \nwill hold its 30th anniversary celebration on Wednesday, July 30, 2003.\n  Started in September 1973, as the Developmental Disabilities \nEvaluation Center, the Center for Disabilities has a long and \ndistinguished history of providing training, service, information, and \nresearch not only to South Dakota, but to the entire region. My wife \nBarbara served on the DDEC staff during those initial years. Thirty \nyears later, the school continues to serve those needs of South Dakota \nthrough current projects, such as the Autism and Related Disorders \nProgram, Birth to 3 Connections, Cheyenne River Reservation Rural \nHealth Outreach Project, Deaf-Blind Program, Dietetic Internship, and \nthe Upper Midwest Public Health Training Center. The Center for \nDisabilities is also working with other States to provide service in \nprojects such as the Four-State Consortium on Studies in the Prevention \nof Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Fetal Alcohol Effect and the Upper Midwest \nPublic Health Training Center.\n  Over the last 30 years, the University of South Dakota School of \nMedicine and Health Sciences Center for Disabilities has provided \nquality services to the people of South Dakota. Their goal, which is to \n``work with others to create opportunities that improve the lives of \npersons with disabilities and those they consider their families,'' has \nbeen demonstrated through the citizens with whom they have worked. \nThose ideals have also been carried out by the students who have \ngraduated and gone on to excel in their careers.\n  Not only has this center encouraged learning and research, but the \nUniversity of South Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences \nCenter for Disabilities also strives to bring together communities. \nIndeed, one of the core functions of the center is community education. \nThe Center works to provide training and assistance, not only to \nindividuals with disabilities and their families, but also to \nprofessionals, paraprofessionals, policymakers, students, and any \nmember of the community who chooses to get involved.\n  I want to acknowledge Executive Director Judy Struck, Director of \nResearch Amy Elliott, Director of Services and Supports Matthew Hocks, \nDirector of Community Education and Population Studies Roland \nLoudenburg, Director of Information and Resources Heather Stettnichs, \nand Director of Academic Training Joanne Wounded Head for the guidance \nand support they provide to the Center and all who work with it. I \nwould also like to take this opportunity to recognize the project and \nprogram staff at the Center: Missy Bailey, Mark Boyd, Stephanie Brown, \nMary Fitzpatrick, Sherry Lafferty, Teresa Nold, Ellisa Nyberg, Susan \nParr, Mary Mikkelson Peterson, Cheryl Raysby-Park, Dennis Stevens, \nBrittany Schmidt, Tracy Stephens, Kimberly Butler, Pam Anderson, Gregg \nDrube, Rolad Ellis, and Dan Korves. Finally, I would like to recognize \nthe hard work of support staff members: Jaime Larson, Kristen Blaschke, \nJennifer Gaspars, Paula Koller, LaVita Logue, Misty Miller, Jeanette \nSmolik, Elizabeth Fox, and Alana Richards.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor the University of South \nDakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences Center for Disabilities \nfor its 30 years of outstanding service. It is an honor for me to share \nwith my colleagues the exemplary leadership and strong commitment to \neducation and research the University of South Dakota School of \nMedicine and Health Sciences Center for Disabilities has provided. I \nstrongly commend their years of hard work and dedication, and I am very \npleased that their substantial efforts are being publicly honored and \ncelebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9583-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE PASSING OF EDUCATOR EUGENE GILMER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to extend condolences to the \nfamily and friends of the late Eugene Gilmer. Although many of you did \nnot know Mr. Gilmer personally, he was a longstanding member of the \nDetroit education and political community, and his life touched many.\n  Eugene Gilmer's distinguished career started overseas, where he \nserved as a member of the United States Army during World War II, part \nof which was in Okinawa. Following the war, he earned a Bachelor's \ndegree in political science from Xavier University of Louisiana. He \nthen moved to Detroit where he earned a Master's degree in education \nfrom Wayne State University.\n  After earning his Master's degree, he gained his first job as a \nteacher at Sampson Elementary School where, 6 years later, he was \npromoted to the position of assistant principal. He later became \nprincipal of Fitzgerald Elementary School, where he is credited for \nmaking significant strides in improving the educational quality of that \nformerly troubled school. He went on to become superintendent of \npersonnel for the Detroit Public Schools. When he retired from that \nposition in 1985, he concluded his tenure of 35 years in the Detroit \neducation system.\n  In his spare time, Eugene Gilmer served as the first African-American \nchairman of the Fisher Branch YMCA, and he was active in the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, the National \nAlliance of Black School Educators, the Palmer Park Police Community \nRelations Committee and Kappa Alpha Psi, his social fraternity. He \nbecame known in the Detroit community for his involvement with the \ndevelopment of the International Afro-American Museum, a precursor to \nthe current Charles H. Wright Museum of African-American History. He \nserved as chairman of the board of directors of the museum when it was \ndedicated in 1993.\n  Eugene Gilmer provided lasting contributions to the City of Detroit, \nand his death will be mourned. I invite my Senate colleagues to join me \nin remembering the life of this commendable citizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9583-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9583-S9584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING THE LIFE OF CHESTERFIELD SMITH OF MIAMI, FLORIDA\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to express \nsadness at the passing of a legendary Floridian. Yesterday evening, \nChesterfield Smith, one of the Nation's great attorneys, passed away in \nCoral Gables.\n  Recognized by many as the conscience of the legal profession, \nChesterfield's accomplishments are almost too numerous to count. A \nWorld War II veteran, founder of one of the country's most prestigious \nlaw firms and an accomplished litigator, he dedicated himself to his \nfamily and his country.\n  He is probably best known on the national scene for his tenure as \npresident of the American Bar Association during the Watergate scandal. \nFollowing the dismissal of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, \nChesterfield courageously stood up to the President of the United \nStates, publicly calling on Congress to reestablish the Office of \nSpecial Prosecutor.\n  Smith's brave and bold reminder that the ``No man is above the law'' \naltered the course of public debate during that difficult time.\n  That bravery carried over to his private practice as well. \nChesterfield believed in individual accomplishment\n\n[[Page S9584]]\n\nand personal responsibility. A fierce civil rights advocate who opposed \nsegregation in the Old South, he aggressively challenged the color \nbarrier by making his law firm a model of diversity.\n  Chesterfield always led by example, but also challenged others in his \nprofession to get involved. He encouraged his colleagues to ``be \nsomebody'' in their communities. His passion and commitment to \nbettering our society influenced an entire generation of attorneys.\n  Supreme Court Justice Ginsberg described him perfectly when she said \nof Chesterfield. ``He has devoted his extraordinary talent and energy \nto the improvement of the legal profession, to making the profession \nmore honorable, more responsive to the people law and lawyers serve. \nShe went on, ``He is, in sum, among the brightest, boldest, bravest, \nall-around most effective lawyers ever bred in Florida and the USA.''\n  I send my condolences to his family and friends on this sad day. His \ndeath is a grievous loss to the entire country. He will be greatly \nmissed.\n  I ask that an obituary chronicling Mr. Smith's life be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The obituary follows.\n\n Chesterfield Smith, International Law Firm Founder and Outspoken ABA \n                 President During Nixon-Era, Dies at 85\n\n\nSmith's ``No Man is Above The Law'' Was Turning Point in Public Call to \n                      Investigate President Nixon\n\n       Chesterfield Smith, 85, of Miami, one of the country's most \n     prominent figures in modern law and often called ``the \n     conscience of the legal profession,'' died today at Doctors \n     Hospital in Coral Gables, Florida.\n       Smith was the founder and chairman emeritus of Holland & \n     Knight LLP, the country's eighth largest law firm. During his \n     55 year career, Smith was a major force in American law and \n     politics, humbling the mightiest and giving a voice to the \n     common.\n       Smith served as president of the American Bar Association \n     (ABA) from 1973-1974 and was best known as the daring leader \n     who made the first public call to investigate President \n     Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate scandal. His simple and \n     direct rationale: ``No man is above the law'' appeared on the \n     front page of major American newspapers following the \n     infamous Watergate ``Saturday Night Massacre,'' October 20, \n     1973.\n\n\n                            America's Lawyer\n\n       In a country that is cynical and, at times, even disdainful \n     of lawyers, Chesterfield Smith maintained a positive vision \n     of what lawyers could be, using his own success as an \n     example. He believed that lawyers must have an ``unselfish \n     involvement in essential public service'' and encouraged his \n     colleagues to ``be somebody'' in their communities.\n       The word restraint had no place in Smith's life. Known for \n     his candid and sometimes brutally honest speeches, he loved \n     nothing more than giving a rousing speech to stir up \n     audiences.\n       ``We are not a trade association. We are not a union,'' he \n     once told a group of law students about the ABA. ``We are out \n     to improve justice and its administration of society. If you \n     don't intend to work to improve the quality of justice, then \n     I hope you flunk your exams.''\n       Smith grew up in Arcadia, a small town in central Florida. \n     He fought in World War II from 1940-1945, earning a Bronze \n     star. He graduated from the University of Florida Law School \n     in 1946.\n       After graduation, Smith returned to Arcadia and soon joined \n     the firm of Treadwell and Treadwell. A year and a half later, \n     he joined the firm of Holland, Bevis and McRae in nearby \n     Bartow. He made partner in record time by capably \n     representing Florida's booming phosphate industry. His law \n     firm subsequently engineered a merger with the prominent \n     Tampa firm, Knight, Jones, Whitaker and Germany in 1968. The \n     new firm became Holland & Knight, named for founders of both \n     firms, and became a dominant firm in Florida.\n       By 1965, Smith was fully immersed in the legal profession \n     and state politics. He was elected president of the Florida \n     Bar and chairman of the Florida Constitutional Revision \n     Commission. In the late 1960's, his work on the Commission \n     brought an end to the ``Pork Chop Gang,'' a group of powerful \n     rural Florida legislators who, for years, controlled the \n     state government by malapportionment.\n\n\n                        The Voice of the People\n\n       Chesterfield Smith served as president of the ABA during \n     one of the most turbulent and unsettling years in American \n     politics, 1973-1974. In the midst of the Watergate scandal, \n     Nixon and his advisors were convinced that they could avoid \n     handing over the Oval Office tapes and fire special \n     prosecutor Archibald Cox without public backlash. It would \n     take Smith's words, ``No man is above the law'', a large \n     voice from a significant source, to alter public discourse \n     towards impeachment.\n       Amid the Controversy, Smith publicly urged Congress to re-\n     estblish the office of special prosecutor. Undaunted by wide \n     criticism, he led the ABA in an effort to authorize an \n     independent counsel to investigate President Nixon. Another \n     former leader of the ABA, Leon Jaworski, was appointed. He \n     vigorously prosecuted the case against Nixon, culminating in \n     appeals to the Supreme Court. In the end, Nixon felt \n     compelled to resign.\n\n\n                    Promoting Equal Justice for All\n\n       Chesterfield Smith exhibited amazing clarity in a complex \n     era in the 1960's. With this clarity came the courage and \n     ability to recognize and embrace societal change. Unconcerned \n     about the contrary opinions of others, he often spoke out \n     against racial discrimination. And, despite growing up in the \n     segregationist South Smith was one of the first to recruit \n     minorities. Under his leadership, Holland & Knight became a \n     model of diversity.\n       Chesterfield Smith strongly believed in the responsibility \n     of individuals to take action in the civic and charitable \n     life of their communities. Today his firm is recognized for \n     community service efforts and extensive pro-bono legal work.\n       In 2002, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg \n     presented Smith with the Laurie D. Zelon Pro Bono Award in a \n     formal ceremony conducted in the Great Hall of the United \n     States Supreme Court.\n       During the ceremony Ginsburg, praised his life-long \n     contributions to the legal profession and his leadership in \n     creating a firm dedicated to public service.\n       ``He has devoted his extraordinary talent and enormous \n     energy to the improvement of the legal profession--to making \n     the profession more honorable, more responsive to the people \n     law and lawyers serve'' Ginsberg said. ``He is, in sum, among \n     the brightest, boldest, bravest, all-around most effective \n     lawyers ever bred in Florida and the USA.''\n       He is survived by his wife of 16 years, Jacqueline Allee, \n     and two children, Chesterfield Jr. and daughter Rhoda Smith \n     Kibler, both of Tallahassee, Florida.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/17/senate-section/article/S9584-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JULY 21, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to improper labeling and classification of dairy \n     products; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, Technological advances have led to a dramatic \n     increase in the use of imported dry milk protein concentrates \n     (MPCs) in dairy products. The widespread use of this \n     technology has largely developed after the negotiations for \n     the landmark General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GAAT). \n     Since MPCs are not subject to quotas and tariffs, they are \n     imported into this country at much lower prices. This \n     economic advantage is wreaking havoc in the domestic dairy \n     industry; and\n       Whereas, within the American dairy industry, there is great \n     concern that not all manufacturers may be fully complying \n     with requirements for listing accurately all ingredients in \n     standardized food. Since using MPCs in producing dairy \n     products, including cheese, offers significant cost \n     advantages, it is essential that labeling of products reflect \n     the contents accurately. It must be easy for consumers to \n     identify companies that fully comply with standards of \n     identity and that do not use imported MPCs; and\n       Whereas, Since substituting MPCs offers price advantages in \n     the marketplace, the volume of their use is increasing \n     substantially. The result is the displacement of domestic \n     milk solids and the erosion of the major component of \n     American agriculture. Action needs to be taken to protect \n     existing food standards and correct unlawful practices as \n     soon as possible; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives (the senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to enact legislation that will address the issue of \n     the improper labeling and classification of dairy products; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-215. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to the Congressional Medal of Honor; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 67\n\n       Whereas, Congress has before it a bill, H.R. 369, that \n     would waive time limitations specified in federal law to \n     allow the Medal of Honor to be awarded posthumously to \n     Sergeant Gary Lee McKiddy for acts of valor in the Vietnam \n     War. This legislation was originated in response to \n     circumstances surrounding the events of May 6, 1970, when a \n     helicopter and crew came under intense fire and were shot \n     down; and\n       Whereas, The helicopter's crew chief, Sergeant Gary Lee \n     McKiddy, who compiled a remarkable record in Vietnam, \n     gallantly rescued one crew member before Sergeant McKiddy was \n     killed by an explosion that occurred as he returned again to \n     the flames and wreckage to try to rescue the pilot. For a \n     variety of reasons, including the fact that application \n     procedures were not initiated prior to the statutory date of \n     October 1975, Sergeant McKiddy's bravery was not recognized \n     with the nation's highest honor. Congress considered similar \n     legislation to address this in the 107th Congress but \n     adjourned before taking action; and\n       Whereas, Congress has the opportunity to rectify the \n     oversight of the past three decades to accord appropriate \n     honor to a true national hero and defender of our ideals. \n     This legislation is long overdue: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact H.R. \n     369 to waive time limitations for the consideration of the \n     Congressional Medal of Honor for Sergeant Gary Lee McKiddy; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-216. A joint memorial adopted by the Senate and House \n     of Representatives of the Legislature of the State of \n     Washington relative to the United States Military Academy at \n     West Point; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4021\n\n       Whereas, The United States Military Academy today \n     celebrates 200 years of providing leaders of character for \n     our Army and a lifetime of selfless service to the Nation; \n     and\n       Whereas, On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson \n     signed into law a bill of the United States Congress \n     authorizing the establishment of ``a military academy to be \n     located at West Point in the State of New York;'' and\n       Whereas, West Point was originally created as an academic \n     institution devoted to the arts and sciences of warfare, and \n     later emphasizing engineering to serve the needs of the \n     Nation and to eliminate the country's reliance on foreign \n     engineers and artillerists; and\n       Whereas, Isaac I. Stevens, the first graduate of West \n     Point's Class of 1839, served as the first Governor of the \n     Territory of Washington, and organized and led the Northern \n     Railway Survey that paved the way for the transcontinental \n     railroads to Washington; and\n       Whereas, United States Military Academy graduates were \n     responsible for the construction of many of the Nation's \n     initial railway lines, bridges, harbors and roads, and \n     surveys and mapmaking that were vital to the infrastructure \n     development of our great Country and its State of Washington; \n     and\n       Whereas, United States Military Academy led Army forces \n     into the wilderness area that became the Territory and State \n     of Washington, providing protection and development services \n     until the civil authority was able to assume these functions; \n     and\n       Whereas, West Point graduates have distinguished themselves \n     in countless ways, from Olympic glory to receiving the \n     Heisman Trophy, from receiving scores of Rhodes Scholarships \n     to serving as some of the Nation's pioneering astronauts; and\n       Whereas, The United States Military Academy is preparing \n     for its third century of service to our Nation--a future in \n     which fighting and winning our Nation's wars remains the \n     Army's primary focus; and\n       Whereas, The United States Military Academy must also \n     prepare officers for peacekeeping duties as part of an ever \n     complex world; and\n       Whereas, United States Military Academy remains today an \n     energetic, vibrant institution that attracts some of the \n     Nation's best and brightest young men and women from \n     throughout the Country and its State of Washington who, in \n     the next two hundred years of service to this Nation, will \n     face challenges different from those that have gone before \n     them to make up the storied Long Gray Line; and\n       Whereas, The United States Military Academy continues its \n     lasting commitment to its motto of Duty, Honor, Country;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     the President of the United States and the Congress join with \n     the state of Washington and other states in honoring the \n     200th Anniversary of the United States Military Academy at \n     West Point in recognizing that the United States Military \n     Academy is a living testament to the accomplishments of the \n     United States throughout its history, and in recognizing West \n     Point and its graduates as they move forward into the \n     Academy's third century of service to the Nation; be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, Lieutenant General William J. Lennox, Jr., \n     Superintendent, United States Military Academy, West Point, \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, and each member of Congress from \n     the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-217. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to unsolicited, commercial email or spam; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 62\n\n       Whereas, Unsolicited commercial email, which is generally \n     referred to as ``spam'' is becoming an increasingly \n     burdensome problem for many Americans and both private and \n     public sector enterprises. Unlike other forms of unsolicited \n     marketing, spam imposes little cost to the sender. Because of \n     this, there are few forces to limit the volume of these \n     emails being sent; and\n       Whereas, The cumulative effects of spam are staggering. \n     According to reports cited by the Federal Trade Commission \n     (FTC), spam accounts for between one-third and one-half of \n     all emails sent each day. The skyrocketing growth in the \n     volume of unsolicited commercial emails is a burden upon \n     those receiving these unwanted messages. As volume increases, \n     so does the worry over the potential for fraudulent \n     activities; and\n       Whereas, The nuisance of unsolicited email has turned into \n     a problem spiraling out of control, not only for individuals \n     but also costing businesses millions of dollars every year in \n     lost productivity. Reports indicate that dealing with spam \n     costs United States corporations nearly $9 billion and \n     accounts for at least $4 billion in lost productivity each \n     year. Even our troops in the Persian Gulf region have \n     reported frustrations with unsolicited email messages \n     impeding efforts to communicate with family back home; and\n       Whereas, The FTC has just completed a three-day forum to \n     address the proliferation of unsolicited commercial email and \n     to explore the technical, legal, and financial issues \n     associated with it. In 2001, the FTC received 10,000 messages \n     a day through its spam database; the agency now receives \n     about 130,000 spam messages a day. In reviewing these \n     messages, the FTC has found 66% of the spam analyzed \n     contained false ``From'' lines, ``Subject'' lines, or message \n     text; and\n       Whereas, The FTC forum clearly demonstrated a need for \n     actions at the federal level. Numerous options are being \n     discussed, in Congress and in the states and among business \n     and community leaders, on how best to address the issue of \n     spam. It is increasingly clear to many that a federal \n     approach, coupled with individual state actions, offers the \n     greatest potential for meaningful results in dealing with \n     this complex issue: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S9591]]\n\n       Resolved by the house of representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the Federal \n     Trade Commission to address the issue of unsolicited \n     commercial email, otherwise known as spam, on a national \n     basis; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the United States \n     Federal Trade Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-218. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the \n     Gulf Intercostal Waterway; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science and Transportation.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 90\n\n       Whereas, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway is vital to the \n     nation's economy spanning across five gulf coast states; and\n       Whereas, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway carries one-third \n     of the freight of all of America's waterways and has \n     significant economic impact on the entire state of Louisiana, \n     as well as the nation; and\n       Whereas, the protection of the banks of the Gulf \n     Intracoastal Waterway guarantees the future of many \n     businesses and individuals that depend on its efficiency and \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, tidal exchange, combined with the effects of wave \n     action and boat wake from traffic has contributed to \n     significant shoreline erosion; and\n       Whereas, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway shoreline erosion \n     has and continues to contribute to the loss of coastal \n     wetlands, aquatic resources, commercial and recreational \n     fisheries, agricultural farmland, wildlife resources, \n     essential fish habitat, recreation resources, and cultural \n     resources of coastal Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the lack of action to protect the Gulf \n     Intracoastal Waterway's shorelines has negatively impacted \n     navigation, resulting in increased dredging costs, threats to \n     shipping, implications for loss of trade, reduced flood \n     control, and threats to water supplies due to saltwater \n     intrusion: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to provide \n     adequate and immediate protection, stabilization, and \n     maintenance of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway canal banks in \n     southwest Louisiana; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-219. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to Lake St. Clair; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 63\n\n       Whereas, Lake St. Clair is an essential component of the \n     network that comprises the world's largest source of \n     accessible freshwater. Often referred to as the ``Heart of \n     the Great Lakes'' for the unique importance, location, and \n     shape, Lake St. Claire is an immeasurable resource to the \n     region's economy, ecology, health, and recreation; and\n       Whereas, Lake St. Clair provides the drinking water for 2.3 \n     million people, produces one-third of all fish caught on the \n     Great Lakes, and includes some of the most important \n     ecosystem along the Great Lakes basin; and\n       Whereas, Several key federal acts, including the Great \n     Lakes Act of 1956, the Clean Water Act of 1978, the Great \n     Lakes Shoreline Mapping Act of 1987, the Nonindigenous \n     Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, and the \n     Water Resources Development Act of 2000, include Lake St. \n     Clair in the definition of the Great Lakes for the purpose of \n     programs and grants; and\n       Whereas, Lake St. Clair also received special attention in \n     the Water Resources Development Act of 1999, which directed \n     the Secretary of the Army to prepare a comprehensive \n     management plan for Lake St. Clair, a first draft of which is \n     scheduled for release in 2003; and\n       Whereas, In spite of its critical role, Lake St. Clair has \n     been subject to several serious environmental problems in \n     recent years.

A bill to provide assistance to train teachers of children \nwith autism spectrum disorders, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce along with Senator \nLautenberg the Teacher Education for Autistic Children, TEACH, Act of \n2003, legislation that will highlight the needs of autistic children by \nbringing more qualified teachers into the classroom, helping families \nreceive the support and services they need for their children, and \nhelping ensure vocational programs to assist people with autism \ntransition from school to work are functioning as intended.\n  Autism is a developmental disability characterized by atypical, often \nrepetitive behaviors and deficits in social and communication skills. \nThough it is difficult to determine an exact number, some researchers \nbelieve that an astounding 1 out of 250 of our Nation's children are in \nsome way affected by this disorder.\n  Perhaps even more alarming is the fact that the number of children \ndiagnosed with some form of autism has increased significantly \nthroughout the country over the past decade. Take my State for \nexample--according to the New Jersey Department of Education in 1991, \nthere were 241 children in our schools who had been diagnosed with \nautism. By 2001, that figure had risen to 3,984, a staggering increase \nof 1,548 percent.\n  While the cause of autism and its cure are unknown, we are aware that \nthe best treatment for these children is early intervention from \nqualified teachers. The TEACH Act of 2003 would go a long way in \nimproving services for these children by providing teachers with the \nnecessary training and helping school districts in hiring qualified \nautism teachers.\n  Specifically, the TEACH Act authorizes $15 million a year for five \nyears to provide education or professional development training for \ncurrent teachers or students who want to be special education teachers, \nteachers' aides, or other professionals who work with autistic \nchildren.\n  The TEACH Act also establishes a loan forgiveness program for \nqualified teachers of autistic children to help them pay off college \nloans or loans associated with taking continuing education courses \nrelated to autism. This incentive of up to $20,000 to help pay off \ncollege loans will go a long way in attracting more qualified \nindividuals into special education.\n  The bill also includes provisions that establish State Autism \nOmbudsman Offices that would act as clearinghouses for families who are \nseeking information on services, education, and other resources to help \ntheir children achieve the full and happy lives they deserve. It also \ncreates a national Task Force to evaluate and make recommendations \nregarding best practices for the education of autistic children.\n  Finally, this legislation requires a joint Department of Labor/\nDepartment of Education study to evaluate existing vocational programs \navailable for people with autism in order to ensure that such \nindividuals have access to quality jobs and their own independence.\n  The TEACH Act will go a long way to help autistic families by giving \ntheir children the opportunity to achieve the highest quality of life. \nI urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, which has \nthe power to improve thousands of lives.\n\n[[Page S9594]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1422\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITION.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``autism spectrum disorder'' has the \n     meaning given the term by the Diagnostic and Statistical \n     Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1428. A bill to prohibit civil liability actions from being \nbrought or continued against food manufacturers, marketers, \ndistributors, advertisers, sellers, and trade associations for damages \nor injunctive relief for claims of injury resulting from a person's \nweight gain, obesity, or any health condition related to weight gain or \nobesity; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about abusive \nlitigation in America. Unfortunately, a personal injury lawyer's desire \nfor a big payday by any theory imaginable is never satisfied, and so I \ncome yet again to speak about tort reform--an issue I have worked on \nnearly every year that I have been in the Senate.\n  America is blessed with an abundant food supply and an overwhelming \nnumber of food choices. With so many choices, some of us overdo it. \nThat over indulgence, combined with an under indulgence of exercise can \nsometimes have negative health consequences. But most of us take \nresponsibility for the amount--and the type--of food we put in our \nmouth, and we accept the consequences of those decisions.\n  Personal injury lawyers, however, are now trying to convince \nAmericans with expanding waistlines that someone else is to blame for \ntheir weight problem. And so the latest targets of predatory lawyers \nare the people producing and selling food. That is right. This money-\nhungry gang is going after ``Big Food.'' If it were not so frightening, \nit would be funny.\n  This is a disturbing turn of events and a further indication of the \nerosion of personal responsibility in America. People claiming their \nweight gain is the fault of the food manufacturers or seller have \nalready begun filing lawsuits. Think of the absurdity of that logic. \nHow long will it be until those who get speeding tickets begin to sue \ncar manufacturers for building a car that people may decide to drive \ntoo fast?\n  Many Americans need to take greater care in what--and how much--they \neat. But it is also time to curb the voracious appetite of the personal \ninjury lawyers and put an end to this ridiculous and costly litigation \nbefore it gets out of hand\n  That is why today I am introducing the Commonsense Consumption Act.\n  My bill would prohibit suits against food manufacturers and sellers \nfor claims of injury resulting from a person's weight gain, obesity or \nhealth condition related to weight gain or obesity.\n  Any such suit pending on the date of enactment of this bill would be \ndismissed.\n\n[[Page S9596]]\n\n  Let me be clear. This bill does not provide widespread legal immunity \nfor the food industry. It only provides protection from abusive suits \nby people seeking to blame someone else for their poor eating habits.\n  This bill would not affect lawsuits against food manufacturers or \nsellers that knowingly and willfully violate a Federal or State statute \napplicable to the manufacture and sale of food.\n  This bill would not apply to lawsuits for breach of contract or \nexpress warranty. And this bill would not apply to claims related to \n``adulterated'' food.\n  I should mention that Representative Ric Keller has introduced \nsimilar legislation in the House. His bill, entitled the Personal \nResponsibility in Food Consumption Act has received a hearing and has \nattracted a significant number of cosponsors. My bill is worded a bit \ndifferently than Representative Keller's but I believe it is safe to \nsay that both bills aim for the same result: an end to these absurd \nlawsuits.\n  Just a few years ago, the whole idea of blaming, and suing, someone \nelse for your own eating habits was comical.\n  In fact, in August of 2000 the satirical publication ``The Onion'' \ncarried a spoof news story entitled ``Hershey's Ordered To Pay Obese \nAmericans $135 Billion.''\n  The story began: In one of the largest product-liability rulings in \nU.S. history, the Hershey Foods Corp. was ordered by a Pennsylvania \njury to pay $135 billion in restitution to 900,000 obese Americans who \nfor years consumed the company's fattening snack foods.\n  The article continued by saying: [The five-state class-action suit \naccused Hershey's of ``knowingly and willfully marketing rich, fatty \ncandy bars containing chocolate and other ingredients of negligible \nnutritional value.'' The company was also charged with . . . \nartificially ``spiking'' Their products with such substances as \npeanuts, crisped rice, and caramel to increase consumer appeal.\n\n  That story was humorous in August of 2000. It is not funny any \nlonger. Personal injury lawyers are now attempting to turn that \nsatirical story into reality.\n  We have seen press reports that just a few weeks ago a group of more \nthan a hundred money-hungry lawyers and activists met in Boston to plan \nstrategy for suing food manufacturers and sellers.\n  As I mentioned, some of these personal injury lawyers have already \nstarted suing. We have seen suits against restaurants, suits against \ncookie makers, and there are more to come.\n  One lawyer has reportedly sent letters to restaurants telling them to \nmeet his demands or he will sue. This same trial lawyer ring-leader has \nalso threatened to sue local school districts and even individual \nmembers of the school board. Have these lawyers no shame?\n  But perhaps these lawyers have finally bitten off more than they can \nchew. When they sue come big corporation, most people probably do not \npay much attention. But when you start dragging the local school board \nmembers into court and forcing them to spend thousands and thousand of \ntax dollars defending against frivolous claims, well as we say in \nKentucky that is a horse of a different color.\n  When Americans hear what these lawyers are up to I do not think they \nare going to like it. I know the voters in Kentucky are not interested \nin seeing more abusive lawsuits about obesity, and they certainly are \nnot interested in paying more at the cash register in order to finance \nsome personal injury lawyers' extravagant lifestyle.\n  These lawsuits are expensive to defend and the lawyers know that. The \nlawyers are not really interested in consumers, they are looking for a \nsettlement, a big settlement, that will make them rich and enable them \nto clog the courts with more frivolous cases.\n  Make no mistake about it. These lawsuits seek only to fatten personal \ninjury lawyers' wallets. And that will result in higher food prices for \nconsumers.\n  It is time to stop this abuse now and it is time to remind people \nthat personal responsibility is the issue here. People must take \nresponsibility for their actions.\n  As one weight loss guru said on CNN earlier this year when he was \nasked about obesity suits against restaurants:\n  There is always going to be greasy, fried, salty, sugary food. It is \nup to the individual to walk in and say, I don't want those fries \ntoday. I have 40 pounds to lose. It is not the fault of the fast food \npeople, and anyone who's trying to sue the fast food places needs a \ntherapist, not an attorney. You have to make your own decisions. That's \nwhat the freedom in America is all about.\n  Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be quoting Richard \nSimmons on the Senate floor, but he has perfectly summed it up pretty \nwell, as I just described.\n  Making your own decisions is what freedom is all about. And with \nfreedom comes responsibility. We have the freest society on the planet, \nbut folks need to start exercising some responsibility with their \nfreedom. Do not blame others for your bad habits. You are responsible \nfor what you put in your mouth, and parents are responsible for what \ntheir children put in their mouth. It is that simple. The plaintiff's \nbar may not like that fact, but it is truly that simple.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1429. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide States with options for providing family planning services and \nsupplies to individuals eligible for medical assistance under the \nmedicaid program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nFeinstein in introducing the Family Planning State Empowerment Act of \n2003. This legislation would provide States with a mechanism to improve \nthe health of low-income women and families by allowing States to \nexpand family planning services to additional women under the Medicaid \nprogram.\n  The Federal Government currently reimburses States for 90 percent of \ntheir expenditures for family planning services under Medicaid, due to \nthe importance of these for low-income women. This reimbursement rate \nis higher than for most other health care services.\n  Generally, women may qualify for Medicaid services, including family \nplanning, in one of two ways: they have children and an income level \nbelow a threshold set by the State, ranging from 15 to 86 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level; or they are pregnant and have incomes up to \n133 percent of the poverty level, federal law allows states to raise \nthis income eligibility level to 185 percent, if they desire. If a \nwoman qualifies because of pregnancy, she is automatically eligible for \nfamily planning services for sixty days following delivery. After those \nsixty days, the woman's Medicaid eligibility expires.\n  If States want to provide Medicaid family planning services to \nadditional populations of low-income women, they must apply to the \nFederal Government for a so-called ``1115'' waiver. These waivers allow \nStates to establish demonstration projects in order to test new \napproaches to health care delivery in a manner that is budget-neutral \nto the Federal Government.\n  To date, these waivers have enabled eighteen States to expand access \nto family planning services. Most of these waivers allow states to \nextend family planning to women beyond the sixty-day post-partum \nperiod. This allows many women to increase the length of time between \nbirths, which has significant health benefits for women and their \nchildren. For this reason, an Institute of Medicine report recommended \nthat Medicaid should cover family planning services for two years \nfollowing a delivery.\n  Some of the waivers allow States to provide family planning to women \nbased solely on income, regardless of whether they qualify for Medicaid \ndue to pregnancy or children. In general, States have used the same \nincome eligibility levels that apply to pregnant women, 133 percent or \n185 percent of the poverty level, creating continuity for both family \nplanning and prenatal care services. These expanded services also help \nstates reduce rates of unintended pregnancy and the need for abortion.\n  My State of Rhode Island was one of the first States to obtain one of \nthese waivers, and has had great success with it in terms of preventing \nunintended\n\n[[Page S9597]]\n\npregnancies and improving public health in general. Rhode Island's \nwaiver has averted 1,443 pregnancies from August 1994 through 1997, \nresulting in a savings to the state of $14.3 million. In addition, \nRhode Island's waiver has assisted low-income women with spacing-out \ntheir births. The number of low-income women in Rhode Island with short \ninter-birth intervals, becoming pregnant within 18 months of having \ngiven birth, dropped from 41 percent in 1993 to 29 percent in 1999. The \ngap between Medicaid recipients and privately insured women was 11 \npercent in 1993, compared with only 1 percent--almost negligible--in \n1999. As these statistics show, these waivers are extremely valuable \nand serve as a huge asset to the women's health, not only to my \nconstituents but to constituents in the thirteen other states who \ncurrently benefit from these waivers.\n  Unfortunately, the waiver process is extremely cumbersome and time \nconsuming, taking up to three years for States to receive approval from \nthe federal government. This may discourage States from applying for \nfamily planning waivers, or at the very least, delay them from \nproviding important services to women.\n  Our bill would rectify this problem by allowing States to extend \nfamily planning services through Medicaid without going through the \nwaiver process. Eliminating the waiver requirement will facilitate \nState innovation and provide assistance to more low-income women.\n  This bill will allow States to provide family planning services to \nwomen with incomes up to 185 percent of the Federal poverty level. For \nlow-income, post-partum women, States will no longer be limited to \nproviding them with only sixty days of family planning assistance. \nStates may also provide family planning for up to one year to women who \nlose Medicaid-eligibility because of income.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1429\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Chafee to \nintroduce a bill to give States the flexibility to provide family \nplanning services to low-income women who do not qualify for Medicaid.\n  Under current law, in order to qualify for family planning services \nprovided by the Medicaid program, a women would either have to have \nchildren and an income level below a threshold set by the State, \nranging from 15-86 percent of the Federal poverty level, or be pregnant \nand have an income up to 133 percent of the poverty level; Federal law \nallows States to raise this income eligibility level to 185 percent, if \nthey desire.\n  If a woman qualifies because of pregnancy, she is automatically \neligible for family planning services for 60 days following delivery. \nAfter those 60 days, the woman's Medicaid eligibility expires.\n  If a State wants to provide Medicaid family planning services to \nadditional populations of low-income women, they must apply to the \nFederal Government for a waiver. Currently, 18 States have waivers \napproved by the Federal Government. The waiver process is extremely \ncumbersome and time consuming, often taking up to three years to \nreceive approval from the Federal Government.\n  This bill would once and for all allow States to provide crucial \nfamily planning to low-income women under the Medicaid program. It \nwould eliminate the waiver process for these services and would give \nauthority back to the States to determine what populations of low \nincome women they want to provide family planning services to.\n\n  California currently receives $100 million annually, until 2004, as \npart of its five-year waiver to provide family planning services to low \nincome women. with these funds, California provides services to more \nthan 900,000 women each year.\n  The State estimates that because of these services, at least 50,000 \nunintended pregnancies are prevented each year.\n  In addition to contraceptives, the family planning funds are used for \nsexually transmitted disease screening and treatment, HIV screening and \ncounseling, basic infertility services and pregnancy testing and \ncounseling.\n  Officials involved in the program estimate that for every $1 invested \nin family planning, $3 are saved in pregnancy and health-care related \ncosts.\n  In California, it is estimated that providing low-income women with \naccess to family planning will save the State more then $900 million \nover the course of the five-year waiver.\n  I believe this legislation is more important now than ever.\n  Each year, approximately 3 million pregnacies, or about half of all \npregnancies, are unintended. Increasing access to family planning \nservices could help avert these 3 million unintended pregnancies and \nall the decisions and costs associated with either continuing or \nterminating a pregnancy.\n  Family planning services give women the necessary tools to space the \nbirths\n\n[[Page S9598]]\n\nof their children, which improves women's health and reduces rates of \ninfant mortality.\n  Medicaid family planning is also cost effective. For every $1 \ninvested in family planning, $3 are saved in pregnancy and health care-\nrelated costs.\n  Family planning and reproductive health services are much more than \njust accessing contraceptives. Services provided include screening and \ntreatment for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV, basic inferility \nservices and pregnancy testing and counseling. Women can receive pap \nsmears and breast exams, which are crucial to detecting cervical and \nbreast cancer.\n  Low income women deserve access to family planning and reproductive \nhealth services. And States should not have to ask the Federal \nGovernment for permission to use Medicaid funds to provide these \nessential services.\n  We can afford to shut the door on those who cannot otherwise afford \nfamily planning and reproductive health services.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1430. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nstudy of the Baranov Museum in Kodiak, Alaska, for potential inclusion \nin the National Park System; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Erskine House in Kodiak, AK, which \nhouses the Baranov Museum, is one of a very few Russian period \nstructures remaining in the Western Hemisphere. It is of great \nhistorical significance not only for this reason, but also because it \nis the only surviving structure known to have been associated with both \nthe Russian America Company and the Alaska Commercial Company, the \npillars of Russian and early American administration of Alaska.\n  The Erskine House/Baranov Museum is owned by the City of Kodiak and \noperated by the Kodiak Historical Society. It is a popular visitor \nattraction in Kodiak. Its collections include artifacts from the \nRussian American Company and the Alaska Commercial Company and also \ninclude Alaska Native, Russian and other cultural exhibits. I am told \nthat the structure, although it has had many owners, maintains much of \nits original historic integrity.\n  The Erskine House was designated a National Historic Landmark on June \n2, 1962. Shortly thereafter the National Park Service initiated \nconsideration of including this important property in the National Park \nSystem. On February 11, 2000, the Department of the Interior formally \nsought funds from Congress to study the possible inclusion of the \nErskine House in the system. The Congress responded by earmarking \n$250,000 in fiscal year 2002 appropriations for he Erskine House, some \nof which could be used to conduct the study and the remainder for \npreservation and maintenance of the facility.\n  I am sad to report that the National Park Service has not initiated \nthis study. The National Park Service has indicated that it cannot \ninitiate the study without the express direction of Congress and that \ncongressional intent to do so cannot be inferred from the language of \nthe appropriation. However, the good news is that a sufficient portion \nof the $250,000 appropriation remains unexpended and I understand that \nit is available to be expended on the study. The expenditure of funds \non the study will not interfere with plans to spend other portions of \nthe $250,000 appropriation to rehabilitate the structure. The City of \nKodiak and the Kodiak Historical Society have expressed support for the \nstudy. What we need is for Congress to authorize the study.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would do just that. It \ndirects the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study of the Erskine \nHouse/Baranov Museum for the purpose of determining the suitability and \nfeasibility of designating the museum as a unit of the National Park \nService. I would like to see this study proceed with all deliberate \nspeed. Accordingly, the legislation also requires that the Secretary \nreport to appropriate committees of the Congress on the findings of the \nstudy and the Secretary's conclusions and recommendations within one \nyear of the date upon which this legislation is enacted.\n  I want to commend the City of Kodiak and the Kodiak Historical \nSociety for their loving care of this important structure. Perhaps this \nexcerpt, from a July 7, 2003 letter that I received from Stacey \nBecklund, Director of the Kodiak Historical Society states it best, and \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpt from the letter was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n       The [Erskine House and the Baranov Museum] are some of \n     Kodiak's most cherished treasures. both assets have matured \n     through labors and love of staff, volunteers and members of \n     the community. We, at all levels of government and community, \n     will benefit from a thorough and accurate study to assess the \n     future ownership of this structure.\n\n  I am privileged to lend my voice to the voices of the people of \nKodiak, many of whom believe that this very important historic site is \na national treasure, as well as a local one. I hope that this \nlegislation will receive expeditious consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) If a terrorist group were to acquire the necessary \n     fissile material for a nuclear explosive device, it would not \n     be difficult for the group to construct such a device, the \n     explosion of which could kill and injure thousands, or even \n     hundreds of thousands, of people and destroy a large area of \n     a city.\n       (2) If a terrorist group were to acquire a complete nuclear \n     weapon from a nation which has constructed nuclear weapons, \n     it is likely that the group would be able to detonate the \n     device with similar results.\n       (3) A nation supplying either complete nuclear weapons or \n     special nuclear material to terrorists might believe that it \n     could escape retaliation by the United States, as the United \n     States would not be able to determine the origin of either a \n     weapon or its fissile material.\n\n[[Page S9604]]\n\n       (4) It is possible, however, to determine the country of \n     origin of fissile material after a nuclear explosion, \n     provided that samples of the radioactive debris from the \n     explosion are collected promptly and analyzed in appropriate \n     laboratories.\n       (5) If radioactive debris is collected soon enough after a \n     nuclear explosion, it is also possible to determine the \n     characteristics of the nuclear explosive device involved, \n     which information can assist in locating and dismantling \n     other nuclear devices that may threaten the United States.\n       (6) If countries that might contemplate supplying nuclear \n     weapons or fissile material to terrorists know that their \n     assistance can be traced, they are much less likely to allow \n     terrorists access to either weapons or material.\n       (7) It is in the interest of the United States to acquire a \n     capability to collect promptly the debris from a nuclear \n     explosion that might occur in any part of the Nation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate on Nuclear Debris Collection and \n     Analysis Capability.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense should develop and deploy a \n     nuclear debris collection and analysis capability sufficient \n     to enable characterization of any nuclear device that might \n     be exploded in the United States;\n       (2) the capability should incorporate airborne debris \n     collectors, either permanently installed on dedicated \n     aircraft or available for immediate use on a class of \n     aircraft, stationed so that a properly equipped and manned \n     aircraft is available to collect debris from a nuclear \n     explosion anywhere in the United States and transport such \n     debris to an appropriate laboratory in a timely fashion; and\n       (3) to the maximum extent practicable, the capability \n     should be compatible with collection and analysis systems \n     used by the United States to characterize overseas nuclear \n     explosions.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than March 31, 2004, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report on the feasibility of developing and \n     deploying the capability described in subsection (b)(1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1309.

Mr. President, this year marks the 40th anniversary of \nthe March on Washington--a turning point in the struggle for civil \nrights for all Americans--and I am pleased that the Senate today has \npassed S. 470, a bill I introduced on February 27, 2003. This important \nlegislation extends the authority for the memorial to Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., to be constructed in the District of Columbia close to the \nspot from which Dr. King delivered his moving ``I Have a Dream'' speech \nat the March on Washington. I would like to thank the Senate for moving \nso expeditiously on S. 470--legislation that is crucial to ensure a \nfitting tribute to our Nation's greatest civil rights leader.\n  In the 104th Congress, Congress passed a bill that I sponsored \nauthorizing the creation of a memorial to Dr. King as part of the \nomnibus parks legislation. The Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, of which Dr. \nKing was a member, was designed to coordinate the design and funding of \nthe memorial. The legislation provides that the monument be established \nentirely with private contributions. The Department of Interior, in \nconsultation with the National Capital Park and Planning Commission and \nthe Commission on Fine Arts, has approved the site of the memorial \npursuant to this legislation. A design has been selected and the Alpha \nPhi Alpha National Memorial Project Foundation is in the process of \ngetting that design approved by the Department of the Interior.\n  Pursuant to the Commemorative Works Act, there is a 7-year period of \nlegislative authority in which the National Memorial Project Foundation \nmust acquire a construction permit for the memorial. This 7-year period \nwill expire in November of this year. Despite the enormous dedication \nof the National Memorial Project Foundation, additional time is \nnecessary for the Foundation to erect a fitting tribute to Dr. King. \nMeeting the administrative procedures and fundraising requirements of \nthe act has been a slow process. Therefore, the foundation requires \nmore time in which to complete the process and acquire a construction \npermit.\n  That is why I and Congresswoman Diane Watson in the House of \nRepresentatives introduced this legislation to extend the period of \nlegislative authority for an additional 3 years. This legislation gives \nthe foundation additional time to raise the necessary funds to obtain \nthe construction permit and will ensure that work on the memorial is \ncompleted. This extension of legislative authority has been done before \nfor numerous other memorials, such as the World War II Memorial and the \nU.S. Air Force Memorial, given the length of time it usually takes to \nembark on a project of this magnitude, and I am pleased that it will be \ndone for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial.\n\n  Since 1955, when in Montgomery, AL, Dr. King became a national hero \nand an acknowledged leader in the civil rights struggle, until his \ntragic death in Memphis, TN in 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. made an \nextraordinary contribution to the evolving history of our Nation. His \ncourageous stands and unyielding belief in the tenet of nonviolence \nreawakened our Nation to the injustice and discrimination that \ncontinued to exist 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation and \nthe enactment of the guarantees of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and \nfifteenth amendments to the Constitution.\n  A memorial to Dr. King erected in the Nation's Capital will provide \ncontinuing inspiration to all who view it, and particularly to the \nthousands of students and young people who visit Washington, DC every \nyear. While these young people may have no personal memory of the \ncondition of civil rights in America before Dr. King, nor of the \nstruggle in which he was the major figure, they do understand that \nthere is more that needs to be done in this critical area.\n  Martin Luther King, Jr. dedicated his life to achieving equal \ntreatment and enfranchisement for all Americans through nonviolent \nmeans. It is my hope that the young people who visit this monument will \ncome to understand that it represents not only the enormous \ncontribution of this great leader, but also two very basic principles \nnecessary for the effective functioning of our society. The first is \nthat change, even very fundamental change, is to be achieved through \nnonviolent means; that this is the path down which we should go as a \nNation in resolving some of our most difficult problems. The other \nbasic principle is that the reconciliation of the races, the inclusion \ninto the mainstream of American life of all its people, is essential to \nthe fundamental health of our Nation.\n  Forty years ago Dr. King declared ``I have a dream that my four \nchildren will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by \nthe color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a \ndream today.'' We must not let future generations forget the power of \nthese words, and the importance of Dr. King's dream.

SCHERLE POST OFFICE BUILDING\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration \nof S. 1399 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1399) to redesignate the facility of the United \n     States Postal Service located at 101 South Vine Street in \n     Glenwood, Iowa, as the ``William J. Scherle Post Office \n     Building''.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1399, a bill I \nam happy to cosponsor with Senator Harkin, to name the post office in \nGlenwood, IA, the William J. Scherle Post Office Building. Former \nCongressman Bill Scherle served in the U.S. House of Representatives \nfor four terms, from 1967-1975. Before that, we served together in the \nIowa House of Representatives. Bill Scherle is originally from New York \nState, so he was not born an Iowan, but you would never know it. He \nacclimated well to Iowa, living on a farm near the small southwestern \nIowa town of Henderson. Bill is a farmer through and through. He was a \nplainspoken conservative voice in Congress and he represented his \nlargely rural western Iowa district well. He then went on to serve his \ncountry in the Department of Agriculture. Bill Scherle has given a good \nportion of his life to public service and it is fitting that a post \noffice near his home be named in his honor. In fact, Bill Scherle's \nlegacy as a public servant is demonstrated by the fact that this bill \nto honor him is a bipartisan initiative. Both Senator Harkin and I \nrecognize the contribution made by Bill Scherle to Iowa and to the \nUnited States. I was very sorry when I recently learned that Bill is in \npoor health. I wish him the best and my prayers are with him and his \nfamily. I am glad that we have this opportunity now to recognize Bill \nand his service to his State and his Nation. I would like to thank \nChairman Collins for her help in allowing this bill to be moved quickly \nthrough the Government Affairs Committee and the Senate. I know that \nCongressman King, who follows in Congressman Scherle's footsteps, has \nsponsored a similar measure in the House with the support of others \nfrom the Iowa delegation. Those who know Bill Scherle or know of his \nlegacy understand why this honor is so appropriate and I hope this bill \ncan be enacted very soon.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nmoving towards passage today of legislation that would name the \nGlenwood, IA, post office for former Iowa Congressman, William J. \nScherle. Bill Scherle and his wife Jane live on their family farm just \noutside of Henderson, IA, in Mills County. Glenwood is the county seat \nof Mills County. Bill served four terms in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, beginning with three terms in 1967 in what was then \nIowa's 7th Congressional District, and a term in the re-districted 5th \nCongressional District. I think it is appropriate that Glenwood's Post \nOffice will soon permanently bear Congressman Scherle's name.\n  Bill long served his Nation. He started with military service in the \nNavy and Coast Guard during World War II, then afterwards served in the \nNaval Reserve. He chaired the Mills County Republican Party for almost \na decade starting in 1956. He served in the Iowa legislature from 1960 \nthrough 1966. He then was elected to the U.S. Congress and served \nthrough 1974, including service on the Education and Labor Committee \nand the Appropriations Committee. His public service continued in 1975 \nand 1976, when he was appointed to a senior position at the Department \nof Agriculture.\n  In January 1968, North Korea seized the USS Pueblo, imprisoned and \ntortured the crew. Congressman Scherle led the effort in Congress to \nfree the crew of the Pueblo. I have always admired Bill's tenacity in \nnever letting the Pueblo crew be forgotten. Bill was the only Member of \nCongress invited to attend Pueblo reunions and as their health has \nallowed, Bill and Jane always have attended.\n  Bill and I are at different places on the political spectrum, and I \nran\n\n[[Page S9619]]\n\nagainst him for Congress twice. He wont the first time, and I won the \nre-match. We disagreed on many issues, but I always understood that he \nacted on the basis of strong-held views about what he considered were \nthe best interests of those he represented and of the Nation.\n  Long after we ran as opponents, I got to know Bill and visited him on \nhis farm. He is a good person who cares deeply about his community and \nrural America. Politics has always had a certain amount of rough and \ntumble. But while Bill was certainly a good Republican who wanted to \nsee consistent victories for the GOP, he also could see the good in all \npeople.\n  One area of our mutual interest was the Iowa School for the Deaf in \nCouncil Bluffs. Bill always did what he could for the school my brother \nattended years ago, and for deaf people in general.\n  Congressman Scherle always cared about children and their welfare. He \nwrote a children's book. ``The Happy Barn.'' He gave away thousands of \ncopies to schools, hospitals and individual families in Southwest Iowa \nand the Omaha area, reading to young children time after time. He had \nlots of fun reading to children, and I believe that there are few more \nvaluable things we can do as adults than to read to children and get \nthem started on that most important activity.\n  Bill was a businessman and farmer, proud of both professions. He \nreceived the Alegent Health Mercy Hospital Heritage Award for his \ncontributions to business in Southwest Iowa.\n  He remains a good father to his two sons, and a good husband to his \nwife of 55 years, Jane. He is blessed with 6 grandchildren--five girls \nand a boy. Bill has lived a dedicated, patriotic, family and public \nservice life.\n  I am pleased that my colleague, Senator Grassley, joins me in \nsponsoring this legislation.
