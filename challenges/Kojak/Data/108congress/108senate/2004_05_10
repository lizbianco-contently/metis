Mr. President, today the Senate will conduct a period for \nmorning business, with Senators to speak for up to 10 minutes each. \nShortly, we expect to lock in an agreement for a vote at 5:30 this \nevening on the adoption of a Senate resolution relating to Iraqi \nprisoners. That will be the first rollcall vote of the day.\n  The Senate may also resume consideration of the FSC/ETI JOBS \nlegislation. I filed cloture on that bill on Friday, and that cloture \nvote will occur Tuesday morning. We are still hoping to work out an \nagreement to allow for a vote on the pending Cantwell amendment prior \nto that cloture vote. I will continue to talk with Members this \nafternoon about that agreement, and I will update Senators as to what \nto expect in the timing of those votes later in the day.\n  In any event, it is time that we bring the FSC/ETI JOBS bill to a \nclose. We have been on that bill 12 days. We have considered and \ndisposed of 20 different amendments on the floor of the Senate--9 \nrollcall votes and 11 voice votes.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues, if cloture is invoked, germane \namendments will be offered. As we mentioned at the end of last week, \nthose amendments would be discussed and debated for up to 30 hours \npostcloture.\n  For the remainder of the week, following the completion of the FSC/\nETI bill, we will proceed to S. 1248, the IDEA, Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, legislation. We have an agreement as to how \nwe will proceed on the IDEA bill. Therefore, we will be able to finish \nthat bill this week.\n  Finally, I remind Senators that we have 2 weeks remaining before the \nnext recess, and we have a number of items we must address prior to \nthat recess, including the Defense authorization bill, the budget \nconference report, if available, bioshield, sending the highway bill, a \nvery important bill, to conference, as well as nominations. Senators \nshould be prepared for full weeks and busy sessions in order to finish \nour work before the Memorial Day recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5051-9", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5051-S5052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished majority \nleader yielding to me. I know he has some remarks he wishes to make. We \nare going to have a cloture vote sometime tomorrow. There is a \npossibility, as there\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\nalways is, that cloture could be invoked, especially if there is the \nability for us to vote on unemployment insurance. We have not \ncompletely vetted that with the caucus.\n  One point that weighs favorably at least on this Senator's mind is \nthat the distinguished majority leader said on more than one occasion \nthat when and if cloture is invoked we would have the opportunity to \ndebate germane amendments. We have a handful of germane amendments. No \none will be trying to use a lot of time, but I think the time on most \nof our germane amendments would be 5 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes--\nnot very much time. So we could do those quickly.\n  One of the concerns--and certainly the majority leader has never done \nthis, and it hasn't been done for a number of years--if it is possible \neven postcloture to cut off people from offering germane amendments. I \nthink the majority leader said on Friday that germane amendments would \nbe allowed. That is a step in the right direction, not only for \ncompleting this bill but for future work in the Senate. It would be a \nbad thing if cloture were invoked, people anticipating they could offer \ntheir germane amendments, and then we go into a 30-hour quorum call. \nThat would not set the right tone.\n  I appreciate the attitude and the remarks of the Senator regarding \nwhat would happen if cloture is invoked. I think that weighs heavily in \nfavor of some people perhaps voting for cloture on this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, again, we will be voting somewhere around \n5:30 p.m. today. We expect formal introduction of the resolution after \nmore discussions over the course of the next several minutes.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to comment on the substance of the \nresolution that will condemn the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib \nprison and the details of the resolution we will talk about later on \nthe Senate floor. It all focuses on the fact that this Nation, our \ncolleagues, this body is shocked, is disturbed, is saddened by the \nincidents that have occurred at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. These \nacts are deplorable. There is absolutely no excuse for what happened to \nthose Iraqi prisoners.\n  The individuals who committed those despicable acts must be and will \nbe held accountable. Justice must be served in a swift manner, in a \nfair manner, and in a transparent manner, and it will be. It is crucial \nthat we get all the facts out quickly and thoroughly, and that is \nunderway--never as quickly as people would like, but everyone, I \nbelieve, in their heart of hearts understands the importance of getting \nthe facts out quickly and thoroughly.\n  I commend the President of the United States for his efforts to reach \nout to the Arab world to address this matter, particularly the \napologies he offered to the victims and their families.\n  I am sure all Americans share his sentiments which he articulated so \nwell. The Senate, too, will do its part to ensure the administration \nfully investigates the abuses at Abu Ghraib. By investigating the \nabuses committed at the prison, we recognize specific individuals are \nresponsible for specific acts. By doing so, we recognize the vast \nmajority of men and women in uniform every day promote the values and \nthe principles we all hold so dear.\n  I would also like to highlight the work of the Department of Defense. \nAfter receiving a report from a concerned soldier, the Department of \nDefense promptly took action to investigate the allegations of abuse. \nThe first investigation was initiated in January. More investigations \nfollowed and many are still ongoing. The military is examining its \npolicy, its procedures, and its training with regard to the handling of \nprisoners and the management of detention facilities. These are the \nright and proper actions to be taken.\n  We do not yet know the full story. That is frustrating. It is \nfrustrating for us in this body and for members of the administration. \nThat investigation is underway. From what people have said, more \ndisturbing stories and pictures will, in fact, find their way into the \npublic domain. I have faith the administration will fully investigate \nthese incidents and will report to us its findings.\n  In the meantime, the Senate will continue to do its duty. We had \nseveral hearings last week. We will continue to maintain a close watch \non the unfolding situation. The appropriate committees of the Senate \nwill fulfill their proper oversight roles. The Intelligence Committee \nand the Armed Services Committee both conducted hearings last week. \nMore are planned, and briefings are at this very moment being \nscheduled.\n  Success in our national security policy depends on regular \ncommunication between the executive branch and Congress and ultimately \nthe American people. I pledge to work with my colleagues and the \nadministration to ascertain the truth and take action to ensure such \nappalling acts will never, ever happen again.\n  America is a nation governed by the rule of law. We hold accountable \nthose who break the law. As the President has said, democracy is not \nperfect and indeed we make mistakes, but openness is a hallmark of that \ndemocracy, and as a democracy we will investigate and we will correct \nthose mistakes.\n  The people of Iraq did not know justice under Saddam. His regime was \nborn in violence and ruled by fear. Let us take this opportunity to \nshow the Iraqi people and the world that America protects the rights of \nindividuals. Let us show the world we can and will administer justice \nswiftly, fairly, and openly. We cannot undo the abuse those Iraqi \nprisoners suffered, but through our actions now we can show the Iraqi \npeople the transgressions of a few do not represent America. They do \nnot represent what we stand for as Americans.\n  Today the Senate will take up a bipartisan resolution which commends \nthe noble work of our forces and condemns in the strongest manner \npossible the few who have disgraced themselves and brought shame to \ntheir fellow Americans. I urge my colleagues to unanimously pass this \nresolution this afternoon. I believe it is imperative that we speak \nwith one voice, united in strength and united in purpose.\n  By passing this resolution, this body will show its resolve to pursue \nthe truth and protect our national security. We will also show the \nworld America believes such acts as occurred at Abu Ghraib must never \nhappen again. Our soldiers are risking their lives in Iraq to bring \npeace and freedom to a country that has known neither. Our service men \nand women have worked tirelessly to build schools, rebuild hospitals, \nrepair electricity grids and water lines, and to ensure food and water \nare available. We have seen innumerable acts of kindness and bravery \nfrom our soldiers on behalf of the Iraqi people. That is who we are and \nthis resolution acknowledges their service.\n  We are engaged in a noble cause. We must see it through. The Iraqi \npeople are depending on us to stay the course and the American people \nare depending on us to show courage, resolve, and leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5052-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5052-S5054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PLAN OF OBSTRUCTIONISM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, like all of my colleagues, I am enormously \nproud to serve in the Senate. It is a unique and special privilege. I \ncome from a small town of 300 people in the southwestern ranching \ncountry of North Dakota. Some of my colleagues come from big towns, \nsome of them from family farms. We come from different parts of America \nto convene here and do public policy. I am enormously proud of this \ninstitution, but there are times when I see what is rancid, partisan, \nbare-knuckle politics played in this town that begin to bother me.\n  I am big enough to understand politics can be tough. I have been in \npolitics a long while and I think most of\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\nmy colleagues understand politics is a tough business, but the Senate \nis different. It does not mean there ought not be politics in the \nSenate, but it means we ought to be reasonably serious about doing good \nthings for our country and creating good public policy.\n  Last week we had a visit to the Senate floor by some colleagues, and \nI noticed an article in the National Journal that said the following: \n``House, Senate Republicans coordinate anti-Daschle message, Pryce''--I \nbelieve this is the chairperson of the Republican Conference in the \nHouse--``acknowledged Wednesday that the respective conferences are \ncoordinating their current message against so-called Democratic \nobstructionism . . .''\n  Today, I want to talk a little bit about this targeting that goes on, \nabout the notion of obstructionism, because we had a discussion last \nweek by one of our colleagues that talks about the ``price for \nobstructionism,'' ``the pain of obstructionism,'' and Democratic \nobstructionism specifically. Then we see this, the anti-Daschle \nobstructionism plan.\n  I will talk about some of this partisanship that boils up and boils \nover. I came to the Congress when Tip O'Neill was Speaker of the House \nand I served in the other body. Bob Michel was minority leader. The two \nof them liked each other. They spent a lot of time together, played \ngolf together, worked together, did good things for America together. \nThat was a different time and a different era. They respected each \nother and worked closely together. In my judgment, that is the way it \nought to be.\n  I might say that changed about in the mid-1980s. My former colleague, \nNewt Gingrich, formed something called GOPAC. This is a letter signed \nby Newt, ``Dear friend,'' and the letter describes his version of \nAmerican politics and says:\n\n       I have also included a new document entitled ``Language: A \n     Key Mechanism of Control,'' drafted by our GOPAC political \n     director.\n\n  The letter then describes the words that should be used to describe \nthe opponent and the words that should be used to describe one's self, \nsigned by Newt Gingrich.\n  Here is what Newt then counseled back in the mid 1980s: When you are \ntalking about your opponents, use words like destroy, sick, pathetic, \nlie, betrayed, incompetent, greed, anti-family, anti-child, anti-flag, \nanti-job, corrupt, shame, disgrace. That is what Newt Gingrich \ncounseled candidates across the country to use when they described \ntheir opponent. He said, by the way, when you describe yourself you \nreally ought to use words, which we have tested, like courage, \nchildren, family, liberty, vision, success.\n  Again, the rancid ignorance of excessive partisanship has its root \nabout two decades ago in GOPAC--my former colleague, Mr. Gingrich, \ndescribing how people ought to play their politics in this country. I \nwouldn't do that in a million years. It ruins the political system, in \nmy judgment.\n  We saw some of that recently in the last campaign for Congress. I had \na colleague in the Senate who left three limbs on the battlefield in \nVietnam. In his campaign, his courage, patriotism, his commitment to \nhis country was questioned--a man who lost three limbs on the \nbattlefield had his patriotism and courage and his commitment to his \ncountry and his country's national security questioned.\n  Now, the standard bearer on the Democratic side of the aisle is a man \nwho has three Purple Hearts, a Silver Star and a Bronze Star, and they \nquestion his patriotism. They question his commitment to our country.\n  Let me talk a little bit about this message last week from those who \nconcoct a political menu that says lets just try to be involved in this \nsearch-and-destroy mission if we can--how House and Senate Republicans \ncoordinate the anti-Daschle message. Let me talk a little about this \n``so-called Democratic obstructionism.''\n  Let me say, no one here--certainly not me--will ever apologize for \ndeciding that our role in selecting people for a lifetime appointment \non the bench is to say no when appropriate. We have said yes over 96 \npercent of the time when the President has sent us the name of a \nFederal judge he wants to sit on the Federal bench for a lifetime. But \non those rare occasions when we say no, we have a constitutional right \nto do so and we will not apologize for keeping bad people off the \nFederal bench.\n  No one on this side of the aisle, I think, is prepared ever to \napologize for opposing bad fiscal policy, the kind of policy that has \nturned the largest budget surpluses in history into the largest Federal \ndeficits in history. You won't hear an apology for not supporting or \nfor trying to stop bad fiscal policy. You will not hear an apology from \nthis side of the aisle.\n  But I want to talk for a moment about this issue of obstruction. \nSenator Daschle doesn't need a defender on the floor of the Senate. His \nactions and his votes defend themselves. So is the case with my \ncolleagues on the floor of the Senate. I respect differences of \nopinion. I think I served with some of the most talented and creative \nmen and women in the Republican and Democratic caucus that I have ever \nhad an opportunity to spend time with. I respect all of them. But let \nme talk for a moment about another kind of obstruction, and that is the \nobstruction of good public policy that ought to change this country for \nthe better but that we can't get through the U.S. Congress because we \nhave people who think they are just a set of human brake pads, that \ntheir sole mission in life is to stop good things from happening.\n  No one here works at the bottom of the economic wage scale. No one \nhere is on minimum wage. No one in the Senate understands what it is \nlike to live on the minimum wage. Yet for 7 years there has not been an \nadjustment in the minimum wage. Yes, there are people who work long \nhours, many of them with two jobs at the minimum wage, trying to raise \na family. Yes, there are people trying to raise a family on the minimum \nwage. They have not had an adjustment in 7 years. We can't get a \nminimum wage increase through this Congress. Why? Because it is \nobstructed by those who control the Congress--the House, the Senate, \nthe Presidency.\n  How about a simple little issue, country-of-origin labeling. We can't \nget that done. You know where your shirt was made; there is a label \nthere. You know where your socks are made. You know where your shoes \nare made. You know where your belt is made. They are all labeled, \nexcept meat. Try to find out where your next piece of beef steak was \nproduced. Did it come from a Mexican plant, Canada, the United States? \nYou don't know.\n\n  By the way, if you want a description of the FDA inspector who \ninspected the Mexican beef, I will give you the description. Then you \nreally ought to want to know where that meat came from. Can you get \nlabeling on meat? No, you can't get it done. Why? Because the \nadministration and the House and the Senate don't want it done. \nObstruction.\n  How about the price of prescription drugs, the reimportation of \nprescription drugs. Why is that not now the law of the land, allowing \nthe market system to work; allowing the American people to buy the less \nexpensive, FDA-approved prescription drug from Canada; allowing the \npeople who are on Lipitor, who pay $1.01 per tablet when they buy it in \nCanada, and for the same tablet, same pill, put in the same bottle, \nmade by the same company, the U.S. consumer pays $1.81 per pill, and \nthey ask the question why should the American public be charged nearly \ndouble for the same pill? Why haven't we fixed that?\n  It is not because we on this side of the aisle haven't pushed and \npushed and pushed. It is because the majority in the House and the \nSenate and the President don't want it. They have obstructed it.\n  How about a highway bill. Last week I heard--in fact, the discussion \non the floor last week about obstructionism on the part of this side of \nthe aisle, and on the part of Senator Daschle, was about the highway \nbill. What a load of nonsense that is. The problem with the highway \nbill is not that anyone here is obstructing anything. We passed a \nhighway bill. It passed with wide bipartisan support in the Senate. The \nreason we don't have a highway bill is because the Republicans--yes, I \nsay Republicans--in the Congress and the Republican in the White House \nwill not and cannot agree on what the number ought to be. So as a \nresult of that, we\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\ndon't have a highway bill, and we have people on the other side of the \naisle come out here and want to blame Senator Daschle for it. What a \nload of nonsense. It is simply not true. We don't have a highway bill \nbecause the majority party that controls the Senate and the House and \nthe Presidency cannot agree and are having this internal feud on how \nbig the bill ought to be, how much we invest in this country's \nhighways.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for 10 additional \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. What about an energy bill. We ought to have an energy \npolicy. You look at the price of gas at the gas pumps these days and \nask yourself, Do we want to continue to be more and more dependent on \nforeign sources of oil? It went from 50 percent to 60 percent. Does \nthat make sense for our country? Our economy will be belly up at some \npoint if, God forbid, terrorists shut off the supply of oil to our \ncountry. Yet we rely on the Saudis, Iraqis, and so many others from \ntroubled parts of the world for our supply of oil. We need an energy \nbill.\n  Don't point at Senator Daschle and don't point at the Democrat Caucus \nwith respect to that issue. That bill failed the Senate by two votes, \nand my colleague, Senator Daschle, voted for it, as did I and others. \nThe reason that bill failed in the Senate by two votes was because the \nmajority leader of the House stuck a provision in it that he was warned \nwould kill that bill, a retroactive waiver for liability for something \ncalled MTBE, a pernicious provision that he knew--he should have known; \nhe was warned--would kill the bill. So they stick in a giveaway \nprovision that kills the bill because it costs them four or five votes \nin the Senate, and then they want to come to the floor and point at the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, as the problem. He is not the \nproblem. The problem is the majority party that controls the House and \nthe Senate and the White House.\n  We need an energy policy. In fact, we should have had the energy bill \nback on the floor of the Senate 2 weeks ago, but we don't control the \nSenate. We don't schedule the Senate.\n\n  Appropriations bills: I am a member of the Appropriations Committee. \nLast year we had to put seven appropriations bills into one big omnibus \nappropriations because we didn't get the appropriations bills done. \nThen in the middle of all that, the appropriations bill, with well over \n$300 billion--smack dab in the middle of that, those of us who were \ntrying to overturn the FCC rules which would allow big broadcasters to \nbecome even bigger, and fewer and fewer people would control what you \nsee, hear, and read in this country--they stuck right in the middle of \nthis big appropriations bill something that upended our attempt to deal \nwith the FCC rules. They stuck, right in the middle of this, something \nthat interrupted the ability to affect the country-of-origin labeling \nfor meat and other food products.\n  I tell you, it is a hollow claim, it seems to me, that there is \nobstructionism from this side of the aisle. It is a hollow claim that \nSenator Daschle is somehow guilty of obstructionism. The obstructionism \non things that would improve this country, public policy dealing with--\nyes, the minimum wage increase, with country-of-origin labeling, with \nan energy bill, with a highway bill that means new jobs and new \ninvestment, with lowering prescription drug prices, with extending \nunemployment benefits to people whose benefits have run out during a \ntime of economic trouble--all of those issues, all of those things \nthat, in my judgment, would make this a better country and would \nimprove things in this country have been stopped.\n  They have been stopped because one party controls the House, the same \nparty controls the Senate, the same party controls the White House, and \nthey have stopped these things dead. It is as simple as that.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said, ``Die when I may, I want it said by those \nwho know me best that I have always plucked a thistle and planted a \nflower where I thought a flower would grow.'' I must say there are \nprecious few thistle pluckers or flower planters these days in this \npolitical system. There are a lot of political flame throwers and those \nwho decide everything they don't like ought to be put at the feet of \nthe minority Caucus in the Senate and the minority leader of the \nSenate, Senator Daschle.\n  The Constitution of this country begins, ``We the people.'' Some in \nthe Senate think the Constitution is a rough draft--something they \nought to change every month, every week. We are apparently going to \nvote on three constitutional amendments very soon in the Senate because \nthat work which occurred over two centuries ago and which has been \namended outside of the Bill of Rights only 17 times needs, according to \nthe majority, to be amended again and again and again. I think that \nConstitution of ours is pretty important. That Constitution provides an \nopportunity for a minority in Congress to stop bad things from \nhappening. But it also empowers the minority to push good public \npolicy.\n  We have as a Caucus offered a substantial amount of good public \npolicy that would improve things in this country, provide hope and \nopportunity, and do what every American would want to have happen; that \nis, leave a country for their children that is better than the country \nthey found when they were born into this great country of ours. All of \nus are lucky to be here and lucky to be here now. There is only one \nplace on this Earth--only one place--named the U.S.A. This big, old \nglobe of ours spins with 6 billion people on it. There is only one \nlocation on this big globe with 6 billion people called the U.S.A. We \nare lucky to be born here and lucky to be born now with all the \nopportunities and all the bounties that are offered to us as Americans. \nBut with those bounties come responsibility. The responsibility is, in \nmy judgment, to work together.\n  I am weary and tired of those who continue to point the finger of \nobstructionism and who continue to organize these ``anti'' messages, \nanti-Daschle, anti-Democrat, anti-this, anti-that. I have no time at \nall for those who, as my former colleague Newt Gingrich did, put out \nword lists to pollute the political process in this country and say to \nthose who aspire to serve in public service the way you ought to refer \nto your opponent is with words like ``sick,'' ``pathetic,'' ``betray,'' \nand ``poison.'' Shame on them. That is not the best this political \nsystem has to offer. John F. Kennedy used to say every mother hopes her \nchild might grow up to be President as long as they do not have to be \nactive in politics. But, of course, politics is the basis for making \npublic decisions in our country. It is an honorable occupation. The \npractice, in the main, is by people who care a great deal about this \ncountry's future.\n  I hope all of us will understand this isn't about trying to figure \nout who is setting up roadblocks and who is obstructing. Let us try to \nsort out between good and bad public policy and then pass the good.\n  Let me say again this message--this organizing for anti-Daschle, \nanti-Democratic Caucus, obstruction message--to those who spend time \ndoing that, this country is at war. This country has an economy that is \nstill troubled. This country needs an energy policy. This country has \nso many needs that require so much attention from all of us. Stop this \nnonsense. Let us decide to work together to make this country work \nbetter for our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5054-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5054-S5056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are in a period of what we call \nmorning business. But we know when we go back to what is referred to as \nthe JOBS bill we will be on the Cantwell amendment which is to extend \nunemployment compensation to workers who have worked hard over the \ncourse of their lives and contributed into the unemployment \ncompensation fund, the fund that today is approximately $14 billion in \nsurplus. The Cantwell amendment is about $5 billion and, if passed, \nwould certainly ensure the funds would be retained in a very robust \nfinancial situation. It would help us address the fact there are 85,000 \nworkers every single week who are losing their unemployment \ncompensation funds. As a result of losing their compensation funds,\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\nthey are hard pressed to pay for their mortgage, to continue to put \nfood on the table, to pay for their utilities, the downpayment on their \nautomobiles, and to continue to try to even be able to survive.\n  Real Americans are hurting in many parts of the country, and it \ndoesn't have to be this way. The Senator from Washington has tried to \nhave this issue addressed in the Senate some 14 times over the period \nof the last 18 months. She was only once successful, and that was in \nFebruary of this last year when a vote that was taken in the Senate \nshowed 58 Members of the Senate agreed with the Senator's position. We \nhave a lot of close votes around here; some are 50-49, and some are 51-\n49. But when we have a vote that is 58-39, that demonstrates a strong \nbipartisan desire by the Members of this body to try to address the \nsituation.\n  It isn't only the Members of this body. There was another vote in the \nHouse of Representatives which was 227-179 for a similar proposal to \nprovide help and assistance to those who are unemployed, who have \nworked hard and paid into the fund. When the unemployment compensation \nfund was established, the very purpose of the unemployment compensation \nfund was to provide in these kinds of circumstances.\n  There are those who say we have seen and are seeing some significant \nchanges in our economy and, therefore, this legislation is not \nnecessary. Let me come back one more moment to address our procedural \nissue.\n  Last week, on Thursday evening, when it finally became possible after \nthe long week for the Senate to consider the Cantwell amendment on the \nunemployment compensation fund, we finally had that matter before the \nSenate. Our Republican leadership rushed to move off the JOBS bill and \nmove into morning business where we have been for the last several days \nbecause they didn't want to address the issue of unemployment \ncompensation. Then we find the situation where the majority leader \nfiles cloture because the Republican leadership does not want to permit \nthe Senate to vote on this kind of help and assistance for workers--\nbasically middle-income families--to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies, even though a broad majority of Republicans and Democrats \nfavor it. They so fear, evidently, taking a vote on the issue of \nunemployment compensation that they say let us close out this \namendment, prohibit Senator Cantwell from getting a vote, prohibit the \nSenate from voting up or down, let's end all debate on the underlying \nbill and cut off any future amendments as well, because under the order \nthey will have to follow the cloture provisions because we do not want \nto risk having the Members of this body vote yea or nay on the issue of \nunemployment compensation.\n  We are getting used to that by the leadership here. We see that \nsimilar technique followed when it comes to overtime, although with the \npersistence of my friend and colleague Senator Harkin, we were able to \nget an overtime vote. We saw an overwhelming majority of the Members of \nthis body send a very clear message to the Bush administration to keep \ntheir hands off overtime payments for American workers.\n  We have been trying to get an increase in the minimum wage for some 7 \nyears, and we have been denied the opportunity to get an up-or-down \nvote and let the Senate speak its will. Clearly, there is a majority in \nthis body who understand it has been 7 years since we provided an \nincrease in the minimum wage. And certainly now is the time when so \nmany of those proud men and women are working on the bottom rung, but, \nnonetheless, working and working hard--men and women, primarily women, \nwomen who have children, and men and women of color who want to be able \nto provide for their families, and this institution denies them an \nopportunity to get an up-or-down vote on minimum wage. They tried to \nensure that we would not have to vote on unemployment compensation, \nthen deny the Senate the opportunity to get a vote on the increase in \nthe minimum wage, try to avoid a vote on overtime--all the issues that \naffect the economic conditions for working families and middle-income \nfamilies in this country.\n\n  As I have said many times, I don't know what these families have done \nto this administration or to the Republican Party that they should \ndeclare war upon them, but that is the result of their policies.\n  I thought I would take a few moments of this time to review where we \nare in terms of the state of our economy because there may be those who \nbelieve because there has been an increase in the total number of jobs \ncreated, even though 40 percent of those created in the last report \nperiod of last week are basically low-income jobs. In the group \nannounced in the earlier quarter, there was virtually no manufacturing \njobs. These was the increase in low-wage jobs and the increase in the \npart-time jobs but not the kind of real growth which this country is \nfamiliar with when we come out of a recovery, which means good jobs, \ngood benefits, good hope for the future, and a sense of hope for those \nworkers and workers' families.\n  These are April figures and do not include the latest of the May \nfigures. In January of 2001, we had 6 million Americans who were \nunemployed. Now we have 8.2 million, 2.2 million more that were \nunemployed than we had 2 years ago.\n  This is one of the most important charts because this shows the long-\nterm employment is nearly triple. Those are the number of workers who \nhave been unemployed for more than 26 weeks. These are record numbers \nfrom recent history of 20 years; 20 years since we have had this number \nof unemployed workers looking for jobs for longer than 26 weeks. \nTherefore, it reflects the fact we have many workers out there looking \nfor jobs; they want to work and they are not able to find the jobs.\n  That is understandable when we have 8.2 million unemployed Americans \nyet we have only 2.9 million job openings, according to the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics. We have all these Americans looking for these jobs.\n  I ask consent that I be allowed to speak as long as I desire to \nspeak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So we have 8.2 million unemployed Americans looking for \nthese job openings. Clearly, they are not going to be able to squeeze \ninto that funnel. It will mean many millions are going to continue to \nbe unemployed.\n  That is what the Cantwell amendment addresses, those unemployed \nAmericans who paid into that fund are losing their unemployment \ninsurance, at the rate of over 85,000 a week.\n  The next chart is interesting because it shows the growth in the last \n3 years. This represents March of this year, and it goes back to March \nof 2001 where we had 3.3 million Americans with part-time jobs who were \nlooking for full-time employment. That was in March of 2001 at the \nstart of this administration. Now that is up to 4.6 million Americans \nin part-time jobs who want to have a full-time job.\n  That is a great leap in terms of the unemployment numbers recently, \nthe great numbers of those have been in the part-time jobs. As we know \nwith part-time jobs, more often than not they do not get the health \ninsurance, they are not given the overtime pay. Obviously, they are \ndenied pensions and they are denied other protections which many full-\ntime workers receive.\n\n  Americans want to work, they will work, but they are not given the \nopportunity to work in our economy, which gets back again to the \nCantwell amendment. If that is the circumstance, why aren't we willing \nto extend the unemployment compensation fund when we know the \nunemployment compensation fund is in surplus?\n  The next chart indicates clearly that 40 percent of the jobs that are \nbeing created are in the low-wage and low-paying industries. This is \nwhat has happened in recent times. Even with the increase in the total \nnumbers of jobs, these are basically low-paying jobs and part-time \njobs. Only a handful of those in the last employment figures would be \nmanufacturing.\n  The next chart shows 43 States still have higher unemployment than \nwhen the recession began. With the exception of the 6 States in yellow, \n43 States still have higher unemployment than when the recession began, \nwhich comes back to the basic rationale for the Cantwell amendment.\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\n  We still have significant unemployment in great parts of this country \nof ours. People just cannot find other work. If that is the condition--\nand it is the condition because this is the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nfigures--then we have to ask ourselves, Why are we cutting off and have \nended effectively providing help and assistance with unemployment \ncompensation? It does not have to be this way.\n  This chart is very instructive because it shows what a different \nadministration did when we had economic challenges. This is in the \nearly 1990s, coming out of the recession of the early 1990s. Under \nPresident Clinton, we saw the spiking of 2.9 million jobs. It took the \nspiking of up to 2.9 million before the administration terminated the \nextended unemployment compensation funds. They were facing significant \nunemployment. With Presidential leadership and with the support of a \nDemocrat House and Senate--that is true; because we did not get a \nsingle Republican vote in the Senate or in the House of \nRepresentatives--President Clinton put that into effect. We had the \nlongest period of economic growth, price stability and job expansion \nthan we have had in the last century. Finally, they cut off the \nunemployment compensation after it reached 2.9 million.\n  We have 2 million still unemployed and this administration has said, \nNo way, to those workers and denied them unemployment compensation.\n  This chart rebuts modern thinking about who is now suffering from the \nunemployment and who is not. The green line represents less than a high \nschool degree and the red line signifies college graduate. It has been \nthe belief that with more education, there is a greater and greater \nopportunity to get a job. Right? Wrong. It does not necessarily follow. \nIt can follow but it does not necessarily follow.\n  Over the period of the last year, we find those with college degrees \nare increasingly those who are affected with unemployment, even more so \nthan those with less than a high school degree which, effectively, \nremains flat.\n  What is happening is higher unemployment is moving into the middle \nincome. This is going to college graduates--not those who just \ncompleted 1 year but those who completed college. The red line on the \nchart indicates they are the ones now who have college degrees. Yet \nthey are increasingly unemployed.\n  I bring back to the Senate this very important chart because it very \nclearly shows what is happening out there in Main Street America to the \nmiddle-income working families in this country.\n  Over the period of the last 5 years, what we have seen--and we are \nlooking now from 2000 to 2004--in the purchasing power of middle-income \nfamilies is their income has gone down 2 percent. But the prices for \ntheir homes or rentals have gone up 17.8 percent; health care, 50 \npercent; tuition for their children, 35 percent; and utilities, 15 \npercent. You talk about the middle income having challenges holding on \nto their economic security, this is what is happening to them. Their \nincome, in terms of purchasing power, has effectively been stable, but \nthe costs which they have had to pay in health insurance, tuition, \nutilities, and home prices, let alone what has been happening in terms \nof their local taxes, have been going up, and they have been feeling \nthe squeeze.\n  Can you imagine families with these kinds of obligations and suddenly \nthey do not have any income at all. The only lifeline they have is the \nunemployment compensation. They have paid into it, and they wonder if \nthey are going to get it. The unemployment fund is in surplus, and the \nRepublican leadership says: No, we are not going to let you have a \nvote.\n  Finally, we should understand this very clearly about what has been \nhappening on Wall Street. With the Wall Street recovery, the corporate \nprofits have gone up in the last 3 years by some 37.5 percent. Yet the \nchange in workers' wages, as this chart shows, is 1.5 percent; \nbasically the same figures we had before.\n  So this is what is happening. There are those who are doing very \nwell, and there are those who are able to go through this period of \ntime and have a great deal of financial security. But not middle-income \nworking families; they have not been able to do so. And this \ninstitution is not helping them. We are not helping them with any kind \nof increase in the minimum wage. We do not help them with the \nunemployment compensation. We do not help them, although we did have a \npositive vote. The administration certainly did not help them on the \nissue of overtime. We have left out 9 million Americans when it comes \nto pensions, which leads me into another issue in terms of health care \ncoverage, which is another issue for us to consider.\n  What the Senator from Washington is attempting to do is to provide at \nleast some temporary relief until the economy gets strong for those \nmillions of Americans who are trying to make it, who worked hard and \npaid into the unemployment compensation fund so they will be able to \nmeet the most basic and fundamental needs of their families.\n  Without this relief, 85,000 American workers a week are losing their \nunemployment compensation. Surely we can do something about it. We have \na surplus fund of in excess of $15 billion. So I would hope we would \ncease the obstruction of the Cantwell amendment and permit us to have a \nvote on the Cantwell amendment. We have had a clear majority of this \nbody that wants to vote in favor of it. Yet we are being obstructed \nfrom being able to do that, as we have been obstructed by the \nRepublican majority on the issue of the increase in the minimum wage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5056-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5056-S5058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEDICARE AND THE UNINSURED\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for many of us, this is ``cover the \nuninsured week,'' but, for the administration, a better title would be \n``ignore the uninsured week.'' Since the day it took office, this \nadministration has ignored the worsening health care crisis that \njeopardizes more and more families. Costs are out of control. The \nnumber of the uninsured is soaring. No family can be sure that the \ninsurance that protects them today will be there for them tomorrow. And \nthe Bush administration remains frozen in the ice of its own \nindifference.\n  The number of people without insurance has grown by four million \nsince President Bush took office--and he has done nothing. Health \ninsurance premiums have skyrocketed by 43 percent--and he has done \nnothing. Prescription drug costs have exploded by 45 percent--and he \nhas done nothing.\n  Every day, employers shift more costs to employers or cancel coverage \naltogether. Every day more families are forced into bankruptcy because \nof high medical bills. And President Bush does nothing.\n  Soaring health costs and declining insurance coverage harms the poor, \nbut they are protected to some extent by Medicaid. It is the \nhardworking middle class who are victimized the most. More than 80 \npercent of the uninsured are in working families. Fourteen million have \nincomes of more than $50,000 a year. Seven million have incomes of more \nthan $75,000 a year. No family is more than one pink slip or one \nemployer decision away from being uninsured.\n  That is wrong. You and I know it is wrong. And the American people \nknow it is wrong. But President Bush refuses to do anything about it.\n  The President has read the polls showing that the American people are \nconcerned about health care, so he pretends that he cares. As in so \nmany areas, he talks the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk. He has \ndone nothing. The steps he has proposed don't even deserve to be called \ntokenism. They actually take us in the wrong direction. They would be \nlaughable, except that the health care crisis is no laughing matter for \nmillions of American families.\n  The President touts new tax breaks for the healthy and wealthy--as if \nthe wealthy haven't already benefitted far too much from this \nadministration's policies. The administration calls for health savings \naccounts--but for millions of Americans who need health care the most, \nthe result will be thousands of dollars in higher premiums, not \nsavings.\n  The administration claims to offer refundable tax credits to help the \nlow-income uninsured buy insurance. But those credits are inadequate to \nbuy real coverage. Far from helping the uninsured, they would actually \ncause millions more to lose the good employer coverage they now enjoy. \nThey are\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\nsuch a low priority for the President that he didn't even provide money \nto fund them in his own budget.\n  The administration is proposing association health plans to lower \ncosts for small business. But these plans are nothing more than a \ngiveaway to trade associations that support the President, and they \nwill raise premiums for more than 20 million workers according to CBO.\n  The administration proposes a Federal cap on medical malpractice \nawards, and calls it cost control. But the idea that you can cut health \ncare costs by denying fair compensation to severely injured patients is \na cruel hoax. Some premiums are $100,000.\n  When it comes to affordable health care for the American people, this \nadministration is all talk and no action. It is compassionate \nconservatism without the compassion. President Bush and the Republican \nCongress won't make the tough decisions to bring costs down. They won't \nstand up to the drug companies that profit enormously from the status \nquo. They won't put the need for health care for American families \nahead of the greed of wealthy campaign contributors. It's time for a \nchange.\n  Our colleague Senator John Kerry is proposing a plan to give health \ncare the top priority it deserves. He believes that secure, affordable \nhealth care for hard-working families is more important than tax breaks \nfor millionaires and billionaires. His plan will provide health \ninsurance coverage for 27 million people nearly two-thirds of the \nuninsured. He will cut costs for every family that pays an insurance \npremium.\n  He will take on the drug companies, so that Americans can enjoy the \nsame fair prices paid by Canadians and Europeans. He will give every \nAmerican--every American--access to the same health care enjoyed by \nmembers of Congress at the same fair price they pay. He will be a \nhealth care President--and that is just what the doctor ordered for \nevery family that needs and deserves quality, affordable health care.\n  Every senior citizen now has health insurance through Medicare. But \nMedicare's guarantee of affordable health care remains unfulfilled, \nbecause Medicare does not cover the high cost of prescription drugs. \nCongress had a chance to provide a decent downpayment on prescription \ndrug coverage last year, but President Bush and the Republican \nleadership hijacked that program.\n\n  The Bush Medicare bill needs to be scrapped and replaced. It is a raw \ndeal for senior citizens and a sweetheart deal for the insurance \nindustry and the pharmaceutical industry. It is a triumph of right-wing \nideology pretending to be positive reform. It is based on a flagrant \ndeception reaching all the way to the top of the White House. The sorry \nstory of this legislation is a prime example of the need for new and \nmore effective leadership in the White House.\n  The Republican Medicare bill lavishes Medicare money on subsidies to \nHMOs and other private insurance plans--$46 billion, according to the \nMedicare actuary. The goal is to undermine Medicare, make it no-\ncompetitive, and force senior citizens to join HMOs.\n  The administration's bill was designed to benefit drug companies and \ninsurance companies, not senior citizens. It is not a serious solution \nto the high cost of prescription drugs. Because of high premiums and \nhigh deductibles, 6 million senior citizens will actually pay more in \npremiums for the drug program than they will receive in benefits. \nAnother 6 million--the poorest of the poor on Medicaid--will actually \nbe forced to pay more for the drugs they need. Three million more \nretirees will lose the good private retirement coverage they now have, \nand will be forced into the inadequate new program. That is 15 million \nsenior citizens who will actually pay more for prescription drugs under \nthis bill than they would pay if the bill had never been enacted.\n  Let me repeat that. Fifteen million senior citizens will actually pay \nmore for prescription drugs than if this bill had never been enacted.\n  Even for those who do benefit from the bill, the benefits are meager. \nOnce your spending for drugs reaches $2,250, you fall into a hole where \nyou receive no benefits at all until you spend $2,800 of your own \nfunds. If you spend $500 a year today, you will pay more in premiums \nthan you get back in benefits. If you spend $1,000, you will still pay \n86 percent of the cost. If you spend $5,000, you will pay 78 percent of \nthe costs. The bottom line is that in paying for the drugs you need, \nyou will be better off on a bus to Canada than you will be under the \nBush bill.\n  A key reason the drug benefits are so inadequate under the Bush bill \nis that it fails to do anything to control the explosive growth in the \ncost of prescription drugs. Drug companies will reap at least $139 \nbillion in windfall profits over the next 8 years. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, drug prices will actually rise faster, not \nmore slowly, as a result of this bill.\n  The Bush bill shouldn't be called the Medicare Prescription Drug \nImprovement Act. It should be called the ``Profits for Drug Companies \nImprovement Act.''\n  The more senior citizens learn about the Medicare bill, the less they \nlike it. The Bush administration has already squandered more than $20 \nmillion of senior citizens' own Medicare money on thinly disguised \npolitical advertisements for the Bush reelection campaign. These \nmisleading and dishonest advertisements are intended to persuade the \nelderly that this lemon of a bill is actually lemonade. But senior \ncitizens aren't accepting those ads, because they don't trust them.\n  Now, the Bush administration is trying yet another disinformation \ncampaign. Our part of the Medicare bill is a provision to license \nprivate companies to use the Medicare seal of approval to peddle \ndiscount cards to senior citizens.\n  The administration is attempting to hype these discount cards to try \nto rehabilitate their failed Medicare bill. But senior citizens \nunderstand that these Medicare discount cards are a phony and \nineffective solution to high drug prices--and every day brings a new \nembarrassment. The $18 million of senior citizens' own money that the \nBush administration is spending to promote this program isn't \npersuading anyone.\n  The administration set up a Web site to help senior citizens choose \nthe cards that offer the biggest discounts in its ridiculously \ncomplicated program. But it turns out that many of the prices posted on \nthe Web site are just plain wrong. The card companies blame the Bush \nadministration, the administration blames the card companies, and \nsenior citizens are left holding the bag.\n  Studies by Families USA and the House Government Reform Committee \nprove what most analysts had said. The cards offer little or no savings \ncompared to discount programs already available to senior citizens. \nSenior citizens will still be paying 50 percent more than Canadians pay \nand 50 percent more than the Government negotiates for the Veteran's \nadministration and other Federal programs.\n  The Bush administration tried to rescue their program with yet \nanother study claiming to show that the cards really were a good deal. \nThey claimed that the earlier study had not made a fair comparison in \nprices. So they prepared a new table and claimed savings ranging from 4 \nto 10 percent.\n  But once again, the administration played fast and loose with the \nfacts. The discount cards don't allow purchase of a 30-day supply of \ndrugs. So the administration took the cost of a 90-day supply, divided \nit by 3 and compared the cost to a 30-day supply already available on \nthe Internet. Once postage and handling costs for three orders are also \nincluded, one discount card offers essentially the same discount, one \ncard is 22 percent more expensive, and two cards offer minimal savings \nof 4 percent and 6 percent, not counting the enrollment fee.\n  Everyone understands that the real issue isn't small discounts from \nalready inflated prices. The real issue is the Bush administration's \nunwillingness to take on the drug companies. It won't allow Americans \nto buy drugs at the much lower prices paid by foreigners. It refuses to \nallow the Government to use the purchasing power of 40 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries to negotiate a fairer price.\n  When the Bush administration first put out its flawed study, they \ninadvertently let the cat out of the bag. They included Canadian prices \nand the Federal Supply Schedule prices of the\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\ndrugs. A few hours later, they released a ``corrected version'' that \nomitted the comparison, but the damage was obvious.\n  Whether the issue is the real cost of their Medicare plan or the \nsavings from their drug cards, the Bush administration has made \ndeception a tactic and distortion a habit.\n  The administration's hype won't fool senior citizens or the American \npeople. It isn't fair for Americans to pay twice as much as foreigners \npay for drugs made in America by American pharmaceutical companies. It \nis not right that the Bush administration is fighting to protect drug \ncompany profits instead of fighting for patients. It doesn't reflect \nAmerican values that legislation designed to protect senior citizens \nshould be turned into a bonanza for powerful Republican campaign \ncontributors.\n  It is wrong for this administration to continually distort the facts \nand deceive senior citizens. We need a president and a Congress who \nwill stand up to the drug companies and insurance companies and stand \nup for senior citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5058-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE PRISONER ABUSE RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to comment about the resolution \nthat will be before the Senate. We will vote on it in a very short \ntime.\n  I support the resolution. The torture and other sadistic abuses of \nprisoners in Iraq have done immense damage already to America's \nreputation in the world, and the worst may be yet to come.\n  Protection of the Iraqi people from the cruelty of Saddam had become \none of the administration's last remaining rationalizations for going \nto war. All of the other trumped-up rationalizations have collapsed. \nSaddam was not on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. He had no \npersuasive link to Al-Qaida. He had nothing to do with 9/11. We have \nfound no weapons of mass destruction.\n  So it is human rights that the administration turned to in order to \njustify its decision to go to war. On December 24, 2003--the day Saddam \nwas captured--President Bush said, ``For the vast majority of Iraqi \ncitizens who wish to live as free men and women, this event brings \nfurther assurance that the torture chambers and the secret police are \ngone forever.''\n  On March 19, 2004, President Bush asked: ``Who would prefer that \nSaddam's torture chambers still be open?''\n  Shamefully, we now learn that Saddam's torture chambers reopened \nunder new management--U.S. management.\n  Every day brings new photos, new horrors from the same prison and the \nsame torture rooms that Saddam used to commit crimes against humanity. \nToday, it's the photo of a naked Iraqi man, his hands clasped behind \nhis head in terror, facing snarling German shepherd dogs held on \nleashes by American soldiers. According to the New Yorker magazine, \nsubsequent photos show the Iraqi man lying on the ground, writhing in \npain, blood flowing from wounds on both his legs.\n  President Bush has presided over America's steepest and deepest fall \nfrom grace in the history of our country. The tragedy unfolding in Iraq \nis the direct result of a colossal failure of leadership.\n  We all agree that the guards and interrogators who committed these \nabuses at Abu Ghraib prison should be held accountable. They should be \nprosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. But the responsibility for \nthese abuses does not lie with them alone.\n  On Friday, the Armed Services Committee held its first public hearing \non the abuses. Secretary Rumsfeld and General Myers came to the hearing \nto tell us what had happened at the prison, but in several instances \ntheir answers were incomplete or misleading.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld testified that the guards at the prison had \nreceived training on detention procedures and had been instructed to \nabide by the Geneva Conventions. Yet in the report on his investigation \nof such abuses last winter, General Taguba found that the soldiers \ninvolved were poorly trained to manage such operations. He found that \nneither the prison camp rules nor the provisions of the Geneva \nConventions were posted in English or in the language of the detainees.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld and General Myers testified that the abuses at the \nprison lasted from October to December 2003. They said that the \nmilitary leadership's first indication of trouble was when a low-\nranking soldier came forward in January 2004.\n  Yet, since the beginning of the war, the International Committee for \nthe Red Cross had provided Pentagon officials with repeated reports of \nabuses at the prison. Some of these abuses, the Red Cross reported, \nwere ``tantamount to torture.''\n  As early as May 2003, the Red Cross had sent Pentagon officials a \nmemorandum describing more than 200 allegations of mistreatment during \nthe capture and interrogation of Iraqi prisoners.\n  In October 2003, the Red Cross inspected the Abu Ghraib prison, \nincluding the unit where the worse abuses at the prison occurred. They \nsaw prisoners being held naked in cells and forced to wear women's \nunderwear. They saw evidence of burns, bruises, and other injuries \nconsistent with the serious abuses that the prisoners had alleged.\n  After this October 2003 inspection, the Red Cross put officials at \nAbu Ghraib prison and at Central Command on notice that they were \nviolating international humanitarian law. Yet October 2003 is when the \nmilitary now says that the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison began, and that \nthey didn't know anything was wrong until 3 months later.\n  Clearly, the military leadership failed to respond properly to the \nreports and recommendations of the Red Cross. During 2003, both the \nState Department and the Coalition Provision Authority repeatedly \nappealed to top military officials to stop the mistreatment of military \ndetainees. Secretary Powell himself raised this issue at cabinet \nmeetings and elsewhere, pleading for proper care and treatment of \ndetainees, but the Defense Department failed to act.\n  The military leadership is also responsible for putting troops in \ncharge of the prison who were not trained to do the job. They assigned \ntoo few soldiers to the prison than were required to do the job right. \nThey relied on civilian contractors to perform military duties, \nincluding the interrogation of Iraqi prisoners.\n  The military leadership failed to respond in a systemic way even \nafter it had initiated 35 criminal investigators into the alleged \nmistreatment of detainees in both Iraq and Afghanistan; 25 of these \ninvestigations involved deaths. In December 2002, military doctors at \nthe Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan ruled that two Afghan men in U.S. \ncustody had died from ``blunt force injuries.'' No one in the military \nhas been held accountable for these homicides.\n  Since 9/11, top officials in the administration have shown an \narrogant disregard for the protections of the Geneva Conventions in \ndealing with detainees. In January 2002, Secretary Rumsfeld was asked \nwhy he believes the Geneva Conventions do not apply to the detainees at \nGuantanamo. He replied that he did not have ``the slightest concern'' \nabout their treatment in light of what had occurred on 9/11. In other \nwords, they are terrorists, and torture is too good for them. The \nBritish magazine The Economist called his remarks ``unworthy of a \nnation which has cherished the rule of law from its very birth.''\n  It is clear that it is not enough for us merely to pass a resolution \ncondemning the abuses. We need a full and independent investigation and \nfully accountability, including a comprehensive review of all detention \nand interrogation policies used by military and intelligence officials \nabroad, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo, and elsewhere. The American \npeople and the Iraqi people deserve answers, and they deserve them \nquickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor not to point fingers or \nmake accusations about the tragedy that occurred in Iraq and continues \nto unfold. So while we are focused on international affairs and what \nmay or may\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\nnot have gone on in the Abu Ghraib prison, what I am going to talk \nabout for a moment is what the average American, taxpaying, consuming, \nvoting public, has experienced this past weekend.\n  They went to the service station in their local community and filled \nup their gas tank with the highest priced gas in the history of this \ncountry. They paid anywhere from $1.84 to over $2.50 a gallon, \ndepending on where one lives. When that credit card or that cash was \nhanded out, that American consumer had paid more for gas at that moment \non that day than ever in the history of this country. Yet this Senate, \nembroiled in Presidential politics at this very moment, fails to deal \nwith this issue.\n  I am amazed that last month the American economy struggled along and \ncreated nearly 300,000 new jobs, and we may well end up the quarter \nwith one of the strongest growth periods in the American economy than \nwe have had in a decade, and yet in all of those struggles, the \nAmerican economy is spending more for energy than ever in the history \nof this country.\n  I have not heard one speech on the floor about blame big oil, and the \nreason I have not is because I think there are a lot of Senators who \nare hiding at this moment or not wanting to address the fact they voted \ndown a national energy policy some months ago and denied the American \nconsumer a progressive Government policy that begins to promote \ninvestment and development in the energy sector of this country.\n  At the close of business on Friday of this past week, the futures for \ncrude oil in some categories went to over $38 a barrel. That will \ntranslate down the road to nearly $3 a gallon at the pump in the United \nStates. I bet I am one of the few who will come to the floor today and \nspeak about the crisis in energy that is draining this economy while \nall of that money flows to the Middle East because we are so focused on \nthe Presidential fingerpointing that is going on at this very moment.\n  Why don't we fingerpoint at ourselves for just a little bit? Why \ndon't we blame big government and big politics at this moment for the \nfailure of the Senate to address and pass a national energy policy for \nthis country?\n  When we talk about growth and we talk about the average American \nfamily's needs, have we told the American family this year they are \ngoing to spend between $400 and $500 more for gasoline than they did a \nyear ago? No, we have not told them that. I am telling them that today \nbecause that is what they are going to spend.\n  They are also going to spend a great deal more for a lot of their \nconsumer goods that are made with petrochemicals. Carpeting in our \nhomes today is synthetic and made as a derivative of the hydrocarbons \nor petroleum. Paint, plastics, all of those kinds of products are \ncritically important to the American consumer, and the base resource \nthat makes them is petroleum. Yet this country has had a ``no \ndevelopment'' policy for well over two decades. We have run around and \nstuck our heads in the sand hoping that somehow we could just get \nthrough this while the world was becoming an ever larger consumer of \nhydrocarbons.\n  We have good conservation policies in place, and we would have better \nconservation policies in place had we passed a national energy policy. \nWe would have pro-production policies in place and we would be sending \nthe economy toward producing once again had we passed a national energy \npolicy.\n  My guess is bids would have gone out for the development of an Alaska \ngas pipeline to bring billions of cubic feet of gas to the lower 48 had \nwe passed a national energy policy.\n\n  We would have the legitimate right to say to the consumer that we \nhave done something for you. Oh, yes, we were asleep at the switch for \na decade fighting over the environment and fighting over the politics \nof who wins and who loses in energy production, but we cannot even say \nthat today. We cannot even say we did the right things.\n  I was doing a radio talk show this morning and somebody said: Isn't \nthis the President's fault? I reminded them that the first priority of \nthe Bush administration when they came to office 3\\1/2\\ years ago was a \nnational energy policy, and while the other side is trying to subpoena \nthe records and pick the books and argue that this was somehow a \nclandestine gathering, what they failed to recognize is the multiple \nrecommendations made by this study group, headed by the Vice President, \nwas early on and was a priority of this administration.\n  We took those recommendations with the work the Energy Committee has \ndone in the Senate, under the leadership of Pete Domenici, and we \ncrafted a national energy policy. It was not about who was a winner and \nwho was a loser. It was about getting this country back into the \nbusiness of production so the American consumer would not have to pay \n$2.50 a gallon at the pump for their gas. But, once again, we got \nembroiled in politics.\n  Somehow winners and losers wanted to be picked by some. Somehow we \ncould not touch the pristine environment of ANWR of Alaska to bring \nthat oil south to the lower 48 and to give us leverage power in the \nworld market to tell the world producers that we were not going to be \nheld hostage by their restrictive production that would drive up \nprices. We did none of that. Even though a majority of the Senate--\nRepublicans and Democrats--voted for a national energy policy, a few \ndragged their feet, we missed that magic number of 60, and a national \nenergy policy did not go forth.\n  What did I tell that phone caller today when he said, Shouldn't we \nblame the President? I said, no, he was the first to lead us. We simply \nwould not follow because, you see, our politics was better or smarter, \nand, in this instance, it might well have been dumber. So blame \nCongress and blame the Senate and check the voting records of your \nindividual Senators to see where they were on the development of a pro-\nproduction, pro-conservation, multiple alternative, new technology \nenergy policy for our country.\n  As the summer goes on, all of our refineries are operating at peak \ncapacity at this moment, but that which they are refining, nearly 60 \npercent is produced by a foreign country, and those foreign countries \nare raking in U.S. gold today in the form of U.S. dollars like they \nnever have before. All of our money flows overseas instead of \ndeveloping in this country and producing jobs and improving our \neconomy.\n  Call your Senator and say: Vote on a national energy policy. It is \nright there in front of you. Quit playing politics with this issue. I \nbelieve the American consumer grows angry that the price they pay at \nthe pumps is the highest price they have ever paid for gas. This time \nthey have only one group to blame, and that is the Congress of the \nUnited States, for failing, at the urging of the President and at the \nurging of consumer groups and all who have studied this issue over the \nyears, they have us to blame because we could not produce a national \nenergy policy for this country. It is big politics and a failing \nSenate.\n  While we continue the debate about the tragedies of Iraq--and we \nshould get to the base of that issue, let's not forget there are other \nissues in this country that are very important to job creation, to the \nlong-term economic stability of our country, and one of those will be \nthe cost of energy and the cost of input into the economy of this great \ncountry.\n  Let's pass a national energy policy. Let's pass the tax incentive \npackage that is within the FISA bill. Let's get at it, Senate, and do \nthe work we were sent here to do and allow this country to get back \ninto the production of energy so we can challenge the world market and \nprovide our consumers with that which they deserve: an abundance of \nreasonably priced energy and a variety of alternatives to pick from in \nthis great marketplace of ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Albert Einstein once advised, everything \nshould be made as simple as possible but not simpler. In other words, \nknow when you have done enough.\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\n  On the JOBS bill that will soon be before the Senate today, we are \nnear time when we have done enough. The Senate has returned to the JOBS \nbill now for the 14th separate day over the course of 5 separate weeks. \nThe Senate has considered 28 separate amendments. It adopted 17 \nseparate amendments. Many of the amendments the Senate considered, such \nas Senator Harkin's amendment on overtime regulations and Senator \nWyden's amendment on trade adjustment assistance, have not been \nstrictly germane to the bill at hand.\n  The modern Senate does not regularly devote such time and freedom of \namendment to major bills. It is really not that normal for the Senate \nto consider every amendment until no other Senator seeks to offer \namendments.\n  My colleagues will remember the Senator from Louisiana, Russell Long. \nSenator Long served as chairman of the Finance Committee from 1965 to \n1981. When Russell Long would bring a major tax bill to the Senate \nfloor, he would frequently file cloture early, just to require that \namendments be germane.\n  With the advent of the budget reconciliation process in 1981, the \nSenate began considering major tax increases in Senate reconciliation \nbills. The reconciliation process, as we know, limits debate to a \nmaximum of 20 hours, pretty much 2 or 3 days, and reconciliation \nrestricts Senators to only germane amendments.\n  In 1996, the Senate began considering tax cuts under the tight rules \nof the reconciliation process. Since then, almost every major tax bill \nhas been a reconciliation bill. This year, a number of Senators sought \nto have this JOBS bill considered in reconciliation. To his credit, the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Chuck Grassley, fought these \nefforts. He and I talked about this several times. He frankly prevailed \non many on his side of the aisle in arguing that this tax bill, the \nFSC/ETI bill, should not be under reconciliation under those very tight \nconditions but should be a regularly considered bill, and he prevailed. \nI commend him for that.\n  Let us now look at this bill. This bill began as a venture of both \nDemocrats and Republicans working together in the Finance Committee. I \nmight add the vote was 19 to 2. Only two members in the committee voted \nagainst this bill, and they were on the other side of the aisle.\n  This bill's major provision, tax cuts for American manufacturing, is \nreally a Democratic priority. Democrats have sought all along to create \nand keep good manufacturing jobs in America. We advanced this priority \nwhen many House Republicans sought to maximize tax breaks for \ninternational businesses or, to put this another way, the Finance \nCommittee decided after consulting with Members on both sides of the \naisle, both Republicans and Democrats, that it made more sense for the \nFSC/ETI placement bill to have a deduction for manufacturing produced \nin the United States rather than the approach taken by the majority \nparty in the other body, which wanted a corporate tax reduction, \ninternational tax reduction bill, not a domestic manufacturing jobs \nbill. So it is a very different approach.\n\n  Again, to his credit, the chairman of the committee, Senator \nGrassley, agreed with Members on both sides of the aisle that the best \nsolution is the Republican and Democratic approach, the bipartisan \napproach, to help create more jobs in America by providing for the 9-\npercent manufacturing deduction. Contrast that with the House majority \napproach, which is much different, and I am quite certain a majority of \nour Members, certainly on this side of the aisle, are against it.\n  When it comes to the question of how much and how long we need to \nfight for amendments on the Senate floor, I think it matters whether we \nare talking about a partisan bill where the majority has closed the \nminority out of the process or are we talking about a bipartisan bill \nwhere Senators have worked together across the aisle. This clearly has \nbeen a bipartisan bill.\n  Our bill advanced the Finance Committee as a cooperative venture. The \nchairman of the Finance Committee and I working together included many \nof the provisions in the bill in response to requests from Senators on \nthis side of the aisle. I daresay many provisions in this bill are in \nresponse to a request by Senators on this side of the aisle, although a \ngood number are in response to Members on the other side of the aisle. \nSo therefore this bill reflects a very open and democratic process.\n  Once we came to the Senate floor, this Senator tried to ensure that \nthe Senate consider the maximum number of amendments, as many as we \npossibly can. Twice before on this bill, I have fought cloture, worked \nagainst cloture, to ensure that the Senate could address, for example, \nSenator Harkin's overtime amendment and others. The Senate did consider \nthat amendment. The Senate adopted that amendment. Over the course of \nlast week's Senate consideration, the chairman of the Finance Committee \nand I have attempted to maximize the number of amendments the Senate \ncould consider, and now the Senate has considered 28 amendments. It \nadopted 17 of those. That, I believe, is a very respectable record.\n  Now, when the Senate appears to be stymied over whether to vote on \nthe amendment of the Senator from Washington on unemployment insurance, \nI continue to work for a vote on that amendment.\n  So here is where we stand: If the majority can see that there is a \nprospect that the Senate will invoke cloture on this bill, then I \nbelieve the majority will allow a vote on the unemployment insurance \namendment; but if the majority sees that Senators on this side of the \naisle are united against cloture, regardless of whether they allow a \nvote on the unemployment issue, then I believe the majority will not \nallow a vote on the unemployment insurance amendment. That is where we \nare. It is that simple.\n  If Democrats want the Senate to vote on unemployment insurance, then \nwe need to show some prospect of bringing this bill to a close. I \nbelieve we should accept that offer to get a vote on the unemployment \ninsurance amendment. To do so, we should support cloture.\n\n  We should acknowledge that we are near the time when we have done \nenough. I say ``near time'' because even after the Senate invokes \ncloture, the Senate may still consider germane amendments. There are \nseveral amendments I believe the Senate will be able to consider \npostcloture. For example, there is the amendment by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. Hollings, to strike the international provisions. \nThere is the amendment by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, on tax \nshelters. There is the amendment by the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, to provide tax benefits to reservists. There are amendments \nby the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, to strike energy tax \nprovisions. There may be other germane amendments. Based on my \nunderstanding of the intention of the two leaders and the two managers, \nI believe that if the Senate invokes cloture, the Senate will work \nthrough these and other germane amendments postcloture. In fact, the \nmajority leader has publicly indicated so.\n  Thus, I do believe we are near time when we have done enough. I \nsupport efforts to get a vote on the unemployment insurance amendment, \nand I support invoking cloture thereafter. So let us make this bill as \ngood as possible but not better. Let us advance this bill to create and \nkeep good manufacturing jobs, especially in America. Let us invoke \ncloture on this bill tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to take a \nfew minutes to discuss the vote that is coming up this afternoon, the \nresolution about the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal.\n  No. 1, I would like to compliment Majority Leader Frist and Senator \nDaschle for bringing this matter up, and the committees and those who \nare\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\ninvolved in drafting the resolution, and allowing it to come to the \nfloor. I think it is important for the Senate to be on record; but, \nmore importantly, that this not just be used or seen as an opportunity \nfor politicians to pile on and talk about the story that is hard to \nwatch or view, that we are all on the right side here in making sure \nthe world understands we condemn this, and it is more about us \nprotecting ourselves politically. I think it is a symbolic gesture, but \nmuch of democracy is symbolism: The idea that an elected body--some say \nthe most prestigious deliberative body in the world, and I can \nunderstand why people would say that about the Senate--would take some \nof its time to have a vote on something that goes to the core of who we \nare as a people.\n  As I travel around and listen to constituents about this prisoner \nabuse scandal, a couple of points are reflected back to me.\n  No. 1, the people there are probably not nice people; they are \ncriminals; maybe terrorists; that other people do worse; let us not be \nso hard on ourselves; and people in a war environment where there is \nmuch stress sometimes overreact. That is all true. But that is not the \npoint. The point is if we use as a standard to govern ourselves the \nshortcomings of a dictatorship, then the big loser is us.\n  I spoke at a graduation this weekend. I said never use the standard \nof someone else's failures to be your benchmark as to how you would \nlike to live your life.\n  We know how bad people treat good people and others. We have seen it \nin history for thousands of years. It was a real part of Saddam \nHussein's regime.\n  The question is, Can we prove to the world and ourselves that good \npeople treat bad people differently? Not only can we, I think we must.\n  There are a lot of Iraqis who are probably not shocked by this \nprisoner abuse scandal nearly as much as we are. In their world, this \nis pretty much the way you do business. A lot worse happened in that \nprison under Saddam Hussein. But what happened there that we know about \nso far is very hard for Americans to understand and digest. That is the \ngood thing. The fact a lot of Iraqis are willing to accept that this is \nusual is not a good thing.\n  What will have to occur for Iraq to make it as a functioning \ndemocracy is people are going to have to change what to expect from \ntheir leaders and their government and those in authority.\n  My question to our Nation is, If we show anything short of disgust \nand condemnation, would we not be reinforcing to those already \ndisheartened Iraqis that you should not have high expectations? Even \nthe Americans, whom we have all heard about and who tout themselves as \nthe good guy, understand how these things can happen.\n  This resolution is a small step forward to prove to the Iraqi people \nand others that you should have high expectations of those who are in \nyour government--those who are given the authority to imprison, to make \narrests and detain. If you start having those high expectations, you \nwill be amazed at how things in Iraq change for the better.\n\n  I have been waiting for a demonstration to occur in Iraq against the \nactivities that led to the death of the four contractors. I am fully \naware if you join us to stabilize Iraq, to be a judge, or a prosecutor, \nor a police chief or the army--any symbol of authority that would bring \nabout a transfer of democracy in Iraq--the insurgents are likely to \ncome after you and your family.\n  It is easy for us to talk about demonstrating and showing disgust \nwhen we are not threatened. But in the history of our Nation, people \nhave put their lives at risk to make us better. In my lifetime, people \nsuch as Dr. Martin Luther King risked their lives to try to make life \nbetter for us all. During the civil rights demonstrations of the 1950s \nand 1960s, the photos of police dogs attacking African-American men and \nwomen shocked us all and it made what segregation is about real.\n  I hope these photos will shock us and make us understand when we fail \nas a people, when our institutions fail, it is OK to apologize. It \ndoesn't make you smaller; it actually makes you larger. It is OK to \nsay, I am sorry. There is a moral imperative, that when we assess \naccountability we do not take anybody off the list because of their \nrank or their status.\n  This resolution today is a small step forward. There will be many \nmore steps to be taken to overcome this prisoner abuse scandal and to \ntransform Iraq into a functioning democracy. But there are voices in \nour country which are vilifying and undercutting the effort.\n  I appeared on a show this Sunday with former NATO Commander General \nWesley Clark, a man who served his country in a variety of roles and \nhonorably served in Vietnam and was wounded. But he said something that \ndisturbed me. It took a while for me to realize the depth of the \nstatement. When asked, Will Iraq be democratic, or the effort to \ntransform Iraq be successful, he said, Less than 50. I will give 2-to-1 \nodds that this operation ends in a catastrophe, for a lack of a better \nword paraphrasing him. It is not good, I believe, to bet against \nourselves, or to put 2-to-1 odds on the ending. People will take that \nwrong and think they are winning when they are really not. Whether Iraq \nbecomes a functioning democracy or something akin to it is not only \npossible, it is a must.\n  There will never be a Mideast without turmoil and hatred until some \ncountries in that region embrace the idea that you can worship God more \nthan one way, that there is a role for women, a meaningful role for \nwomen, and democracy ensures the two things I have mentioned. All \npeople can participate and one's faith is expressed in many ways in a \ndemocracy. Not only is Iraq's transformation to a democracy a \nworthwhile objective, I think we have a moral imperative to accomplish \nthat mission because it goes to the sense of whether we will ever win \nthe war on terror. For every democracy that is formed in the Mideast, \nthere is one less place for Osama bin Laden and his henchmen to be able \nto thrive; they know that. That is why they are fighting so hard and so \nfiercely. The people indigenous to Iraq who do not want a democracy \nunderstand their past association with Saddam Hussein will not be \nrewarded. They want it their way and no other way. They use this \nopportunity to attack us and run America and other people out as a way \nto create a vacuum which they will fill.\n  If that occurs and we fail in Iraq, the big loser will be the next \ngeneration of freedom-loving people all over the world. The \ninternational community is not only essential to transforming Iraq, it \nmust take an active part sooner rather than later.\n  History tells us sometimes the international community is more \nworried about appeasing the problem than solving the problem. Winston \nChurchill virtually stood alone because so many people before him \nbelieved Hitler would be OK if you gave him just one more country. \nPeople like Hitler are never OK with just a little more. They want all \nyou have and then some.\n\n  Osama bin Laden will never be appeased by having part of Iraq or all \nof it. People who think the way he does cannot be dealt with in terms \nthat we understand and live by. That is not to say we need to throw our \nlaw and our values overboard. We need to understand the only thing that \nwill control the Osama bin Ladens of the world is the same thing that \ncontrolled the Hitlers of the world: Good men and women from diverse \nbackgrounds from all over the world coming together and saying, We will \nfight you. We will fight for freedom of religion, diversity in life. If \nyou want to fight, that is the only way this can be resolved, you will \nget a fight.\n  The international community needs to help us yesterday. President \nBush is right: a democratic Iraq is necessary to transform the Middle \nEast as a starting point. President Bush is right: Iraq is a frontline \neffort in the war on terror. It is a place in the past where terrorists \nfelt at home; a place in the past with a leader, Saddam Hussein, who \nfueled money to the Middle East to reward those who wanted to destroy \nthe State of Israel and prevent a two-state solution between Palestine \nand Israel.\n  This resolution could not come at a better time. But it is only a \nsmall first step of many more steps to come. My bet is that it is not 2 \nto 1, it is 100 percent; that if Americans can come together and stop \nthe partisan fighting over this war, having differences of opinion is \nabsolutely appropriate, and the only way a free people can live.\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\n  The Iraqi prison abuse scandal is an opportunity for America to come \ntogether. Regardless of whether you are Republican or Democrat, we see \nthis problem the same. If we work together, we can win. We will work, I \nam 100-percent certain of that. The only person who can defeat us is \nourselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business with a 10-minute time limit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5062-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5062-S5063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, over 6 weeks ago, the Senate minority \ninstituted what resulted in a virtual freeze on the Senate's \nconstitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on the \nPresident's nominees.\n  This is troubling to me for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, I am \nslightly encouraged by the movement on a few executive nominations last \nweek, even though I remain extremely concerned about the current and \ncontinuing freeze on judicial nominations.\n  The last time the Senate confirmed a judge was on March 12, about 2 \nmonths ago. So it is past time for a rollcall.\n  Yesterday, in addition to being Mother's Day, marked the beginning of \nthe fourth year since the President sent to the Senate his first \nnominations to the Federal judiciary. Back on May 9, 2001, President \nBush nominated 11 outstanding individuals to serve on the bench. The \nSenate has confirmed eight of those nominees. One has withdrawn, and \ntwo are still pending.\n  I commend Senator Daschle and other colleagues across the aisle, \nespecially my friend the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, for working with us and the administration in \nconfirming to date 173 of President Bush's judicial nominations. As \nSenator Leahy frequently reminds us, 100 of those nomination \nconfirmations took place during his tenure as Judiciary Committee \nchairman from mid-2001 through 2002.\n  But more work can and needs to be done so that the American public \ncan enjoy the benefits of a more fully staffed Judiciary. \nUnfortunately, the old saying, ``justice delayed is justice denied'' is \ntrue. The Senate needs to consider the judges on the calendar and give \neach one an up-or-down vote, as the Constitution requires. At present, \nthere are 32 nominations for our district and circuit courts pending \nbefore the full Senate. Among this group are 22 men and 10 women. This \nis an outstanding group of candidates with diverse backgrounds. These \ncandidates include a number of impressive minority candidates such as \nJustice Janice Rogers-Brown of the California Supreme Court, who has \nbeen nominated to serve on the influential Circuit Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia.\n  The nominees being held in limbo are highly qualified. Each and every \none of them deserves the consideration of the full Senate. They include \nsitting State supreme court justices, State and Federal trial judges, \nand distinguished members of the bar. Many have served as judicial \nclerks in our Federal trial and appellate courts and in the Supreme \nCourt. Others have served at the highest levels of all three branches \nof Government. All have distinguished academic records. Twenty-four of \nthese nominees received a Well Qualified rating from the American Bar \nAssociation. Fourteen of those Well Qualified ratings were unanimous.\n  While I do not take the position that the ABA ratings are or should \nbe dispositive on judicial nominations, let me remind my colleagues \nwhat a Well Qualified rating means. According to guidelines published \nby the American Bar Association, standing committee on Federal \njudiciary:\n\n       To merit a rating of ``well qualified,'' the nominee must \n     be at the top of the legal profession in his or her legal \n     community, have outstanding legal ability, breadth of \n     experience, the highest reputation for integrity, and either \n     have demonstrated, or exhibited the capacity for, judicial \n     temperament.\n\n  This rating accurately describes the nominees before the Senate. When \nvotes are held, I believe we will find there is bipartisan support for \nall of the nominees pending before the Senate. Even those who have been \npreviously filibustered have received an affirmative vote of support by \na majority of the Senate and have supporters across the political \nspectrum. Yet they are being held up, for the first time in this \ncountry's history, by filibusters.\n\n  As further evidence of the qualifications and support of the \nnominees, I note that 22 nominees were reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee without a single negative vote. Eighteen district judges were \nreported by voice vote and with no announced opposition. Four circuit \nnominees received a 19-to-0 Judiciary Committee vote. I see no reason \nall cannot expeditiously be acted on by the Senate. That means all of \nthe 22 Judiciary Committee consensus nominees by voice vote or by \nunanimous consent, and the others, as well.\n  I have been troubled by the practice in this Congress of demanding \ntime-consuming rollcall votes on nominees who pass unanimously or \nnearly unanimously. I understand these positions are lifetime \nappointments, but the Senate acts on many extremely important matters \nby unanimous consent or by voice vote. I have been told that last year \nalone we took about twice as many rollcall votes on unopposed judicial \nnominees than in 8 years under President Clinton. That is just last \nyear.\n  Like every other Senator, I took an oath to defend and support the \nConstitution. Every Senator has his or her view on how that \nresponsibility is to be exercised with respect to acting on judicial \nnominees. In my view, the Constitution requires the Senate provide its \nadvice and consent regarding the judicial nominees.\n  Fulfilling my oath means I have a stake in seeing that happen. As \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have a special role in working \nwith the leadership in seeing the nominees, once reported from the \ncommittee, are brought up for floor action. Vote up or down, but just \nvote. Every judicial nominee who reaches the Senate floor is entitled \nto an up-or-down vote.\n  I am hopeful the votes will be held on all judicial nominees \npresently on the Executive Calendar, as well as for nominees who may \nyet be reported this year by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Now, I intend for my remarks today to bring us closer together on \nconsidering nominations in the Senate. While I will not fully discuss \nthis matter today, I will note I am not persuaded by arguments that \nsuggest that President Bush's exercise of his constitutional \nprerogative to make recess appointments somehow justifies this current \nfreeze on nominations. Absent the refusal to allow the simple up-or-\ndown vote on judicial nominees that article II, section 2, clause 2 of \nthe Constitution requires, the recess appointments would not have been \nmade in the first place.\n  I am mindful that my colleagues across the aisle have also expressed \nan interest in seeing that minority party nominees to bipartisan boards \nand commissions be acted upon. For the last several weeks, I have \npublicly stated on a number of occasions that I understand this concern \nand that I would support qualified Democratic nominees such as Jon \nLeibowitz, a former Judiciary Committee staffer of Senator Kohl, to \nserve as a Commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission. Likewise, I am \npleased that the White House is considering a particular Democratic \nattorney, also a former Judiciary Committee staffer, to serve on the \nFederal Sentencing Commission.\n  I hope that significant and mutually satisfactory progress can be \nmade on judges and other nominees. I hope such progress will be made. I \nknow from my experience in this body if we work together we can usually \nfind solutions to these matters, even in an election year.\n  Senator Leahy and I and other members of the Judiciary Committee have \nworked hard on nominations, even as we faced other difficult issues in \nthe committee this year.\n  I know Senator Frist and Senator Daschle are working hard with the \nadministration, and I wish them well. I simply implore them--each and \nevery one of them--to accelerate the pace of these discussions. But I \nmust also state I believe the time for discussions, negotiations, and \ntalk is drawing to a close. At some point, the Senate must do its sworn \nduty and vote up or down on judicial nominations. That is just right. \nIt is the right thing to do.\n  The time for action is quickly coming upon us. Some believe that \npoint\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\nhas already passed. To do otherwise is unfair to this institution, \nunfair to the nominees, unfair to the President, and, most importantly, \nunfair to the American public who entrusted us with the responsibility \nto conduct the public business.\n  Madam President, we can and should do a better job of considering \njudicial nominees on the Senate floor. I stand ready and willing to \ncontinue to work with all of my colleagues and the administration on \nthis important matter.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5063-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5063-S5064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in Reno, this weekend, the price of a \ngallon of unleaded gasoline was $2.22. Premium gasoline costs more than \nthat. The higher blend fuels in Nevada cost about $2.50 a gallon.\n  My friend and neighbor from the State of Idaho, the senior Senator \nfrom the State of Idaho, was in the Chamber a few minutes ago talking \nabout the fact that if we pass the energy bill that had previously been \non the Senate floor, and the one that came back from conference, we \nwould have all of our energy problems resolved. I want to disabuse \nanyone within the sound of my voice, that simply is not factual.\n  That energy bill was a bad bill. It did nothing to help the cost of \ngasoline. The thing it would do is give the industry just what it \nwants, billions of dollars in the form of subsidies and tax breaks, \nwith no real conservation requirements.\n  We want an energy bill. We, the minority, want an energy bill. But we \nwant an energy bill that will diversify our energy supply, reduce our \nNation's dependence on foreign oil, and protect the environment.\n  The one thing the bill did not have in it that came back from \nconference was ANWR. That was at least something of which we were able \nto convince people of good will around here: The fact that the United \nStates has, at its fingertips, less than 3 percent of the oil reserves \nof the world, recognizing that we cannot drill our way out of our \nproblems. And that includes the oil that is supposedly in the ground in \nAlaska. We cannot produce our way out of our problems. Almost 97 \npercent of the oil reserves in the world are someplace else. So we have \nto do things that are smart and not only look to the short term but to \nthe long term.\n  There is no doubt that the price of crude has contributed to the \nhigher gasoline prices in Nevada and throughout the rest of the country \nthese last few years. But the outrageous 55-cent-per-gallon increase in \nNevada, since January, has not been driven by the rising cost of crude \noil only, but I believe by corporate greed and profit. These oil \ncompanies and refiners are getting rich, and middle-class families are \ngetting gouged.\n  The stalled energy bill will do nothing to reduce the high price of \ngasoline because it fails to either improve regulations on an oil \nindustry that is over-concentrated or rein in demand by adopting \ntougher fuel economy standards. Instead, the legislation proposes just \nwhat the industry wants--I repeat, giving billions of taxpayers' \ndollars to large oil companies in the form of subsidies and tax breaks, \nwith no conservation requirement whatsoever.\n  The Bush administration's own analysis concludes that the legislative \nincentives to reduce our reliance on foreign oil in the bill will have \nonly a negligible success. The administration report concludes that \nimplementation of the energy bill would reduce net petroleum imports by \nabout 1.2 percent in 21 years--a reduction hardly worth the billions of \ndollars taxpayers would give away to the oil companies.\n  We must also pressure the Saudis to increase production instead of \ncutting it back by a million barrels per day. I have said on this floor \npreviously that Saudi Arabia and the OPEC nations can do a great deal \nto relieve the problems we have. They are our allies. That is something \nthat I am not too sure exists. It is a one-way street with them. But I \nwas pleased to hear that Saudi Arabia has said they will recommend at \nthe next OPEC nations meeting to increase production by at least 1.5 \nmillion barrels a day. That is nice because they just cut back \nproduction by a million barrels of oil a day.\n  We need to be releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to \ndrive down prices. We have to stop putting extra oil in the Reserve, \nfor which we are paying an arm and a leg.\n\n  In terms of meeting the Nation's energy needs, we should increase the \nuse of alternative fuels and renewable energy resources. That is the \nthing we can do to take a bite out of big oil. We can rely more on the \nSun, the wind, geothermal, even biomass.\n  So I was encouraged that in the FSC bill the Finance Committee put in \nenergy incentives, including the section 45 production tax credits for \nrenewable energy. That will allow us to use the things that are \nrenewable like the Sun, wind, and, of course, geothermal heat.\n  So I applaud Senators Grassley and Baucus for having this section 45 \nproduction tax credit for renewable energy resources that expands and \nextends the credit for these issues that I have talked about, these \nrenewable resources.\n  Renewable energy will protect consumers and create jobs. It is \nimportant to stop declaring our energy independence when that is not \nthe case. I do not think it serves any purpose to come out and talk \nabout how great this bill is that failed. If it were that great, it \nwould not have failed. It is a bill that does nothing to solve the \nenergy needs of this country.\n  One of the big issues in that bill, of course, was the fact that this \nsubstitute fuel that had been manufactured around the country, MTBE--\nwhat the bill proposed is that you just simply forget the fact that \ncompanies that used MTBE polluted the ground, and that people have \nsuffered from it.\n  No one knows of a better example of that than what took place in \nUtah, Nevada, and California. MTBE polluted the water systems there. \nThese companies have had to respond in damages as a result of \nlitigation filed by the water entities in that area. So what this bill \nwould have done is taken away the right of these entities, such as in \nthe Lake Tahoe area, to seek recourse for the damages caused by these \nchemicals to the water supply.\n  So the bill that was before the Senate, and the conference report \nthat was defeated, was a bad bill. It was a bill that was a sop to the \ncar manufacturers and the oil companies. That bill would have done \nnothing to solve the energy problems of this country.\n\n  The legislation we will be asked to work on this week, the FSC/ETI \nbill, has something that will help the long-term needs of the country. \nI hope we don't become righteously indignant as my friend did--for whom \nI have the greatest respect. He is a fine man, and we have worked \ntogether on a number of issues dealing with western land problems. The \nfact is, passing the bill that came before us, that was defeated \nbecause there weren't enough votes to go forward on the conference \nreport, was some of the best action the Senate has ever taken. If we \nwant to respond to the energy needs of the country, we need to do \nthings that really help the consumers and not big oil and big auto \nmanufacturers.\n  I was stunned to learn that New Yorker magazine has come out today \nwith a story by a man named Hirsch that talks about some of the things \ngoing on in the torture chambers in Iraq, not the torture chambers that \nwere there and run by Saddam Hussein but torture chambers that were \nthere--I am embarrassed, humiliated, and disappointed to say--and were \nrun by Americans. He talked about the story on public radio today, and \nthis is a message that I understand and I think all Americans have to \nunderstand: We can't have a few enlisted people, as we refer to them--\nno longer draftees; everyone is enlisted--nonofficers, take the fall \nfor what went on there. He talked about the reason pictures were taken, \nboth the videos and stills.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. They were going to be used to show the prisoners' families \nand neighborhoods. That is why they\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\nwere produced. This was not something that was done by some soldiers \njust trying to do something to pass the time of day; the people who \nwere in the officers corps instructed these men and women that they \nwere to take these pictures and what they were to be used for in the \nfuture. I know some of these nonofficers did things that were wrong, \nand I am so grateful there were people in the military who came forward \nand said enough is enough. That is the reason we know about it now. But \nlet's not have a few of the nonofficers be the scapegoats for what went \non.\n  We are a mighty nation. We have to respond accordingly. We cannot \nallow a few underlings to take the fall for what obviously was a \nconcerted action that officers were involved in. It is just a question \nof how high up in the officers corps the problem went.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the Senate floor with a heavy \nheart. As so many other Americans, I am horrified at the graphic images \nof American soldiers abusing Iraqi soldiers and prisoners. We are in a \nsituation today where our troops in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan \nhave performed millions of acts of kindness and good will and bravery \nwhich, sadly, have been overshadowed by the recently disclosed \nphotographs. That is a reality.\n  The war in Iraq is more dangerous today because of the scandal at the \nAbu Ghraib prison, and our standing in the world is being challenged. A \nnation which believes in the rule of law and democracy must demonstrate \nthat in its own conduct. Our conduct is being called into question.\n  I am very concerned that we have reached this point. I am concerned \nthat statements from the Bush administration, sadly, over the last 2 \nyears have sent a message that we were prepared to bend some of the \ntime-honored rules and standards when it came to the treatment of \nprisoners of war. Over 2000 years ago, the Roman orator Cicero said: \nLaws are silent in time of war.\n  In modern times, we have rejected this proposition. Some voices are \nnow calling on us to turn back the clock, but we can't do that. That is \nnot America. That is not what we are all about. Our great country was \nfounded by people fleeing governmental repression. Our founders wanted \nto ensure that the United States would not oppress its citizens even \nduring time of war, and that is why they included a prohibition on \ncruel and unusual punishment in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.\n  After World War II, the United States and our allies, horrified by \nthe genocidal practices of Nazi Germany, created a new international \nlegal order based on respect for human rights. One of the fundamental \ntenets was a universal prohibition on torture and ill treatment. Each \nyear Amnesty International and even our State Department issue report \ncards on countries around the world as to whether they are living up to \nthat standard. Imagine what that report will look like the next time it \nis issued by our own Department of State.\n  In light of the horrific abuses that have come to light in recent \nweeks, we ought to take a moment to review the legal order that was \ncreated after World War II. International law absolutely prohibits \ntorture as well as ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.'' The \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights states unequivocally:\n\n       No one shall be subject to torture or cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading treatment or punishment.\n\n  The United States, with a majority of countries in the world, is a \nparty to two treaties that contain absolute bans on torture, cruel and \ninhuman degrading treatment: The International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights and the Convention against Torture.\n  The Geneva Conventions govern the status and treatment of those in a \nwartime detainee situation. The U.S. Government has long held that as a \nparty to the conventions, we are legally bound by its terms. The Geneva \nConventions make clear that there are no exceptions to this prohibition \nagainst torture and such treatment during armed conflict.\n  Article 13 of the Geneva Conventions says: Prisoners of war must at \nall times be humanely treated. Prisoners of war must at all times be \nprotected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and \nagainst insults and public curiosity. Measures of reprisal against \nprisoners of war are prohibited.\n  Article 14 of the Conventions states: Prisoners of war are entitled \nin all circumstances to respect for their persons and their honor.\n  Article 17 states: No physical or mental torture, nor any form of \ncoercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them \ninformation of any kind whatsoever. Prisoners of war who refuse to \nanswer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant or \ndisadvantageous treatment of any kind.\n  The United States of America is a signatory to this international \nagreement. Army regulations implementing those provisions repeat these \nstandards and make it clear that they apply to the men and women in \nuniform.\n  International law, U.S. law, and Army regulations speak clearly. \nNonetheless, as we have learned in recent weeks, abuses took place at \nAbu Ghraib prison that clearly violate these standards. To quote army \nMG Antonio Taguba's report:\n\n       Between October and December 2003, at the Abu Ghraib \n     Confinement Facility, numerous incidents of sadistic, \n     blatant, and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted upon \n     several detainees. This systemic and illegal abuse of \n     detainees was intentionally perpetrated.\n\n  The report describes ``the intentional abuse of detainees by military \npolice personnel,'' including ``punching, slapping, and kicking \ndetainees,'' ``using military working dogs, without muzzles, to \nintimidate and frighten detainees, and in at least one case biting and \nseverely injuring a detainee,'' ``breaking chemical lights and pouring \nthe phosphoric liquid on detainees,'' ``threatening detainees with a \ncharged 9m pistol,'' ``beating detainees with a broom handle and a \nchair,'' and ``sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light.''\n  Importantly, the Taguba report concludes that the military police \nwere not trained or put on notice in other ways that these kinds of \nabuses were impermissible and would not be tolerated.\n  Let me say, before I read on, that you would know by human instinct \nthat the things I have just read were wrong. You should know at the \nmoment such an order is given that it is an unlawful order. But the \nfact is, when General Taguba looked into the background and training of \nthese soldiers, little or nothing was done to prepare them for their \nassignment.\n  I will read further from the Taguba report:\n\n       Neither the camp rules nor the provisions of the Geneva \n     Conventions are posted in English or in the language of the \n     detainees at any of the detention facilities . . . There is a \n     general lack of knowledge, implementation, and emphasis of \n     basic legal, regulatory, doctrinal, and command requirements \n     . . . I find that the 800th MP Brigade was not adequately \n     trained for a mission that included operating a prison or \n     penal institution at Abu Ghraib Prison Complex.\n\n   Unfortunately, the abuses in Iraq are, in some ways, the logical \nbyproduct of the administrations's policies. In the aftermath of 9/11, \nthe Bush administration made it clear that they believed that \ninternational legal order,\n\n[[Page S5065]]\n\nwhich served us so well during the cold war, was not good enough for \nthe war on terrorism.\n   The administration has created a secret detention system, outside \nthe strictures of domestic and international law, that stretches from \nNorfolk, VA, and Charleston, SC, where American citizens Jose Padilla \nand Yasser Hamdi are detained as enemy combatants, to Guantanamo Bay, \nwhere hundreds have been detained since the commencement of hostilities \nin Afghanistan. The administration denies public access to these \ndetainees and asserts that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to the \nwar on terrorism.\n   A Washington Post editorial entitled ``System of Abuse'' alleges:\n\n       Similar mistreatment of prisoners held by U.S. military or \n     intelligence forces abroad has been reported since the \n     beginning of the war on terrorism. A pattern of arrogant \n     disregard for the protections of the Geneva Conventions or \n     any other legal procedure has been set from the top, by Mr. \n     Rumsfeld and senior U.S. commanders.\n\n   Some of the most flagrant legal violations have taken place at \nGuantanamo Bay. The administration claims that the detainees are not \nentitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions, though they may \nbe treated in accordance with some provisions of the conventions ``to \nthe extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity.''\n   There is no room for hairsplitting when it comes to the law. This \nkind of policy sends a signal to lower ranking officials that the law \nis an obstacle to be overcome, not a bright line that cannot be \ncrossed.\n   Contrary to this position, the Geneva Conventions protect all \ncaptured combatants and civilians. The official commentary on the \nconventions explains: ``There is no intermediate status; nobody in \nenemy hands can fall outside the law.''\n  The Geneva Conventions do not allow the hairsplitting which this \nadministration has engaged in at Guantanamo and other places where \nthere are detainees in this war on terrorism.\n  Administration officials claim that none of the Guantanamo detainees \nqualify as POWs. However, under article 5 of the 3rd Geneva Convention, \ncaptured combatants are presumed to be POWs, and must be treated as \nsuch, unless and until determined otherwise by a competent tribunal in \nan individualized proceeding. The U.S. Government has long abided by \nthis principle, e.g., the U.S. convened more than 1,000 such \nproceedings during the gulf war. Military regulations state, ``When \ndoubt exists as to whether captured enemy personnel warrant POW status, \nArt. 5 Tribunals must be convened.''\n  The Red Cross, which typically refrains from public comment on its \nvisits to wartime detainees, has taken the unusual step of criticizing \nthe Guantanamo Bay detentions. They said:\n\n       The [Red Cross's] main concern today is that the U.S. \n     authorities have placed the internees in Guantanamo beyond \n     the law. This means that, after more than eighteen months of \n     captivity, the internees still have no idea about their fate, \n     and no means of recourse through any legal mechanism.\n\n  Since 9/11, there have been persistent reports that U.S. \ninterrogators have used interrogation tactics that may rise to the \nlevel of torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.\n  For example, a December 5, 2002, story in The Washington Post \nreported on the widespread allegations that the United States was using \nso-called ``stress and duress'' techniques, including sleep, food, \nwater, or sensory deprivation, and forcing detainees into uncomfortable \nor painful physical positions.\n  According to The Post, an unnamed administration official said, ``If \nyou don't violate someone's human rights some of the time, you probably \naren't doing your job. I don't think we want to be promoting a view of \nzero tolerance on this.''\n  The use of these techniques, which are also known as ``torture \nlite,'' violates prohibitions on torture and cruel, inhuman, and \ndegrading treatment. The State Department has repeatedly characterized \nthe use of such tactics by other countries as torture, plain and \nsimple.\n  Our own State Department has accused other countries that have tried \nto rationalize this treatment as being engaged in torture.\n  In Israel, a country that has grappled with terrorism for decades, \nthe Supreme Court held that ``stress and duress'' techniques \ninterrogation techniques violate international law and are absolutely \nprohibited. As the Court explained:\n\n       These prohibitions are ``absolute.'' There are no \n     exceptions to them and there is no room for balancing. Indeed \n     violence directed at a suspect's body or spirit does not \n     constitute a reasonable investigation practice.\n\n  Guantanamo interrogators have reportedly used these tactics. There is \na disturbing link between Guantanamo and the abuses in Iraq. MG. \nGeoffrey Miller was the commander of the Guantanamo Bay detention \nfacility. In late 2002, Miller reportedly asked the Pentagon to approve \nthe use of some ``stress and duress'' techniques. In April 2003, the \nPentagon approved the use of these techniques.\n  The Defense Department's general counsel was involved in creating \nguidelines. That is an important element for us to consider regarding \nthe nomination before us today.\n  In August 2003, Miller, the Guantanamo commander, visited Abu Ghraib \nprison to examine interrogation practices there. According the Taguba \nreport, Miller recommended that military police, who were serving as \nprison guards, become ``actively engaged in setting the conditions for \nsuccessful exploitation of internees.'' The Taguba report criticized \nMiller's recommendation which the report said would violate Army \nregulations and ``clearly run counter to the smooth operation of a \ndetention facility.''\n  There is another key player who Congress need to question closely, \nWilliam Haynes, who is the Defense Department's general counsel. As the \ntop lawyer at the Pentagon, Haynes was intimately involved in crafting \nthe legal standards for the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq, \nincluding the guidance regarding ``torture lite.''\n  Last year, President Bush nominated Mr. Haynes to be a judge on the \n4th Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land.\n  When Haynes was nominated, I and many of my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee were already very concerned about the Defense \nDepartment's legal policies related to the war on terrorism and the war \non Iraq. So, we questioned Haynes closely.\n  Following his hearing, I sent Haynes a number of written questions. \nHe failed to respond to some of my questions and many of the answers he \ndid provide were not responsive. He answered several questions by \nciting government briefs. He refused to respond to other questions \nbecause he ``may or may not have been called to provide advice'' on the \nsubject in his official capacity.\n  I sent a followup letter to Mr. Haynes, expressing concern about his \nnonresponsiveness and giving him another opportunity to respond to my \nquestions related to torture of detainees and internees, and POWs.\n  His second set of answers was not much better than the first and he \nstill failed to respond to many of the questions I asked. Let me offer \na couple of examples.\n  I asked Mr. Haynes about views he expressed in a speech to the \nFederalist Society. Speaking about the detention of enemy combatants, \nhe said: ``Congress specifically authorized the President not only to \nuse deadly force, but also an lesser force needed to capture and detain \nenemy combatants to prevent them from engaging in continued hostilities \nagainst the United States.'' I asked him:\n\n       Do you believe that the Executive could use deadly force \n     against an American citizen enemy combatant in the United \n     States instead of apprehending him or her? If yes, please \n     explain. If no, how do you explain your statement quoted \n     above?\n\n  In his first set of answers, Mr. Haynes responded by simply citing to \na government brief, ``The Government's position concerning the \nstatutory authorization of September 18, 2001 has been most recently \narticulated in its brief filed in opposition to petition for the writ \nof certiorari in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.''\n  I asked Haynes for a more responsive answer.\n  Keep in mind he is the general counsel for the Department of Defense \nresponsible for establishing the legal standards under the Geneva \nConventions and American law and military regulations on the treatment \nof prisoners and detainees.\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\n  I am asking him specifically to tell me the standards he used. These \nquestions were sent to Mr. Haynes months before the scandal at Abu \nGhraib prison. He continued to be evasive. He again cited a Government \nbrief instead of explaining his views. He carefully avoided answering \ndirectly any of the questions which I asked him.\n  I asked Mr. Haynes about the failure to provide article 5 tribunals \nto detainees at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. Government has long abided by \nthis practice and U.S. military regulations provide detailed procedures \nfor article 5 tribunals.\n  I asked Mr. Haynes:\n\n       Have the detainees been provided with the process outlined \n     in [U.S. military] regulations?\n\n  He responded by asserting the screening process for detainees ``goes \nwell beyond what article 5 requires.'' But he did not respond to my \nquestion:\n\n       Have the detainees been provided with the process outlined \n     in U.S. military regulations?\n\n  He failed to respond. That, unfortunately, is the pattern we have \nseen with Mr. Haynes and this nomination.\n  These questions sent by Members of the Senate to nominees are more \nthan an academic exercise. We want to establish for the record exactly \nthe role Mr. Haynes and others played, if any, in establishing the \ninterrogation tactics and techniques which have now been dramatized so \nnegatively to the world.\n  Mr. Haynes cannot expect the vote of this Senate to the second \nhighest court of the land by being evasive on this critical issue at \nthis important moment in our history.\n  Torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment are wrong, \nillegal, un-American, and totally counterproductive in the field of \nintelligence.\n  As the Israeli Supreme Court reminded us:\n\n       Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied \n     behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand. \n     Preserving the Rule of Law and recognition of an individual's \n     liberty constitutes an important component in its \n     understanding of security. At the end of the day, they \n     strengthen its spirit and its strength and allow it to \n     overcome its difficulties.\n\n  Those inspiring words come from the Supreme Court of the Nation of \nIsrael, a nation which battles terrorism every day. They have rejected \nthe easy way out, torture ``lite,'' stress and duress. They have \ndecided that does not make them any safer as a nation, and it degrades \ntheir reputation in the world community. The United States can do no \nless.\n  Since the horrific terrorist attacks on 9/11, our commitment to this \nprinciple and values has been tested. As we withstand repeated warnings \nof possible terrorist attacks, we may be tempted by the notion that \ntorture is somehow justified, but it is not. We must resist the \ntemptation.\n  In his classic novel ``The Brothers Karamazov,'' Dostoevsky posed the \nquestion eloquently:\n\n       Imagine that it is you yourself who are erecting the \n     edifice of human destiny with the aim of making men happy in \n     the end, of giving them peace and contentment at last, but \n     that to do that it is absolutely necessary, and indeed quite \n     inevitable, to torture to death only one tiny creature, the \n     little girl who beat her breast with her little fist, and to \n     found the edifice on her unavenged tears--would you consent \n     to be the architect on those conditions?\n\n  No, America must not engage in torture and cruel, inhuman, and \ndegrading treatment. Torture is wrong. We have said that unequivocally \nfor 50 or 60 years. It is one of the values and principles that guides \nour Nation.\n  As Thomas Paine said:\n\n       He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even \n     his enemy from oppression.\n\n  Torture is an ineffective counterterrorism tactic. It produces \nunreliable information. When our Government engages in these kinds of \nabuses, we project a negative image abroad, creating anti-American \nsentiment around the world that is virtually impossible for us to deal \nwith. If we engage in this sort of activity, we run the risk of \nsubjecting our men and women in uniform and other American citizens not \nonly to a dangerous wartime situation but to torture themselves if they \nare ever detained or captured.\n  Our Nation has been a beacon for democratizing forces around the \nworld as they challenge repression and human rights violations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. We extend whatever time the Senator from Illinois needs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, our Nation has been a beacon for \ndemocratizing forces around the world as they challenge repression and \nhuman rights violations. The American exemplar inspired many to shed \nthe yoke of communism and move toward democracy. In an era where we \nhave emerged as a superpower, the world looks to us for leadership, \ninspiration, and our values. When we curtail individual rights, other \nnations follow suit and democracy and human rights suffer.\n  I have sent a letter to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. I have asked Senator Hatch to \nreschedule a hearing for Mr. William Haynes whose nomination is \ncurrently on the calendar. Mr. Haynes, now more than ever, must answer \nthese important questions about the role he played as general counsel \nat the Pentagon. If he had nothing to do with this policy, he can make \nthat eminently clear, but if he did have something to do with it, I \nthink we need the answers to these questions before we, in good \nconscience, are asked to vote to support his nomination to the second \nhighest court in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5066-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5066-S5072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONDEMNING ABUSE OF IRAQI PRISONERS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the resolution, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 356) condemning the abuse of Iraqi \n     prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, urging a full and complete \n     investigation to ensure justice is served, and expressing \n     support for all Americans serving nobly in Iraq.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 32 minutes remaining. The \nminority has 10 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I am pleased we have this resolution \nbefore us. I think all of us share the same thoughts about this whole \nIraqi prisoner abuse issue. We are all very disappointed and very \ntroubled about the events in the prison. We need to move forward to \nresolve this issue. We need to do what needs to be done as a followup. \nWe do not need to make it into a political operation for the next week \nbecause we have other things to do in Iraq. But we must take care of \nthis issue because we, as Americans, hold ourselves to a higher \nstandard.\n  These are appalling actions of those responsible for the treatment of \nthe detainees in Iraq. It falls far short of any of those standards. \nOur credibility has been called into question in the eyes of those we \nare trying to help, as well as the rest of the world. These incidents \nof cruelty and mistreatment at the hands of American service men and \nwomen are inexcusable, and certainly it is a very small group of our \nservice people. Unfortunately, the foolish actions of a few have cast a \npall on thousands of our military. All of us know that is not the case, \nand all of us who have served in the military know these are not the \nkinds of activities we are ordered to do.\n  There have been mistakes, and we need to determine how those happened \nand see they do not happen again so our folks can continue at the very \nhard job they have.\n  These terrible events have dealt a blow to what we are seeking to do. \nI want to say again our task is to win in Iraq, and this is a deterrent \nfrom that, but we can overcome it and move on with the task.\n  This also makes it more important that we win at home. With the media \nand the emphasis that has been put on this issue, it detracts from our \njob. We cannot let that happen. If we are really as strong in our \nfeeling about our service people overseas, we ought to make sure we \nsupport what they are doing and continue to give them that support.\n  We as a nation must deliberately correct the situation and ensure it \ndoes not happen again. All of us want to do that.\n  Democracies hold themselves accountable. That is our task. We can do\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\nit, and we will do it. We acknowledge we have done wrong, and we will \nmove to correct it. That is what this resolution is about. That is what \nthe hearings are about. That is what holding people in authority \nresponsible is about. We need to move on that initiative. We need to \nget the facts. We need to make the whole effort more transparent in the \nfuture, of course, as all Government activities should be transparent.\n  The process needs to move swiftly and decisively. We need to do this \njob and get on with the rest of the job.\n  For those who committed the acts and those who enabled them, we need \nto do all we can in determining if there is involvement in the chain of \ncommand.\n  I do not think anyone denies that is what we need to do. These things \nthat have happened are certainly fundamentally contradictory to \nAmerican values. The eyes of the world are focused now on how we will \nreact, and we have reacted. The President has reacted. The Secretary \nhas reacted. The Congress will react. We need to ensure that it \ncontinues, but I do warn that we ought not divert all of our attention \nto this issue, taking it away from the overall issue that still exists. \nWe need to be there. The stakes are simply too high to play politics \nwith this issue, and unfortunately that might well happen.\n  So we need to proceed. We need to make everyone understand that these \nare not the kinds of things that the United States will live with and \nlet happen. We will do something about it. We need to bring those to \njustice who were involved. We will go forward and we will win in Iraq. \nFirst, we must win in the United States.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Earlier, I listened to the assistant minority leader talk about \nenergy and say that the things we are doing now have nothing to do with \nan energy bill. I think that is absolutely wrong. What we are talking \nabout is an energy policy that will last somewhat over time but is \ndesigned to change some of the things that we are doing in energy and \nenergy use that are causing us part of the problems today. Will they \nreflect some change in the next day or two? Of course not. But we need \nto be working forward at doing something about the long-term impact of \nenergy.\n  I will briefly talk about a few of the things that need to be done \nbecause it is just impossible to say they do not have an impact. Keep \nin mind that we have had an energy bill now last year and this year, \nand we tried to bring it up on the Senate floor. It passed here, went \nto conference, came back, and would not be accepted again. We have been \nobstructed and cannot move forward in doing something with the broad \nenergy bill that has to do with energy efficiency. Again, it is going \nto take some time to do that, but it is very clear that consumption has \ngone up faster than has production. If we continue to do so, this will \nbe the case. Even more importantly, our consumption will grow and our \nproduction--if we keep it as it is--will soon be overcome and will not \ngrow. So we have to talk about issues like renewable energy. We have to \ntalk about alternative energy. Those things are in the bill. That is \nwhat we are talking about doing, seeing if we can do some things \ndifferently than we have in the past.\n  We also have some incentives to continue like in marginal wells. \nMarginal wells, even with the price as high as it is, if there is not \nsome incentive for a well that only delivers two, three, or four \nbarrels a day, we do not produce them, but in total they still have a \nlarge impact on what we are doing.\n  We need to make some changes in the way we use energy. We are using \noil, for example, to heat homes. We are using oil to do a lot of things \nother than make gasoline. We have other energy sources that could be \nused for that purpose. The same is true with natural gas. We are using \nnatural gas for many things. For instance, the electric-generating \nplants that have been built in the last 10 or 15 years have all been \nnatural gas plants. Natural gas is so much more flexible for other \nuses: we ought to be using coal; we ought to be using nuclear for \nthe generation of electricity so we can use natural gas for other \npurposes.\n\n  So to say this bill has nothing to do with our problems with energy \nis absolutely without merit. It does have a great deal to do with it.\n  We talked about some things that would have a pretty immediate \nimpact, such as doing something on the Indian reservations to promote \nproduction. They would like to do that, but we have not really been \nable to make it happen. We are talking about doing something with \nhydrogen, fairly short term, to make hydrogen part of automobile fuel, \nand use coal and make hydrogen for automobiles.\n  We can talk about the price of gas next week. I would love to be able \nto do something about that, and hopefully maybe we can, but the real \nthoughtful question is, where are we going to be in 5, 10, or 15 years \nfrom now to meet the needs which will constantly be growing? We need to \nhave a plan. We need to have a policy. This Congress has absolutely \nrefused to move forward with the policy, along with many other things, \nand has strictly been obstructed from moving forward. So every week we \nare going through the same things because we cannot get them passed. \nSomething needs to be done.\n  I think we have some very important issues before us. First of all, \nwe have this resolution. I favor the resolution, which says very \nclearly how we feel about what happened in the prisons in Iraq. It says \nvery clearly what we ought to be doing about those responsible for \nthose acts. It says very clearly that we ought to make sure that does \nnot happen in the future and that we can go back to doing what we are \nsupposed to be doing. I hope we do not make such an issue in terms of \naccomplishing things that we detract from the real purpose of our being \nin Iraq, and that is to win freedom for the Iraqi people, do something \nabout terrorism, and be able to bring our men and women back to the \nUnited States after the victory.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that the time in the quorum call \nbe equally divided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I just returned from my home \nState of Florida, and I cannot state the number of people who came up \nto me over the course of the weekend to ask me about the situation in \nthe prison in Baghdad and the question of what should be done with \nSecretary Rumsfeld.\n  My reaction is, we have an ongoing investigation. I would like to see \nsome more results of that investigation, in addition to what we have \nalready been shocked with in the graphic photographs--although I \nunderstand we have ``not seen nothing yet,'' that we are going to get \nmore graphic photographs, including some videos that are fairly \ndescriptive of behavior that is clearly not behavior approved in the \nnormal course of the standards of Americans.\n  Of course, offensive conduct by Americans is made all the more \ndifficult as we are in unsettled parts of the world in a place of Arab \nculture and the Muslim religion.\n  Often, my response has been specifically about Secretary Rumsfeld; \nthat this issue is much greater than any one Secretary of Defense. The \nissue comes down to how America has planned for the postwar occupation. \nWe did not do a very good job of planning for the postwar occupation.\n  This Senator happens to be a Democrat from Florida, but that does not \nhave anything to do with this. What I am about to say is very \nbipartisan, or nonpartisan. One of the committees on\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\nwhich I have the privilege of serving is the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. The chairman is a Republican and his name is Dick Lugar of \nIndiana. He has been saying very similar things to what I am about to \nsay, as has his ranking Republican member, Senator Chuck Hagel of \nNebraska, and certainly the ranking Democrat and former chairman, \nSenator Joe Biden of Delaware. It is this: We had a brilliant military \ncampaign in Afghanistan and again in Iraq, led, by the way, by a \nFloridian, GEN Tommy Franks.\n  To give credit where credit is due, I include Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld. He ought to be given credit. It was a brilliant military \ncampaign, blending the use of military forces--specifically, special \noperations forces in Afghanistan--with other agencies, such as the CIA. \nThe CIA was first in Afghanistan. The first American killed in \nAfghanistan was Mike Spann, a CIA agent detailed out of Uzbekistan.\n  So, too, in the runup to the military campaign in Iraq, a brilliant \nmilitary planning in the war effort. We took Iraq in much fewer days \nthan General Franks had ever planned. Of course, that is what he is \nsupposed to do as a combatant commander, plan for the worst and be very \nconservative in the planning. The military campaign was spectacular.\n  The problem was, before the war in Iraq, in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, over and over we asked the administration--who is \n``we''? It is all of those Senators I just talked about, the bipartisan \nleadership of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--asking over and \nover, peppering the administration with questions: What are your plans? \nWell, we do not have them. Well, bring them to us. And they would come \nback with some cursory plan.\n\n  Of course, we are now seeing the results.\n  The prison problems are a manifestation of just one element of the \nlack of a plan, of what it is to be an occupier in a Muslim country and \nthen not planning for the sensitivities of being an occupier in a \nMuslim country.\n  What do we do now? The criminal investigation will go forward. The \nrest of the reporting is going to go forward, and we will find out what \nto do with regard to the prisons. But what we ought to be doing, and I \nthink we are hearing this chorus from a number of Members in a \nbipartisan way, coming out of the several committees--not the least of \nwhich is the Foreign Relations Committee--the President ought to \nconvene the major countries of the world, along with the Arab neighbors \nof Iraq in the region, and they should forge consensus. When somebody \nsays that consensus cannot be reached, all you have to do is explain to \nthose countries it is in their naked self-interest to try to get a \nstabilized Iraq.\n  France, for example, has a Muslim population somewhere between 8 and \n12 percent. Convene those nations and then invite in a NATO force led \nby the United States. Go to the United Nations, get a senior \ninternational diplomat to come in and start working after June 30 to \nbuild Iraq with the institutions so it can go to elections.\n  We will be there a long time. Anyone who doubts that, we are in the \nninth year in Bosnia. It will take a lot of troops. Eventually, we will \nsee our troops will have to be more than what we are planning for now \nwith the 130,000 that we have there.\n  With those few short comments prior to the voting on this resolution, \nI thank the Senate for the privilege of addressing the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 2398 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues and so many \nothers around the country and around the world to condemn the treatment \nof prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. What happened there is \ndeplorable. It is despicable, and it is dishonorable. It does not \nreflect the values of the United States of America or the code of \nconduct for the United States military that so many of our brave men \nand women live by every day.\n  This has been a terrible blow for the vast majority of our troops who \ngo by the book, serve America with honor, and put their lives on the \nline every day to promote and protect the democratic principles that we \nhold dear. It is also a terrible blow for America's standing around the \nworld. Today, our troops are less secure. Instead of winning hearts and \nminds on the road to a free and democratic Iraq, our troops must now \novercome tremendous anger and mistrust.\n  That is why we must take immediate steps to: investigate these \nabuses, hold accountable those responsible, commend those who did the \nright thing, and correct the problems quickly and thoroughly.\n  First, there must be thorough and rigorous investigations. Congress \nand independent investigators in the military and the intelligence \ncommunity must get the facts: what are the abuses, how widespread are \nthey, how did they come to happen, and what did the military and \ncivilian leadership do, or not do, to correct them. On charges of such \na grave nature--that are so detrimental to America's standing in the \nworld--there cannot be enough transparency and public scrutiny.\n  The result of these investigations must be accountability at all \nlevels of the military and civilian chain of command--up to the highest \nlevels. Why do the Privates and Specialists face prosecution, but the \nGenerals get letters of reprimand? Those who participated or were \ncomplicit in abuses--or created a climate that allowed them to occur--\nmust be held accountable, no matter their rank or title.\n  The world has witnessed shameful acts committed by people who \nrepresent the United States in Iraq. Now America must show the world \nhow United States of America exercises the true principles of \ndemocracy--upholding the rule of law by administering justice in a \nswift, transparent and fair manner.\n  We should also commend those who did the right thing, like Specialist \nDarby, who reported the abuses, General Sanchez, who launched an \ninvestigation, and General Taguba, who issued a no-holds-barred report.\n  The problems that led to this must be corrected quickly and \nthoroughly. Our soldiers in Iraq must get the training and supervision \nthey need to do their jobs with honor and in accordance with \ninternational law. And if heads need to roll to correct the problem, so \nbe it. The world must know that America holds to the highest standards \nof military conduct and human rights protections. Anything less is \nunacceptable.\n  The resolution we will vote on this evening commends our soldiers, \ncondemns the abuses and calls for swift justice and accountability. Yet \nit should go further and demand accountability at all levels.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will speak with one voice by \nunanimously supporting this resolution.\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I strongly support the resolution \nwhich the Senate is considering today.\n  The world has witnessed images that do not represent America's cause \nfor freedom, democracy and human rights. While our American soldiers \ntoil and sacrifice to bring justice and opportunity to Iraq, there is a \nsmall group of soldiers who have undermined the work of this noble \nmission through their despicable behavior.\n  The acts that took place at Abu Ghraib prison were simply \ninexcusable. The violation of any Iraqi prisoner's human rights, \ndignity or life by any member of the American military--for whatever \nreason--defies not only international law, but basic human decency. \nThese acts risk undermining the mission, and put at risk other American \nmen and women working for freedom in Iraq.\n  I am concerned that Congress was not adequately informed of the \nabuses and the investigations. Secretary Rumsfeld's appearance on \nCapitol Hill last week was welcome, and I expect that he will continue \nto make himself available to the Senate.\n  I deeply appreciate the President's willingness to speak candidly and \napologetically to the Arab world. I support the decision to offer \ncompensation to the victims, and to put together commissions to \nascertain how widespread the abuse and humiliation were, and what can \nbe done to prevent future violations. I am hopeful that these steps \nwill be part of a much needed\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\nprocess to make amends for the great damage that has been done by a few \nmen and women.\n  Abu Ghraib was home to torture under Saddam Hussein's regime, and has \nnot yet overcome its notorious reputation. Consequently, I believe \nthat, should the Iraqi people wish it, this prison should be wiped off \nthe map. Tearing down Abu Ghraib prison would symbolize the definitive \nend to the era of torture--an era which preceded Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, and must be put to rest once and for all.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to echo the horror that all of \nour citizens felt when we first viewed the photographs taken at Abu \nGhraib prison. It is a stain upon the honor of our nation and the \nactions of these few individuals have undermined many of the \nsubstantial gains and sacrifices that our service men and women have \nachieved since the events of September 11th.\n  At the same time, it is important to remember that these are the \ndisgraceful actions of a few and by no means do they represent the hard \nwork and honorable service of the 138,000 soldiers, sailors, airman, \nmarines, and coast guardsman that are serving our country in Iraq and \nsurrounding countries.\n  During this trying time, I am also reminded that one of our troops' \nprimary responsibilities is to do what is necessary to minimize \ncivilian casualties. As some of my colleagues have mentioned on \nnumerous occasions, one of their most vivid memories of the war was \nwhen a young American service member ran out onto an exposed bridge in \norder to save a young Iraqi woman. This is just one of many examples of \nthe high personal, professional and moral conduct that is displayed \nevery day by our Nation's service members.\n  The question then arises, how do we remove this stain on our honor? \nOur commander-in-chief, the President, as always, is leading the way by \nexpressing his outrage over these actions and has apologized to the \nworld.\n  The Department of Defense has followed the President's example.\n  In his very forthcoming and candid comments before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, the Secretary of Defense apologized and took full \nresponsibility for these mistakes.\n  The statements by President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld were the \nhallmarks of leadership and show the world what is best about the \nUnited States. It is the sign of a great nation to acknowledge openly \nwhen laws have been broken, bring those violators to justice, and apply \nthe law equally to all. We are working with the Iraqi people to use \nthese same legal principles as the cornerstone of their developing \nlegal system. Therefore, it is my hope that the results of the trials \nto come will form the real enduring image in minds of the Iraqi people.\n  I strongly support the resolution that is before the Senate. It adds \nour apology to those offered by the President and the Secretary of \nDefense; it rightly commends the vast majority of service members who \nare serving nobly abroad to support liberty; and it reiterates our \ncommitment to bring to justice those who broke the law.\n  It is a beginning to set things right.\n  However, I am dismayed to learn that some have taken this opportunity \nto make a political point. They have called on the Secretary to resign. \nIt is troubling that some would take advantage of these horrific acts \nin order to achieve a political gain during an election year.\n  This is a Secretary of Defense who has continued to show that he is a \nman of honor by taking direct responsibility for the actions of a few \nrogue individuals.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has proven conclusively time and again that he is \na positive agent for change at the Department of Defense. I know of no \nother individual who will engage in a more aggressive investigation of \nthe events that have occurred and will institute whatever changes are \nnecessary to prevent these violations from ever happening again.\n  We have much to do to repair our credibility.\n  The President's apology, followed by the acceptance of responsibility \nby Secretary Rumsfeld and the actions of the Senate today, begin this \nprocess.\n  However, this process will also require a rigorous investigation. \nThere is one man who I know who is up for that challenge and it is \nSecretary Rumsfeld. This great Nation must stand behind him.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, although I must be necessarily \nabsent for the vote this afternoon, I want to express my support for \nthis important resolution and briefly speak on the issue that has \nshocked all of us during the past two weeks--the horrific abuse \nsustained by the prisoners and detainees in Iraq.\n  All of us condemn what has happened in Iraq's prisons. The acts the \nworld has now seen are deplorable; they are inhumane; they are \nappalling. Every day brings new evidence of horrors. These actions are \ncompletely inconsistent with our values, and completely \ncounterproductive to our efforts to help the Iraqi people achieve \nsecurity, stability, and freedom.\n  These images cast a dark shadow on all our efforts in Iraq, and they \nmake the work of our brave military men and women in Iraq only harder. \nThese shameful acts of a few have put many in harm's way. As we condemn \nthese acts and punish those responsible all the way up the chain of \ncommand, we must continue to support our soldiers in Iraq and around \nthe world. We cannot let the images and stories from the last week--and \nthe images and stories that will certainly emerge in the coming weeks--\ndistort the fact that the vast majority of men and women serving their \ncountry today in Iraq and elsewhere are doing so with great dignity, \nskill and patriotism.\n  This is not just a major setback for our efforts in Iraq. Just think \nabout the damage that these acts have done to America and our authority \nto promote peaceful, democratic change around the world. At the same \ntime when we are trying to reach out to Arab countries--and to help \ntheir societies develop more opportunities so their people can live in \ngreater freedom--these photographs and the behavior they depict do \ntremendous harm to America's ability to lead.\n  That is why we must stand together today to condemn these actions in \nthe strongest terms. But our words will not be enough. We must follow \nup our words with deeds. There must be a full investigation into how \nthese acts were allowed to happen, and an exhaustive effort to see that \nmeasures are put in place so that they never happen again. Many \nquestions must be answered, and we must have the administration's full \ncooperation. The American people--and the Iraqi people--deserve \nanswers. We must hold accountable those responsible all the way up the \nmilitary chain of command, and they must be punished to the fullest \nextent of the law.\n  I also believe that these acts reveal such a fundamental failure of \nleadership that we need to have accountability here in Washington. We \ncannot just blame this on the individual soldiers involved. We must \nshow the world that no one can shirk responsibility no matter how high \nthat responsibility goes, or what office one might hold.\n  So if we want to signal to the rest of the world that we in fact \nemphatically reject what happened; if we want to send the message that \nwhat happened in that prison was inconsistent with American values; if \nwe want to say to the rest of the world that we as a nation want to \nchange course here, then we need to hold our leadership at the highest \nlevels accountable.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong \nsupport for a Senate resolution condemning the abuses in United States \ndetention facilities in Iraq.\n  This resolution makes clear that the abusive behavior we have seen \ngraphically portrayed in photographs, detailed in the report of MG \nAntonio Taguba, and described by Secretary Rumsfeld in testimony last \nweek, are unacceptable.\n  Such conduct is wrong, un-American, and inconsistent with the history \nand tradition of our military services. It is critical that the Senate \nvoices its absolute rejection of the conduct, and this resolution does \njust that.\n  It must be understood that this resolution, however, is narrow and \nfocused. It is confined to expressing our views on the specific conduct \nat issue. It does not purport to be a comprehensive view\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\non the implications of this growing scandal, nor a conclusive statement \nof a congressional investigation into this incident, and its \nramifications.\n  I believe that such an investigation is necessary and should be \nundertaken as soon as possible. We need to know why the Geneva \nConvention appears to have been ignored. We need to understand how such \na debacle could have happened, and what orders were given by who, and \nwhen, which governed the prison at Abu Ghraib. We need to know why the \nreports of the Red Cross and others were not responded to in a \ncomprehensive and timely manner. And why was this problem concealed for \nmonths from the Congress and the American people.\n  If the conflict in Iraq is seen as a battle for the hearts and minds \nof the Iraqi people, then it is unfathomable how such a devastating \nfailure in that battle could be allowed to happen. This is not just \nabout personal accountability, or abuse--it is about the conduct of a \nconflict upon which the future of our security may depend.\n  It is also important to recognize that planning and implementing a \nmilitary detention and interrogation operation is a necessary and \nimportant part of a competent and professional war plan. There are \nthree reasons why this is so:\n  First, the information gained from proper interrogation is critical \nto protect our warfighters--it allows us to deal with the tactical risk \non the ground in Iraq. Simply put, military interrogation is part of \nthe overall intelligence-gathering mechanism which is designed to \nprovide timely, accurate information to front line troops and strategic \nplanners. Done correctly, a well-run, properly administered military \ndetention system will yield information that will keep our men and \nwomen in uniform alive in the face of an increasingly violent \ninsurgency.\n  Second, detention and interrogation is inherently risky, and that \nrisk is a moral risk. It is not easy to run prisons, interrogate \ndetainees, and maintain order in a manner consistent with our Nation's \nmoral values. There are certainly some guides to help manage this risk: \nthe Geneva Convention, for instance, provides a well-established set of \nguidelines that can not only allow American soldiers to adhere to \ninternational law, but help them ensure that their conduct is \nacceptable to Americans and to our moral code.\n  Third, it should be apparent that the administration of a military \nprison system inside Iraq is a clear danger point in the context of our \nstrategic goals--prisons pose a necessary, but important, strategic \nrisk. Failure to adhere to the highest standards of conduct will fuel \nthe increasingly hostile view of Americans and American policy in Iraq \nand the Middle East.\n  I have reviewed Secretary Rumsfeld's testimony, as well as other \ninformation provided in public statements of the administration and \nprivate briefings.\n   I am becoming increasingly concerned that the Secretary, and the \nAdministration, are missing the point of this growing scandal.\n   Of course there is a need to investigate individual wrongdoing and \nhold people accountable for their acts according to the Code of \nMilitary Justice. But much more needs to be done. I see little evidence \nthat there has been adequate planning for the management and function \nof military detention facilities in Iraq, and this failure needs to be \naddressed now.\n   This is critical for the three reasons I outlined above. In essence, \nmilitary detention facilities should be looked upon exactly like other \nelements of war-planning--necessary to fight successfully, but carrying \nrisks to our soldiers and to our mission.\n   I am concerned that this function has not been adequately planned. \nIt does not surprise me that we see the lack of planning becoming \napparent in the revelation of individual misconduct, but I think it is \ncritical that the Department of Defense take on the larger issue, and \ntake it on immediately.\n   The situation is grim. Each of the three risks I mentioned have come \nto be.\n   Some of our soldiers, inadequately supervised and poorly commanded, \nhave succumbed to the moral hazards of running a prison. I do not \nexcuse their actions, and they will be held accountable for their \nactions. But it is predictable that without adequate command and \ncontrol such conduct will happen in a prison, and for that Secretary \nRumsfeld and senior Army commanders are responsible.\n   It is clear that the potentially valuable source of tactical \nintelligence that could have been gained through the competent and \nprofessional administration of military detention facilities was \nwantonly thrown away by allowing those facilities to degenerate into a \nchaotic and ungoverned free-for-all.\n   It is my view that there is a place for properly conducted \ninterrogation in the context of a military detention facility.\n   But it seems to me that what we have seen is not overly aggressive \ninterrogation, but wanton cruelty and abuse, unconnected with any \ndoctrinally acceptable method of prisoner interrogation.\n   We will never know what potentially valuable tactical intelligence \nwas lost in the chaos of Abu Ghraib prison, but I am confident that \nwhatever intelligence was there was unlikely to have been elicited in \nthat environment.\n   Again, Secretary Rumsfeld and senior commanders are responsible for \nthis failure, and I call upon them to immediately remedy this \nsituation.\n   We have troops on the ground, under fire, and we cannot afford to \nabandon a mechanism for gathering intelligence which could help make \nour troops safer.\n   Finally, the failure to run this element of our war effort \ncompetently has resulted in a catastrophic setback to our strategic \ninterests.\n   It should have been self-evident that failure to run U.S. detention \nfacilities in a professional, competent and lawful manner would, when \nmade public, adversely affect our prospects in Iraq and in the region.\n   Simply put, American soldiers will come under increasing fire \nbecause of the failure to run the prisons correctly, and whatever \nprospects remain for peacefully transferring power to an Iraqi \ngovernment have been diminished.\n   In sum, it is important to recognize that planning for detention and \ninterrogation of prisoners is as much a part of war planning as making \nsure that there is enough gas for tanks, enough ammunition for guns and \narmor for our soldiers.\n   I am concerned that the failure to plan for this aspect of the war \nis consistent with a general pattern at the Pentagon--an unwillingness \nto plan for the realities of Iraq and the Middle East. We will all pay \nfor that failure.\n   One key part of the resolution speaks to the roll of the Congress, \nnoting that ``the best interests of the United States and the American \npeople will be served by a full investigation by the appropriate \nCommittees of the United States Senate exercising their oversight \nresponsibilities.'' This is a critical point. This body must \nimmediately begin its task of addressing this issue.\n   There are a few particular questions upon which I hope we will \nfocus:\n   Whether, and to what extent, the conditions and procedures in Abu \nGhraib and other prisons came about because of particular policy \ndecisions by senior officials. For instance, who made the decision, \nreported in the media, to use prison guards to ``set the conditions'' \nfor interrogations?\n   Why was the critical task of administering Abu Gharaib entrusted to \nsoldiers without adequate training or guidance?\n   Who in the command structure is responsible for maintaining and \nadministering our military program to detain and interrogate prisoners \nin Iraq and elsewhere?\n   I hope we can answer these, and other questions, and make the \nchanges necessary to make our nation safer.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am unavoidably absent from the \nSenate this afternoon, but would like to express my strong support for \nS. Res. 356.\n  The photos and reports of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison that have \nemerged over the past week defy description. I condemn, as must all \nAmericans, these horrific acts. It saddens and shames our country to \nsee Americans perpetrate these abuses on other human beings. Their \nactions do not reflect the principles for which this country stands.\n  We have fought to liberate Iraq, and to free the Iraqi people from \nthe murderous rule of Saddam Hussein. We have achieved great things in \nIraq, but\n\n[[Page S5071]]\n\nwe have much work to do. The sickening images of abuse that have \nemerged in the media threaten to undermine much of the good we have \ndone. These incidents have marred the reputation of our country abroad, \nand have made the tasks of the brave Americans fighting and working in \nIraq harder. But I am confident that the vast majority of men and women \nworking to bring freedom to Iraq will conduct their noble mission with \nintegrity and distinction.\n  Toward that end, we need to have all the facts about the abuses at \nAbu Ghraib and elsewhere, and we need them immediately. We cannot wait \nmonths for a new commission to issue a report, nor for new photos and \ndetails to dribble out over weeks. The American people need to know, at \nonce, the abuses committed, punish those guilty of these crimes, and \nensure that they never again occur. We must also ensure that similar \nabuses are not occurring elsewhere in detention centers outside Iraq. \nOur venture in Iraq is moral, and must be conducted with moral means. \nWe must ensure that we are treating all prisoners and detainees \nhumanely and in accordance with U.S. and international laws and \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, as Americans we are defined not just by the way in \nwhich we deal with our friends but by how we treat our enemies. I know \nthat in many countries around the world, abuse of prisoners is \ncommonplace and brutal interrogation is the norm, rather than the \nexception. But American, a Nation that was founded on the idea of \nliberty and justice for all, must hold itself to a higher standard. We \nliberate, not torture, and we free, not oppress.\n  Burned into our minds are terrible images: a hooded man standing on a \nbox, a prisoner on a leash. These photos represent humanity at its \nworst, and represent everything that America is not. We must show the \ncountry and the world another image--that of Americans working with \nIraqis to topple the statute of Saddam Hussein, to free the Iraqi \npeople--truly represents who we are.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this Senate \nresolution expressing our clear condemnation of the despicable abuses \nof Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison.\n  Nearly a week ago, I called on the Senate to clearly and forthrightly \ncondemn the despicable acts perpetrated at Abu Ghraib prison.\n  The pictures and description of the treatment inflicted on Iraqi \ndetainees was too brutal, too inconsistent with what this country \nstands for, and far too consequential for our troops for this body to \nstay silent.\n  Given the severe consequences on our troops and our efforts in Iraq, \nit is important that the Senate say to the world that:\n  No. 1, the Senate commends the American forces serving honorably in \nIraq;\n  No. 2, the Senate condemns the mistreatment of Iraqi detainees and \napologizes to the victims of this abuse;\n  No. 3, the Senate is prepared to exercise its oversight \nresponsibility and fully investigate these incidents; and\n  No. 4, the United States government--both the executive branch and \nthe legislative branch--will hold accountable all of those responsible \nfor these despicable acts.\n  This resolution does each of these and makes clear that the Senate \nwill fulfill its responsibility in the face of these troubling \nrevelations.\n  That's what the resolution does. Let me say a few words, Mr. \nPresident, about what it does not do.\n  The resolution does not spell the end of our work, In fact, the \nSenate is just getting down to the business of investigating what \nhappened and how widespread these practices are.\n  The Armed Services Committee has another hearing tomorrow. We look \nforward to hearing the testimony of General Taguba, someone who had the \ncourage to fully document these abuses not just in Iraq but Afghanistan \nas well and bring them to the attention of his civilian and military \nsuperiors.\n  The hearing also comes as news agencies publish reports of even wider \nspread abuse practices in Iraq, all of which apparently began in \nGuantanamo when senior administration officials adopted a policy to \npermit interrogation tactics that this country has never before \nallowed. So we are at the beginning of this effort, not the end.\n  Nor does this resolution limit in any way whom or what Congress \nshould and must investigate. As horrendous as they are, we are now told \nthat these pictures may only be the tip of the iceberg. And we learned \ntoday that the International Committee of the Red Cross was expressing \nconcerns directly to the administration as early as March 2003--over a \nyear ago.\n  Lastly, this resolution does not absolve anyone. We will have done a \ngreat disservice in this investigation if only a handful of enlisted \nmen and women are held accountable and the actions and decisions of \nthose higher up in the military and civilian chain of command are \nignored. Anyone who ordered these actions, tolerated these abuses, or \ncontributed to an atmosphere that led to this mistreatment must be held \naccountable.\n  I join with several of my colleagues--Republican and Democrat--who \nhave made clear that we need to ensure that the entire chain of command \nis held accountable for these despicable acts, and we will have failed \nthe American people if we do otherwise.\n  Like most Americans, we learned about these horrific acts on national \ntelevision. And like the overwhelming majority of Americans, we were \nshocked at the brutality the pictures depicted.\n  The simple truth is that America stands for democracy and the \nunalienable rights of individuals, and the vast majority of Americans \nserving in Iraq embody those principles--and do so under unimaginably \ndifficult and dangerous circumstances.\n  In order to uphold the service and sacrifices of these fine men and \nwomen and to demonstrate to the world--yet again--what America truly \nstands for, we must send this clear message.\n  The stakes here could not be higher. We are at a dangerous and \ndifficult crossroads in Iraq. If these pictures go unanswered, the \nconsequences could not be more grave for our troops and their security, \nfor our goal of a free and unified Iraq, and for our hope for a stable \nMiddle East.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in 2 minutes we will be voting on S. Res. \n356, a resolution condemning the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib \nprison. I would like to close the debate and comments today by reading \nthe resolve clauses that follow a number of whereas statements. This is \nwhat we will be voting on in a couple minutes:\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends all Americans serving nobly abroad who are \n     advancing the ideals of freedom and democracy, and working, \n     through the individual and collective actions of such \n     individuals, to improve the lives of all the people of Iraq;\n       (2) condemns in the strongest possible terms the despicable \n     acts at Abu Ghraib prison and joins with the President in \n     expressing apology for the humiliation suffered by the \n     prisoners in Iraq and their families;\n       (3) urges the Government of the United States to take \n     appropriate measures to ensure that such acts do not occur in \n     the future;\n       (4) believes that it is in the interests of the United \n     States and of the people of the United States that the \n     appropriate committees of the Senate, exercising the \n     oversight responsibilities of such committees, and the \n     President, through the appropriate departments or agencies of \n     the executive branch, conduct a full investigation of the \n     abuses alleged to have occurred at Abu Ghraib; and\n       (5) urges that all individuals responsible for such \n     despicable acts be held accountable.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired.

Res. 356\n\n       Whereas the United States was founded on the principles of \n     representative government, the rule of law, and the \n     unalienable rights of individuals;\n       Whereas those principles are the birthright of all \n     individuals and the fulfillment of those principals in Iraq \n     would benefit the people of Iraq, the people of the Middle \n     East, and the people of the United States;\n       Whereas the vast majority of Americans in Iraq are serving \n     courageously and with great honor to promote a free and \n     stable Iraq and through such service are promoting the values \n     and principles that the people of the United States hold \n     dear;\n       Whereas Americans serving abroad throughout the history of \n     the United States, both military and civilian, have \n     established a reputation for setting the highest standards of \n     personal, professional, and moral conduct;\n       Whereas in January 2004, a member of the United States \n     Armed Forces reported alleged abuses perpetrated in Abu \n     Ghraib prison during November and December 2003;\n       Whereas an inquiry into those alleged abuses was ordered in \n     January 2004, and that inquiry is reported to have found \n     numerous incidents of criminal abuses by a small number of \n     Americans based in Iraq;\n       Whereas the reaction to the alleged abuses is having a \n     negative impact on the United States efforts to stabilize and \n     reconstruct Iraq and to promote democratic values in the \n     Middle East and could affect the security of the United \n     States Armed Forces serving abroad;\n       Whereas Congress was not informed about the extent of the \n     alleged abuses until reports about the abuses became public \n     through the media;\n       Whereas success in the national security policy of the \n     United States demands regular communication between the \n     President, the agencies and departments of the executive \n     branch, Congress, and the people of the United States;\n       Whereas, in an interview on May 5, 2004, the President \n     stated ``First, people in Iraq must understand that I view \n     those practices as abhorrent. They must also understand that \n     what took place in that prison does not represent America \n     that I know. The America I know is a compassionate country \n     that believes in freedom. The America I know cares about \n     every individual. The America I know has sent troops into \n     Iraq to promote freedom--good, honorable citizens that are \n     helping the Iraqis every day.'';\n       Whereas in that interview the President further stated \n     ``It's also important for the people of Iraq to know that in \n     a democracy, everything is not perfect, that mistakes are \n     made. But in a democracy, as well, those mistakes will be \n     investigated and people will be brought to justice. We're an \n     open society. We're a society that is willing to investigate, \n     fully investigate in this case, what took place in that \n     prison. That stands in stark contrast to life under Saddam \n     Hussein. His trained torturers were never brought to justice \n     under his regime. There were no investigations about \n     mistreatment of people. There will be investigations. People \n     will be brought to justice.''; and\n       Whereas the pursuit of truth and justice are core \n     principles of the United States, and if the Government of the \n     United States conducts a full investigation of the alleged \n     abuses and holds accountable the individuals who are \n     responsible for such abuses, the people of Iraq and of the \n     Middle East will witness how a democracy upholds the rule of \n     law and protects the rights of individuals by administering \n     justice in a swift, transparent, and fair manner: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends all Americans serving nobly abroad who are \n     advancing the ideals of freedom and democracy, and working, \n     through the individual and collective actions of such \n     individuals, to improve the lives of all the people of Iraq;\n       (2) condemns in the strongest possible terms the despicable \n     acts at Abu Ghraib prison and joins with the President in \n     expressing apology for the humiliation suffered by the \n     prisoners in Iraq and their families;\n       (3) urges the Government of the United States to take \n     appropriate measures to ensure that such acts do not occur in \n     the future;\n       (4) believes that it is in the interests of the United \n     States and of the people of the United States that the \n     appropriate committees of the Senate, exercising the \n     oversight responsibilities of such committees, and the \n     President, through the appropriate departments or agencies of \n     the executive branch, conduct a full investigation of the \n     abuses alleged to have occurred at Abu Ghraib; and\n       (5) urges that all individuals responsible for such \n     despicable acts be held accountable.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, after cloture was not invoked on S. 2290, \nthe Hatch-Frist asbestos bill, Senator Daschle and I asked Judge Becker \nto conduct a mediation process in the hope of identifying a path to \nreach consensus on this contentious yet extraordinarily important \nissue. Judge Edward Becker was asked to focus on working with the \ninterested stakeholders on three major issues--projections, claims \nvalues, and overall funding into the trust--understanding that there \nare over a dozen additional issues that remain unresolved. Our belief \nwas that if these three issues could be resolved, it would be much \neasier to work through the remaining differences.\n  Judge Becker presided over meetings for the last 2 weeks and held his \nfinal session last Thursday. His presence was invaluable in helping to \nfurther define the issues and illuminate the differences. Throughout \nthe process all parties negotiated in good faith and worked towards \nbridging the gaps. We are extremely grateful for the time, energy, and \nleadership Judge Becker put into working through these technical \nissues, and to all the parties for their steadfast participation.\n  Last week, Judge Becker gave us his final report on the result of his \nmediation. We are glad there has been movement in major areas but \nrealize there is more work to be done. While both sides have provided \nnew proposals, ultimately, there remains gaps in claims values, \nprojections, and the amount of dollars needed to establish a trust.\n  As you know, we have been personally committed to achieving a \nresolution to this extremely complicated issue for some time. Many \nmembers of both caucuses have devoted countless hours of time and \nconsiderable personal energy toward this end as well. We are committed \nto working together to determine whether a compromise can be reached \nthat would provide sufficient payments to asbestos victims and \ncertainty to companies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5072-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5072-S5073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION--A CENTURY OF EXCELLENCE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto the American Lung Association as it prepares to celebrate its \ncentennial anniversary on May 22. It is a remarkable milestone and the \nleaders and members\n\n[[Page S5073]]\n\nof this impressive organization, past and present, deserve great credit \nfor their continuing successful commitment to fight lung disease for \nthe past 100 years. From its inception as a community-based \norganization formed to eradicate tuberculosis to its current \ninitiatives to reduce smoking, improve environmental health, reduce \nasthma incidence, and support research on preventing and treating lung \ndisease, the Association has been an extraordinary leader in public \neducation and public advocacy.\n  The American Lung Association early mission was to combat the growing \npublic health threat of tuberculosis a century ago. Even in 1904, the \nassociation had the creativity and visionary thinking to develop the \nnation's first health campaign to deal with this threat. The \nassociation developed new ways to diagnose and treat the disease and \nprevent its spread. Through public outreach efforts, it brought the \nbest available technology to communities throughout the United States. \nIn fact, the association funded the research that led to the discovery \nof isoniazid in 1952, which was the first drug for children with the \ndisease and is still widely used today. The American Lung Association \nhas long had an indispensable role in controlling the spread of \ntuberculosis and preventing epidemics of this disease. The Nation is \nvery grateful for its immense contributions to public health.\n  In its long and distinguished history, the association has risen to \nthe challenge of many other health threats. In 1960, the board of \ndirectors issued a policy statement warning that ``Cigarette smoking is \na major cause of lung cancer.'' The statement came 4 years before the \nlandmark ``Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health,'' and the \nassociation became an effective leader in the battle we are still \nwaging to this day against smoking. The association had the skill and \nforesight to develop needed smoking cessation programs and youth \nsmoking prevention programs, and it did so decades before the public \nand the Federal Government called for them.\n  An additional high priority of the association today is reducing the \nheavy burden of asthma in our society. Based on its outstanding \nsuccesses with tuberculosis and smoking cessation, I have no doubt that \nit will lead the way to make our environments safer for asthma \nsufferers.\n  On this special anniversary, I commend the American Lung Association \nfor a century of leadership in improving the health of millions of \nAmericans every year, and I wish them great success in their important \nmission in the years ahead.\n   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, it is my tremendous honor to rise today to \nrecognize a very special birthday. Over the last 100 years, the \nAmerican Lung Association has distinguished itself in numerous and \nmeaningful ways. It has made significant contributions to modern health \nscience and has been a force for successful political action. Most \nimportantly, the American Lung Association is responsible for saving \nmillions of lives through its constant and dedicated efforts to educate \nthe public to the dangers of lung disease and to promote both \npreventive care and treatment for this terrible illness.\n   The American Lung Association has been especially active over the \npast 40 years in bringing the health concerns of smoking to the \nnational policy agenda and aggressively promoting the principles behind \nthe Clean Air Act in relation to pollution's effect on the human body \nand to those individuals with existing lung illnesses.\n   Its work in the field of asthma is equally exemplary. The American \nLung Association has pioneered research efforts to determine the causes \nand treatment of childhood and adult asthma, calling for needed funding \nand government support. It has also spearheaded efforts to teach \nchildren with asthma how to better manage their disease so as to reduce \ncomplications, hospitalizations, and in some cases, deaths.\n   With the knowledge that lung disease is responsible for one in seven \ndeaths annually, there is no doubt of the critical nature of the \nefforts of the American Lung Association. It is certainly appropriate \nthat this body recognize this dedicated organization for a century of \nremarkable efforts to improve the health and lives of all Americans, \nand wish its members many more years of continued success. When they \nsucceed, we all do indeed breathe easier.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I congratulate the American Lung \nAssociation, ALA, on its 100th anniversary. Since its inception in \n1904, as the National Association for the Study and Prevention of \nTuberculosis, the American Lung Association has served as a champion \nfor those affected by lung disease.\n  Lung disease is America's number three killer, responsible for one in \nseven deaths. Every year, close to 342,000 Americans die of lung \ndiseases. However, lung disease is not only a killer, most lung disease \nis chronic. More than 35 million Americans are now living with chronic \nlung disease. I applaud ALA's commitment to fighting lung disease in \nall its forms, with special emphasis on asthma, tobacco control and \nenvironmental health.\n  One of the main focuses of the American Lung Association is the \nreduction of tobacco use in order to combat lung disease. Smoking is \nresponsible for 90 percent of all cancer deaths. Four years before the \npublication of the landmark 1964 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking \nand Health the American Lung Association established the link between \ncigarette smoking and lung cancer.\n  As the author of the law banning smoking on airplanes and in all \nFederal buildings I am tirelessly committed to protecting individuals \nfrom deadly secondhand smoke and developing regulations to protect \nchildren from the dangers of tobacco use. I am proud to call ALA my \npartner in this effort.\n  In addition to the outstanding progress ALA has achieved in its anti-\ntobacco work the association is also recognized as a leader in the \nclean air movement. Americans have ALA to thank for developing the \ncrucial health basis for the Nation's clear air standards that led to \npassage and implementation of the landmark 1970 Clean Air Act and the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and 1990.\n  I commend the ALA for its outstanding achievements over the past \ncentury, and I offer by best wishes for a successful future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5073-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. By \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5073-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5073-S5074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO NANCY AAMODT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is no secret that those of us who are \nprivileged to serve in the U.S. Senate could not do so without the \nsupport of the hard working and dedicated staff. And I rise today to \npay tribute to one of the most valuable members of my staff, who will \nbe retiring at the end of May.\n  For the past 7\\1/2\\ years, anyone who has called or visited my \nPortland office has probably talked with Nancy Aamodt. Indeed, from her \npost at the office's front desk, Nancy is usually the first person who \nanswers the phone, and the first person who greets visitors. I have \nlong believed in the wisdom of the old saying that ``first impressions \nare the most important ones,'' and I know that when Oregonians talk \nwith or meet Nancy, their first impression will be of a kind, caring, \nand courteous individual. She treats all callers and visitors with \nhospitality and courtesy, and leaves everyone knowing that they were \ntreated with great respect.\n  The Bible tells us that ``God loves a cheerful giver,'' and I can't \nthink of a better description of Nancy. She truly\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\nis a ``cheerful giver,'' as she constantly reaches out and offers kind \nwords and support to those who need it most.\n  The commitment to helping others and interest in current events that \nNancy exhibits at the office also extends to her personal life, as \nwell. For many years, Nancy has been a respected leader in both the \nOregon and National Federations of Republican Women. She has served as \nPresident of the OFRW, and is a member of the NFRW Legislative \nCommittee.\n  I am very proud to call Nancy and her husband, Dave, my friends, and \nwish her the very best as she retires from service to the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5074-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING BETTY BENJAMIN\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I congratulate and honor my \nfriend, Betty Benjamin from Minneapolis, who last Saturday celebrated \nher 80th birthday. She has lived an extraordinary and outstanding 80 \nyears.\n   Raised on a farm near Redwood Falls, MN, Betty studied social work \nat Hamline University, where she met her future husband, Robert \nBenjamin, a pre-med student from Pipestone, MN. During the mid- to late \n1960s, Betty was busy raising her family, but somehow she found time to \nbecome a committed leader in the local movement to reform the existing \nabortion laws. Recognizing her determination and natural leadership, \nher friends and colleagues asked her to become the president of two \nwomen's organizations; the Edina League of Women Voters and the \nMinnesota Organization for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. The latter \norganization later became the Minnesota Chapter of the National \nAbortion Rights Action League.\n   When Betty became the leader of Minnesota's pro-choice community, \nabortion was an illegal procedure. Driven by her professional \nexperience as a social worker and her deeply held belief that women \nshould have the freedom to make their own decisions about their own \nbodies and lives, Betty was committed to see the abortion laws \nrepealed. With her family by her side, Betty dedicated everything to \nthe movement--her time, her energy, and even her home. To save valuable \nresources, the organization met in a spare room at the Benjamins' house \nin suburban Minneapolis for more than 5 years. Opening her home to \nother abortion rights advocates allowed Betty to stay connected to the \nstatewide, grassroots organizing plan she shaped. At one point, Betty \norganized a Board of Directors that featured a resident from each of \nMinnesota's 67 legislative districts. Most importantly, making the \norganization's base of operations her home enabled Betty to be a loving \nand devoted mother. And what a role model she was to her three \nchildren! Day after day, she demonstrated the values of hard work and \npersistence and that one person can truly make an imprint on social \npolicy.\n   While the organization eventually outgrew the Benjamins' spare room, \nBetty has never outgrown the organization and the fight. A steady \nsource of inspiration and encouragement to all in the movement, Betty \ncontinues to serve on the Minnesota NARL Foundation Board of Directors.\n   At 80 years of age, Betty's activism and passion still spill out of \nthe boardroom and onto the streets. Two weeks ago, she flew from \nMinneapolis to Washington, DC, to participate in the largest march ever \nfor women's reproductive rights. Once again, she stood strong with her \nfellow Americans, this time over a million, to protect the rights she \nfought to secure for women more than 30 years ago.\n   I stand here on the Senate floor today to honor Mrs. Betty Benjamin \non her 80th birthday and to thank her for her continued commitment and \ndedication. May God grace us with her presence and her passion for many \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5074-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              OSTEOPOROSIS AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to speak about osteoporosis \nand to remind my colleagues that May is Osteoporosis Awareness and \nPrevention Month. Osteoporosis today is a major public health threat \nfor an estimated 44 million Americans, or 55 percent of the population \nage 50 and over. At least ten million Americans are estimated to have \nosteoporosis and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone \nmass, placing them at increased risk for the disease.\n  Of the 10 million Americans estimated to have osteoporosis, 20 \npercent are men. Current statistics show that one in two women and one \nin four men over age 50 will have an osteoporosis -related fracture in \nher or his lifetime. To put this into perspective, as I look around \nthis chamber, these statistics mean that more than 25 of our group of \n100 Senators could develop osteoporosis. And, while osteoporosis is \nthought of as an older person's disease, it strikes men and women of \nall ethnic groups at any age.\n  The literal meaning of the word ``osteoporosis'' is ``porous bone.'' \nOsteoporosis is a devastating disease that causes bones to thin and \nbreak easily--especially bones in the hip, spine and wrist. It is known \nas a silent disease because most people don't even know that they have \nosteoporosis until after they have broken a bone.\n  Not only are these bone fractures very painful and devastating to an \nindividual's quality of life, but they can also be life-threatening, \nespecially for older men. Nearly one in four hip fracture patients who \nare age 50 and over, and average of 24 percent, die in the year \nfollowing their fracture. And the 80,000 men who suffer hip fractures \neach year are nearly twice as likely to die in the year after the \nfracture as women their age.\n  Apart from the severe life-or-death and quality of life consequences \nthat bone fractures can have, osteoporosis has become a major health \ncare expense. In 2001, osteoporosis cost the country $17 billion, or \n$47 million a day in direct costs, according to a report of the \nNational Osteoporosis Foundation, ``America's Bone Health: The State of \nOsteoporosis and Low Bone Mass in Our Nation,'' issued 2 years ago. Of \ncourse, those figures would be even higher today.\n  The ramifications of osteoporosis go beyond our country's health care \nsystem and are truly international in scope. The World Health \nOrganization considers osteoporosis to be the second leading health \nproblem in the world.\n  In spite of these alarming statistics, we are making progress and \ndeveloping a growing awareness and commitment to confronting this \ndisease. Twenty years ago, few people understood the terms \n``osteoporosis,'' and no medical therapy existed to treat the disease \nor help prevent its onset. Today, osteoporosis research and education \nare helping us make great strides. People are far better informed about \nthe causes of this disease and steps to take for prevention and \ntreatment.\n  Building strong bones during childhood, adolescence and as young \nadults can help individuals avoid the disease later in life. Four \nsimple steps can help prevent osteoporosis and optimize bone health: \nEating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D; doing weight-\nbearing exercises on a regular basis; leading a healthy lifestyle \nwithout smoking or excessive alcohol; and having bone density tests and \ntreating low bone mass, as recommended. Preventive measures and \ntreatment--even after a fracture--will minimize further bone loss and \nhelp prevent future disability.\n  Along those lines, I have introduced two bills, the Osteoporosis \nFederal Employee Health Benefits Standardization Act of 2003, S. 417, \nwhich ensures that coverage of bone mass measurements is provided under \nthe Federal health benefits program, and the Medicare Osteoporosis \nMeasurement Act of 2003, S. 419, which amends Medicare to include \ncoverage of bone mass measurements under Medicare part B for all \nindividuals, including estrogen-deficient women, at clinical risk for \nosteoporosis. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation and working towards passage of these bills this year.\n  Injuries and death from bone fractures can be greatly reduced with \nprevention, early detection, and the new forms of treatment that are \nnow available. We should all take the initiative and keep one thought \nforemost in our minds: It's never too early or too late to \nstart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5074-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5074-S5075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COVER THE UNINSURED WEEK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Cover \nthe Uninsured Week. I take this opportunity to highlight the crisis of \nthe uninsured in the United States and to underscore the significant \nimpact that this crisis has on our population.\n\n[[Page S5075]]\n\n  The number of Americans without health insurance is equal to the \ncombined populations of 24 States and the District of Columbia. As of a \nSeptember 2003 National Bureau of Census report, the most recent set of \ncomprehensive figures on this problem, nearly 44 million people had \ngone without health insurance for the span of an entire year or longer. \nMillions more had been uninsured for part of a year.\n  The estimated 43.6 million people who are currently uninsured face \nconstant financial vulnerability. At any moment they could face \nfinancial devastation by the costs associated with an unexpected injury \nor disease. In Maryland alone, there were 595,500 uninsured in 2003--\napproximately 13 percent of Maryland's population. According to the \nBaltimore Sun, 700,000 people younger than 65 have no insurance.\n  Lack of insurance takes a huge financial toll on families. On \naverage, the uninsured are forced to pay 35 percent of the overall \ncosts of their medical coverage. As a result, medical bills are the \nleading cause of bankruptcy and are cited as a reason for half of all \npersonal bankruptcy filings.\n  In my own State of Maryland, we hear the worries of people with \npreexisting conditions who cannot change their job because they fear \nthey will never again be eligible for affordable health insurance. I \nhear about recent college graduates who are no longer eligible for \ncoverage under their parent's insurance policy and are going without, \nhoping nothing happens to them until they find a job that has health \nbenefits.\n  I hear the stories of those who have had to forego care because they \nare uninsured; mothers, fathers, children who have fatal disease, \nforced to face fatal consequences because they cannot effectively \naccess the health care system. Statistics show that up to 18,000 people \ndie each year because we ignore the plight of the uninsured. That is \nthe equivalent of 49 people a day.\n  Who are the uninsured? Often we are led to believe that if people are \nworking they will have health coverage for themselves and their \nfamilies. This is not the case. Eighty percent are in families in which \nat least one person is working. Many employers and workers are finding \nit difficult to afford health insurance due to the continual increases \nin health care costs. Service and labor jobs, which make up a \nsignificant portion of our workforce, are less likely to offer \ninsurance. Moreover, part-time workers are often ineligible for \nemployer-sponsored insurance and low-wage workers often cannot afford \nto pay their premiums.\n  This phenomenon has a very negative impact on the lives of children. \nMr. President, 8.5 million of our children are uninsured, which is more \nthan the number of children in first and second grade in all of our \npublic schools combined. A Florida Healthy Kids Corporation study \nshowed that uninsured kids are 25 percent more likely to miss school \nthan insured children. Such a percentage represents a significant \ndisadvantage for children, especially for those who likely face other \nobstacles as well.\n  Often those with insurance take these benefits for granted. We tend \nto ignore that which does not directly affect us. But those who are \nignoring this problem for that reason should think again. There are \nconsequences to all of us for ignoring the plight of the uninsured. \nAccording to a recent Institute of Medicine report, the United States \nloses $65-$130 billion each year as a result of the poor health and \nearly deaths of uninsured adults. These numbers are called lost \n``health capital,'' also known as individual work losses and \ndevelopment losses in children due to poor health. A community's high \nrate of uninsurance can adversely affect its overall health status, \nincluding the financial stability of its health care institutions and \nproviders. Moreover, such communities face decreased access to services \nsuch as emergency departments and trauma centers.\n  I hope the Senate in the near future can begin to engage in \ndiscussions about meaningful ways to provide quality, comprehensive, \naffordable health care for all of our citizens. I would like to comment \nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and their cosponsors for creating \nCover the Uninsured Week. I urge my colleagues to use this week as an \nopportunity to redouble our efforts to work toward a collective and \ncomprehensive solution to address this critical problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5075-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5075-S5076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ROBERT GLIDDEN\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the State of Ohio has had a good \nfriend in Ohio University President Robert Glidden for many years. \nHigher education in particular, in Ohio and elsewhere, has had a good \nfriend in Dr. Glidden for a lifetime.\n  As he prepares to retire next month from the presidency of Ohio \nUniversity, my alma mater, I think it is important to recognize Dr. \nGlidden's commitment, dedication and hard work. Most of all, though, I \nwould like to applaud his stance that education is the best means \nthrough which to raise up the individual, the State of Ohio and our \ngreat Nation, and his zeal in conveying that philosophy.\n  On July 1, 1994, Dr. Glidden became the 19th president of Ohio \nUniversity, the first public institution of higher learning in the old \nNorthwest Territory. He previously had served Ohio as dean of the \nBowling Green State University College of Musical Arts from 1975 to \n1979 and assistant professor of music at Wright State University from \n1966 to 1967. His other posts have included professor, music school \ndean, provost and vice president for academic affairs at Florida State \nUniversity and music professor at Indiana University and the University \nof Oklahoma.\n  Dr. Glidden can be proud of his service to higher education. In the \npast decade, he has taken Ohio University to a new level of excellence \nby emphasizing the university's academic and research missions. He has \nalso made it an Ohio University priority to reach out to Southeast Ohio \nthrough the university's strong regional campus system, the Voinovich \nCenter for Leadership and Public Affairs, and a multitude of other \nofferings. He has moved the university forward--by way of improvements \nin undergraduate education, technological advancements and campus \nimprovements--during some of the toughest economic times we have faced \nin recent memory.\n  This has taken considerable creativity, focus and foresight, and \noften it has meant making difficult decisions. It also has required a \ncommitment to seeking out new opportunities and revenue steams. Under \nDr. Glidden's watch, external funding for Ohio University faculty \nresearch has climbed to $54.3 million, up from just $34.4 million six \nyears earlier. The university also is about to surpass the $200 million \ngoal of its Bientennial Campaign.\n  These are accomplishments on the grand scale, but there is a personal \nside to Dr. Glidden that students of Ohio University have come to know \nand appreciate. Above all, he respects them. He wants them to \nappreciate learning for learning's sake and gain knowledge and skills \nthat will last them a lifetime, especially because the focus of their \ncareers is likely to change several times as the years go by. He also \nhas emphasized civility and character, attributes that--as we see every \nday--are more important now than ever.\n  Likewise, Dr. Glidden has nurtured Ohio University's relationship \nwith its alumni. These individuals, now some 170,000 strong, are making \nimportant advancements and contributions around the globe. He takes \npride in their accomplishments, and he encourages their continued \ninvolvement with and support for their university and education in \ngeneral.\n  My wife Janet and I have enjoyed being able to get to know Bob and \nhis wife, Renee. Renee's contributions to the university community are \nnoteworthy in their own right. Not only did she oversee the renovation \nof the President's residence--painstakingly stripping and refinishing \nthe home's main staircase herself--she has also made valuable \ncontributions as a career volunteer. She has served on the Board of \nTrustees of the Dairy Barn/Southeastern Ohio Cultural Arts Center, the \nStuart Opera House, Community Design Inc., the Percent for Art \nCommittee, and the Ohio Arts Council.\n  In addition to his distinguished service to Ohio University, Dr. \nGlidden has taken a leadership role in higher education in Ohio and \naround the country through his involvement with Ohio's Inter-University \nCouncil and service as founding chair of the Council on Higher\n\n[[Page S5076]]\n\nEducation Accreditation. Such activities have helped raise the bar for \neducational institutions around the country and earned him the respect \nof his peers nationwide. In the words of Miami University President \nJames Garland, whose school has long enjoyed a healthy rivalry with \nOhio University: ``When it comes to defending budgets and advancing \npolicies in the interest of higher education, Bob has been a leader in \nthe state . . . I have as much respect for him as a university \npresident as anyone I've ever met.''\n  I am grateful, as I know others throughout southeast Ohio are that \nDr. Glidden has expressed an interest in continuing his service to Ohio \nUniversity, albeit in a more modest fashion, during retirement. His \npassion for education and the doors it opens make him a most valuable \nally for the students of today and the leaders of tomorrow. Thank you, \nBob, for your service. Go Bobcats.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5076-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMERICAN LEGACY FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an \norganization that has done so much good in our country. I am happy to \nbe able to congratulate the American Legacy Foundation on its 5-year \nanniversary. Five years ago, the American Legacy Foundation was born \nout of the Master Settlement Agreement, MSA. As we are all aware, the \nStates' lawsuits against the major cigarette companies explicitly \nrequired Sates to spend certain amounts of their settlement payments on \ntobacco-prevention efforts and to advance public health.\n  I would like to personally commend those organizations, such as the \nAmerican Legacy Foundation, who have worked tirelessly for 5 years to \nreduce smoking in our Nation. Smoking is now at its lowest level in \nnearly three decades. This did not happen by chance. It happened \nbecause States and communities all across this great Nation, led by the \nAmerican Legacy Foundation, challenged and continue to challenge the \ntobacco industry.\n  Whether it is an award-winning youth counter marketing campaign, or \n``Great Start,'' an innovative cessation program for pregnant women, \nthere is no denying the fact that programs such as these have \nsuccessfully convinced teens, pregnant women and older adults that they \ncan quit smoking.\n  In closing my remarks, I encourage my colleagues to remain committed \nto the spirit of the Master Settlement Agreement, so that we can \neliminate tobacco addiction altogether. By squelching America's smoking \nhabit, it is my hope that we can achieve the vision of a smoke-free \nsociety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5076-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WE THE PEOPLE NATIONAL FINALS COMPETITION\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, from May 1-3, 2004 more than 1200 \nstudents from across the United States came to Washington, DC to take \npart in the national finals of ``We the People: The Citizen and the \nConstitution.'' This is the most extensive program in the country \ndeveloped specifically to educate young people about the U.S. \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for \nCivic Education, the ``We the People'' program is funded by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education by act of Congress.\n  I am very proud to note that a class from Cheyenne Central High \nSchool in Cheyenne represented the State of Wyoming in this prestigious \nnational event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of \nthe U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the \nchance to come to our Nation's capital and compete at the national \nlevel.\n  The 3-day ``We the People'' National Finals Competition is modeled \nafter hearings in the U.S. Congress. The students are given an \nopportunity to demonstrate their knowledge before a panel of adult \njudges while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant \nhistorical and contemporary issues. Their testimony is followed by \nquestions designed to probe the students' depth of understanding and \nability to apply their constitutional knowledge. Columnist David Broder \nonce described this annual competition as ``the place to come to have \nyour faith in the younger generation restored.''\n  Most recently, the ``We the People'' program was highlighted at two \nnational conferences held in 2003: the White House Forum on American \nHistory, Civics, and Service, and the first annual Congressional \nConference on Civic Education. Evaluations and independent studies have \nvalidated the effectiveness of the ``We the People'' program on \nstudents' civic knowledge and attitudes. This innovative civic \neducation program continues to be one of the best antidotes to apathy \nand cynicism in our Nation.\n  I am certain everyone enjoyed their participation in the ``We the \nPeople'' national finals and I applaud the achievements of all who took \npart in the program. We should all be proud that so many are focused on \nand are learning about the fundamental principles and ideals that \nidentify us as a people and bind us together as a nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5076-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MILKEN EDUCATOR AWARD\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize three \noutstanding teachers from my home State of Louisiana who will be \nhonored by the Milken Family Foundation with the Milken Educator Award \nat their National Educator Conference here in Washington. The Milken \nFamily Foundation was established in 1982 with the mission to discover \nand advance inventive and effective ways of helping people to help \nthemselves and those around them lead productive and satisfying lives. \nOn May 4-6 they will be holding their National Educator Conference in \nWashington, DC.\n  With a major focus on education, the Milken Family Foundation is \ncommitted to recognizing and rewarding the Nation's most outstanding \neducators and helping them to expand their leadership and potential. \nThis year, the Milken Family Foundation has recognized Amanda Mayeaux, \na math teacher at Dutchtown Middle School, Phyllis Diecidue, a reading \nteacher at St. Bernard High School, and Josh Michael Burton, a biology \nteacher at Albany High School, all from the State of Louisiana. They \nare among one hundred teachers who were selected from across the \ncountry to receive this very prestigious $25,000 award.\n  When I think back to my education, I remember many inspiring teachers \nwho helped make me who I am today. Without highly qualified teachers \nwho are dedicated to the success of every student, my colleagues and \nmyself would most certainly not be where we are today. Today, research \nis confirming what common sense has suggested all along. A skilled and \nknowledgeable teacher can make an enormous difference on how well \nstudents learn. As we look towards the future of our country and the \nsustainability of our democracy, we must look to our children, the \nfuture leaders. The future of our workforce and our country depends on \nour ability to recruit and retain qualified teachers in our classrooms, \nwho will help our children become active and responsible citizens. \nOften times teachers are not recognized for the challenges and \nstruggles which they encounter each and every day and tremendous \nsignificance of their work. We must remember that it is our Nation's \nteachers who are in the trenches each and every day ensuring that our \nchildren gain the knowledge and skills that they will need to be \nsuccessful.\n  As we in Congress continue to focus on education reform and ensuring \nthat all children have access to the same quality education, it is \nimportant that we also take a moment to recognize the teachers who work \nhard every day to ensure that our children are succeeding. It is \nbecause of the hard work and dedication of these teachers that our \nchildren can set their sights towards a bright future. I know that my \ncolleagues here in the Senate join me today in congratulating these \nexceptional educators and the other ninety-seven teachers from around \nthe country who were recognized with this high honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5076-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5076-S5077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5076-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5076-S5077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5077-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5077-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ENROLLED BILL PRESENTED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on May 7, 2004, she had \npresented to the President of the United States the following enrolled \nbill:\n\n       S. 2315.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the centenary of the bestowal of the Nobel \nPeace Prize on President Theodore Roosevelt, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nTheodore Roosevelt Commemorative Coin Act, which would commemorate the \ncentenary of the bestowal of the Nobel Peace Prize on President \nTheodore Roosevelt. This bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury \nto mint and issue coins bearing the likeness of Theodore Roosevelt. The \nsales of these coins would support programs to educate the public about \nthe impressive achievements of our 26th President.\n  As those of my colleagues who have studied Roosevelt's life are \naware, my state has a special connection with Theodore Roosevelt. \nRoosevelt liked to say that the years he spent in the Badlands of North \nDakota were the best of his life. He even attributed his success as \nPresident to his experiences as a hunter and rancher in western North \nDakota. It is with great pride, then, that I introduce the Theodore \nRoosevelt Commemorative Coin Act, which honors President Roosevelt's \nforeign policy achievements and commitment to conservation in this \ncountry. In particular, the bill highlights his success in drawing up \nthe 1905 peace treaty ending the Russo-Japanese War. This \naccomplishment earned him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize--making him the \nfirst citizen of the United States to receive the Peace Prize. \nMoreover, the bill pays tribute to his enduring respect for our \nNation's wildlife and natural resources. Over his tenure as\n\n[[Page S5080]]\n\nPresident, Roosevelt established 51 bird reserves, 4 game preserves, \n150 national forests, 5 national parks, and 18 national monuments, \ntotaling nearly 230 million acres of land placed under public \nprotection.\n  It is fitting, therefore, that the proceeds from the surcharge \nassociated with the coin be used for educational programs at two very \nimportant sites in the life of Theodore Roosevelt--his home in New \nYork, Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, and the national park that \nbears his name and honors his conservation efforts, Theodore Roosevelt \nNational Park, located in Medora, ND. These two sites played a \nsignificant role in the development of Teddy Roosevelt's policies and \noffered him refuge away from the stress associated with public life.\n  In addition, the bill would provide funds for the maintenance and \nacquisition of the largest collection of Roosevelt's unofficial papers, \nwhich is housed in the Harvard Library. The Theodore Roosevelt \nCollection is second only to the Library of Congress's collection of \nRoosevelt's presidential papers, and the funds raised by this bill \nwould aid in the Collection's goal of purchasing additional Roosevelt \nmaterials, which will be preserved and exhibited throughout history.\n  As a North Dakotan and an American, it is my hope that this bill will \nrenew interest in the life of Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt's courage, \npatriotism, optimism, and spirit reflect what is best about our \ncountry, and he is remembered not only as a great statesman, but also a \nfriend to the environment. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation to honor Theodore Roosevelt's contributions to \nU.S. foreign and domestic policy and build upon his efforts to promote \nrespect for our nation's lands.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2396. A bill to make improvements in the operations and \nadministration of the Federal courts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, from time to time the Judicial Conference \nand the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts recommend legislative \nproposals to improve the efficiency and enhance the operations of the \nFederal courts. I believe that, out of comity to the judicial branch, \nthe Senate should have the judiciary's specific proposals on record so \nthat we can give those suggestions proper consideration.\n  Today, joined by Senators Leahy, Chambliss, Clinton, Durbin, and \nSchumer, I am introducing the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2004. \nThis bill contains both technical and substantive changes in the law. \nThese recommendations made by the judicial branch will improve the \njudicial process and enhance judiciary personnel administration, \nbenefits, and protections. Some proposals have been carried over from \nprevious Congresses, but the legislation also contains some new \nproposals which the Federal judiciary believes will improve its \noperation. I appreciate the support of my cosponsors, and encourage the \nentire Senate to support this legislation.\n  Many provisions contained in this bill streamline the operation of \nthe Federal court system or otherwise facilitate judicial operations. \nThe bill authorizes some realignments in the composition or the place \nof holding court of specified district courts. For example, section 120 \nwould grant emergency authority for circuit, district and bankruptcy \ncourts, as well as magistrate judges, to conduct court proceedings \noutside the territorial jurisdiction of the court. The need for this \nlegislation has become apparent following the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, and the impact of that disaster on court \noperations, in particular in New York City. In emergency conditions, a \nFederal court facility in an adjoining district (or circuit) might be \nmore readily and safely available to court personnel, litigants, jurors \nand the public than a facility at a place of holding court within the \ndistrict. This is particularly true in major metropolitan areas such as \nNew York, Washington, DC, Dallas and Kansas City, where the \nmetropolitan area includes parts of more than one judicial district.\n  Other sections of the bill contain provisions that would improve \nresource management within the judiciary. The bill would improve the \nprocedures for recouping technology costs and also would broaden the \ncourts' investment options and offer an improved procedure for \ninvesting court registry funds in Treasury securities. Other provisions \nincrease the approval thresholds for payment vouchers or expand the \ndelegation authority of respect to approving vouchers. These \nimprovements will reduce the amount of time judges must devote to non-\njudicial matters.\n  Provisions in this bill also clarify existing law to better fulfill \nCongress's original intent or to make technical corrections. For \nexample, sections 113 and 114 clarify diversity jurisdiction rules as \napplied to resident aliens and foreign corporations. Section 117 \nrepeals references to obsolete sections of the U.S. Code.\n  In addition, the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2004 also contains \nprovisions designed to improve personnel administration, benefits and \nprotections for employees working for the Federal judiciary. These \nprovisions, in some cases, bring the Federal judicial system in line \nwith the executive branch and other governmental bodies. Other \nprovisions are designed to improve the ability of the judiciary to \nrecruit and retain personnel.\n  Several sections improve the judicial system in other ways. The bill \noffers protection of certain information contained in bankruptcy case \nfiles, such as Social Security account numbers, from public disclosure. \nThe proposed legislation provides protection against malicious \nrecording of fictitious liens against Federal judges. The bill provides \nfor improving the process for determining Federal court security \nrequirements.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation, along with \na section-by-section analysis of the bill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and additional material were \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2396\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

BANKRUPTCY, MAGISTRATE, AND TERRITORIAL JUDGES LIFE \n                   INSURANCE.\n\n       (a) Bankruptcy Judges.--Section 153 of title 28, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) For purposes of construing and applying chapter 87 of \n     title 5, including any adjustment of insurance rates by \n     regulation or otherwise, a bankruptcy judge of the United \n     States in regular active service or who is retired under \n     section 377 of this title shall be deemed to be a judge of \n     the United States described under section 8701(a)(5) of title \n     5.''.\n       (b) United States Magistrate Judges.--Section 634(c) of \n     title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(c)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) For purposes of construing and applying chapter 87 of \n     title 5, including any adjustment of insurance rates by \n     regulation or otherwise, a magistrate judge of the United \n     States in regular active service or who is retired under \n     section 377 of this title shall be deemed to be a judge of \n     the United States described under section 8701(a)(5) of title \n     5.''.\n       (c) Territorial Judges.--\n       (1) Guam.--Section 24 of the Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. \n     1424b) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) For purposes of construing and applying chapter 87 of \n     title 5, including any adjustment of insurance rates by \n     regulation or otherwise, a judge appointed under this section \n     who is in regular active service or who is retired under \n     section 373 of this title shall be deemed to be a judge of \n     the United States described under section 8701(a)(5) of title \n     5.''.\n       (2) Commonwealth of the northern mariana islands.--The \n     first section of the Act of November 8, 1977 (48 U.S.C. 1821; \n     Public Law 95-157; 91 Stat. 1265) is amended in subsection \n     (b) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) For purposes of construing and applying chapter 87 of \n     title 5, including any adjustment of insurance rates by \n     regulation or otherwise, a judge appointed under this section \n     who is in regular active service or who is retired under \n     section 373 of this title shall be deemed to be a judge of \n     the United States described under section 8701(a)(5) of title \n     5.''.\n       (3) Virgin islands.--Section 24(a) of the Revised Organic \n     Act of the Virgin Islands (48 U.S.C. 1614(a)) is amended--\n       (A) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) For purposes of construing and applying chapter 87 of \n     title 5, including any adjustment of insurance rates by \n     regulation or otherwise, a judge appointed under this section \n     who is in regular active service or who is retired under \n     section 373 of this title shall be deemed to be a judge of \n     the United States described under section 8701(a)(5) of title \n     5.''.\n\n     SEC. 216. HEALTH INSURANCE FOR SURVIVING FAMILY AND SPOUSES \n                   OF JUDGES.\n\n       Section 8901(3) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in subparagraph (D), by adding ``and'' at the end; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(E) a member of a family who is a survivor of--\n       ``(i) a Justice or judge of the United States, as defined \n     under section 451 of title 28, United States Code;\n       ``(ii) a judge of the District Court of Guam, the District \n     Court of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the District Court \n     of the Virgin Islands;\n       ``(iii) a judge of the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims; or\n       ``(iv) a United States bankruptcy judge or a full-time \n     United States magistrate judge;''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Federal Courts Improvement Act\n\n                             108th Congress\n\n                       Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                 TITLE I--JUDICIAL PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS\n\n  Sec. 101. Authority of Bankruptcy Administrators To Appoint Trustees \n and to Serve as Trustees in Bankruptcy Cases in the States of Alabama \n                          and North Carolina.\n\n        This section provides that the bankruptcy administrators \n     in Alabama and North Carolina shall have the same authority \n     as that exercised by United States trustees in all other \n     states. The bankruptcy administrator program was established \n     in the judicial districts in Alabama and North Carolina \n     pursuant to section 302(d)(3) of the Bankruptcy Judges, \n     United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of \n     1986. Expanding the duties of bankruptcy administrators would \n     further one of the central goals of the Bankruptcy Reform Act \n     of 1978, Public Law No. 95-598: freeing bankruptcy judges \n     from an administrative role in their cases. This will improve \n     the efficiency and effectiveness of the bankruptcy \n     administrators to facilitate the work of the court to the \n     same degree that United States trustees have done so in the \n     other 48 states.\n\n                  Sec. 102. Venue in Bankruptcy Cases.\n\n        This provision amends section 1412 of title 28, United \n     States Code, to clarify that a district court or a bankruptcy \n     court exercising original jurisdiction under section 157 of \n     title 28, United States Code, may raise an issue of venue sua \n     sponte.\n        Section 1412, at present, neither explicitly allows nor \n     explicitly prohibits a district court or bankruptcy court \n     from raising an issue of venue sua sponte. Federal Rule of \n     Bankruptcy Procedure 1014 implements the venue statute. The \n     Rule only contains the phrase ``on timely motion by a party \n     in interest.'' The incongruence between the statute and Rule \n     has caused confusion. Currently, courts in the same districts \n     raise the issue of venue sua sponte, while others do not.\n        While multiple fora may be permissive locations for filing \n     a bankruptcy case, it is important that courts have the \n     authority to meet the policy goals of preventing forum \n     shopping and promoting an economic, efficient, and effective \n     administration of that case. The Judicial Conference believes \n     that amending the statute to clarify that the courts have the \n     power to raise this issue sua sonte furthers those goals and, \n     promotes the uniform application of the law. For example, if \n     a debtor company, with its primary business and the vast \n     majority of its creditors and employees in a particular \n     state, has its bankruptcy petition filed in another, \n     geographically removed state, the resulting bankruptcy \n     proceeding could impose significant burdens upon the parties \n     in interest, and may not result in the most efficient or \n     effective administration of the bankruptcy. With the \n     enactment of this section, the court, on its own motion or on \n     a timely motion of a party in interest, may transfer a \n     bankruptcy case or proceeding to a district court for another \n     district in the interest of justice or for the convenience of \n     the parties.\n\n  Sec. 103. Place of Holding Court in Texarkana, Texas and Texarkana, \n                               Arkansas.\n\n        This section amends sections 83(b)(1) and 124(c)(5) of \n     title 28, United States Code, to provide that the Western \n     District of Arkansas and the Eastern District of Texas may \n     hold court anywhere within the Federal courthouse in \n     Texarkana that is located astride the State line between \n     Texas and Arkansas. Two courtrooms in the Texarkana \n     courthouse are in one state and two are in the other. As the \n     caseload in Texarkana has\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\n     increased in recent years (especially the criminal dockets), \n     the courts have demonstrated a desire to use the court rooms \n     interchangeably to move their dockets more efficiently. \n     Currently, Texas-originated cases must be tried in Texas and \n     Arkansas-originated cases in Arkansas. This amendment is a \n     further refinement of the efficiency move to build one \n     courthouse for judicial districts in different states.\n\n  Sec. 104. Change in Composition of Divisions of Western District of \n                                 Texas.\n\n        This section would amend the jurisdiction of two divisions \n     of the Western District of Texas by removing Hudspeth County \n     from the Pecos Division and including it in the El Paso \n     Division. The change is sought because increased law \n     enforcement activities in the District's border counties \n     continue to result in increased criminal filings. Three major \n     border checkpoints are located in Hudspeth County, which is \n     directly adjacent to the El Paso District. These checkpoints \n     are closer to El Paso then they are to Pecos (by \n     approximately 135, 105, and 50 miles respectively), and most \n     of the law enforcement agents responsible for these \n     checkpoints live in El Paso. In addition, although the \n     prosecution of these cases occurs in Pecos, counsel usually \n     travels from El Paso. Moreover, El Paso is better equipped to \n     handle the burgeoning workload, as it is where two new \n     judgeships will be filled. Thus, this section would benefit \n     defendants, counsel, and law enforcement agencies, reduce \n     travel costs, and increase the cost effectiveness of \n     administering justice in the district. The United States \n     Attorney for the Western District of Texas supports the \n     proposal.\n\n  Sec. 105. Change in Composition of Divisions of Western District of \n                               Tennessee.\n\n        This section amends Section 123(c) of title 28, United \n     States Code, to move Dyer County from the Western Division of \n     the Western District of Tennessee to the Eastern Division. \n     The section further provides that court for the Eastern \n     Division shall be held at Dyersburg and Jackson. Currently, \n     court for the Eastern Division is held only at Jackson. \n     Dyersburg is removed as a place of holding court for the \n     Western Division.\n       Dyersburg, the largest city in Dyer County, is \n     approximately 75 miles from Memphis, the location of the \n     Western Division court. However, Dyersburg is only 47 miles \n     from Jackson, the location of the Eastern Division court. A \n     drive from Dyersburg to Memphis takes approximately two hours \n     but a drive from Dyersburg to Jackson requires less than one \n     hour. In addition, there is a new four-lane highway between \n     Dyersburg and Jackson which results in a very easy drive. The \n     judges of this court are in agreement that this transfer \n     would result in a convenience to litigants, lawyers, and \n     jurors from Dyer County. Even more importantly, the court \n     would realize a significant savings resulting from reduced \n     juror mileage fees. The Dyer County Bar Association surveyed \n     its membership concerning the proposed transfer of Dyer \n     County. According to the president of the Dyer County Bar \n     Association at that time, there was near unanimous support \n     for the proposal.\n\n Sec. 106. Place of Holding Court in the Northern District of New York.\n\n       This section would designate Plattsburgh as a federal place \n     of holding court in the Northern District of New York. The \n     need to designate Plattsburgh as a place of holding court has \n     been necessitated by the effort to increase security near our \n     national borders in the wake of the attacks of September \n     2001. The Department of Justice and the U.S. Customs Service \n     are implementing significant increases in manpower and \n     federal law enforcement capability along the Canadian border \n     in the Northern District of New York. The additional manpower \n     and equipment resources are expected to dramatically increase \n     the number of proceedings that will be heard at the \n     Plattsburgh location.\n       Currently, there is a part-time federal magistrate judge in \n     Plattsburgh who holds criminal proceedings at his law office. \n     There are no dedicated federal facilities available for the \n     judge to use. The law office has virtually no security nor \n     sufficient space to properly accommodate the members of the \n     press or public (or even the defendant's own family). \n     Arrestees, the majority of who are charged with trafficking \n     in narcotics between Canada and the United States, must be \n     processed under these circumstances. With a significant \n     influx of cases, this situation will not continue to be \n     manageable.\n       A designated court location in Plattsburgh would greatly \n     facilitate the prosecution of the additional cases generated \n     at the northern ports of entry in New York State. The \n     Plattsburgh court location would minimize the transportation \n     of detained defendants to the Albany court location. It would \n     actually shorten detention time and enable the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service to obtain more prompt dispositions \n     in the administrative removal proceedings that follow federal \n     prosecutions. A Plattsburgh location would also enable \n     detention of defendants locally, a critical advantage as \n     detention space in Albany is severely limited.\n       Designation of Plattsburgh as a place of holding court \n     would allow acquisition of space for a criminal proceedings \n     courtroom of approximately 800 square feet at the Federal \n     Building in Plattsburgh. In addition to providing adequate \n     space for courtroom proceedings, the designation will enable \n     the Northern District to create a new jury division \n     consisting of the counties of Essex, Clinton, and Franklin, \n     thereby enabling jurors from these areas to serve in nearby \n     Plattsburgh, rather than drive three to four hours to Albany \n     or Watertown. Also, the bankruptcy court would be able to \n     make use of the new courtroom, which would make an enormous \n     difference in those cases involving litigants from the North \n     County.\n\n                         Sec. 107. Juror Fees.\n\n       This section would amend 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1871(b)(1) by \n     increasing the daily fee to which a juror is entitled from \n     $40 to $50. The change would compensate jurors more \n     adequately for their services. Although the cost of living \n     has continued to increase each year, the daily rate for \n     jurors has not increased in twelve years. Previous increases \n     occurred in 1990 (from $30 to $40), 1978 (from $20 to $30), \n     and 1968 (from $10 to $20).\n       The Jury Selection and Service Act, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1861, et \n     seq. (Jury Act), specifically prohibits exclusion of any \n     citizen from jury service on the basis of economic status, \n     and its legislative history reflects support for fee \n     increases that would make jury service less burdensome. \n     Congress recognized that, to the extent that the burden of \n     jury service is diminished, financial hardship excuses could \n     decline, with consequent enhancement of representative \n     participation of juries. Therefore, while the juror \n     attendance fee has never been intended to support or replace \n     salaries, it is intended to provide a minimal level of \n     compensation for jurors' time and effort in fulfilling their \n     civic responsibility.\n       The projected additional cost for FY 2004 for a $50 daily \n     attendance fee would be approximately $8.1 million. Therefore \n     enactment of this legislation would require a commensurate \n     increase in the fees of jurors appropriations account.\n\n   Sec. 108. Supplemental Attendance Fee for Petit Jurors Serving on \n                            Lengthy Trials.\n\n       This section amends 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1871(b)(2) by shortening \n     the number of days that a juror is required to serve before \n     he or she is eligible for the supplemental daily fee \n     authorized by the section. Currently, a juror who is required \n     to serve more than thirty days is permitted to receive an \n     additional ten dollars a day, above the established juror fee \n     of forty dollars. The economic hardship associated with jury \n     service worsens the longer jurors are required to serve, \n     especially if service continued for more than a week. This \n     section recognizes the fact by reducing to five days the time \n     before jurors could qualify for the supplemental fee.\n       The projected additional cost for FY 2004 for the \n     supplemental daily fee authorized by this section would be \n     approximately $2 million. Therefore enactment of this \n     legislation would require a commensurate increase in the fees \n     of jurors appropriations account.\n\n      Sec. 109. Authority of District Courts as to a Jury Summons.\n\n       This section would amend 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1866(g) to clarify \n     that a court may, but is not required to, follow up on \n     individuals who do not respond to the jury selection process.\n       Under the traditional ``two-step'' jury selection process, \n     qualification questionnaires and summonses are mailed to \n     prospective jurors separately. For those who do not respond \n     to the questionnaires, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1864(a) provides that \n     they ``may'' be called into court to fill out the form. For \n     those who fail to respond to a summons, however, section 28 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1866(g) provides that they ``shall'' be ordered \n     into court to show cause for their non-compliance.\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1878, however, 22 districts have \n     combined these two steps into a ``one-step'' jury selection \n     process, whereby questionnaires and summonses are sent out \n     simultaneously. Section 1878(b) expressly provides that ``no \n     challenge . . . shall lie solely on the basis that a jury was \n     selected in accordance with a one-step summoning and \n     qualification procedure.'' Nonetheless, as long as section \n     1866(g) contains the word ``shall,'' challenges that a jury \n     was unlawfully empanelled can be expected to continue. See \n     United States vs. Cisneros, No 97-CR-485 (D.D.C.); United \n     States vs. Hsia, No. 98-CR-57 (D.D.C.). This section will \n     allow a court to take appropriate action against those who do \n     not respond to a jury summons. The section leaves the \n     decision of how to handle non-responders to the discretion of \n     each court, guided by its own circumstances and experiences. \n     The section also makes the provision gender-neutral.\n\n Sec. 110. Automatic Excuse Upon Request From Jury Service for Members \n  of the Armed Services, Members of Fire and Police Departments, and \n                            Public Officers.\n\n       This section repeals the exemption from jury service now \n     granted to members of the Armed Forces, members of fire and \n     police departments, and pubic officials under 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1863(b)(6) and grants to these persons an automatic \n     excuse from jury service upon individual request. The current \n     statute prohibits individuals in these broad categories of \n     occupations to serve on a jury even if they wish to do so. \n     Barring these individuals from jury duty is unjustified. This \n     provision extends to these persons an automatic excuse from \n     jury by amending 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1863(b)(5)(B) to allow them \n     the opportunity to serve on jury if they choose to do so. If \n     they choose not to serve, they are automatically excused.\n\n  Sec. 111. Elimination of the Public Drawing Requirements for Juror \n                                Wheels.\n\n       This section eliminates the noticing and public drawing \n     requirements for selecting names from jury wheels. The Jury \n     Act at 28 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1864(a) and 1866(a) currently \n     states that the clerk shall ``publicly draw at random,'' from \n     the names of persons required\n\n[[Page S5086]]\n\n     for jury service. ``Publicly draw'' is defined in 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1869(k) as a ``drawing which is conducted . . . after \n     reasonable public notice and which is open to the public.'' \n     Because computers have replaced the physical drawing of \n     names, and because the public has little or no interest in \n     attending a jury drawing, this section would eliminate the \n     requirement to post a separate notice for each drawing from \n     the master and qualified wheels, as well as the requirement \n     to draw names publicly and/or to post public notices. \n     Instead, one general notice will be posted in the clerk's \n     office that explains the process by which names are randomly \n     and periodically drawn from the wheels.\n       The Jury System Improvements Act of 1978, Public Law No. \n     95-572, authorized the Judicial Conference to adopt \n     regulations governing the drawing of juror names from the \n     jury wheels when a drawing is made by electronic data \n     processing. Accordingly, the Conference has adopted \n     regulations that take into account the changes in jury \n     selection resulting from technological advances. The \n     Conference regulations narrowed the meaning of ``public \n     drawing`` to apply only to the selection of the starting \n     number and interval (quotient) during the process of \n     selecting juror names from the original source lists. The \n     Conference did not require any public observance of the \n     actual computer operations, interpreting the term \n     ``reasonably public notice'' to mean the posting of a written \n     announcement of the drawing from the master and qualified \n     wheels on a bulletin board or another public place at the \n     courthouse.\n       With advanced computer technology, more courts are moving \n     to a purely randomized method for selecting juries. Indeed, \n     the Administrative Office's new Jury Management System for \n     the courts will perform the selection of names form the \n     master and qualified jury wheels by a purely randomized \n     process approved by the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology.\n\n       Sec. 112. Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release.\n\n       As part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \n     Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No. 104-132), Congress amended title 18, \n     inter alia, by renumbering and amending the discretionary \n     conditions of probation listed in section 3563(b), but failed \n     to conform section 3563(a) (containing the mandatory \n     conditions of probation) to that amendment. Therefore, the \n     references in section 3563(a) to section 33563(b) are now \n     erroneous. The amendment in subsection (a) of this provision \n     corrects this technical error, thereby restoring \n     congressional intent.\n       Subsection (b) corrects the same oversight as to 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3583(d), which delineates the conditions of supervised \n     release, as is corrected in subsection (a). When 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3563(b) was amended in 1996, the cross reference found \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 3583(d) was not conformed to that amendment. \n     The amendment in subsection (b) corrects this technical \n     error.\n       Subsection (b) also makes an amendment to the conditions of \n     supervised release. Prior to the 1996 legislation, \n     intermittent confinement available as a condition of \n     probation, but not of supervised release. Experience since \n     1996 has demonstrated that this form of confinement (custody \n     by the Bureau of Prisons during nights, weekends, or other \n     intervals of time) is appropriate in certain circumstances. \n     However, this provision recognizes several appropriate \n     limitations on the use of intermittent confinement in this \n     context. First, its use should be limited, as in the case of \n     probation, to the first year of supervision. Second, it \n     should be ordered only when Bureau of Prisons facilities are \n     available to accommodate the individual in question. Third, \n     it should be available only as a sanction for a supervised \n     release violation as an option for the court that is less \n     severe than revocation of supervised release.\n       Subsection (c) amends the section providing for \n     intermittent confinement to clarify that its provisions, \n     including the temporal limitations on its imposition, apply \n     to supervised release as well as to probation.\n\nSec. 113. Clarifying the Scope of Diversity of Citizenship for Resident \n                                Aliens.\n\n       This section amends the last sentence of section 1332(a) of \n     title 28 to clarify the scope of diversity of citizenship \n     jurisdiction in disputes involving aliens admitted to the \n     United States as permanent residents (``resident aliens''). \n     Congress added this proviso to the section in 1988 (Judicial \n     Improvements and Access to Justice Act, Pub. L. No. 100-702, \n     102 Stat. 4642) to ``deem'' a resident alien as a citizen of \n     the state in which the alien is domiciled, with the specific \n     purpose of denying federal jurisdiction in suits between a \n     citizen of a state and an alien permanently residing in the \n     same state. However, this deeming language has been \n     interpreted as applying to other litigation circumstances \n     involving aliens. For example, under section 1332(a)(2) a \n     non-resident alien has been permitted to sue a United States \n     citizen and a resident alien; the proviso deems the resident \n     alien to be a citizen of the state of his permanent \n     residence. Such application of the proviso has broadened the \n     scope of diversity jurisdiction beyond that contemplated when \n     the statute was enacted.\n       Thus, the Judicial Conference of the United States proposes \n     replacing the last sentence in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1332(a) (the \n     resident alien proviso) with text providing that the district \n     courts shall not have diversity of citizenship jurisdiction \n     under subsections 1332(a)(2)-(3) where the matter in \n     controversy is between a citizen of a state and a citizen or \n     subject of a foreign state admitted to the United States for \n     permanent residence and domiciled in the same state. This \n     section will resolve differing interpretations of the \n     sentence among federal courts.\n\n    Sec. 114. Clarifying the Scope of Diversity of Citizenship for \n                  Corporations With Foreign Contacts.\n\n        Section 1332(a) of title 28, United States Code, grants \n     the district courts original jurisdiction of all civil \n     actions where the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000 and \n     is between citizens of different States or citizens of a \n     State and citizens or subjects of a foreign state. No \n     plaintiff can be from the same State as a defendant for this \n     diversity jurisdiction to be available. Also, diversity \n     jurisdiction does not lie when a citizen or subject of a \n     foreign state (alien) seeks to sue another foreigner in \n     federal court.\n       When one of the parties to a civil action is a corporation, \n     section 1332(c) deems that corporation to be a citizen of any \n     Sate in which it has been incorporated ``and of the State \n     where it has its principal place of business.'' The quoted \n     language was added to subsection (c)(1) in 1958 to give \n     essentially dual citizenship to corporations. The intent was \n     to preclude diversity jurisdiction over a dispute between an \n     in-state citizen and a corporation incorporated in that state \n     or primarily doing business in the state. In either \n     situation, neither party faced a threat of bias if the action \n     were to be resolved in state court. For example, today under \n     1332(c), if a corporation incorporated in Delaware has its \n     principal place of business in Florida it is deemed a citizen \n     of both Delaware and Florida. If a Florida citizen or a \n     Delaware citizen sues that corporation, diversity \n     jurisdiction would be defeated because both the plaintiff and \n     defendant would be citizens from the same State (Florida or \n     Delaware).\n       Federal courts have struggled with applying this statute \n     when an action involves a U.S. corporation with foreign \n     contacts or foreign corporations that operate in the United \n     States. This difficulty occurs because section 1332(c)(1) \n     makes no reference to a corporation with either of these two \n     types of foreign contacts (country of incorporation or \n     principal place of doing business). Some courts have noted \n     that because the word ``States'' in the subsection begins \n     with a capital ``S,'' it applies only to States of the Union, \n     as well as U.S. territories, the District of Columbia, and \n     Puerto Rico, as defined in section 1332(d). Other courts have \n     concluded that the word ``States'' should mean foreign \n     states, as well as States of the Union, when applying section \n     1332(c)(1).\n       The amendment in this section would adopt the majority view \n     of courts interpreting the language by inserting the words \n     ``foreign state'' in two places in section 1332(c)(1) to make \n     it clear that all corporations, foreign and domestic, would \n     be regarded as citizens of both their place of incorporation \n     and their principal place of business. Such an approach \n     builds upon the long-standing recognition that federal \n     diversity and alienage jurisdiction seek to address the \n     problem of perceived bias that results when non-citizens must \n     litigate in a state court against opposing parties who are \n     citizens of that state (or foreign state), either by virtue \n     of its place of incorporation or by virtue of its principal \n     place of business. See C. Wright & M. Kane, The Law of \n     Federal Courts, 170 (6th ed. 2002). In addition to clarifying \n     the application of the statute regarding corporate \n     citizenship, the amendment would bring about a modest \n     reduction in the diversity workload of the federal courts. It \n     would not, however, deprive a corporation of access to a \n     federal forum where there is a threat of local bias in state \n     court. Moreover, the change made by this amendment tracks the \n     definition of corporate citizenship recently codified in the \n     Multiparty, Multiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002 (Pub. \n     L. No. 107-273).\n       The second change in this amendment is to revise the \n     working of section 1332(c)(1) so that a corporation shall be \n     deemed a citizen of ``every State and foreign state by which \n     it has been incorporated,'' instead of ``any State. . . .'' \n     Although corporations can incorporate in more than one state, \n     the practice is rare. In applying the subsection, most courts \n     have treated such multistate corporations as citizens of \n     every state by which they have been incorporated. The \n     amendment would codify the majority view, treating \n     corporations as citizen of every state of incorporation for \n     diversity purposes. See C. Wright & M. Kane, The Law of \n     Federal Courts, 167-68 (6th ed. 2002).\n\n                 Sec. 115. Reporting of Wiretap Orders.\n\n       Currently, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(1) requires that federal and \n     state judges submit a report to the Administrative Office no \n     later than 30 days after the expiration of an approved order, \n     or the denial of an order, for a wiretap. Certain judges \n     submit numerous reports to the Administrative Office \n     throughout the year. For example, one state judge in 1999 \n     approved 70 wiretap orders, and therefore, was required to \n     submit 70 separate reports. Federal and state prosecutors are \n     required by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(2) to submit information \n     relating to wiretap orders they applied for during the \n     preceding calendar year once in January.\n       The individual reports submitted by judges are not \n     processed by the Administrative Office until the prosecutors \n     submit their summary reports. The prosecutor's reports are \n     then matched to the judge's reports to complete the set of \n     information published by the Administrative Office in the \n     annual Wiretap Report.\n\n[[Page S5087]]\n\n       The proposed section would permit judges to submit annual \n     summary reports on wiretap orders acted on during the \n     previous calendar year, just as prosecutors do. This would \n     simplify the reporting requirements for the judges and their \n     staffs, without impacting the accuracy or timeliness of the \n     reporting required by the statute.\n\n    Sec. 116. Magistrate Judge Participation at Circuit Conferences.\n\n       This section amends section 333 of title 28 of the United \n     States Code to include magistrate judges among the judicial \n     officers who may by statute be summoned to attend circuit \n     judicial conferences. Magistrate judges conduct a wide \n     variety of pretrial proceedings in criminal and civil cases \n     with consent of the parties. Magistrate judges are regularly \n     invited by chief circuit judges to attend circuit judicial \n     conferences in all circuits. They were not included in \n     section 333 upon its enactment in 1939 because the modern \n     office of magistrate judge was not created until 1968. The \n     amendment updates the statute to reflect the significant \n     contributions of magistrate judges to the federal courts and \n     the value of their attendance at circuit judicial conferences \n     where the business of the courts in each circuit is \n     considered.\n\n Sec. 117. Repeal of Obsolete Speedy Trial Act Cross References to the \n                  Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act.\n\n       This provision amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3161 to remove cross \n     references to the now repealed 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2902. The \n     Children's Health Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-310, Div. B, \n     Sec. 3405(c)(1), 114 Stat. 1221 (Oct. 17, 2000), repealed \n     chapter 175 of title 28, United Sates Code (28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 2901-2906), which was entitled, ``Civil Commitment \n     and Rehabilitation of Narcotics Addicts.'' The repeal of \n     chapter 175 of title 28 eliminated long obsolete provisions \n     of title 28 that were enacted as title I of the Narcotic \n     Addict Rehabilitation Act, Pub. L. No. 89-793, 80 Stat. 1438 \n     (Nov. 8, 1966) (NARA) which had not been used in decades \n     since it was completely defunded in the late 1970's. See \n     discussion in United States v. Butler, 676 F.Supp. 88 \n     (W.D.Pa. 1988).\n       There remain, however, three references to 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2902 in the provisions of the Speedy Trial Act, namely, \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 3161(h)(1)(B), (h)(1)(C), and (h)(5) which \n     should be stricken from this statute.\n\n              Sec. 118. Taxing of Court Technology Costs.\n\n       This section would incorporate some of the expenses \n     associated with new courtroom technologies into the \n     assessment of litigation costs against a losing party as \n     provided by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1920. Currently, Sec. 1920 allows \n     a court to include certain limited costs (such as fees of the \n     clerk, marshal, and court reporter; fees for witnesses; court \n     appointed experts, and interpreters; and fees for docketing, \n     printing and copying of papers necessarily obtained for use \n     in the case) into the final judgment or decree of a case. \n     This amendment would update the section to recognize that \n     transcripts are available in electronic form as well as in \n     hard copy. It would also expand the concept of ``papers'' in \n     order to reflect the decreasing use of paper and the \n     increasing use of technology in creating, filing, and \n     exchanging court documents. It would not, however, permit the \n     taxing of costs associated with the use of technology to \n     create, assist, enhance or present materials during a trial.\n\n             Sec. 119. Investment of Court Registry Funds.\n\n       Registry funds are funds received by the courts in the \n     course of litigation. The United States district and \n     bankruptcy courts presently hold about $1.76 billion in \n     registry funds on behalf of thousands of litigants, witnesses \n     and other participants in court proceedings. These moneys are \n     paid into the federal courts to secure judgments or \n     appearance bonds, to begin interpleader or land condemnation \n     actions, and for other judicial purposes. The funds are held \n     and administered by the clerk of the court pending the \n     resolution of the litigation. The registry funds are \n     deposited in accordance with section 2041 of title 28, United \n     States Code, into interest-bearing accounts, e.g. \n     certificates of deposit, at financial institutions that have \n     qualified as designated depositaries of public moneys in \n     accordance with 31 C.F.R. Part 202. The courts also purchase \n     short-term Treasury bills with registry funds. When the \n     courts purchase these bills on the secondary market, the \n     choice of investment instruments is limited and they must pay \n     transaction fees.\n       This section would broaden the courts' investment options \n     and offer an improved procedure for investing in Treasury \n     securities. Under the Treasury's Government Account Series \n     (GAS) program, there are no transaction fees, transactions \n     may be posted daily, and a wider range of Treasury securities \n     is available than the secondary market offers. Also, GAS has \n     full-featured, on-line transaction facilities. Participation \n     in the GAS program would help to reduce the courts' costs in \n     administering registry funds.\n\nSec. 120. Emergency Authority to Conduct Court Proceedings Outside the \n                 Territorial Jurisdiction of the Court.\n\n       This section would authorize circuit, district and \n     bankruptcy courts, as well as magistrate judges, to conduct \n     special sessions outside their respective geographic \n     boundaries upon a finding by the respective chief judge (or, \n     if unavailable, the most senior active judge who is \n     available) or the judicial council of the circuit, that, \n     because of emergency conditions, no location within these \n     boundaries is reasonably available where such special \n     sessions could be held.\n       The need for this legislation has become apparent following \n     the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the impact \n     of these disasters on court operations, in particular in New \n     York City. In emergency conditions, a federal court facility \n     in an adjoining district (or circuit) might be more readily \n     and safely available to court personnel, litigants, jurors \n     and the public than a facility at a place of holding court \n     within the district. This is particularly true in major \n     metropolitan areas such as New York, Washington, D.C., Dallas \n     and Kansas City, where the metropolitan area includes parts \n     of more than one judicial district. The advent of electronic \n     court records systems will facilitate implementation of this \n     authority by providing judges, court staff and attorneys \n     with remote access to case documents.\n\nSec. 121. Restriction of Public Access To Certain Information Contained \n                       in Bankruptcy Case Files.\n\n       This section would implement Judicial Conference policy \n     regarding protection of certain information contained in \n     bankruptcy case files from public disclosure by means of four \n     revisions to section 107 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n       First, the section would transform former subsection (b)(1) \n     regarding protection of trade secret or confidential \n     research, development, or commercial information into a new \n     subsection (b). No substantive change would be made to this \n     provision.\n       Second, the section would create a new subsection (c) to \n     allow the court for cause to authorize the redaction of \n     personal identifiers to protect a debtor, creditor, or other \n     person from identity theft or other harm. The amendment \n     incorporates by reference section 3(d) of the Identity Theft \n     and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 with regard to the \n     types of personal identifiers that may be redacted. These \n     include the debtor's or other person's name, social security \n     account number, date of birth, driver's license number, alien \n     registration number, government passport number, employee or \n     taxpayer identification number, unique biometric data, unique \n     electronic identification number, electronic address or \n     routing code, and telecommunication identifying information \n     or access device. The amendment would also permit the court \n     to exercise its discretion to protect personal identifiers by \n     means other than redaction where appropriate in the \n     circumstances of the case.\n       Third, this new subsection (c) would have the effect of \n     striking from the current provision ``scandalous defamatory \n     matter'' as a basis for protection of a person and instead \n     allow the court for cause to seal or redact ``information \n     that could cause undue annoyance, embarrassment, oppression \n     or risk of injury to person or property.'' This language is \n     drawn from Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 regarding the \n     issuance of protective orders in the course of discovery. \n     This new provision would expand the authority of the \n     bankruptcy court to allow the court to protect information, \n     such as the home or employment address of a debtor, because \n     of a personal security risk, including fear of injury by a \n     former spouse or stalker. It would also allow the court to \n     protect other information normally considered private, such \n     as medical information which, if publicly disclosed, could \n     result in untoward consequences to the debtor or others.\n       Finally, this provision would allow the protection of \n     information under subsection (c) ``contained in a paper \n     filed, or to be filed,'' in a bankruptcy case. This provision \n     is intended to provide persons the opportunity to request \n     protection of the information not only after it is filed with \n     the court, but prior to filings as well. This authority would \n     be especially useful in an electronic filing environment, \n     where information once filed is immediately available to the \n     public.\n\n   Sec. 122. Security of Social Security Account Number of Debtor in \n                  Notice Debtor Provides to Creditor.\n\n       This provision would implement Judicial Conference policy \n     that social security account numbers be protected from public \n     disclosure in court documents.\n       Section 342(c) of title 11, United States Code, currently \n     requires a debtor to include his or her taxpayer \n     identification number, which for an individual is almost \n     uniformly his or her social security account number, on any \n     notice the debtor gives to his or her creditors. Debtors are \n     required to give such notice in various contexts, including \n     the filing of adversary proceedings, such as a compliant to \n     determine the dischargeability of a debt, or contested \n     matters, such as a motion to avoid a lien impairing an \n     exemption.\n       As a copy of such notice is required to be filed with the \n     court, court files routinely include unredacted social \n     security numbers of debtors. By requiring only the last four \n     digits of a taxpayer identification number to appear on the \n     notice, the debtor's full social security number will no \n     longer appear in the court file and thus be protected from \n     public disclosure.\n\n\ntitle ii--judiciary personnel administration, benefits, and protections\n\n   Sec. 201. Disability Retirement and Cost-of-Living Adjustments of \n                   Annuities for Territorial Judges.\n\n       The judges of the district courts of Guam, the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands are appointed by the \n     President and confirmed by the Senate for ten-year\n\n[[Page S5088]]\n\n     terms. Retirement benefits for territorial judges are set \n     forth in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 373. Under this provision, a \n     territorial judge may retire from office under any of the \n     following three circumstances: (1) after meeting the same \n     ``rule of 80'' age and service requirements applicable to \n     Article III judges; (2) after serving at least 10 years, if \n     removed by the President solely on grounds of mental or \n     physical disability; or (3) at the end of a term, if not \n     reappointed. An annuity equal to the pre-retirement salary, \n     or prorated, in cases of disability or failure of \n     reappointment, for judges with less than 15 years of service, \n     is payable beginning at the time of retirement or upon \n     attaining the age of 65 years, whichever is later. For judges \n     who retire under the ``rule of 80'', the annuity is subject \n     to the same cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) as annuities \n     payable under the Civil Service Retirement System, provided \n     that such adjustments cannot result in a total annuity \n     greater than 95 percent of an Article II judge's salary.\n       The retirement arrangements for these four territorial \n     judges compare unfavorably with analogous provisions for \n     bankruptcy judges, magistrate judges, and judges of the Court \n     of Federal Claims (compare 28 U.S.C. Sec. 373 with 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 178 and 377) in that (1) territorial judges cannot \n     retire if removed from office by the President on disability \n     grounds before completing 10 years of service (as compared \n     with five years of other non-Article III judges) and, even \n     then, no annuity is payable until age 65 (no age restriction \n     for other judges) and (2) territorial judges not retired at \n     age 65 or older with combined age and service equal to \n     eighty (``rule of 80'') do not get COLAs and even those \n     retired under the ``rule of 80'' do not get COLAs until \n     salaries of active judges have increased enough to \n     accommodate the 95 percent limitation. There is no \n     rationale for perpetuating these differences between \n     territorial judges and other non-Article III judges.\n       In addition, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 373(c)(4) currently appears to \n     permit only those recalled territorial judges who retired on \n     a ``rule of 80'' basis to receive the same compensation, \n     travel, and other expenses as a judge on active duty with the \n     court, in lieu of their annuities.\n       Accordingly, subsection (1) of this section makes a \n     technical amendment to section 373(c)(4) that reflects the \n     fact that any territorial judge retiring under 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 373 may elect to be a ``senior judge'' eligible for \n     recall service and, therefore, should be eligible to receive \n     the same compensation as an active judge on the court being \n     served.\n       Subsection (2) of this section eliminates existing \n     inequities between territorial judges and magistrate judges \n     and bankruptcy judges by permitting territorial judges with \n     five or more years of service to retire on an immediate \n     disability annuity. The annuity would be equal to 40 percent \n     of salary if the judge has less than ten years of service, \n     and is adjusted upward in the proportion that the number of \n     years of service bears to fifteen for service of ten years or \n     more.\n       Subsection (3) of this section applies the COLA provision \n     of title 5 to all retired territorial judges, subject only to \n     the limitation that the annuity may not exceed the salary of \n     a judge in regular active service with the court on which the \n     retired judge served before retiring.\n\n          Sec. 202. Federal Judicial Center Personnel Matters.\n\n       This section would restore the historic parity in the \n     salary levels of the Federal Judicial Center's senior staff \n     and that of the Administrative Office of the United States \n     Courts by authorizing the Director of the Center to set the \n     compensation of a limited number of Center professional \n     employees at levels equivalent to Level IV of the Executive \n     Schedule pay rates. The proposed language would limit the \n     Federal Judicial Center to increases in four positions. The \n     section also corrects a misspelling in the original statute.\n\n      Sec. 203. Annual Leave Limit for Judicial Branch Executives.\n\n       The amendment in this section is designed to afford senior \n     executives in the courts and the Federal Judicial Center the \n     same right to leave carryover (720 hours) as employees in \n     comparable positions in the executive branch and in the \n     Administrative Office. It would make applicable to these \n     executives the 720-hour maximum carryover amount of annual \n     leave established for members of the executive branch's \n     Senior Executive Services, in Government Management Reform \n     Act of 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103-356), and for senior executives \n     in the Administrative Office, as a result of the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts Personnel \n     Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-474.\n       The amendment would affect approximately 400 court unit \n     executives, including circuit executives, clerks of the \n     courts of appeals, district court clerks, district court \n     executives, bankruptcy court clerks, clerk of the Court of \n     International Trade, clerk of the United States Court of \n     Federal Claims, chief probation officers, chief pretrial \n     services officers, senior staff attorneys, chief preargument \n     attorneys, bankruptcy administrators, and circuit librarians. \n     It would also affect five positions in the Federal Judicial \n     Center.\n\n                Sec. 204. Supplemental Benefits Program.\n\n       The purpose of this section is to authorize the judiciary \n     to provide its employees with a benefits package that is more \n     competitive with those already provided throughout the \n     private sector, state governments, colleges and universities, \n     and the banking agencies in the executive branch. The Federal \n     Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation recognized the need \n     to improve benefits and were granted authority by Congress to \n     offer these same enhanced benefits.\n       In January 2001 the General Accounting Office issued a \n     report, ``High-Risk Series: An Update'' (GAO-01-263) which \n     describes four key challenges to the federal government as an \n     employer, paramount among them was ``acquiring and developing \n     staffs whose size, skills, and deployment meet agency \n     needs.'' The Judiciary, like the rest of the federal \n     government, must recruit and retain employees with the proper \n     skill mix in a competitive labor market. Over the next five \n     years, the judiciary is at risk to lose 40 percent of its \n     employee population to retirement. Also, the judiciary faces \n     the additional challenges of recruiting staff nationwide, \n     including in competitive labor markets in major urban areas.\n       The Judicial Conference of the United States has concluded \n     that a comprehensive benefit program which responds to the \n     current and future needs of the judiciary's workforce is \n     essential to allow the judiciary to compete for the skilled \n     employees that make up that workforce. The need for this \n     authority is urgent. Severe budget constraints will only \n     allow this program to be gradually implemented over a period \n     of years. The personnel management problem it is intended to \n     ameliorate is fast approaching.\n\n       Sec. 205. Student Loan Forgiveness for Federal Defenders.\n\n       This provision amends section 465(a)(2)(F) of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Crime Control Act of \n     1990 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1087ee(a)(2)(F)), to extend the \n     categories of borrowers eligible for loan cancellation to \n     include full-time federal defenders. Under section \n     465(a)(2)(F), a borrower is entitled to cancellation of up to \n     100 percent (phased in over five years of employment in a \n     qualifying agency) of a Perkins Loan made on or after \n     November 15, 1990, for full-time service as a qualifying law \n     enforcement or corrections officer. While the Department of \n     Education has interpreted the Federal Perkins Loan Program \n     regulations to include prosecuting attorneys under the \n     category of law enforcement officer, it has declined to \n     extend the cancellation benefit administratively to public \n     defenders.\n       Providing federal defenders with the same eligibility for \n     student loan forgiveness as is held by their counterparts in \n     United States attorney offices would be consonant with the \n     parity established in the Criminal Justice Act between their \n     salaries. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3006A(g)(2)(A) (the compensation \n     of the Federal Public Defender shall be fixed at a rate not \n     to exceed the compensation received by the United States \n     attorney for that district, and the compensation for \n     attorneys in a Federal Public Defender Organization shall be \n     fixed at a rate not to exceed that paid to attorneys with \n     similar qualifications and experience in the office of the \n     United States attorney for that district). The underlying \n     principle supporting the eligibility of prosecutors for \n     student loan forgiveness--i.e., that the fundamental \n     fairness, integrity, and credibility of the criminal justice \n     system require the recruitment and retention of persons of \n     the highest intellect, capability, character, and commitment \n     to public service--applies with equal force to the men and \n     women who serve as federal defenders. They should qualify for \n     the same benefit.\n\n                  Sec. 206. Law Clerk Loan Deferment.\n\n       Federal judges and Supreme Court Justices depend on the \n     work of their law clerks. For that reason, each judge and \n     Justice attempts to hire young attorneys with, among other \n     qualities, records of high academic achievement. These same \n     individuals have employment opportunities in the private \n     sector which pay far higher salaries than a judge can offer. \n     Because recent law school graduates frequently have \n     significant amounts of student loan debt, judges face \n     increasingly strong competition to secure highly capable law \n     clerks.\n       Executive Branch agencies are authorized to pay up to six \n     thousand dollars a year to repay an employee's student loan \n     in certain circumstances. Congress has authorized this \n     program to assist agencies to recruit and retain highly \n     qualified individuals as employees. See 5. U.S.C. Sec. 5379. \n     The proposal in this section is considerably less ambitious. \n     It would only authorize judicial law clerks to defer payment \n     of principal and interest on a federally insured loan during \n     the period they serve as clerks.\n\n Sec. 207. Inclusion of Judicial Branch Personnel in Organ Donor Leave \n                                Program.\n\n       In 1999, the Organ Donor Leave Act increased the amount of \n     paid leave to serve as an organ donor from seven days to 30 \n     days each calendar year. The purpose of the law was to \n     enhance the federal government's leadership role in \n     encouraging organ donations by making it easier for federal \n     employees to become donors. The organ donor statute at 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 6327(a) currently applies only to executive \n     branch employees. This amendment extends the statute to the \n     judicial branch.\n\n   Sec. 208. Transportation and Subsistence for Criminal Justice Act \n                              Defendants.\n\n       This section would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 4285 to give courts \n     the authority to order the\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\n     United States Marshals Service to furnish transportation and \n     subsistence for defendants returning home from court \n     proceedings, and subsistence while attending such \n     proceedings, including successive court appearances. The \n     statute currently authorizes courts to order the United \n     States Marshals Service to provide a released defendant with \n     noncustodial transportation and subsistence to the court \n     where that individual's appearance is required, when the \n     interests of justice would be served and the client is \n     financially unable to pay transportation costs.\n       This proposal would eliminate the present anomaly. While \n     there is authority to bring non-custodial indigent defendants \n     to court, there is no authority to provide the wherewithal to \n     allow them to return to their homes, or obtain food and \n     lodging during court proceedings or on the return trip. This \n     section would provide the presiding judge with discretion to \n     order the payment of reasonable travel and subsistence \n     expenses for a defendant who may need the assistance. A \n     preliminary estimate indicates that the cost of such travel \n     and subsistence would be approximately $600,000 annually. \n     When so ordered, such expenses would be paid by the United \n     States Marshals Service from funds authorized by the Attorney \n     General for such expenses.\n\n        Sec. 209. Maximum Amounts of Compensation for Attorneys.\n\n       The courts are required to pay private attorneys for \n     indigent defendants' representation in criminal cases in \n     situations where Federal Defenders are not available. These \n     attorneys file vouchers for approval by the trial judges to \n     obtain these payments. The Criminal Justice Act in 1986 \n     established certain new ``maximums'' or thresholds which, \n     when exceeded, require that the voucher be approved for \n     payment by the chief judge of the circuit in addition to the \n     trial court. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3006A(d)(2)-(3). At that time, \n     the hourly compensation rate was $60 in-court/$40 out-of-\n     court which yielded an average of $45.\n       The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000 raised the case \n     ``maximums'' for compensation for two reasons. In the \n     previous 14 years, the per hour rates had been increased to \n     $75 in-court and $55 out-of-court. Secondly, the 1987 \n     adoption of the Sentencing Guidelines significantly increased \n     attorney time per case.\n       As of May 1, 2002, the hourly rate for indigent attorney \n     representation was increased to $90 per hour for in-court and \n     out-of-court work. The proposal in this section would realign \n     the case ``maximums'' in light of this increase in hourly \n     rates. The percent of increase tracks the percent of increase \n     in the hourly rate. The goal is to ensure that approximately \n     the same percentage of vouchers are sent on to the court of \n     appeals for approval as were sent on when Congress set the \n     ``maximums'' in 1986 and 2000.\n       The purpose of this proposal is to provide prompt as \n     possible payment to the attorneys who volunteer to the court \n     to do representation work. Even at $90 per hour, well more \n     than half of this compensation constitutes reimbursement to \n     an attorney for overhead and operating expenses. It is only \n     fair to these volunteer attorneys to keep the number of \n     vouchers which are delayed by two judge approval to a \n     reasonable portion of the total number. A secondary goals is \n     to relieve administration burdens on court of appeals judges \n     to the maximum extent reasonable.\n\n   Sec. 210. Maximum Amounts of Compensation for Services Other Than \n                                Counsel.\n\n       This section increases the approval thresholds for payment \n     vouchers for services of investigators, experts, and other \n     service providers by approximately the rate of wage inflation \n     since 1986 (63%), the last year the thresholds were \n     increased. It increases from $300 to $500 the amount which \n     could be expended for investigative, expert, and other \n     services without prior judicial approval, and increases from \n     $1,000 to $1,600 the amount which cannot be paid out for such \n     services without the approval of the chief judge of the court \n     of appeals or an active judge of the court of appeals to whom \n     the chief judge has delegated this authority. (18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3006A(e).) The cost of professional services has risen \n     since 1986, resulting in a much greater percentage of \n     vouchers being submitted to the chief judges of the courts of \n     appeals for review. This delays payment to service providers \n     and increases the administrative burden of judicial officers.\n\n          Sec. 211. Excess Compensation Delegation Authority.\n\n       This section expands the delegation authority of the chief \n     judge of the court of appeals with respect to approving \n     vouchers in excess of the statutory maximums submitted by \n     panel attorneys and investigative, expert, and other service \n     providers. Chief judges of the circuits currently review and \n     approve vouchers in excess of the statutory maximums after \n     the court before which the services were provided certifies \n     that the excess amount is necessary to provide fair \n     compensation. The proposed amendments would widen the pool \n     (now limited to active circuit judges) of possible \n     individuals to whom the chief judge may delegate such \n     approval authority to include any senior circuit judge or an \n     ``appropriate non-judicial officer qualified by training and \n     legal experience.'' The amendments also provide that a \n     claimant may seek review by the circuit chief judge of a \n     reduction made by any delegate in the amount that had been \n     certified as necessary for fair compensation by the court \n     before which the services were provided. The judiciary \n     believes that the expanded delegation will accomplish the \n     goal of enhanced supervision without compromising judicial \n     responsibility for ensuring fair compensation for panel \n     attorneys and other service providers.\n       In 1986, in response to a request from the circuit chief \n     judges, the judiciary proposed and Congress enacted \n     amendments to subsections (d)(3) and (e)(3) of the Criminal \n     Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3006A, to provide that the chief \n     judge of the circuit may delegate the excess compensation \n     approval authority to an active circuit judge. At that time, \n     the chief judges had expressed concern regarding the \n     administrative burden of reviewing excess claim vouchers. \n     Currently, with the large growth in the number of excess \n     compensation claims, the circuit chief judges have indicated \n     that the administration of the compensation system would be \n     further enhanced by expanded delegation authority. By \n     broadening the pool of persons to whom the chief judge may \n     delegate his or her excess compensation approval authority, \n     the chief judge will be better able to designate a person \n     whose background fully equips him or her to decide upon the \n     appropriate amounts of compensation for the services \n     rendered. Moreover, in requiring that any non-judge designee \n     be qualified by training and legal experience, the proposed \n     amendments ensure accountability and effectiveness in voucher \n     review. As a further safeguard for fair compensation, the \n     amendments permit an attorney or other services provider to \n     seek the circuit chief judge's review of a reduction made by \n     the delegate.\n\n Sec. 212. Protection Against Malicious Recording of Fictitious Liens \n                        Against Federal Judges.\n\n       In recent years, members of the federal judiciary have been \n     victimized by persons seeking to intimidate or harass them by \n     the filing of false liens against the judge's real or \n     personal property. These liens are usually filed in an effort \n     to harass a judge who has presided over a criminal or civil \n     case involving the filer, or who has otherwise acted against \n     the interests or perceived interests of the filer, his \n     family, or his acquaintances. These liens are also filed to \n     harass a judge against whom a civil action has been initiated \n     by the individual who has filed the lien. Often, such liens \n     are placed on the property of judges based on the allegation \n     that the property is at issue in the lawsuit. While the \n     incidences of filing such liens have occurred in all regions \n     of the country, they are most prevalent in Washington and \n     other western states.\n       The responsibility to initiate legal action to remove these \n     liens typically falls upon Assistant United States Attorneys \n     (``AUSA''), who represent the judges. The forms of response \n     vary according to the state law and the circumstances. It is \n     sometimes necessary for the AUSA to bring action in state \n     court for the removal of liens. In some circumstances, an \n     action to remove the liens may be brought in federal court, \n     and in others, state court proceedings are commenced and \n     removed to federal court under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1452. In some cases, the AUSA may seek an injunction \n     against further filing of liens by the litigant. All of these \n     methods are difficult and time consuming.\n       The pendency of these liens prior to their removal has \n     caused some judges great inconvenience and personal financial \n     difficulty. There is no current federal statute under which \n     persons engaging in this tactic may be prosecuted. Thus, a \n     new federal criminal sanction is needed to deter the \n     practice. This proposal would create a new provision in the \n     federal criminal code, punishing any person who files a false \n     lien or encumbrance against the property of any federal \n     Judge. The new statute would provide a maximum sentence on \n     the first offense of up to five years.\n\n         Sec. 213. Appointing Authority for Circuit Librarians.\n\n       This section amends Section 713 of title 28, United States \n     Code, to provide that circuit librarians shall be selected \n     and hired by the circuit council rather than the circuit \n     court of appeals. In recognition of the fact that circuit \n     librarians assist judges and clerks from all courts, \n     including district, bankruptcy and magistrate judges as well \n     as appellate court judges, it is more appropriate for the \n     circuit judicial council to hire the circuit librarian, \n     rather than the appellate court.\n\n            Sec. 214. Judicial Branch Security Requirements.\n\n       This section would enhance the ability of the Judicial \n     Conference to determine the security required for the \n     protection of judges, court employees, law enforcement \n     officers, jurors and other members of the public who are \n     regularly in federal courthouses and other buildings used by \n     the Judicial Branch. The judiciary has the ability to make a \n     determination of its requirements in all other areas of \n     operations. Only in security, perhaps the most critical area, \n     does the judiciary lack the authority to determine basic \n     requirements.\n       Currently, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) and the General \n     Services Administration (GSA) share the responsibility for \n     judiciary security. In recent years, the judiciary has been \n     transferring to the USMS increasing amounts of funding for \n     court security officers and courthouse security equipment \n     from the judiciary court security appropriation. Yet, the \n     Judicial Conference currently lacks sufficient information \n     from\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\n     the USMS to fully participate in assessing the effectiveness \n     of the security program upon which the judiciary so heavily \n     depends.\n       The judiciary seeks to work cooperatively with the USMS in \n     setting security requirements, as required by statute. In \n     order for the judiciary to participate in the determination \n     of security requirements, the judiciary will need information \n     from the USMS including, for example, the current security \n     standards, the allocation of personnel, analyses regarding \n     equipment, and resource needs. This information is necessary \n     to help the judiciary determine weaknesses and potential \n     improvements in its security. It will also help the judiciary \n     to provide support for the USMS budget throughout each \n     funding cycle.\n       This section would not alter the responsibility of the USMS \n     for protection of the judiciary in buildings occupied by the \n     courts, pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the \n     GSA and the USMS, under which authority has been delegated to \n     the USMS for the security of federal courthouses. The USMS \n     would still be responsible for the security of the judges and \n     the court facilities. Examples of security requirements which \n     the judiciary could determine include the need for deputy \n     marshals in certain proceedings and whether electronic \n     devices should be allowed into courthouses.\n       With this authority, the judiciary will have a relationship \n     with the USMS that is similar to the one it has with the GSA. \n     The Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \n     has the statutory authority to provide accommodations to the \n     courts, but lacks real property authority. Therefore, the \n     judiciary identifies and defines space requirements for the \n     courts and helps to support the GSA budget request for \n     courthouse construction. The GSA determines how to fulfill \n     the judiciary's space requirements and actually constructs \n     the courthouses. The judiciary seeks this same arrangement \n     with the USMS--a partnership in achieving an end that is \n     agreed to and supported by the judiciary.\n       This section provides the Judiciary Conference with the \n     authority to ``determine'' judiciary security needs. That \n     determination is obviously not intended to mean the USMS is \n     required by law to implement what the determination or \n     assessment may be. It also, obviously, does not mean that \n     Congress is under some obligation to fund what the judiciary \n     ``determines'' it needs. However, it is important for the \n     judiciary to have a voice in setting its own security \n     requirements. This provision would give the judiciary that \n     voice.\n\n     Sec. 215. Bankruptcy, Magistrate, and Territorial Judges Life \n                               Insurance.\n\n       Prior to October 1998, Article III judges had the exclusive \n     right to carry full Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance \n     (FEGLI) coverage into retirement, and many judges relied on \n     this coverage in developing their financial and estate plans. \n     In 1998, after Congress enacted legislation expanding this \n     benefit to all federal employees, the Office of Personnel \n     Management proposed rate changes in FEGLI premiums that would \n     significantly increase for judges the cost of maintaining the \n     insurance and, for older judges, make continued coverage \n     prohibitively expensive. To minimize the impact of this \n     regulatory change, Congress enacted legislation, Public Law \n     No. 106-113 (the ``FEGLI fix''), authorizing the Director of \n     the Administrative Office, on direction of the Judicial \n     Conference, to pay the cost of any increase.\n       Public Law No: 106-518, the Federal Courts Improvement Act \n     of 2000, included a provision extending the ``FEGLI fix'' to \n     the Court of Federal Claims by providing that a retired \n     Claims Court judge is a ``judge of the United States'' for \n     purposes of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) \n     coverage. This section would extend that benefit to \n     Bankruptcy, Magistrate, and Territorial Judges.\n\n Sec. 216. Health Insurance for Surviving Family and Spouses of Judges.\n\n       Federal retirees (executive branch and Congressional \n     employees) and their surviving spouses retain their \n     eligibility for Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) \n     health coverage at the same cost as current employees. In \n     order to carry FEHB coverage into retirement, retirees must \n     have been continuously enrolled (or covered as a family \n     member) in any FEHB plan(s) for the 5 years of service \n     immediately before the date the annuity starts, or for the \n     full period(s) of service since the retiree's first \n     opportunity to enroll (if less than 5 years).\n       Unlike surviving family and spouses of federal employees \n     (and retirees) in the executive branch and Congressional \n     branch, the surviving spouses of Article III judges (not \n     enrolled in the Judicial Survivors' Annuities System) are not \n     eligible to continue Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) \n     in the event of the judge's death. The surviving spouses of \n     employees who have been enrolled for five years or more \n     immediately before their deaths may elect to continue FEHB \n     coverage. The surviving family and spouses of deceased \n     federal judges are not eligible to continue to receive health \n     benefits unless the judge, within the first six months of \n     entering service, elects to participate in a survivors' \n     annuity program.\n       This section would provide the same benefit regarding the \n     FEHB program to surviving family (the spouse or unmarried \n     dependent child under 22 years of age) of a Justice, judge, \n     territorial judge, judge of the Court of Federal Claims, \n     bankruptcy judge or full-time magistrate judge.\n\n  sMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce a bill \nthat would greatly improve the administration and efficiency of our \nFederal court system. The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2004 is an \nattempt to assist our hard working Federal judiciary by replacing \nantiquated processes and bureaucratic hurdles with the necessary tools \nfor the 21st century.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining Senator Hatch and me in supporting \nthis bipartisan measure.\n  In recent years, the job of the Federal judge has changed \nconsiderably. Today, Federal judges at both the trial and appellate \nlevel are hearing more cases with fewer available judicial resources. \nWe have a responsibility to pass legislation that helps them keep up \nwith changing times and circumstances.\n  The judicial branch of Government occupies a place in the \nconstitutional scheme of equal responsibility and importance as the \nCongress and the Presidency. Just like it is the judiciary's duty to \nmete out justice in a neutral and unbiased means, it is this branch's \nduty to provide the requisite tools so that the Federal judiciary can \nmaintain its prominent place in the American system of Government.\n  For the last 20 years I have served on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand I have worked hard to preserve a fair, independent and efficient \njudiciary. To further this goal, this body has passed a number of \nimportant judicial reforms over the past decade. The legislation under \nconsideration today, like those passed in recent years, assists the \nFederal judiciary in achieving its goals and fulfilling its \nconstitutional duties. While I am pleased with many of the reforms that \nhave been implemented in recent years, other necessary measures that \nhave been considered have not been implemented.\n  For example, last year I introduced legislation that would have \nprovided Federal judges with a substantial pay raise as an attempt to \nrectify the fact that Federal judges earn far less than their \ncounterparts in the private sector. I feel that it is completely \nunreasonable that judges do not automatically receive an annual cost-\nof-living adjustment that nearly every other Federal employee receives. \nChief Justice Rehnquist has observed that, ``inadequate compensation \nseriously compromises the judicial independence fostered by life \ntenure. That low salaries might force judges to return to the private \nsector rather than stay on the bench risks affecting judicial \nperformance--instead of serving for life, those judges would serve the \nterms their finances would allow.'' It was for these reasons that I was \nvery disappointed that the legislation was not enacted after it was \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee. While I understand that \nwe are now in a time of record deficits, we should not be so \nconstrained as to jeopardize the independence of our Federal judiciary.\n  I am disappointed that the legislation introduced today does not seek \nto rectify the inadequacy of judicial pay. Nevertheless, it will assist \nthe Federal judiciary by addressing some of its institutional \ninefficiencies and disparities. For example, this bill will strengthen \nthe jury system, establish parity in judicial benefits, protect against \nidentity theft, respond to changes in technology, and recognize the \nimportant role of magistrate judges in our Federal justice system. I am \nhappy to respond to these requests made by the Judicial Conference of \nthe United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2397. A bill to adjust the boundary of the John Muir National \nHistoric Site, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill with my \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, to adjust the boundary of the John Muir \nNational Historic Site. This bill, which is identical to legislation \nintroduced in the House by Representative George Miller, would allow \nthe Park Service to obtain a small parcel of property to create a \nparking area for the John Muir National Historic Site. This would make \naccess to the site much easier.\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\n  Naturalist John Muir lived in Martinez, CA, from 1890 until his death \nin 1914. While living in Martinez, Muir served as the first president \nand one of the founders of the Sierra Club, played a prominent role in \nthe creation of several national parks, and wrote numerous articles and \nbooks on the importance of conservation. In 1964, John Muir's former \nresidence became part of the National Park Service. Designated as a \nNational Historic Site, John Muir's estate provides valuable open space \nin the San Francisco Bay area.\n  In 1988, Congress enacted legislation to expand the John Muir \nHistoric Site. Included in this site expansion was a 3.3 acre parcel of \nland owned by the city of Martinez, which was donated by the city to \nthe National Park Service. Following a survey conducted as part of the \ndevelopment of the General Management Plan, the Park Service discovered \nthat a two-tenths acre triangle adjacent to the acquired parcel did not \nappear to have an owner.\n  Enactment of this legislation would allow the Park Service to either \nacquire the land, if an heir or owner is identified, or condemn the \nproperty if an heir or owner is not found. When the title to the land \nis clear, the Park Service wants to construct a parking area in order \nto meet the growing needs of the site users. This 9,500 square foot \naddition to the John Muir National Historic Site would allow the \nproposed parking area to accommodate school busses and provide 12 \nadditional parking spaces.\n  This bill authorizes a noncontroversial boundary adjustment and is \nsupported by Contra Costa County and the city of Martinez. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n   S. 2398. A bill to designate the Federal building located at 324 \nTwenty-fifth Street in Ogden, Utah, as the James V. Hansen Building; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation along with \nSenator Bennett to designate the Federal building located at 324 \nTwenty-fifth Street in Ogden, Utah, as the James V. Hansen Federal \nBuilding.\n  I am pleased to introduce this measure today to honor my friend from \nUtah, former Congressman Jim Hansen. I am joined by my colleague \nSenator Bennett, who has also worked extensively with Congressman \nHansen on issues important to the people of Utah.\n  Congressman Hansen retired last year after serving in the United \nStates House of Representatives, representing Utah's First \nCongressional District, for 22 years. Before his 11 terms in Congress, \nhe served in the Utah State Legislature for 8 years, where he ascended \nto the role of speaker of the Utah House of Representatives. For 12 \nyears, he served on the Farmington City Council. He is a veteran of the \nKorean War and served in the United States Navy.\n  Congressman Hansen has served the people of Utah with great \ndistinction in the House of Representatives. He served as the Chairman \nof the House Resources Committee, as a senior member on the Armed \nServices Committee, and as a member of the House Ethics Committee,. He \nis one of the three founders of the Western Caucus and served as its \nchairman from 1988 to 1999.\n  While serving as the Chairman of the Resources Committee, Congressman \nHansen guided hundreds of difficult and complex bills through the \nlegislative process. He sponsored numerous pieces of legislation to \nprotect land in Utah and the Arizona Strip, and designate wilderness \nlands in Wyoming and Montana.\n  Congressman Hansen proved to be an effective broker in the Congress, \nas he crafted numerous agreements that provided sensible policies to \nencourage multiple use of public lands, preservation of the \nenvironment, and sound economic principles. As the Resources Committee \nChairman, Congressman Hansen facilitated compromises and negotiated \nmany agreements among diverse parties.\n  Congressman Hansen also rose to the role of the ranking member of the \nHouse Armed Services Committee. He was instrumental in helping preserve \nHill Air Force Base through three rounds of base closures. While on the \nCommittee, he led the effort to stop President Clinton's attempt to \ntransfer work being conducted at Hill Air Force Base to California. He \ncame to be known as an expert leader on defense issues, and he has a \ndistinguished reputation for speaking with authority on intricate \nmilitary topics.\n  Congressman Hansen served longer than any member to date on the House \nCommittee on Standards of Official Conduct. His colleagues in the House \nreappointed him three times, and in the third term he served as \nChairman. When Hansen was a freshman in Congress, he worked with \nPresident Ronald Regan to establish the Presidential Commission on \nDrunk Driving. In the first year of the program, the number of deaths \nresulting from drunk driving declined by 4,700.\n  Over the course of his life, Congressman Hansen has built a \nreputation as a decent, commonsense, hard-working public servant. He is \nrespected by members on both sides of the aisle as a straightforward, \nrational lawmaker who works hard to reach sensible solutions.\n  Mr. President, it is only fitting that the Federal building in Ogden \nbear Congressman Hansen's name. He devoted time, energy, and talent to \nimproving the State of Utah. The name of Jim Hansen will bring a level \nof trust, a level of fairness, and a level of understanding to all who \nenter this building. His name will continue to be synonymous with \nexcellence in public service in Utah.\n  Congressman Hansen advocated what was best for his constituents and \nwhat was best for the Nation. I thank Congressman Hansen, and I wish \nhim the best in the activities he chooses to pursue.\n  Senator Bennett and I are pleased to introduce this companion \nlegislation in the Senate. I note that Representative Cannon has \nintroduced a companion bill which has been passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. I hope this measure will be approved by the Senate in \nshort order.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2399. A bill to provide for the improvement of physical activity \nand nutrition and the prevention of obesity for all Americans; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Healthy \nLifestyles Act of 2004 with Senator Kennedy. This bill places the \ncrafting of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans squarely on the \nshoulders of the independent Institute of Medicine of the National \nAcademies of Sciences. This bill also establishes several grant \nprograms to help curb the obesity epidemic that plagues more than one-\nthird of Americans.\n  In the United States, approximately 300,000 of our citizens die each \nyear as a result of being overweight or obese. This information becomes \neven more dire when you consider that 64 percent of adults and 13 \npercent of children and adolescents are overweight, according to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. More staggering, twice as \nmany children and three times as many adolescents are characterized as \noverweight today as in 1980--when the Federal Government, through the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, first published the Dietary Guidelines. \nIn 1990, Congress took a larger role in the establishment of these \nGuidelines and passed legislation requiring the USDA and HHS to review, \nand, if necessary, revise the Guidelines every 5 years.\n  According to the CDC, in 1985, in no State in the union were more \nthan 14 percent of the resident's obese, but in 2001, in every State \nbut Colorado more than 15 percent of residents were obese. My own State \nof Illinois dramatically demonstrates this disturbing trend. According \nto CDC, in 1985, less than 10 percent of Illinois residents were obese. \nBy 2001, between 20 and 24 percent of Illinois residents were obese.\n  Furthermore, according to the CDC, the medical expenses of the \noverweight and obese accounted for 9.1 percent of total U.S. medical \nexpenditures in 1998 and may have reached as high as $78.5 billion. \nApproximately half of these costs were paid by Medicaid and Medicare.\n  It is time to fix this dysfunctional system. By placing the IOM in \ncharge of drafting the Dietary Guidelines, we can help to ensure that \nthe Guidelines\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\nare based upon unbiased, sound, scientific evidence rather than which \norganization has the greatest influence. When dealing with the health \nand welfare of Americans, we can expect no less.\n  Additionally, this measure directs the IOM to examine nutrition \nprograms run by the Federal Government, an important step to discern \nwhether USDA, HHS, and other Federal agencies are properly conducting \nnutrition research.\n  While many factors contribute to this growing health crisis, the \nproblem, in part, may be attributed to a lack of nutrition and fitness \ninformation available to the public, especially among low-income \ngroups. This bill will help our communities to a better job of \neducating Americans about proper nutrition and the serious risks \nassociated with obesity. The Federal Government can fund all the \nresearch that it wants, but that research will do no good unless it is \nproperly communicated to the public.\n  This legislation empowers schools, local and State governments, and \nemployers, through grant programs, to establish obesity-prevention \ninitiatives. We can only limit the prevalence of obesity in America by \nempowering the individual through grassroots and community programs to \nchange their eating and exercise behaviors. Obesity is not only a \npreventable disease, it is a curable disease. By encouraging more \nphysical activity and better eating habits, we can help reduce the size \nof waistbands in America and help curb heart disease, type II diabetes \nrates, and other obesity-related diseases.\n  In communities at risk for poor nutrition, this legislation provides \ngrant funding to help promote the consumption of foods that are \nconsistent with the Dietary Guidelines and to promote water as the main \ndaily drink choice for people. The measure provides grants to train \nhealth professionals and health science students in identifying, \npreventing, and treating obesity-related conditions.\n  With 64 percent of the people in our country classified as overweight \nor obese, it is obvious that the Dietary Guidelines and Federal \nnutrition monitoring programs have failed. I thank Senator Kennedy for \njoining me today to introduce the Healthy Lifestyles Act of 2004. We \nowe it to the American people to disseminate unbiased, sound, \nscientific nutrition information. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nFitzgerald in introducing the Healthy Lifestyles Act. This important \nbill will give families greater access to practical information on \nnutrition and physical activity and enable Americans of all ages, \nespecially the young, to live healthier, fitter, and longer lives.\n  Two-thirds of our citizens are overweight. The cost of diseases \nassociated with obesity has been estimated at $117 billion each year. \nPhysical inactivity and unhealthy eating, the two primary causes, are \nresponsible for at least 300,000 preventable deaths each year in the \nUnited States, and they increase the risk of many chronic diseases, \nincluding cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\n  Environments that promote poor nutrition and sedentary lifestyles are \nmajor causes of this public health epidemic. The numerous messages and \nadvertisements from various sources about what and how much to eat have \nproduced serious public confusion about good nutrition. Many citizens \nwould like to be more active but live in ways that discourage exercise \nand vigorous lifestyles that involve walking, bicycling, or other \nsimilar activities.\n  The Healthy Lifestyles Act is a major step in addressing these \nchallenges. It establishes a partnership between the Department of \nHealth and Human Services and the Institute of Medicine to conduct a \ncomprehensive assessment of what is being done by whom on nutrition \nguidelines and education. The Institute of Medicine is eminently \nrespected for its scientifically sound opinions on health issues. Its \nstudy will provide indispensable oversight for the development and \ndissemination of national nutrition guidelines, and an independent \nimpartial source of nutrition information for the public.\n  The legislation also supports community outreach programs to support \nhealthy nutrition and physical activity. Communities will be able to \nconduct campaigns encouraging consumption of healthy foods, and after-\nschool programs will be available to encourage exercise and good \nnutrition for children. Support will be available for each state for \nobesity prevention and control programs, to encourage coordinated \nongoing efforts to enhance awareness of guidelines for healthy eating \nand activity.\n  Finally, the legislation assures that the information will be widely \navailable to the public and to health professionals. State-of-the-art \ncurricula will be developed to educate and train professionals about \nnutrition education and counseling.\n  The Healthy Lifestyles Act is only a first step in preventing \nunhealthy nutrition environments by ensuring consistency and high \nquality in dietary information, and improving physical activity in our \ncommunities. Working together we can halt this worsening public health \nepidemic. I commend Senator Fitzgerald for his leadership, and I urge \nour colleagues in Congress to support the Healthy Lifestyles Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5094-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5094-S5095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 356--CONDEMNING THE ABUSE OF IRAQI PRISONERS AT ABU \n   GHRAIB PRISON, URGING A FULL AND COMPLETE INVESTIGATION TO ENSURE \n  JUSTICE IS SERVED, AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR ALL AMERICANS SERVING \n                             NOBLY IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, \nMr. Burns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Campbell, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nChafee, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nDayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Graham of South \nCarolina, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, \nMr. Hollings, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \nLott, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Miller, \nMs. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Sununu, Mr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \nWyden) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 356\n\n       Whereas the United States was founded on the principles of \n     representative government, the rule of law, and the \n     unalienable rights of individuals;\n       Whereas those principles are the birthright of all \n     individuals and the fulfillment of those principals in Iraq \n     would benefit the people of Iraq, the people of the Middle \n     East, and the people of the United States;\n       Whereas the vast majority of Americans in Iraq are serving \n     courageously and with great honor to promote a free and \n     stable Iraq and through such service are promoting the values \n     and principles that the people of the United States hold \n     dear;\n       Whereas Americans serving abroad throughout the history of \n     the United States, both military and civilian, have \n     established a reputation for setting the highest standards of \n     personal, professional, and moral conduct;\n       Whereas in January 2004, a member of the United States \n     Armed Forces reported alleged abuses perpetrated in Abu \n     Ghraib prison during November and December 2003;\n       Whereas an inquiry into those alleged abuses was ordered in \n     January 2004, and that inquiry is reported to have found \n     numerous incidents of criminal abuses by a small number of \n     Americans based in Iraq;\n       Whereas the reaction to the alleged abuses is having a \n     negative impact on the United States efforts to stabilize and \n     reconstruct Iraq and to promote democratic values in the \n     Middle East and could affect the security of the United \n     States Armed Forces serving abroad;\n       Whereas Congress was not informed about the extent of the \n     alleged abuses until reports about the abuses became public \n     through the media;\n       Whereas success in the national security policy of the \n     United States demands regular communication between the \n     President, the agencies and departments of the executive \n     branch, Congress, and the people of the United States;\n       Whereas, in an interview on May 5, 2004, the President \n     stated ``First, people in Iraq must understand that I view \n     those practices as abhorrent. They must also understand that \n     what took place in that prison does not represent America \n     that I know. The America I know is a compassionate country \n     that believes in freedom. The America I know cares about \n     every individual. The America I know has sent troops into \n     Iraq to promote freedom--good, honorable citizens that are \n     helping the Iraqis every day.'';\n       Whereas in that interview the President further stated \n     ``It's also important for the\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\n     people of Iraq to know that in a democracy, everything is not \n     perfect, that mistakes are made. But in a democracy, as well, \n     those mistakes will be investigated and people will be \n     brought to justice. We're an open society. We're a society \n     that is willing to investigate, fully investigate in this \n     case, what took place in that prison. That stands in stark \n     contrast to life under Saddam Hussein. His trained torturers \n     were never brought to justice under his regime. There were no \n     investigations about mistreatment of people. There will be \n     investigations. People will be brought to justice.''; and\n       Whereas the pursuit of truth and justice are core \n     principles of the United States, and if the Government of the \n     United States conducts a full investigation of the alleged \n     abuses and holds accountable the individuals who are \n     responsible for such abuses, the people of Iraq and of the \n     Middle East will witness how a democracy upholds the rule of \n     law and protects the rights of individuals by administering \n     justice in a swift, transparent, and fair manner: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends all Americans serving nobly abroad who are \n     advancing the ideals of freedom and democracy, and working, \n     through the individual and collective actions of such \n     individuals, to improve the lives of all the people of Iraq;\n       (2) condemns in the strongest possible terms the despicable \n     acts at Abu Ghraib prison and joins with the President in \n     expressing apology for the humiliation suffered by the \n     prisoners in Iraq and their families;\n       (3) urges the Government of the United States to take \n     appropriate measures to ensure that such acts do not occur in \n     the future;\n       (4) believes that it is in the interests of the United \n     States and of the people of the United States that the \n     appropriate committees of the Senate, exercising the \n     oversight responsibilities of such committees, and the \n     President, through the appropriate departments or agencies of \n     the executive branch, conduct a full investigation of the \n     abuses alleged to have occurred at Abu Ghraib; and\n       (5) urges that all individuals responsible for such \n     despicable acts be held accountable.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 105--DESIGNATING THE SECOND WEEK OF MARCH \n                 2005 AS ``EXTENSION LIVING WELL WEEK''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina submitted an amendment intended \nto be proposed by him to the bill S. 1637, to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to comply with the World Trade Organization \nrulings on the FSC/ETI benefit in a manner that preserves jobs and \nproduction activities in the United States, to reform and simplify the \ninternational taxation rules of the United States, and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 501. NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING CURRENCY VALUATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The currency of the People's Republic of China, known \n     as the yuan or renminbi, is artificially pegged at a level \n     significantly below its market value. Economists estimate the \n     yuan to be undervalued by between 15 percent and 40 percent \n     or an average of 27.5 percent.\n       (2) The undervaluation of the yuan provides the People's \n     Republic of China with a significant trade advantage by \n     making exports less expensive for foreign consumers and by \n     making foreign products more expensive for Chinese consumers. \n     The effective result is a significant subsidization of \n     China's exports and a virtual tariff on foreign imports.\n       (3) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     intervened in the foreign exchange markets to hold the value \n     of the yuan within an artificial trading range. China's \n     foreign reserves are estimated to be over $350,000,000,000 as \n     of September 2003, and have increased by over \n     $110,000,000,000 in the last 12 months.\n       (4) China's undervalued currency, China's trade advantage \n     from that undervaluation, and the Chinese Government's \n     intervention in the value of its currency violates the spirit \n     and letter of the world trading system of which the People's \n     Republic of China is now a member.\n       (5) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     failed to promptly address concerns or to provide a \n     definitive timetable for resolution of these concerns raised \n     by the United States and the international community \n     regarding the value of its currency.\n       (6) Article XXI of the GATT 1994 (as defined in section \n     2(1)(B) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n     3501(1)(B))) allows a member of the World Trade Organization \n     to take any action which it considers necessary for the \n     protection of its essential security interests. Protecting \n     the United States manufacturing sector is essential to the \n     interests of the United States.\n       (b) Negotiations and Certification Regarding the Currency \n     Valuation Policy of the People's Republic of China.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding the provisions of title I \n     of Public Law 106-286 (19 U.S.C. 2431 note), on and after the \n     date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, unless a certification described in paragraph (2) has \n     been made to Congress, in addition to any other duty, there \n     shall be imposed a rate of duty of 27.5 percent ad valorem on \n     any article that is the growth, product, or manufacture of \n     the People's Republic of China, imported directly or \n     indirectly into the United States.\n       (2) Certification.--The certification described in this \n     paragraph means a certification by the President to Congress \n     that the People's Republic of China is no longer acquiring \n     foreign exchange reserves to prevent the appreciation of the \n     rate of exchange between its currency and the United States \n     dollar for purposes of gaining an unfair competitive \n     advantage in international trade. The certification shall \n     also include a determination that the currency of the \n     People's Republic of China has undergone a substantial upward \n     revaluation placing it at or near its fair market value.\n       (3) Alternative certification.--If the President certifies \n     to Congress 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act \n     that the People's Republic of China has made a good faith \n     effort to revalue its currency upward placing it at or near \n     its fair market value, the President may delay the imposition \n     of the tariffs described in paragraph (1) for an additional \n     180 days. If at the end of the 180-day period the President \n     determines that China has developed and started actual \n     implementation of a plan to revalue its currency, the \n     President may delay imposition of the tariffs for an \n     additional 12 months, so that the People's Republic of China \n     shall have time to implement the plan.\n       (4) Negotiations.--Beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \n     the United States Trade Representative, shall begin \n     negotiations with the People's Republic of China to ensure \n     that the People's Republic of China adopts a process that \n     leads to a substantial upward currency revaluation within 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act. Because various \n     Asian governments have also been acquiring substantial \n     foreign exchange reserves in an effort to prevent \n     appreciation of their currencies for purposes of gaining an \n     unfair competitive advantage in international trade, and \n     because the People's Republic of China has concerns about the \n     value of those currencies, the Secretary shall also seek to \n     convene a multilateral summit to discuss exchange rates with \n     representatives of various Asian governments and other \n     interested parties, including representatives of other G-7 \n     nations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3138.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE WORLD TRADE \n                   ORGANIZATION DECISION ON INTERNET GAMBLING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Gambling through the Internet, which has grown rapidly, \n     opens up the possibility of immediate, individual, 24-hour \n     access in every home to the full range of wagering \n     opportunities on sporting events or casino-like contests.\n       (2) The number of Internet gambling websites has increased \n     from about 2 dozen to over 2,000 in the last 9 years, with an \n     estimated $5,000,000,000 wagered over the Internet in 2003 \n     alone.\n       (3) Internet gambling fosters criminal activity, as up to \n     90 percent of pathological gamblers commit crimes to pay off \n     their wagering debts.\n       (4) The Department of State has noted that Internet \n     gambling ``represents yet another powerful vehicle for \n     criminals to launder funds from illicit sources as well as to \n     evade taxes'' and the chief of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation's Financial Crimes Section has testified that \n     Internet gambling is a ``haven for money laundering \n     activities''.\n       (5) There are Federal and State laws in the United States \n     which restrict Internet gambling services, and these laws are \n     consistent with the World Trade Organization obligations of \n     the United States.\n       (6) The United States is currently involved in World Trade \n     Organization proceedings in which the nation of Antigua and \n     Barbuda has challenged these laws.\n       (7) A World Trade Organization panel has ruled, as a result \n     of these proceedings, that the United States must allow \n     access to the United States market by foreign Internet \n     gambling businesses.\n       (8) The World Trade Organization is likely to authorize \n     Antigua and Barbuda to impose tariffs on products from the \n     United States unless the United States agrees to change its \n     antigambling laws.\n       (9) The United States benefits from participating in \n     international organizations such as the World Trade \n     Organization, but the United States must also be vigilant \n     about protecting American interests when decisions by such \n     organizations encroach upon United States sovereignty.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States disagrees with the decision of the \n     World Trade Organization panel regarding the Internet \n     gambling laws of the United States, and\n       (2) the United States should vigorously defend its right to \n     enact legislation protecting United States interests against \n     organized crime and money laundering and protecting the \n     integrity of United States sporting events.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/10/senate-section/article/S5167-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n    subcommittee on forestry, conservation and rural revitalization\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.
