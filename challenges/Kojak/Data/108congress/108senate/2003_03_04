We are entrusted with \nthe sacred stewardship of legislating decisions for life and death. Not \nmerely the quality of life is ours to measure, but even the length of \nlife, and for a multitude. Once within our time and hearing a prophetic \nvoice proclaimed Your gospel values in ``a dream'': peace, dignity, \nequality, community. Was it just a dream or the groaning of a great \nprayer asking for an Amen?\n  When we yearn for peace,\n  When power becomes powerless,\n  When riches and poverty meet,\n  When the one language of love unites us,\n  When the courage of our belief is unfettered from special interests,\n  When we see ourselves in the face of the other, the lion and the lamb \nlay down.\n  Your word is revealed. You, Creator God, are present.\n  Divine Wisdom, abide here so that every word spoken and every vote \ncast may be a prayer. The cause and the purpose may always give life, \ndignity, freedom, honor . . . above and beyond personal or factional \npreference.\n  Thus so we pray, One Nation Under God, in the Name of that infinite \nGod, Mystery, Many Faces, Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, Allah, \nYahweh, Jesus Christ.

Also, today the Senate will recess from the \nhours of 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly party caucuses.\n  As a reminder, Senators who desire to speak on the nomination are \nasked to do so during today's session.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. While the acting majority leader is in the Chamber, I say \nthrough him to the majority leader that I certainly am appreciative \nof--and I think I speak for the entire Senate--his setting aside time \nfor Senators to give their maiden speeches. Some may think this is a \nwaste of time. From personal experience, when I gave my first speech on \nthe Senate floor, presiding was David Pryor, and listening in his \noffice was Chuck Grassley. My speech was on the Taxpayers' Bill of \nRights, which I worked on my entire time in the House of \nRepresentatives. The subcommittee chairman did not like the legislation \nand would not do anything on it. To make a long story short, Senator \nPryor sent me a note and said he liked my speech and liked the \nlegislation I was talking about. Senator Grassley also contacted me \nthat day. They were both senior members of the Finance Committee, and \nas a result of their support I was able to get that legislation passed, \nwhich was landmark legislation, putting the taxpayer on a more equal \nfooting with the tax collector.\n  I say to Senator Alexander and others who will give their maiden \nspeeches: People listen. These speeches really are meaningful.\n  I look forward to Senator Alexander's speech. In fact, I will be \njoining with him in the legislation he is going to introduce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3037-6", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first of all, I thank the new Senators who \nare here. I heard my distinguished colleague from Nevada talk a little \nbit about what we are about to embark upon. It is a rich tradition of \nthis body. In the last few years, we have gotten away from having what \nwe call a ``maiden speech.'' It is not the first time we have heard \nfrom our freshmen\n\n[[Page S3038]]\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle, but it does give Members an \nopportunity to focus, as we just heard, on issues that are important to \nindividual Senators but also are important to the American people in \nthe broadest sense.\n  In this body, because we are always on a particular piece of \nlegislation or in Executive Session, this gives us an opportunity to \npause for a moment and shine that spotlight and that focus on an \ninitial speech or discussion.\n  I am delighted we are reaching to the past--not the distant past--to \nsomething we have gotten away from in the last several Congresses, and \nas an initiative by our new Senators are embarking upon what I know \nwill be a great and very meaningful and powerful experience for all of \nus.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair, in my capacity as the Senator \nfrom Alaska, asks the floor staff to notify me when such speeches are \nto be made of any Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the majority leader is in the Chamber, \nI ask unanimous consent that the majority be given a full hour--we have \ntaken some time today--and the Democrats, if necessary, extended 10 \nminutes also. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I first thank the majority leader for \nhis comments and his friendship and his encouragement of the new \nSenators in these first addresses. I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nhis encouragement and his willingness to join me in cosponsoring the \nlegislation that I hope to talk about. I thank my colleagues for taking \nthe time to be here today.\n  From the Senate's earliest days, new Members have observed, as we \njust heard, the ritual of remaining silent for a period of time, \nranging from several weeks to 2 years. By waiting a respectful amount \nof time before giving their so-called ``maiden speeches,'' freshmen \nSenators hoped their senior colleagues would respect them for their \nhumility.\n  This information comes from our Senate historian, Richard Baker, who \ntold me that in 1906 the former Governor of Wisconsin--I am sensitive \nto this as a former Governor--Robert La Follette, arrived here, in Mr. \nBaker's words, ``anything but humble.'' He waited just 3 months, a \nbrief period by the standards of those days, before launching his first \nmajor address. He then spoke for 8 hours over 3 days and his remarks in \nthe Congressional Record consumed 148 pages. As he began to speak, most \nof the Senators present in the Chamber rose from their desks and \ndeparted. La Follette's wife, observing from the gallery, wrote:\n\n       There was no mistaking that this was a polite form of \n     hazing.\n\n  From our first day here, as the majority leader said, we new Members \nof the 108th Congress have been encouraged to speak up, and most of us \nhave. But, with the encouragement of the majority leader and the \nassistant minority leader, several of us intend also to try to revive \nthe tradition of the maiden address by a signature speech on an issue \nthat is important both to the country and to each of us. I thank my \ncolleagues who are here, and I assure all of you that I will not do \nwhat the former Governor of Wisconsin did and speak for 3 days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3038-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3038-S3046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE AMERICAN HISTORY AND CIVICS EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to address the \nintersection of two urgent concerns that will determine our country's \nfuture, and these are also the two topics I care about the most, the \neducation of our children and the principles that unite us as \nAmericans. It is time we put the teaching of American history and \ncivics back in its rightful place in our schools so our children can \ngrow up learning what it means to be an American. Especially during \nsuch serious times when our values and ways of life are being attacked, \nwe need to understand just what those values are.\n  In this, most Americans would agree. For example, in Thanksgiving \nremarks in 2001, President Bush praised our Nation's response to \nSeptember 11. ``I call it,'' he said, ``the American character.'' At \nabout the same time, speaking at Harvard, former Vice President Al Gore \nsaid, ``We should fight for the values that bind us together as a \ncountry.''\n  Both men were invoking a creed of ideas and values in which most \nAmericans believe. ``It has been our fate as a nation,'' the historian \nRichard Hofstadter wrote, ``not to have ideologies but to be one.'' \nThis value-based identity has inspired both patriotism and division at \nhome as well as emulation and hatred abroad. For terrorists, as well as \nthose who admire America, at issue is the United States itself--not \nwhat we do but who we are.\n  Yet our children do not know what makes America exceptional. National \nexams show that three-quarters of the Nation's 4th, 8th, and 12th \ngraders are not proficient in civics knowledge and one-third do not \neven have basic knowledge, making them ``civic illiterates.''\n  Children are not learning about American history and civics because \nthey are not being taught them. American history has been watered down, \nand civics is too often dropped from the curriculum entirely.\n  Until the 1960s, civics education, which teaches the duties of \ncitizenship, was a regular part of the high school curriculum. But \ntoday's college graduates probably have less civic knowledge than high \nschool graduates of 50 years ago. Reforms, so-called, in the 1960s and \n1970s, resulted in widespread elimination of required classes and \ncurriculum in civics education. Today, more than half the States have \nno requirement for students to take a course--even for one semester--in \nAmerican government.\n  To help put the teaching of American history and civics in its \nrightful place, today I introduce legislation on behalf of myself and \ncosponsors, Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator Gregg, Senator Santorum, \nSenator Inhofe, and Senator Nickles. We call it the American History \nand Civics Education Act. The purpose of the act is to create \npresidential academies for teachers of American history and civics, and \ncongressional academies for students of American history and civics. \nThese residential academies would operate for 2 weeks, in the case of \nteachers, and 4 weeks in the case of students, during the summertime. \nTheir purpose would be to inspire better teaching and more learning of \nthe key events, the key persons, and the key ideas that shape the \ninstitutions and democratic heritage of the United States.\n  I had some experience with such residential summer academies when I \nwas Governor of Tennessee. It was a good experience. In 1984, we began \ncreating governor's schools for students and for teachers. We had a \nGovernor's School for the Arts. We had a Governor's School for \nInternational Studies at the University of Memphis, a Governor's School \nfor Teachers of Writing at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, \nwhich was very successful. Eventually there were eight governor's \nschools in our State, and they helped thousands of Tennessee teachers \nimprove their skills and inspired outstanding students in the same way. \nWhen those teachers and students went back to their own schools during \nthe regular school year, their enthusiasm for teaching and learning the \nsubject they had been a part of in the summer infected their peers and \nimproved education across the board. Dollar for dollar, I believe the \ngovernor's schools in our State were the most effective popular \neducation initiatives in our State's history.\n\n  We weren't the only State to try it; many did. The first State \ngovernor's school I heard about was in North Carolina, started by Terry \nSanford when he was Governor in 1963, and then other States have done \nthe same--Georgia, South Carolina, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee. \nIn 1973, Pennsylvania established the Governor's Schools of Excellence, \nwith 14 different programs of study. Mississippi has done the same. \nVirginia's Governor's School is a summer residential program for 7,500 \nof the Commonwealth's most gifted students. Mississippi and West \nVirginia also have similar programs. They are just a few of the more \nthan 100 governor's schools in 28 States. Clearly, the model has proved \nto be a good one.\n  The legislation I propose today applies that successful model to \nAmerican history and civics by establishing\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\npresidential and congressional academies for students and teachers of \nthose subjects.\n  The legislation would do one more thing. It would authorize the \ncreation of a national alliance of American history and civics teachers \nto be connected by the Internet. The alliance would facilitate sharing \nof best practices in the teaching of American history and civics. It is \nmodeled after an alliance I helped the National Geographic Society \nstart in the 1980s. Their purpose was to help put geography back into \nthe school curriculum.\n  This legislation creates a pilot program, up to 12 presidential \nacademies for teachers, 12 congressional academies for students, \nsponsored by educational institutions. The National Endowment for the \nHumanities would reward 2-year renewable grants to those institutions \nafter a peer review process. Each grant would be subject to rigorous \nreview after 3 years to determine whether the overall program should \ncontinue or expand or be stopped. The legislation authorizes $25 \nmillion annually for the 4-year pilot program.\n  There is a broad new basis of support for and interest in American \nhistory and civics in our country. As David Gordon noted in a recent \nissue of the Harvard Education Letter:\n\n       A 1998 survey by the nonpartisan research organization \n     Public Agenda showed that 84 percent of parents with school \n     age children say they believe the United States is a special \n     country and they want our schools to convey that belief to \n     our children by teaching about its heroes and its traditions. \n     Similar numbers identified the American ideal as including \n     equal opportunity, individual freedom, and tolerance and \n     respect for others. Those findings were consistent across \n     racial and ethnic groups.\n\n  Our national leadership has responded to this renewed interest. In \n2000, at the initiative of my distinguished colleague Senator Byrd, \nCongress created grants for schools that teach American history as a \nseparate subject within the school curriculum. We appropriated $100 \nmillion for those grants in the recent omnibus appropriations bill, and \nrightfully so. They encourage schools and teachers to focus on the \nteaching of traditional American history and provide important \nfinancial support.\n\n  Then, last September, with historian David McCullough at his side, \nPresident Bush announced a new initiative to encourage the teaching of \nAmerican history and civics. He established the ``We The People'' \nprogram at the National Endowment for the Humanities, which will \ndevelop curricula and sponsor lectures on American history and civics. \nHe announced the ``Our Documents'' project, run by the National \nArchives. This will take 100 of America's most prominent and important \ndocuments from the National Archives to classrooms everywhere in the \ncountry. This year, the President will convene a White House forum on \nAmerican history, civics, and service. There we can discuss new \npolicies to improve the teaching and learning of those subjects.\n  This proposed legislation takes the next step by training teachers \nand encouraging outstanding students. I am pleased today that one of \nthe leading Members of the House of Representatives, Roger Wicker of \nMississippi, along with a number of his colleagues, is introducing the \nsame legislation in the House of Representatives. I thank Senator \nGregg, the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, for being here and also for agreeing that the committee will \nhold hearings on this legislation so we can determine how it might \nsupplement and work with the legislation enacted last year in this \nCongress and the President's various initiatives.\n  In 1988, I was at a meeting of educators in Rochester when the \nPresident of Notre Dame University asked this question: ``What is the \nrationale for the public school?'' There was an unexpected silence \naround the room until Al Shanker, the president of the American \nFederation of Teachers, answered in this way: ``The public school was \ncreated to teach immigrant children the three R's and what it means to \nbe an American with the hope that they would then go home and teach \ntheir parents.''\n  From the founding of America, we have always understood how important \nit is for citizens to understand the principles that unite us as a \ncountry. Other countries are united by their ethnicity. If you move to \nJapan, you can't become Japanese. Americans, on the other hand, are \nunited by a few principles in which we believe. To become an American \ncitizen, you subscribe to those principles. If there are no agreement \non those principles, Samuel Huntington has noted, we would be the \nUnited Nations instead of the United States of America.\n  There has therefore been a continuous education process to remind \nAmericans just what those principles are. In his retirement at \nMonticello, Thomas Jefferson would spend evenings explaining to \novernight guests what he had in mind when he helped create what we call \nAmerica. By the mid-19th century it was just assumed that most \nAmericans knew what it meant to be an American. In his letter from the \nAlamo, Col. William Barrett Travis pleaded for help simply ``in the \nname of liberty, patriotism and everything dear to the American \ncharacter.''\n  New waves of immigration in the late 19th century brought to our \ncountry a record number of new people from other lands whose view of \nwhat it means to be an American was indistinct--and Americans responded \nby teaching them. In Wisconsin, for example, the Kohler Company housed \nGerman immigrants together so that they might be Americanized during \nnon-working hours.\n\n  But the most important Americanizing institution, as Mr. Shanker \nreminded us in Rochester in 1988, was the new common school. McGuffey's \nReader, which was used in many classrooms, sold more than 120 million \ncopies introducing a common culture of literature, patriotic speeches \nand historical references.\n  The wars of the 20th century made Americans stop and think about what \nwe were defending. President Roosevelt made certain that those who \ncharged the beaches of Normandy knew they were defending for freedoms.\n  But after World War II, the emphasis on teaching and defining the \nprinciples that unite us waned. Unpleasant experiences with McCarthyism \nin the 1950's, discouragement after the Vietnam War, and history books \nthat left out or distorted the history of African-Americans made some \nskittish about discussing ``Americanism.'' The end of the Cold War \nremoved a preoccupation with who we were not, making it less important \nto consider who we are. The immigration law changes in 1965 brought to \nour shores many new Americans and many cultural changes. As a result, \nthe American Way became much more often praised than defined.\n  Changes in community attitudes, as they always are, were reflected in \nour schools. According to historian Diane Ravitch, the public school \nvirtually abandoned its role as the chief Americanizing institution. We \nhave gone, she explains, from one extreme--simplistic patriotism and \nincomplete history--to the other--``public schools with an adversary \nculture that emphasizes the Nation's warts and diminishes its genuine \naccomplishments. There is no literary canon, no common reading, no \nagreed-upon lists of books, poems and stories from which students and \nparents might be taught a common culture and be reminded of what it \nmeans to be an American.''\n  During this time many of our national leaders contributed to this \ndrift toward agnostic Americanism. These leaders celebrated \nmulticulturalism and bilingualism and diversity at a time when there \nshould have been more emphasis on a common culture and learning English \nand unity.\n  America's variety and diversity is a great strength, but it is not \nour greatest strength. Jerusalem is diverse. The Balkans are diverse. \nAmerica's greatest accomplishment is not its variety and diversity but \nthat we have found a way to take all that variety and diversity and \nunite as one country. E pluribus unum: out of many, one. That is what \nmakes America truly exceptional.\n  Since 9/11 things have been different. The terrorists focused their \ncross-hairs on the creed that unites Americans as one country--forcing \nus to remind ourselves of those principles, to examine and define them, \nand to celebrate them. The President has been the lead teacher. \nPresident Bush has literally taken us back to school on what it means \nto be an American. When he took the country to church on television \nafter the attacks he reminded us\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\nthat no country is more religious than we are. When he walked across \nthe street to the mosque he reminded the world that we separate church \nand state and that there is freedom here to believe in whatever one \nwants to believe. When he attacked and defeated the Taliban, he honored \nlife. When we put planes back in the air and opened financial markets \nand began going to football games again we honored liberty. The \nPresident called on us to make those magnificent images of courage and \ncharity and leadership and selflessness after 9/11 more permanent in \nour every day lives. And with his optimism, he warded off doomsayers \nwho tried to diminish the real gift of Americans to civilization, our \ncockeyed optimism that anything is possible.\n  Just after 9/11, I proposed an idea I called ``Pledge Plus Three.'' \nWhy not start each school day with the Pledge of Allegiance--as we did \nthis morning here in the Senate--followed by a faculty member or \nstudent sharing for three minutes ``what it means to be an American.'' \nThe Pledge embodies many of the ideals of our National Creed: ``one \nnation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'' It \nspeaks to our unity, to our faith, to our value of freedom, and to our \nbelief in the fair treatment of all Americans. If more future Federal \njudges took more classes in American history and civics and learned \nabout those values, we might have fewer mind-boggling decisions like \nthe one issued by the Ninth Circuit.\n  Before I was elected to the Senate, I taught some of our future \njudges and legislators a course at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of \nGovernment entitled ``The American Character and America's \nGovernment.'' The purpose of the course was to help policymakrers, \ncivil servants and journalists analyze the American creed and character \nand apply it in the solving of public policy problems. We tried to \nfigure out, if you will, what would be ``the American way'' to solve a \ngiven problem, if such a thing were to exist.\n  The students and I did not have much trouble deciding that America is \ntruly exceptional--not always better, but truly exceptional--or in \nidentifying the major principles of an American creed or the distinct \ncharacteristics of our country; such principles as: liberty, equal \nopportunity, rule of law, laissez faire, individualism, e pluribus \nunum, the separation of church and state.\n  But what we also found was that applying those principles to today's \nissues was hard work. This was because the principles of the creed \noften conflicted. For example, when discussing President Bush's faith-\nbased charity legislation, we knew that ``In God We Trust'' but we also \nknew that we didn't trust government with God.\n  When considering whether the Federal Government should pay for \nscholarships which middle and low income families might use at any \naccredited school--public, private or religious--we found that the \nprinciple of equal opportunity conflicted with the separation of church \nand state.\n  And we found there are great disappointments when we try to live up \nto our greatest dreams; For example, President Kennedy's pledge that we \nwill ``pay any price or bear any burden'' to defend freedom, or Thomas \nJefferson's assertion that ``all men are created equal,'' or the \nAmerican dream that for anyone who works hard, tomorrow will always be \nbetter than today.\n  We often are disappointed when we try to live to those truths.\n  We learned that, as Samuel Huntington has written, balancing these \nconflicts and disappointments is what most of American politics and \ngovernment is about.\n  If, most of our politics and government is about applying to our most \nurgent problems the principles and characteristics that make the United \nStates of America an exceptional country, then we had better get about \nthe teaching and learning of those principles and characteristics.\n  The legislation I propose today, with several cosponsors, will help \nour schools do what they were established to do in the first place. At \na time when there are record numbers of new Americans, at a time when \nour values are under attack, at a time when we are considering going to \nwar to defend those values, there can be no more urgent task than \nputting the teaching of American history and civics back in its \nrightful place in our schools so our children can grow up learning what \nit means to be an American.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nseveral items: A syllabus from the course that I taught, an article \nfrom the National Association of Scholars, and memoranda outlining the \nvarious Governors' schools in our State and other States.\n  I also highly commend to my colleagues a report from the Carnegie \nCorporation and CIRCLE titled ``The Civic Mission of Schools.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the National Association of Scholars]\n\n  Today's College Students Barely More Knowledgeable Than High School \n                  Students of 50 Years Ago, Poll Shows\n\n       Princeton, NJ, Dec. 18, 2002.--Contemporary college seniors \n     scored on average little or no higher than the high-school \n     graduates of a half-century ago on a battery of 15 questions \n     assessing general cultural knowledge. The questions, drawn \n     from a survey originally done by the Gallup Organization in \n     1955, covered literature, music, science, geography, and \n     history. They were asked again of a random sample of American \n     college and university students by Zogby International in \n     April 2002. The Zogby survey was commissioned by the National \n     Association of Scholars.\n       There were variations in the pattern of responses. The \n     contemporary sample of seniors did better than the 1950s high \n     school graduates on four questions relating to music, \n     literature, and science, about the same on seven questions \n     pertaining to geography, and worse on four questions about \n     history.\n       The answers given by today's seniors were also compared to \n     those provided to the Gallup questions by college graduates \n     in 1955. Although the relatively small number of college \n     graduates in the latter sample limits the degree of \n     confidence one can have in the comparisons, the consistency \n     and size of the knowledge superiority displayed by the 1950s \n     college graduates strongly suggests that it is real.\n       The overall average of correct responses for the entire \n     general knowledge survey was 53.5% for today's college \n     seniors, 54.5% for the 1955 high school graduates, and 77.3% \n     for the 1955 college graduates.\n       (Removing three questions about which, for reasons \n     indicated in the full report, the earlier respondents may \n     have had more ``extracurricular'' sources of knowledge, the \n     figures become 50.3% for the 2002 seniors, 46.4% for the 1955 \n     high school graduates, and 67.8% for the 1955 college \n     graduates.)\n       In addition, the 2002 college seniors were asked two \n     questions dealing with the reading and musical interests that \n     were asked of national samples of the American population in \n     1946 and 1957. With respect to interest in high literate and \n     musical culture, the answers fail to show impressive or \n     consistent differences between the two groups.\n       On a question inquiring whether or not they had a favorite \n     author, 56% of 2002 college seniors, as opposed to 32% of the \n     general population in 1946--the great majority of whom had \n     only an elementary or secondary school education--answered \n     affirmatively. For both groups, however, most of the authors \n     specifically mentioned were writers of popular fiction. When \n     only responses naming ``high-brow'' and canonical writers \n     were tabulated, the differences between the two groups \n     shrank considerably: 17% of the national sample falling \n     into a ``high-brow'' classification in 1946, as opposed to \n     24% of the 2002 college senior sample. Not a particularly \n     large difference given the college senior's great \n     advantage in formal education.\n       Asked whether or not they would like to collect a fairly \n     complete library of classical music on LPs or CDs, the 1957 \n     sample of owners 33 rpm-capable phonographs (37% of a \n     national survey sample) provided a more affirmative response \n     than did the 2002 college seniors, 39% of the former, and \n     only 30% of the latter, responding ``Yes''.\n       On the other hand, the contemporary college seniors were \n     more likely (69%) to have studied a musical instrument than \n     were the members of the population as a whole (44%) in 1957. \n     The type of instrument studied also differed, the 1957 \n     national sample more heavily favoring the violin and piano \n     than did the 2002 college seniors.\n       ``The results,'' said NAS president Stephen H. Balch, \n     ``though somewhat mixed and based on a limited number of \n     questions, are hardly reassuring. America has poured enormous \n     amounts of tax dollars into expanding access to higher \n     learning. Students spend, and pay for, many more years in the \n     classroom than was formerly the case. Our evidence suggests \n     that this time and treasure may not have substantially raised \n     student cultural knowledge above the high school levels of a \n     half-century ago.''\n       ``Worst yet,'' he continued, ``the high cultural interest \n     and aspirations of today's college seniors are neither \n     consistently nor substantially more elevated than \n     yesteryear's secondary school graduates. Creating such \n     interests and aspirations has traditionally been considered a \n     core element of the collegiate experience. If the last fifty \n     years have in fact witnessed few gains in this respect, it \n     represents a real disappointment of once widespread hopes.''\n\n[[Page S3041]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                      Governor's Schools Appendix\n\n       Virginia Governor's Schools for Humanities and Visual & \n     Performing Arts:\n       Established in 1973;\n       Takes place in more than 40 sites throughout Virginia;\n       ``The Governor's Schools presently include summer \n     residential, summer regional, and academic-year programs \n     serving more than 7,500 gifted students from all parts of the \n     commonwealth'';\n       Funded by way of the Virginia Board of Education and the \n     General Assembly (no specific figures readily available).\n       Pennsylvania Governor's Schools of Excellence:\n       Established in 1973;\n       Program is broken up into 8 schools (Agricultural Sciences-\n     Penn State University, Global Entrepreneurship-Lehigh \n     University, Health Care-University of Pittsburgh, Information \n     Technology-Drexel University/Penn State University, \n     International Studies-University of Pittsburgh, Teaching-\n     Millersville University, the Arts-Mercyhurst College, the \n     Sciences-Carnegie Mellon University);\n       Funded by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n       Mississippi Governor's School:\n       Established in 1981;\n       Program is hosted by the Mississippi University for Women;\n       Major academic courses change yearly, however, all courses \n     are designed to provide ``academic, creative leadership \n     experiences.''\n       West Virginia Governor's School for the Arts:\n       ``Brings 80 of West Virginia's most talented high school \n     actors, dancers, musicians, singers and visual artists to the \n     West Liberty State College campus for a three-week \n     residential program.''\n       Arkansas Governor's School:\n       Established in 1980;\n       Program is hosted by Hendrix College and attended by \n     approximately 400 students yearly;\n       Areas of focus include ``art, music, literature, film, \n     dance, and thought in the sciences, social sciences, and \n     humanities'';\n       This 6-week program is funded by the Arkansas General \n     Assembly.\n       Governor's schools for Montana, Massachusetts, and \n     Connecticut not found.\n       Alabama Governor's School:\n       Established in 1987;\n       Program is hosted by Samford University;\n       Academic courses stress fieldwork and problem-solving; the \n     arts, humanities and sciences are also explored;\n       Major and minor areas of study include, ``The Legal \n     Process, American Healthcare, and Urban Geography.''\n       Delaware Governor's School for Excellence:\n       One-week summer program;\n       Open to academically and artistically talented sophomores \n     from Delaware high schools;\n       Students attend either the academic program or the visual \n     and performing arts program.\n       Kentucky Governor's Scholars Program:\n       Established in 1983;\n       Held on the campuses (2003) of Centre College in Danville, \n     Eastern Kentucky; University in Richmond, and Northern \n     Kentucky University in Highland Heights;\n       Five-week long summer program;\n       Students may choose from over 20 subjects, including; \n     engineering and cultural anthropology;\n       Students selected attend the program free of cost.\n       Kentucky Governor's School for the Arts:\n       Provides hands-on instruction for Kentucky's dancers, \n     actors, and musicians;\n       No charge to students because it is paid for by the State;\n       Open to sophomores and juniors in high school.\n       Missouri Scholars Academy:\n       Three-week academic program for Missouri's gifted students;\n       330 students attend each year;\n       Held on the campus of University of Missouri-Columbia;\n       Administered by the Department of Elementary and Secondary \n     Education, in cooperation with University of Missouri \n     officials;\n       Funds to support the Academy are appropriated by the \n     Missouri Legislature following state Board of Education \n     recommendations;\n       Academy focuses on liberal arts and numerous extra-\n     curricular activities.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                A Glance at Tennessee Governor's Schools\n\n\n                           Governor's Schools\n\n                               Background\n\n       The Governor's School concept and practice began in North \n     Carolina in 1963 when Governor Terry Sanford established the \n     first one at Salem College, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. \n     The first school was initially funded through a grant from \n     the Carnegie Corporation. Later it came under the auspices of \n     the North Carolina Board of Education of the North Carolina \n     Department of Education.\n       Upon the establishment of the first school, several states, \n     including Georgia, South Carolina, Arkansas, Kentucky, and \n     Tennessee established similar schools.

Listed below is a table of all of \n     the schools, including subject area that is taught, the \n     location, and the dates for the 2003 session.\n       The School for the Arts--June 15-July 12, 2003-held on the \n     Middle Tennessee State University campus in Murfreesboro, and \n     located only 30 miles from Nashville and the Tennessee \n     Performing Arts Center.\n       The School for the Sciences--June 15-July 12, 2003-held on \n     the campus of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, near \n     the Oak Ridge National Laboratories, Tremont Environmental \n     Center, and in the heart of TVA.\n       The School for the Humanities--June 15-July 12, 2003-held \n     on the campus of the University of Tennessee at Martin, in \n     the center of Shiloh Battleground and the sociological \n     cultures of the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers.\n       The School for International Studies--June 15-July 12, \n     2003-held on the campus of The University of Memphis, in the \n     heart of Tennessee's growing international corporate center, \n     home to Federal Express, Holiday Inns, and Schering-Plough.\n       The School for Tennessee Heritage--June 15-July 12, 2003--\n     held on the campus of East Tennessee State University-in \n     Johnson City-surrounded by the area where Tennessee's history \n     began and only a few miles from Jonesborough, the state's \n     oldest existing city.\n       The School for Prospective Teachers--June 15-July 12, \n     2003--held on the campus of the University of Tennessee at \n     Chattanooga--with access to many schools throughout the area.\n       The School for Manufacturing--June 15-July 12, 2003--held \n     on the campus of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville--\n     focuses on the importance of manufacturing as an integral \n     part of the culture and economy of Tennessee.\n       President's School for Information Technology and \n     Leadership--June 15-July 12, 2003--this self-funded school \n     will be held on the campus of Tennessee Technological \n     University in Cookeville. It focuses on developing a complete \n     business plan for an information technology-based business \n     and enhancing student's knowledge of information technology \n     and business leadership.\n       The Tennessee Governor's Schools offer selected gifted and \n     talented high school students intensive learning experiences \n     in the Humanities, Math and Science, Arts, International \n     Studies, Tennessee Heritage, Prospective Teaching, \n     Manufacturing and Information Technology Leadership. \n     Admission to the various programs are highly competitive, as \n     1,250 applications have been received thus far for the 2003 \n     year for The School for the Arts, and only 300 spots are \n     available. Additionally, The School for the Sciences has \n     received 800 applications thus far, for 125 spots.\n       Students in the 10th and 11th grades who are interested in \n     participating in the programs receive information from their \n     school's guidance counselor and then proceed with the \n     application process.\n       Students selected to attend these highly competitive \n     schools are provided housing and meals for the duration of \n     the program, which is about a month long. Students \n     participate in a variety of courses that are offered. For \n     example, there were 14 academic\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\n     courses offered to the 115 scholars at the Governor's School \n     for the Humanities in 2001. All of the scholars were enrolled \n     in courses at 9 a.m. and 10:15 a.m. This particular \n     curriculum was designed to expose the scholars to a rich \n     selection of humanities courses including literature, \n     philosophy, religion, ethics, poetry, history and media \n     studies. In addition to the required morning classes, the \n     scholars were given the opportunity to participate in \n     afternoon electives, such as the yearbook staff and the \n     student newspaper. In the evening hours at the Governors \n     School for the Humanities, students were offered a broad-\n     range of humanities-related speakers and activities.\n\n                  Governor's Schools make a difference\n\n       The scholars' satisfaction with the 2001 Governor's School \n     for the Humanities program is reflected in the overall rating \n     of the program, with 94% of the scholars rating the program \n     as either ``excellent'' or ``very good.''\n       This satisfaction is also evident from the feedback the \n     students were asked to write upon completion of the 2001 \n     Governor's School for the Humanities program. Some examples \n     of the feedback from the program are as follows:\n       ``I had the fortunate chance of coming here, and I am glad \n     I came. The cool thing about the people here is that I got \n     along with everyone, and I especially got along very well \n     with my roommate. My favorite class was Lord Chamberlain's \n     Men. I better developed my acting skills and overall \n     understanding of what goes on in a play production. This \n     campus is so beautiful. The people, activities, and \n     atmosphere are unbelievable. I have had the time of my life \n     here, and I would especially come to this campus again for a \n     future GS, but I doubt that is possible. I love the freedom I \n     get from being here. The classes were challenging for me and \n     I believe I am prepared for my classroom experience now. \n     There are some very strange people that came here who I \n     wouldn't even think would be accepted to Governor's School. I \n     have learned to accept all different types of people and \n     their views and lifestyles since coming to GS. I love the \n     fact that Tennessee is rewarding me and everyone here that is \n     smart with the opportunity to become a better person. This \n     experience was wonderful. I speak for a lot of people when I \n     say that I don't want to leave!''\n       ``I honestly would have to say that Governor's School has \n     been one of the best experiences I have ever had. By coming \n     here, I have met so many people from different backgrounds, \n     and I learned to grow as a person. I learned so much in and \n     out of class, both from the staff and students. I really \n     enjoyed all the activities because I had fun and because I \n     was able to be myself. The atmosphere was so receptive and \n     nurturing, and the teachers showed that they wanted us to \n     learn and grow. I feel that the variety of electives offered \n     allowed each person to pick what he/she was interested in and \n     enabled each person to show their talents and abilities. The \n     time in which I was here flew by, but so many wonderful \n     things happened. It sounds funny, but every time I would \n     write or call home, I couldn't help but smile as I told my \n     parents about the fun I was having. This may or may not seem \n     relevant to the Governor's School experience, but it helped \n     me to see that I can go off to college in a year and I will \n     be fine. Overall, I feel that this was a positive growing \n     experience, and I can't wait to take back home all that I \n     have learned. Thank you all so much!''\n\n              Other Governor's Schools around the country\n\n       The Arkansas Governor's School is a 6-week summer \n     residential program for gifted students who are upcoming high \n     school seniors and residents of Arkansas.

The Arkansas \n     Governor's School is a non-credit program. Students are \n     selected on the basis of their special aptitudes in one of \n     eight fields: choral music, drama, English/language arts, \n     instrumental music, mathematics, natural science, social \n     science, or visual arts.\n       The Virginia Governor's School Program provides some of the \n     state's most able students academically and artistically \n     challenging programs beyond those offered in their home \n     schools. With the support of the Virginia Board of Education \n     and the General Assembly, the Governor's Schools presently \n     include summer residential, summer regional, and academic-\n     year programs serving more than 7,500 gifted students from \n     all parts of the commonwealth. There are three types of \n     Governor's Schools that provide appropriate learning \n     endeavors for gifted students throughout the commonwealth: \n     Academic-Year Governor's Schools, Summer Residential \n     Governor's Schools, and the Summer Regional Governor's \n     Schools.

Students will first explore America's \n     ``exceptionalism'': how an idea-based national ideology makes \n     the United States different from other countries--including \n     other Western democracies. Then, each session will analyze \n     one value of the ``American Creed''--and how it conflicts \n     with other values and/or creates unrealized expectations--in \n     the solving of a specific problem. Students will simulate \n     realistic policy-making situations and produce professional \n     products as assignments: concise memos, outlines and \n     briefings.\n\n\n                        Rationale for the Course\n\n       In Thanksgiving remarks President Bush praised the nation's \n     response to September 11. ``I call it,'' he said, ``the \n     American Character''. At KSG Al Gore said, ``We should \n     [fight] for the values that bind us together as a country''. \n     Both men were invoking a creed of ideas and values in which \n     most Americans believe. ``It has been our fate as a nation,'' \n     Richard Hofstader wrote, ``not to have ideologies but to be \n     one.'' This value-based national identity has inspired both \n     patriotism and division at home, both emulation and hatred \n     abroad. For terrorists as well as for those who admire \n     America, at issue is the United States itself--not what we \n     do, but who we are.\n       Yet Americans who unite on principle divide and suffer \n     disappointment when using their creed to solve policy \n     problems. This is because the values of the creed conflict \n     (e.g., liberty vs. equality, individualism vs. community) and \n     because American dreams are loftier than American reality \n     (e.g., ``all men are created equal'', ``tomorrow will be \n     better than today''). Samuel Huntington has said that \n     balancing these conflicts and disappointments is what most of \n     American politics and government is about. That is also what \n     this course is about.\n\n\n                                Audience\n\n       The Course is designed for future policy makers, civil \n     servants, and journalists. A general knowledge of American \n     politics is helpful but not required. It should be useful for \n     both U.S. and international students seeking to learn more \n     about the American system of government and how it differs \n     from that of other countries.\n\n\n                               Instructor\n\n       Lamar Alexander, The Roy M. and Barbara Goodman Family \n     Visiting Professor of Practice in Public Service, has been \n     Governor of Tennessee, President of the University of \n     Tennessee, and U.S. Education Secretary. He co-founded Bright \n     Horizons Family Solutions, Inc., now the nation's largest \n     provider of worksite day care. His seven books include Six \n     Months Off, the story of his family's trip to Australia after \n     eight years in the Governor's residence. In 1996 and 2000 he \n     was a candidate for the Republican nomination for President \n     of the United States.

All briefings are conducted in class \n     and all decision memos and weekly outlines are due at the \n     beginning of the corresponding class session. There is no \n     final exam, but there will be a final paper.\n\n\n                                Grading\n\n       Briefings (2): team exercise 20 percent. Two times during \n     the course each student will participate in a team briefing \n     on that week's subject.\n       Memos (2): team exercise 20 percent. Two other times during \n     the course each student will participate in a team preparing \n     a three-page decision memo on that week's subject . The \n     student may select these from among the class topics.\n       Weekly Outlines (6): 20 percent. Six other times during the \n     course each student will prepare a one-page analysis of the \n     week's problem. (This will be during those weeks when the \n     student is not involved in preparing a team briefing or team \n     memo.) As a result, for ten of the twelve class sessions, \n     each student will have an assignment (other than reading) \n     that requires preparation outside of class--either a team \n     briefing, a team memo, or an individual weekly memo \n     outline.\n       Class participation and attendance: 15 percent.\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\n       Final Paper: 25 percent.\n       Final grades will be determined by students' overall \n     position in the class as measured by performance on each of \n     the assignments and will conform to the Kennedy School of \n     Government's recommended range of grading distribution.\n\n\n                               materials\n\n       The course relies primarily on course packets to be made \n     available for sale at the Course Materials Office. There will \n     be 125-150 pages of reading each week. There are three \n     required textbooks:\n       (1) Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America, translated \n     and edited by Harvey C.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for this \ntime. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to say I believe the speech the \nSenator from Tennessee has given today was an extraordinary speech, \nwhich was his first speech on the floor. Actually, it was not his first \nspeech on the floor, but we are calling it his maiden speech. He gave a \nspeech last week that had a huge impact relative to the Estrada \nnomination, which is the pending business. But this statement today by \nthe Senator from Tennessee highlights effectively and poignantly the \nimportance of teaching civics and history in classes in America. His \nbill, which he has proposed, of which I am a cosponsor, is a step which \nis long overdue.\n  As he so effectively pointed out in his speech, we, as a nation, need \nto teach our children about our roots and our purpose as a country if \nwe are to continue our creed of bringing one out of many.\n  So I thank him for his statement. I think it was a superb statement. \nAnd I thank him for his legislation, which I hope we will be able to \nact on promptly and pass and put into operation so we can pass on to \nour children, through our public school system, the importance of the \nAmerican culture and history.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator \nfrom the State of Alaska, asks unanimous consent that he be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Tennessee on \nan outstanding and inspiring speech. I feel tremendously more patriotic \nnow than when I came in the Chamber. And there is no way one can come \ninto this Chamber without feeling patriotic.\n  I am just hoping that classrooms across America do not wait for the \nlegislation; that they go ahead, get on the Internet, get a copy of the \nSenator's speech, get a copy of the materials that accompany it, and \nget busy on this right away.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. This is a country that began \nunifying on September 11. It is in a huge process of reunifying, of \nfinding the commonality between the people who have united\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\nthe American people and made this the kind of country that it is.\n  I congratulate the Senator for his inspired speech and the work he \nhas done on this bill. I have heard the Senator speak on this bill and \nhave seen his passion on it before.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator for all his efforts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I also join in thanking the Senator from \nTennessee for his very inspiring comments. I am part of the new class \nof Senators. I will have an opportunity to give my maiden speech, \nthough obviously I have spoken on the floor before.\n  I thought this was an important maiden speech. This was the first of \nthe speeches of the new Senators of the 108th, and I think it was the \nright speech. We are going to discuss a lot of issues in these very \nchallenging times--a time when we are on the edge of war, a time in \nwhich the values we hold so dear are challenged by terrorists, are \nchallenged by oppression, and challenged by hate.\n\n  We live in a time of great uncertainty about the economy, about jobs, \nwith moms and dads who worry about their economic futures.\n  So we are going to debate a lot of issues. We are worried about the \nfuture of health care and the future of prescription drugs for seniors. \nWe are worried about baby boomers who are going to get old--and do we \nhave a national policy dealing with long-term care?\n  But at the core of all that we debate is this very fundamental \nconcept that the Senator from Tennessee has raised; that is, What does \nit mean to be an American? What does it mean to celebrate freedom, to \ncelebrate opportunity, and to be an optimist and have a hopeful spirit?\n  So I applaud the Senator from Tennessee for, in his maiden speech, \nsetting forth the seminal concept that binds us.\n  I have noticed, with a little bit of sadness, the very partisan tone \nof so much of what we do. And I have always believed if we spent more \ntime focusing on the things upon which we agree, rather than things on \nwhich we disagree, we would get through those. I think there is great \nagreement in this body on what we agree on, and that is what it is to \nbe an American.\n  I think it is important to transmit those values to the next \ngeneration so that the next generation can reinforce that to our \ngeneration because sometimes we forget.\n  So, again, I add my voice of thanks to the Senator from Tennessee for \nraising this issue. It is so appropriate at this point in time.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor on the Senator's legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague, through the \nChair, for his words of inspiration. This concept of unity, this \nconcept of patriotism, this concept of the essence of what being an \nAmerican is all about, has been a real focus for all of us throughout \nour lives.\n  September 11, as my distinguished colleague mentioned, gave us a time \nto rethink. I think what he has done today by introducing this bill is \ngive us a real focus in this body, to allow us to shine the light on \nwhat we feel but which we do not articulate and spell out and \ncommunicate to the American people very well because we debate small \nissues, big issues, discreet issues, and a lot of rhetoric flies back \nand forth.\n  So I appreciate the Senator taking the time to put together this \npiece of legislation, as well as spelling it out in his maiden speech.\n  I especially appreciate, in his comments, mentioning the importance \nof teachers and setting up, in a structured fashion, a forum with which \nhe has direct experience, by which we can give some discipline to and \ncultivate and encourage and show the national importance of its \nsupport.\n  He mentioned the Pledge of Allegiance. It was not that long ago in \nthis body that we made a decision to revive having the Pledge of \nAllegiance recited at the opening of each session. That was really just \nseveral years ago.\n  It shows, by somebody taking an initiative, such as my colleague from \nTennessee has done, that by giving it definition, you, indeed, can \nadvance down the field and make progress.\n  In this legislation we have an opportunity to continue with and to, \nindeed, capture what we know this great Nation is all about, and \nperpetuate it in a more organized, systematic way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I, too, be added as a \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend, the junior Senator from \nTennessee, has this morning introduced legislation that I think is \nextremely important. I was happy to join with him as the lead cosponsor \nin that legislation. Certainly the Senator from Tennessee has the \nqualifications to offer legislation relating to education. He has been \nGovernor of a State. He has been the secretary of education for our \ncountry. So when I saw this legislation come across my desk, I thought \nit was something in which I was interested. After reviewing it more \nclosely, I am happy to be the lead cosponsor on this legislation, the \nAmerican History and Civics Education Act.\n  First of all, I agree with the Senator from Tennessee that civics or \nthe duties of citizenship need to be stressed more. The best place it \ncan be stressed is through educating our children, K through 12. It is \nthe same with history. Mr. President, I love the study of history. I \nread fiction only occasionally. I read nonfiction all the time. I am \npresently engaged in a tremendously interesting book, written by Evans \nand Novak, the conservative reporters. Evans has passed away. Novak is \nstill writing, as he has for many years. He is an excellent writer. I \ndidn't realize, until I had occasion to visit with Bob Novak a few \nweeks ago, that he and Evans had written a history book in 1967 dealing \nwith the life of Lyndon Johnson. I am in the process of reading that \nbook. I am probably about halfway through the book. It is tremendously \ninteresting. For those of us who read the Caro work, I recommend the \nbook by Novak. It is very readable. They were there at the time. The \nthings that went on, for example, in the Civil Rights Act of the late \nfifties--our colleague Strom Thurmond debated that matter. He stood up \nhimself in a filibuster. Senator Hatch, my friend from Utah, talks \nabout real filibusters. That was a real filibuster. Senator Thurmond \nalone spoke for more than 24 hours.\n  It really threw the southern coalition off because they, in effect, \nmade a deal with Lyndon Johnson and Strom Thurmond. It threw a monkey \nwrench into the so-called deal. Anyway, it is very interesting.\n  History is living what took place in the past. For us, it is the \nability to learn from what has happened in the past to try to do a \nbetter job in the future.\n  My friend from Tennessee, wrote this legislation, and I am happy to \nwork with him on it; it is great. The legislation sets up academies. It \nsets up programs on the Internet for best teaching practices. The \neducation of America's children must be one of our top priorities.\n  Our schools have several important goals, including providing \nstudents with a foundation for higher education, helping them develop \nindividual potential, and preparing them for successful careers.\n  America has been a nation of immigrants for hundreds of years, and \nour schools have helped instill in our diverse population a sense of \nwhat it means to be an American and prepare our youth for the \nresponsibilities of citizenship. We need to reaffirm the importance of \nlearning American history and acquiring civic understanding. That is \nwhat this legislation is all about.\n  As I work to make sure Nevada schoolchildren are connected to the \nInternet and the future, I also want them to be connected with \nAmerica's past and know the common values in history, binding together \nall who live in our great Nation.\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\n  I commend and applaud the junior Senator from Tennessee, Lamar \nAlexander, for offering this legislation. It is important legislation. \nHe said in his statement that Senator Gregg, who chairs the committee \nof jurisdiction on this legislation, will move the bill to the Senate \nfloor quickly. I hope that happens. I do hope my Republican colleagues \nwill join with me in adequately funding this program so we can \nestablish in grades K through 12 these academies where teachers can go \nto summer workshops and learn history and how better to teach history. \nIt will only improve our country and our educational system in \nparticular.\n  Under the previous order, the second 30 minutes shall be under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, or her designee.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3046-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3046-S3049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that it be held at the desk.\n  Before the Chair rules, I add that it is my hope, and the hope of \nmany Members on this side of the aisle, that we can get this resolution \ncleared for adoption today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the resolution will be held \nat the desk.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by the Republican whip, \nSenator McConnell, in introducing a resolution disapproving last week's \nPledge of Allegiance ruling by the full Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The full court refused to review a three-judge panel ruling that bars \nchildren in public schools from voluntarily reciting the Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n  Last week's decision is symptomatic of a court that has become \ndysfunctional and out-of-touch with American jurisprudence, common \nsense, and constitutional values. The full Ninth Circuit decision on \nthe pledge represents a type of extremism carried out by individuals \nwho want to substitute their values in place of constitutional values. \nWhat they want to do is simply eradicate any reference to religion in \npublic life. That is not what the First Amendment mandates.\n  In his dissent from the court's decision, Judge O'Scannlain, writing \nfor six judges, called the panel decision ``wrong, very wrong--wrong \nbecause reciting the Pledge of Allegiance is simply not a `religious \nact' as the two-judge majority asserts, wrong as a matter of Supreme \nCourt precedent properly understood, wrong because it set up a direct \nconflict with the law of another circuit, and wrong as a matter of \ncommon sense.''\n  He went on to say: ``If reciting the pledge is truly `a religious \nact' in violation of the Establishment Clause, then so is the \nrecitation of the Constitution itself, the Declaration of Independence, \nthe Gettysburg Address, the National Motto or the singing of the \nnational anthem,'' verse of which says, `And this is our motto: In God \nis our trust.'' I believe the reasoning of Judge O'Scannlain is \nabsolutely correct.\n  One should not be surprised that the full Ninth Circuit refused to \nreconsider this ill-conceived decision. The recent history of the Ninth \nCircuit suggests a judicial activism that is close to the fringe of \nlegal reasoning.\n  During the 1990s, almost 90 percent of cases from the Ninth Circuit \nreviewed by the Supreme Court were reversed.\n  In fact, this is the court with the highest reversal rate in the \ncountry. In 1997, 27 of the 28 cases brought to the Supreme Court were \nreversed--two-thirds by a unanimous vote.\n  Over the last 3 years, one-third of all cases reversed by the Supreme \nCourt came from the Ninth Circuit. That's three times the number of \nreversals for the next nearest circuit and 33 times higher than the \nreversal rate for the 10th Circuit.\n  Last November, on a single day, the Supreme Court summarily and \nunanimously reversed three Ninth Circuit decisions. In one of those \nthree cases, the Supreme Court ruled that the circuit had overreached \nits authority and stated that the Court ``exceed[ed] the limits imposed \non federal habeas review . . . substitut[ing] its own judgment for that \nof the state court.''\n  One of the reasons the Ninth Circuit is reversed so often is because \nthe circuit has become so large and unwieldy. The circuit serves a \npopulation of more than 54 million people, almost 60 percent more than \nare served by the next largest circuit. By 2010, the Census Bureau \nestimates that the Ninth Circuit's population will be more than 63 \nmillion.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Ninth \nCircuit alone accounts for more than 60 percent of all appeals pending \nfor more than a year. And with its huge caseload, the judges on the \ncourt just do not have the opportunity to keep up with decisions within \nthe circuit, let alone decisions from other circuits.\n\n  In a New York Times article last year it was pointed out that judges \non the court said they did not have time to read all of the decisions \nissued by the court. According to a 1998 report, 57 percent of judges \nin the Ninth Circuit, compared with 86 percent of Federal appeals court \njudges elsewhere, said they read most or all of their court's \ndecisions.\n  Another problem with the Ninth Circuit is that it never speaks with \none voice. All other circuits sit as one entity to hear full-court, or \nen banc, cases. The Ninth Circuit sits in panels of 11. The procedure \ninjects randomness into decisions. If a case is decided 6 to 5, there \nis no reason to think it represents the views of the majority of the \ncourt's 24 active members.\n  Last week, some legal experts suggested that the Ninth Circuit's \nunique 11 member en bank panel system may have contributed to the \ncourts' decision on the pledge. It has been suggested that even a \nmajority of the 24 members of the court might have disagreed with the \npledge decision but feared that a random pick of 11 members of the \ncourt to hear the case might have resulted in the decision being \naffirmed.\n  That is not the way the law should be interpreted by the circuit \ncourts of this country. I believe this decision highlights the need for \nthis Congress to finally enact legislation that will split the Ninth \nCircuit. It has just become dysfunctional.\n  Later this week I will be introducing such legislation, and I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in that legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Alaska, in raising my voice in concern and dismay about the recent \ndecision of the 24-judge U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \ndeclaring the phrase ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance to be \nunconstitutional. You have to ask yourself: What is the problem? Is the \nproblem the pledge or is the problem the Ninth Circuit?\n  The distinguished Senator from Tennessee today in his maiden speech \ntalked about what it is to be an American and made reference to this \nparticular issue. The Pledge of Allegiance does speak to what is great \nabout America, our sense of unity and--to quote the Senator from \nTennessee--our sense of faith, our value of freedom. It is who we are \nas Americans that joins us.\n  If we reflect on the prayer that opened the session today, the pastor \ntalked about prayer and whether it is Allah or whether it is Jesus, \nwhether it is Yahweh, we are joined with a common sense in faith. \nWalking through the doors to the Chamber across from where the \nPresiding Officer sits is the phrase: ``In God We Trust.'' We \nacknowledge that. We accept that. We understand it is not the State \nsaying this is State-sponsored religion. It is simply our recognition \nof faith as being part of who we are and that it is OK.\n  If I would take out a dollar bill, if I had one in my pocket, we \nwould see reference to God. This decision defies common sense. It is \nbecause we have a court that substitutes its judgment, its own perhaps \npersonal political perspective in ruling from the bench, and that is \nnot what courts are supposed to be.\n  I speak as a former Solicitor General of the State of Minnesota. I \nunderstand the Constitution. I respect the Constitution. I revere the \nConstitution. Clearly, our Founders and Framers, in their brilliance, \nin their foresight, and I believe in their being divinely inspired, \nunderstood that it was in God we trust. A decision somehow that says it \nis unconstitutional truly defies common sense.\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\n  If I may, I think this decision highlights the importance of \nconfirming Miguel Estrada to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I say \nthat because if you look at the criticism that Mr. Estrada is getting \nfrom some of my distinguished colleagues on the other side, they are \nconcerned that he is not articulating his personal political \nperspective on a given issue.\n  When Mr. Estrada is asked about legal precedent, he says: I will \nfollow it if it is the established law of the land. That is what judges \nare supposed to do. They are not supposed to take their own personal \npolitical belief, a belief that may defy common sense, and bring it to \nthe fore, in this case the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that \nthe phrase ``under God'' is unconstitutional.\n  When Mr. Estrada was asked about the divisive issue of abortion--\nclearly divisive, and I am one who would love to find common ground. I \nbelieve in America today there is common ground over banning the horror \nof partial-birth abortion. Most people find common ground.\n  On this divisive issue, when Mr. Estrada was probed and pushed to say \nwhat his personal beliefs are, he stepped back and said: It is the \nestablished law of the land. It is a constitutional right to privacy. \nIt is not within the province or responsibility of a judge to bring \ntheir personal political perspective or belief to the table. To do that \nwould constitute judicial activism. That is not what I believe the \nConstitution intended judges to be. They are supposed to interpret the \nConstitution.\n  I truly believe this decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nwhich I am hopeful, if not confident, will be overturned--I am \nsupportive of the efforts of the Senator from Alaska and this body \nspeaking out and saying this is the wrong decision; this does not \nreflect common sense; this does not reflect American values.\n  This is the wrong lesson to be sending our children about what it \nmeans to be an American and the greatness of America. Clearly, we \ncannot have courts substituting their judgment. We cannot have \ndecisions that are so devoid of common sense that they cut away at the \ncore of the fabric and the heart of what it means to be an American.\n  I join in speaking out. I join in support of the resolution that says \nthis is wrong, and the Senate recognizes it is wrong.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Senator from \nAlaska and to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nMinnesota. I mentioned a few moments ago that if our future Federal \njudges had a few more courses in American history and civics, we might \nnot have these decisions.\n  I see the Senator from Alabama is in the Chamber. I think of the \npivot point of the Revolutionary War when all the Europeans on the \nwestern side of the mountain in Tennessee were enraged. They were tired \nof paying taxes to support the bishop of a church to which they did not \nbelong. So they helped fight the Revolution; that is separation of \nchurch and state. They did not want to pay taxes to support another \nchurch.\n  Before they went over the mountain to the Battle of King's Mountain \nin Watauga, they went down on their knees to pray. The great pioneer \npreacher, Samuel Doke, prayed about the sword of the Lord and Gideon. \nThey knew how to separate church and state and still be a religious \ncountry. If they knew it, why don't Federal judges know it? Why don't \nthey know that George Washington went down on his knees at Valley \nForge, and that Abraham Lincoln turned the war over to the Lord, and \nGeneral Pershing advised troops to pray? Did they not see President \nBush take America to church after 9/11 and then walk across the street \nto a mosque?\n  We know how to be a religious country and separate church and state, \nand our Federal judges ought to know how to do that. I suggest one more \nlesson for teaching American history and civics in our public schools, \nas the Senator from Alaska suggests, is that we have more Federal \njudges grow up understanding we are a country that can be as religious \nas any country in the world and still separate church and state.\n  Those principles can work together.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Does the Senator, based on his broad experience in \naffairs, conclude that this country has the unique history of being a \ngenuinely religious country, but a country that knows how to handle \ndifferent religions and faiths? As a matter of history, is it not \nalmost unique in the history of the world how we have been able to \naffirm religious faith and, at the same time, avoid sectarian violence?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Alabama is exactly right. One of the \nmost remarkable aspects about America is we have a country that is \nfilled with people from everywhere. If one goes to a naturalization \nceremony in any Federal court in America and looks at the men and women \ncoming into our country from everywhere, one will see the variety and \ndiversity of our country. We know how to do that.\n  Our country is distinguished because despite our diversity, we do not \nhave religious wars in our country. We respect everybody's right. The \ngreatest aspect of our country is not all that diversity; it is the \nfact we figured out how to turn all that diversity into one country.\n  Federal judges need to know we have two principles running through \nthis country: We have the Pilgrims who arrived here and saw the shining \ncity on the hill, and we have the great diversity where we are more \nreligious virtually than any country, but we separate church and state. \nWhen the chaplain starts every day here with a prayer, he is not \nestablishing a church in the United States of America; he is \nrecognizing the religious nature of our country, and judges should know \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. Madam President, first, I appreciate \nthe remarks of the Senator from Alaska. It was a very effective and \nthoughtful speech about a very important subject, and that is the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals and how this Pledge of Allegiance matter \nhighlights the problems we have had there for a long time. I express my \nappreciation for a wonderful analysis that the Senator from Alaska \nmade. The Senator laid it out very well.\n  I chair the Subcommittee on Courts of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nI have looked at this issue since I have been in the Senate. I was \npresent in Atlanta the day the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals was \ncreated. The old Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals was divided. It went \nfrom Miami to Texas, from El Paso to Miami. It was too big and it could \nnot work well. The judges themselves believed that a division was \nnecessary. The Congress approved. Not one single judge today who is on \nthe new Eleventh Circuit and was on the old Fifth Circuit, would ever \nwant to try to put that monstrosity back together. And it was not \nnearly as big as the Ninth Circuit.\n  We had hearings several years ago during which we called chief judges \nof several circuits as witnesses. Those judges told us they did not \nwant to see the size of their court get any bigger than 10 or 12 \njudges. When it got any bigger than that, collegiality broke down, the \nability to maintain consistency of opinions broke down, and the ability \nto promote harmony and consistency in law broke down.\n  The Senator from Alaska is exactly correct, the Ninth Circuit is a \nparticular problem. It is out of the mainstream of American law, and \nthat is one reason I urged and pleaded with this Senate not to put more \nleft-wing activist judges on the Ninth Circuit. I dealt with the \nquestion of Judge Marsha Berzon and Judge Paez. We did not filibuster \nthose nominees. We debated those nominees. I voted against those \nnominees. Both of them were confirmed. Both of those judges, by all \napparent indication, voted for this opinion that struck down the Pledge \nof Allegiance in this country. Both of those judges, Berzon and Paez, \nin separate opinions have voted to strike down California's three-\nstrikes-and-you're-out law, the law that broke the back of a surging \ncrime rate in California, and we have seen the crime rate go down. \nWhy? Because they targeted repeat dangerous offenders. In a Rand Cor-\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\nporation study of prisoners in California, the prisoners admitted they \nwere involved in as many as 200 crimes per year. So when you target \nrepeat offenders under the three-strikes-you're-out law, it brings the \ncrime rate down. The Ninth Circuit has real problems. They have no \nbusiness striking down California's law. California has a right to set \nthe penalty standards in their State.\n\n  The problems in the Ninth Circuit are broadly known. Several years \nago, the New York Times, in a piece on the problem, noted that a \nmajority of the United States Supreme Court considers the Ninth Circuit \nto be a rogue circuit, a circuit out of control. One year they reversed \nthe Ninth Circuit 27 out of 28 times. Another year it was 13 out of 17 \ntimes. They have the highest reversal rate of any circuit in America. \nBut to have so many cases, there is no way the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States can control that circuit, unless it is under control to \nbegin with. We need judges there who follow the law.\n  This is precisely why, as Senator Coleman indicated, we need judges \nlike Miguel Estrada who show restraint. That is what this debate is \nabout. That is what the President is committed to do. He said we are \nnot going to turn criminals loose without a basis. We are not going to \nbe taking down the Pledge of Allegiance. We are not going to be taking \ndown Christmas decorations because of these nutty decisions coming out \ntime and time again. Many of these decisions are under the guise of \ninterpreting the Constitution in ways it has never been interpreted \nbefore.\n  That is what this debate is about. That is why it is important. We \nneed judges who will simply follow the law. Who can be afraid of that? \nHow is our liberty endangered when we have judges who follow the law \ndutifully? What you have when you have a judge like Judge Reinhardt on \nthe Ninth Circuit, who says that evolving, long-term trends of social \nconscience enable judges to redefine the meaning of the Constitution to \nmake what they think is correct occur, is very dangerous policy. In \nfact, that idea undermines democracy.\n  I could go on and talk about this circuit. I have made probably as \nmany as nine speeches on the floor delineating the problems they have. \nI strongly believe that reform is needed. I thank the Senator from \nAlaska for raising that again. Her State is part of the Ninth Circuit. \nI know she cares deeply about it. We have had a number of proposals to \nfix it. The way the opponents of reform operate, and the way I have \nseen them do it, is whatever the proposal is, is not good enough. So \nthey don't deny we need reform, but any time somebody proposes reform, \nthey come along and say it isn't correct, and they turn it into a \nconfused mess.\n  But it is time for us now to confront this issue, it is time for us \nto confront the problem of judicial activism in its entirety. \nUnfortunately, the Pacific coast has drifted further than any from \nbeing a disciplined interpreter of the law. So I will just say, Madam \nPresident, thank you for your leadership, thank you for your important \nfirst speech. I believe it will help us go forward. It is going to \nencourage me to push the issue in my committee. So I thank the Senator \nfrom Alaska. I look forward to working with you and others who \nsincerely want to improve the rule of law in America, who want to \nimprove consistency in the rule of law to avoid decisions that \nembarrass this country, and embarrass the rule of law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Alaska \nwho has kindly taken the chair so I may speak briefly in support of the \nresolution that she and Senator McConnell have offered this morning.\n  The reason I do so is that I think we see a remarkable confluence of \nthemes this morning. First, as we know, we are in the fourth week of \ndebate on the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, and the debate has often been about what is the proper role \nfor a judge to play under our Government of separated powers, where the \nlegislative branch, executive branch, and judicial branch play \ndistinctive roles, not the same role.\n  Then we heard from the distinguished Senator from Tennessee this \nmorning offering a bill sponsored on a bipartisan basis, trying to put \nhistory and civics back in our classrooms so that American children can \ngrow up knowing what it means to be an American. And then we have this \nsad, but not totally unexpected, incident of the Ninth Circuit's \nrefusal to reconsider the three-judge panel decision striking the words \n``under God'' from the Pledge of Allegiance. I think these three themes \nare connected. I want to speak briefly on that.\n  Madam President, I rise this morning, after an entire month of Senate \ndebate on the nomination of Miguel Estrada to serve on the Federal \ncourt of appeals, in continued dismay over what I see as a \npoliticization of our judicial confirmation process. In my view, it is \nprofoundly dangerous to have a judicial confirmation process that, in \neffect, tells nominees their personal political beliefs will determine \nwhether or not they get to serve as a judge. Such a judicial \nconfirmation process sends exactly the wrong signal and a dangerous \nmessage to judges that it is perhaps OK to decide cases based on their \npersonal beliefs, or a political and social agenda and not based on \nsettled law.\n  Indeed, Miguel Estrada, during the course of these debates, has been \ncriticized. When asked what his judicial philosophy is, he said: I will \napply the law as written by the Congress and as decided by precedents \nof the U.S. Supreme Court. One Senator said: Well, that is not a \nphilosophy. I want to know how Mr. Estrada personally feels about the \nequal protection clause, about the fourth amendment, the first \namendment, and such questions. But, indeed, I think the Senator has it \nexactly wrong, and Mr. Estrada has it exactly right. It is the judicial \nphilosophy we ought to embrace and look for.\n  Indeed, I believe the President has chosen a nominee who says I won't \nimpose my own views or my own political agenda, or what I think the law \nshould be; I will submit to the law of the land, which is what Congress \nhas said the law is, through the laws that are passed and signed by the \nPresident, and the decisions made by a higher court and the precedents \nso established.\n  Madam President, the Ninth Circuit's decision last Friday to strike \ndown, for a second time, the voluntary recitation of the Pledge of \nAllegiance as unconstitutional demonstrates exactly what will happen \nwhen we politicize the judiciary. It demonstrates what happens when we \ntell judges you can ignore the law, because what is really important is \nhow you personally feel about these issues. The Ninth Circuit's \ndecision on the Pledge of Allegiance is without any basis in law or in \nfact. It is a blatantly political decision.\n  As one of the judges noticed in his dissent, ``it doesn't take an \nArticle III judge to recognize that the voluntary recitation of the \nPledge of Allegiance in public school does not violate the First \nAmendment.'' Surely, he is right. Heaven help us if he is not.\n\n  The First Amendment of the Constitution states that ``Congress shall \nmake no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the \nfree exercise thereof.'' These words represent a solemn commitment by \nour Founders, indeed by all of us, that our Government cannot interfere \nwith the ability of an individual to practice his or her faith or \nexpress it in a public forum--no more, and no less. Government shall \nneither establish an official State religion, nor shall Government \ninterfere with the ability of private citizens to exercise their chosen \nreligion.\n  Notice what the first amendment does not say. It does not say the \nGovernment must be hostile to religion. But, indeed, is that not what \nhas happened? I think about our children and what they are exposed to \non a daily basis: Sex, violence, degradation of women, other dangerous \ninfluences. And we expect them to sort that out in their own way, \nhopefully under the guidance and tutelage of parents, teachers, and \nothers.\n  The one thing people cannot talk about, they cannot talk about the \nCreator, they cannot talk about their religious faith. That is \nprohibited. And that is absurd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be extended by 5 minutes on this side of the aisle and \nlikewise extended on the other side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. As Justice William O. Douglas explained in his decision \nin Zorach v. Clauson, ``[t]he First Amendment . . . does not say that \nin every and all respects there shall be a separation of Church and \nState. . . . Otherwise . . . [p]olicemen who help parishioners into \ntheir places of worship would violate the Constitution. Prayers in our \nlegislative halls,'' such as we observed in this Chamber this morning \nand do every time the Senate meets, ``the appeals to the Almighty in \nthe messages of the Chief Executive; the proclamations making \nThanksgiving Day a holiday; `so help me God' in our courtroom oaths--\nthese and all other references to the Almighty that run through our \nlaws, our public rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First \nAmendment.''\n  The Founders of the Constitution did not ratify a Constitution or a \nBill of Rights so hostile to religion. To the contrary, the very first \nday that the first Congress approved the Establishment Clause, it also \npassed the Northwest Ordinance which declared that ``religion, \nmorality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the \nhappiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever \nbe encouraged.''\n  Our Founders thus believed this new Nation could endorse and promote \nreligion and encourage its citizens voluntarily to practice the faith \nof their own choosing. They are not mutually exclusive.\n  The Ninth Circuit's decision to strike down the Pledge of Allegiance \nfinds no basis in the text of the Constitution or the original \nunderstanding of our Founding Fathers. Indeed, it defies common sense.\n  I urge this body to support the resolution offered this morning by \nthe Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Kentucky because the Ninth \nCircuit's decision, like far too many decisions coming from our Federal \ncourts, replaces the Constitution with an altogether new and made-up \nrule preferred by judges who may personally prefer a government that is \nactively hostile to all expressions of faith in a public forum.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Under the previous order, the \nfinal 60 minutes shall be under the control of the Democratic leader or \nhis designee.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3049-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STANDING UP FOR THE CONSUMER\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, gasoline prices are soaring through the \nstratosphere, and the Federal Trade Commission, which is supposed to be \nstanding up for the consumer, ought to stop playing footsie with the \noil companies and take steps to protect the American people. I have \nbeen trying to get the Federal Trade Commission to do its job now for \nseveral years. In fact, I have supplied them with detailed reports \noutlining anticompetitive practices in the oil industry in hopes that I \ncould get their attention. Unfortunately, they are still sitting on the \nsidelines.\n  This morning I will outline what some of those anticompetitive \npractices are that the oil companies are now using to victimize the \nAmerican consumer.\n  The oil companies are redlining. What they have sought to do is keep \nindependent wholesalers known as ``jobbers'' from competing in markets \nby refusing to let independent dealers buy better priced gasoline from \nthe local jobbers. This is a technique to wall off whole communities \nfrom competition. Redlining is going on today.\n  The oil companies are also zone pricing. They charge different prices \nfor the same gas at their own branded stores in adjacent neighborhoods, \npricing it as high as the market will bear. They have also charged \nindependent dealers higher wholesale prices than they charge the \ncompany stores. The end result, the independents cannot compete.\n  So what we have in communities across the country is two stations \nthat are located next to each other, and because of a Supreme Court \ndecision, oil companies are required to treat those companies similarly \nsituated in the same way. But what the oil companies do very cleverly \nis divide that community into different zones. Then they can stick it \nto one of the stations. That station goes out of business. There is a \nlocal monopoly and the consumer gets hosed once again.\n  A third area I have outlined for the Federal Trade Commission is that \nthe oil companies keep the market to themselves. In the past, they have \nkept down refineries that could have increased supply and introduced \nnew competition. We have given this information to the Federal Trade \nCommission and, again, they sit on their hands.\n  Finally, of particular importance to west coast consumers, where up \nand down the west coast of the United States prices have soared, people \nare paying $2 a gallon and close to it in many communities. What we \nhave seen in the past is the oil companies have exported gasoline to \nAsia at a discount and then more than made up for it by sticking \nconsumers with higher prices in the tight west coast market.\n  The oil companies today would say they are no longer doing this, but \nthe fact of the matter is that oil company representatives told my \nOregon colleague, Senator Smith, who has worked with me so \ncooperatively on many of these issues, in an open hearing in the \nCommerce Committee that they would export to Asia once again whenever \nit was in their commercial interest. So hypothetically, if they were \nallowed to drill for oil in the national wildlife refuge in Alaska, \napart from the environmental considerations, based on the testimony in \nthe Senate Commerce Committee, the oil companies would be taking that \noil from the wildlife refuge, selling it to Asia at a discount and \nsticking it to people in Oregon, Washington, and California.\n  It seems to me the Federal Trade Commission ought to be taking steps \nto stand up for the consumer. If they do not think they have the \nauthority to stand up for the consumer at this point, they ought to \ncome to the Senate and tell us what authority they actually need in \norder to protect the consumer and the gas-buying public. The \nunfortunate response from the Federal Trade Commission has been to \nsimply sit this issue out.\n  For example, on July 17, 2002, in a hearing before the Senate \nCommerce Committee, I outlined once again for the Federal Trade \nCommission these anticompetitive practices. I went through with them \nthe impact of redlining, of zone pricing, of the pressure that has been \nput on independent gasoline stations. I asked them to furnish for the \nrecord any set of concrete steps they have actually taken to protect \nthe consumer.\n  We cannot find anything. We cannot find any specific action the \nFederal Trade Commission took, either before July 17, 2002, when I \nasked them that question, or since then. I am very troubled because I \nthink the problems we are seeing today, and they are long-term \nproblems, cry out for someone in the Federal Government to stand up for \nthe consumer. It is the job of the Federal Trade Commission to deal \nwith anticompetitive practices. These are long-term, anticompetitive \npractices that are siphoning the competition out of the gasoline \nmarkets in the United States.\n  I hope the Federal Trade Commission will either do its job under \nexisting law--I think they have the authority to deal with these \nanticompetitive practices--or if they do not believe they do have the \nauthority they need to protect the consumer, they should come to the \nSenate and outline what powers they need in order to stand up for the \nAmerican people.\n  Essentially, both of the reports that I did and have submitted to the \nFederal Trade Commission found the very same thing. They found that the \noil companies were engaging in anticompetitive practices. I hope now, \ngiven the enormous impact these huge gasoline price spikes are having \non consumers, the ramifications for business--we had scores of \nbusinesses and business associations contact us in the past--that we \ncan get the Federal Trade Commission off the side lines. They have a \njob to do. They are not doing it with respect to protecting the \nAmerican people from anticompetitive practices in the gasoline \nbusinesses.\n  I intend to keep coming to the floor and the Senate Commerce \nCommittee until the Federal Trade Commission is prepared to do its job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the plan the \nWhite House is unveiling today concerning Medicare and prescription \ndrugs. I am surprised and dismayed to see we have basically the same \nold thing being proposed once again by the administration. While we \nhear the right words about wanting to make sure every senior has access \nto prescription drugs, one more time we are seeing the President say \none thing and do another.\n  In January after the State of the Union, many were dismayed to hear \nthat the President's proposal for Medicare prescription drug coverage \nwould basically be one that would say to a senior, if you stay in \ntraditional Medicare, Medicare that has worked for you every day, every \nyear, guaranteed access to your doctor, guarantee that you had health \ncare available to you--if you chose to stay in Medicare, which has been \nworking since 1965, you would not get any assistance with your critical \nprescription drug costs; you would have to go into a private sector \nHMO.\n  Now we hear that is not really the plan, that is not really what was \ngoing to happen. Last week, Secretary Thompson came to the Budget \nCommittee. I questioned him about that. No, there was no intention to \nsay that seniors would have to go into a private sector HMO in order to \nbe able to get critical help; everyone would have help.\n  Today we find out that, again, that is really what they are talking \nabout: Small change, cosmetic change, to attempt to address concerns \nthat have been raised on both sides of the aisle by very prestigious \nMembers of this body who are concerned that every senior has Medicare, \nevery senior has the right to make sure that plan covers prescription \ndrugs and gives them help with their medicine.\n\n  What do we see? We see a proposal that says if you stay in the plan \nthat works for every senior--40 million people in Medicare now--if you \nstay in that plan, we will give you a discount card which the GAO says \ndoes not nearly produce the savings spoken about frequently. Less than \n10 percent savings. You have to make sure you are going to the right \nmedicine, have the right medicine, and heaven forbid if you need more \nthan one kind of medicine from more than one company because then it \ndoes not work so well. But we will give you a discount card. Then maybe \ndown the road a number of years, we will help you, if you have a very \nlarge prescription drug bill, with what is called catastrophic help.\n  To add insult to injury, the discount card is being proposed to take \neffect in 2004--not even immediately, when we know there are discount \ncards available on the market now. The major companies all have \ndiscount cards. The President is saying the discounts card will not be \navailable until 2004 and the rest of the plan, not until 2006.\n  The first thing I say today--and I know my colleagues hear the same \nthing I hear--seniors believe they have waited long enough. We have \ntalked about this issue. I have been involved in efforts to get \nprescription drug coverage under Medicare since I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. Certainly seniors have been speaking about that long \nbefore. They want us to provide help now, and they are not interested \nin something that forces them into another kind of plan, a private \nsector plan. They want Medicare to simply cover prescription drugs.\n  Frequently we hear used the words: Choice. This kind of plan will \nprovide more choices for our seniors. If we have more private sector \nHMOs, there are more choices.\n  What I hear from my great State of Michigan is not that people want \nmore, different kinds of complicated insurance plans to figure out. \nThat is not the choice they are asking for. The choice they are asking \nfor is the choice to go to the doctor they choose, their own doctor, \nwho can prescribe the medicine they need. That is the choice they want. \nIt is very clear. The seniors of America have already spoken on this \nissue with their feet. The majority when given the choice of going to \nan HMO under Medicare+Choice, said no and stayed in traditional \nMedicare. That is the reality. Seniors were given a choice about \nwhether or not to keep the stable, reliable, Medicare plan that has \nbeen in place since 1965 or go to a private sector HMO. They stayed \nwith Medicare.\n  Now the President is saying: Even though you made that choice, we are \ngoing to give you another choice, and we will penalize you this time. \nLast time, you could choose, stay in traditional Medicare or do \nMedicare+Choice; this time, because we did not like the choice you \nmade, we are going to say you cannot get comprehensive help if you stay \nin traditional Medicare. You have to go into a private sector HMO in \norder to get the help you need and the help you deserve.\n  When looking at this issue about the private sector HMO approach or \nMedicare+Choice, we also have a situation where in 12 States there are \nno private HMO options under Medicare. In my home State, where people \ndid sign up--and I have said before, my mother signed up and had a \npositive experience under Medicare+Choice with her HMO. But the HMO \ndropped Medicare beneficiaries. She got dropped a couple of years ago \nbecause they believed it was not profitable because of concerns about \nreimbursements. So now in Michigan only 2 percent of those who are \nreceiving Medicare are in an HMO, and they are not enrolling any new \npeople. You had better live in the eastern part of the State of \nMichigan or you do not have that as a choice.\n  If one resides in the great city of Marquette or Iron Mountain in the \nUP or Sault Sainte Marie or on the west side of the State where the \nPresident visited after the State of the Union, in Grand Rapids, MI, to \ntalk about Medicare, in that community where the President visited, we \ncertainly welcome always having a President come to town, but no one \nlistening at that speech would have access to a private sector HMO \nunder Medicare. So we have a situation where it is too little, it is \ntoo late, and this is an effort basically to force seniors into an \napproach the majority of them have already said they do not want.\n\n  Another piece I am very concerned about is that as we look at \nprescription drug coverage, it is not just about comprehensive care \nunder Medicare; it is about lowering prices. It is about lowering \nprices for everyone: For the business that is paying for prescription \ndrug coverage, that has seen their health care premiums skyrocket, \nbusinesses large and small; for families, workers who are affected, as \nwell as for seniors. I am disturbed that this plan does not say \nanything about more competition to lower prices. In fact, while seniors \nare waiting until 2004 for a discount card that will have very little \neffect in lowering their prices--while they are waiting, the fastest \nway the President could join with us to lower prices would be to simply \ndrop the barrier that stops Americans from going to Canada to get \nAmerican-made, American-subsidized prescription drugs at half the \nprice.\n  If we did that today, tomorrow we could drop prices, many of them in \nhalf, and in some cases even more. That is a proposal that passed the \nSenate last summer on a strong bipartisan vote. I am hopeful we will \nsee that happen again this year; that we will once again say we need to \ndrop that barrier.\n  We are in a free trade economy. We have agreements with Canada. Their \nhealth care system, in terms of quality controls and the other issues \nof safety we are concerned about, is very similar to those of our \ncountry. If we want, we can say to seniors, you do not have to get on a \nbus now and go to a Canadian doctor or Canadian pharmacy to get an \nAmerican drug at half the price; we will open the border and get you \nthat right here at home.\n  That is the fastest way to lower prices. The next fastest way is to \nclose loopholes that allow brand name drug companies to stop \nunadvertised brands from going on the market--often called generic \ndrugs. It is the same drug, frequently, the same formula. The \ndifference is we are not seeing it on television every other minute. We \nare seeing generic drugs come onto the market that are available and in \nsome cases can lower prices up to 50 percent, or we have seen prices \nlowered up to 70 percent as a result of the use of generics. There is \nno mention of that here.\n  I commend the President in coming forward with a proposal regarding \ngeneric drugs that has made some inroads. We appreciate it. They have\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\ngone about half the way. Now we would call upon the President to join \nwith us to go all the way to address the issue on generic drugs, and to \nwork with us to pass the bill that has been introduced by my colleagues \nSenator McCain and Senator Schumer, again a bipartisan bill, that would \nin fact put more competition into the system and lower prices--not only \nlower prices for our seniors under Medicare but lower prices for those \ncovered in the private sector, thus bringing down the costs to \nbusinesses large and small.\n  I am disappointed we do not have in this proposal an effort to \nsupport our States, our Governors--Democrats and Republicans--who \nindicated last week that health care costs and Medicaid costs are a top \npriority for them. It is a large part of their budgets as they are \nstruggling under a weakened economy. Many States, including my own \nMichigan, have been innovative, want to come together with other States \nto do bulk purchasing of prescription drugs in order to get discounts, \nbigger discounts than you can get through a discount card, to lower \nprices. We have seen States such as Maine and Vermont that have come \nforward with innovative plans to lower prices, each time being \nchallenged by the brand name industry. In every situation the industry \nis suing or lobbying or doing something to stop competition in \ninnovation in lower prices.\n\n  We had a plan as well. Part of our bill, S. 812, which we passed last \nsummer, was a bill to address more generic drugs, at the same time \nopening the border with Canada, and also supporting the States that \nhave been innovative in coming forward to try to lower prices for their \ncitizens. There is no mention of that in this plan as well.\n  So we do not see anything addressing any of those issues. We see \nnothing in here addressing the concerns that there is more advertising \nmoney now spent by companies than research money--2\\1/2\\ times more \nbeing spent on advertising of the brand name drugs than on researching \nof new cures. We are seeing that drive up the costs as well, the \nexplosion in sales and marketing and advertising.\n  Also, there is no mention of the fact that we are paying for a system \nwhere the majority of patents now are not for new breakthrough drugs \nbut for what are called ``me too'' drugs. Basically 65 percent of \npatents in recent years are patents for drugs that have very little \nchange in health value but just extend the patent so generics cannot go \non the market and there is less competition.\n  There are so many ways we can be working together to lower prices--\nfor employers to create a situation where employees are not being asked \nto take pay freezes so their employer can pay for the costs of health \ncare; lower the prices for the uninsured, who pay the top price; and \nparticularly our seniors. Right now in our country if you are an \nAmerican senior and you walk into the local pharmacy and you do not \nhave insurance, Medicare does not cover it. You pay top dollar of \nanybody in the world for your medicine. That is not an exaggeration. \nAmericans pay top dollar of anybody in the world, and if you are \nuninsured, you pay the top.\n  We are back again talking about these issues of how to provide real \nMedicare coverage and at the same time lower prices for everyone. There \nwere comments about what was going to be proposed by the President. \nThen there were indications from the administration that, no, in fact \nthey were going to be putting forward something that would help \neveryone and not force people into private sector HMOs. Unfortunately, \nagain we see one thing being said and another thing being done.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will come together and we can \nfashion what really needs to happen. Again, our seniors are not asking \nfor more choices about complicated insurance policies. They are not \nasking to wade through more options in terms of private sector HMOs. \nWhen they had the chance to pick between staying with traditional \nMedicare or going to an HMO through Medicare+Choice, the vast majority \nof older Americans and the disabled said no. They said no, we will stay \nwith traditional Medicare.\n  Now that they have said no voluntarily, the White House has decided \nto come back and create a situation where, if they need help, they will \nbe forced to go into a plan they said no to when it was voluntary.\n  I think the people of this country are going to see what this is. I \nthink the seniors are going to understand what this is, and \noverwhelmingly reject this kind of an effort.\n  I hope we in the Senate will reject this kind of a proposal and that \nwe will come together and be willing to roll up our sleeves and do the \nbusiness of simply designing a plan under Medicare where 40 million \nseniors and disabled have the ability to come together under one plan \nand have the clout to lower prices and get that group discount for \nseniors; so they have something that is stable, where everyone knows \nwhat the premium is; so everyone knows what is covered; so it is \nreliable; so it doesn't matter if you live in the upper peninsula of \nMichigan or Benton Harbor, Saint Joe, or the city of Detroit, you would \nknow and you would have it available to you. You could count on it. \nThat has been the strength of Medicare. It has been there for \neveryone, and our older Americans can count on it. They are asking for \nus to simply do the same thing and design prescription drug coverage. \nUnfortunately, what we are hearing about the White House proposal is \nwoefully inadequate.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to immediately reject the proposal and give us \nan opportunity to work together on something that we know we can do \nthat is best.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But I make the point that \nthis is an agreement between two countries--both of which have large \nstocks of nuclear weapons--to reduce their number of nuclear weapons by \ntaking some and putting them in warehouses and storage facilities and \nat the end of the process both countries can keep the same number of \nnuclear weapons they had when they started.\n  No nuclear weapons under this agreement will be destroyed, \ndismantled, or defused.\n  And This treaty deals with only strategic nuclear weapons, not \ntheater nuclear weapons. There are thousands and thousands of theater \nnuclear weapons, such as the nuclear weapons that go on the tips of \nartillery shells. That is not part of this agreement. It has nothing to \ndo with this agreement.\n  Strategic nuclear weapons are the very large warheads that one would \nput on the tip of an ICBM, for example, or to have in the belly of a \nbomber, or perhaps on the tip of a missile that is in a \nsubmarine. Those are the strategic nuclear weapons.\n\n  Between our country and Russia, there are perhaps 10,000, maybe \n11,000, strategic nuclear weapons. So you have thousands on each side. \nShould we be reducing them? Of course. Absolutely.\n  But we have a circumstance now where there is a treaty, or an \nagreement, with Moscow in which, between now and the year 2012, we all \nthe US and Russia have to do is take nuclear weapons and put them in \nstorage. So each side, in the year 2012, can keep if it wants exactly \nthe same number of nuclear weapons. Not one nuclear weapon that exists \ntoday needs to be destroyed in the next 9 years--none.\n  I do not understand that. I guess it is fine to have agreements just \nfor the sake of having agreements, but of what value?\n  We have had examples of effective reductions of nuclear weapons and \nalso delivery vehicles. I have mentioned them in the Chamber on many \noccasions. Let me do so again.\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\n  There is a program called the Nunn-Lugar Program, which is named \nafter former Senator Sam Nunn and our current distinguished colleague, \nSenator Lugar. It is a program that I very strongly support. It makes a \ngreat deal of sense. That program actually destroys nuclear warheads \nand delivery systems that are made excess through the various arms \ncontrol treaties.\n  For example, in my desk I have a piece of metal which I would like to \nshow by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This piece of metal belonged to a Soviet bomber. This was \npart of a wing strut on a Soviet bomber. Presumably, this bomber, \nbelonging to the Soviet Union, carried nuclear weapons that could have \nbeen dropped on a target here in the United States of America.\n  How is it that a Senator on the floor of the Senate has a metal piece \nfrom a Soviet bomber? Well, simple. This bomber had its wings sawed off \nand its fuselage destroyed. How? The U.S. paid for it. We did not shoot \nthe bomber down. This was not the result of hostilities. This was the \nresult of an agreement between our country and the old Soviet Union, \nnow Russia, to actually reduce delivery vehicles, bombers, missiles, \nsubmarines, and to actually reduce the number of nuclear weapons.\n  So that is how I come to hold in my hand a piece of metal that \nbelonged to a Soviet bomber, and then Russian bomber, that would carry \nnuclear weapons that would have threatened this country.\n  Mr. President, I show you this little tube of ground copper. This \nused to be in a submarine that carried nuclear weapons on behalf of the \nold Soviet Union and then Russia. Those nuclear weapons were all aimed \nat this country, thousands of them. Well, this submarine does not carry \nnuclear weapons anymore. It was dismantled and destroyed. And I have \nhere, on the floor of the Senate, a piece of ground up copper from the \nwiring of an old Soviet submarine.\n  That makes a lot of sense to me. We are actually reducing the threat \nby reducing the number of delivery vehicles, bombers, submarines, \nmissiles, and dismantling the number of warheads.\n  We have been engaged in that for the last 10 years or so. And I would \nlike to especially say my colleagues, Senator Lugar and Senator Nunn, \nproposed a program by which we did not have to sink a Soviet submarine \nand we did not have to shoot down a Soviet bomber in order to destroy \nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery vehicles. We paid for \ntheir destruction with large circular saws and with devices in \nshipyards that destroyed their submarine by agreement.\n\n  By contrast, the agreement that comes to the floor of the Senate this \nweek is kind of a marshmallow. It does not do anything. It is full of \nair. It says: Oh, let's have each side put more of their nuclear \nweapons in storage and then pretend we have reduced the number of \nnuclear weapons. Well, I thought pretend was all about children's \nbooks; it is not about the serious business of nuclear arms control.\n  There was a rumor, some long while ago, that a terrorist organization \nhad stolen a nuclear weapon and was set to detonate it in a U.S. city. \nThe interesting thing about that rumor was that the intelligence \ncommunity did not view it as incredible that a nuclear weapon could \nhave been stolen. After all, there where thousands and thousands and \nthousands in the world, most possessed by two countries--ours and also \nnow Russia.\n  So our intelligence community did not believe it was an incredible \nthreat. They believed it was entirely possible someone could have \nstolen a weapon, particularly from the Russian arsenal that does not \nhave great command and control, I have heard and I have been told. And \nsecondly, it was not something beyond the bounds of reality that, \nhaving stolen a nuclear weapon, a terrorist organization would know how \nto detonate it or could detonate it.\n  If ever there needed to be a sober moment, that was it.\n  For us to think that the potential stealing of one nuclear weapon, \nand put in the wrong hands--the hands of terrorists--would threaten \nthis country, or any city in this country, ought to lead us to \nunderstand that if we are worried about one nuclear weapon, we ought to \nbe worried about thousands and thousands and thousands of nuclear \nweapons.\n  With both strategic and theater nuclear weapons, there are perhaps as \nmany as 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear weapons in this world. And what are we \ngoing to do this week? We are going to come and talk about how we \nshuffle the inventory of nuclear weapons from one place to another, \ndestroying none of them, and then saying: We have an agreement. What a \ngreat agreement. By the year 2012, we will have moved nuclear weapons \ninto storage facilities. And the world is safer.\n  Oh, really? How?\n  At the same time all of this is occurring, there is a fundamental \nshift occurring, in addition, with respect to the discussion about \nnuclear weapons. This administration says: We do not want to continue \nthe antiballistic missile treaty--which has been the center pole of the \ntent of arms control.\n  Instead, this administration says: We want to talk about and consider \nthe possibility of developing new designer nuclear weapons; for \nexample, bunker buster nuclear weapons.\n  This administration, and many in this Congress--too many in this \nSenate--said: We do not support the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty--despite the fact that we have not tested a nuclear weapon for \nwell over a decade.\n  There is a fundamental shift going on. This administration has said: \nWe have not ruled out the use of nuclear weapons in certain \ncircumstances. I will not go into them, but they have been in the \nnewspapers.\n  I think our responsibility--of all countries in the world--is to be a \nleader in trying to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in this world, \nand to try to convince everyone and anyone that no one shall ever again \nexplode a nuclear weapon in anger.\n  Pakistan and India both have nuclear weapons. They do not like each \nother. They have been exchanging weapons fire across the border with \nrespect to Kashmir. Both have nuclear weapons. Do we want, in any way, \nto signal that the use of nuclear weapons, in any circumstance, is \nappropriate? Do we want to signal that we actually have a desire to \nbegin producing new types of nuclear weapons, such as bunker buster \nnuclear weapons?\n  I think this country has chosen the wrong path with respect to these \npolicies. We ought to be debating on the floor of the Senate something \nthat has grip to it, something that says: Look, as a world leader, it \nis our determination to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and to stop \nthe spread now. And we are going to do that.\n  We ought to be saying: It is our judgment that we want to reduce the \nstockpile of nuclear weapons in this world. And we want to be a leader \nin doing that. We just have to assume that leadership responsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3052-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3052-S3053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR SENIORS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, having said that, I want to mention two \nadditional quick items.\n  We have had a discussion, and will have a discussion, about the \nsubject of Medicare. It will be a significant issue in this Congress, \nand should be. We have been talking, for a long while, about the health \nneeds of senior citizens who do not have access to prescription drugs \nbecause they are too expensive. Too many senior citizens are told: You \nmust take prescription drugs for these ailments you have; and they \ndiscover: Well, I can't take prescription drugs. I don't have the \nmoney.\n  Republicans and Democrats have been debating how to add a \nprescription drug benefit to the Medicare plan. Today I see the \nPresident is going to send us a proposal that says we would like to \ngive everybody a discount card who would qualify under Medicare, and \nthen say to others, if they want to get some real help for real \nprescription drug coverage, they have to join an HMO or a managed care \norganization. That doesn't make any sense to me as a matter of public \npolicy. We need to put downward pressure on prescription drug prices \nfirst and foremost.\n  Second, I believe we ought to provide a prescription drug benefit in \nthe Medicare Program. If we were writing that program today, we would \ndo that. I\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\ndon't think we ought to hinge that on the requirement that someone join \nan HMO.\n  I have been in the Chamber telling stories for 3, 4 years about what \nis happening to HMOs. Some of them are wonderful. But the construct of \nan HMO says to a senior citizen: By the way, here is your doctor. We \nwill choose your doctor. You don't get to go to the doctor of your \nchoice. Here is the doctor available for you. By the way, in too many \ncircumstances, we have seen that in many of those organizations, major \nhealth care is a function of profit and loss.\n  I told the story, when we debated a Patients' Bill of Rights, about \nan HMO. A woman fell off a cliff in the Shenandoah Mountains. She was \ninjured badly, had a long fall, broke many bones, had internal \ninjuries. She was taken to a hospital in a coma. As she was wheeled \ninto the hospital room on a gurney, there was a question whether she \nwould survive. She did survive. It took a long while. Month after \nmonth, she finally convalesced and survived.\n  Her HMO told her: We will not pay for your emergency room treatment \nbecause you didn't have prior approval for emergency room use.\n  This is a woman hauled into the emergency room in a coma and was \ntold: You don't get paid for the emergency room because you didn't get \nprior approval. Is that nuts? Of course it is. That is exactly what \nhappened to this woman because somebody was looking at her in terms of \nprofit and loss. That is not the way someone's person or body should be \npresented in the medical system. This is not profit and loss. It is \nabout saving lives.\n  To say to senior citizens we will help them with the cost of \nprescription drugs but only if they go into an HMO or a managed care \norganization does not make much sense to me. This Congress can do \nbetter than that. We must do better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3053-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3053-S3054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I also want to mention something I talked \nabout yesterday. That is on the subject of the trade deficit. My \ncolleagues know that we face a fiscal policy budget deficit of well \nover $400 billion this year, and we also face at the same time the \nlargest trade deficit in American history, $470 billion; over $400 \nbillion in our budget deficit and $470 billion in our merchandise trade \ndeficit in the past year. That is nearing $1 trillion in combined \ndeficits for our country.\n  I don't know. I thought that we were about to enter a period of \nfiscal responsibility. Two years ago we had what was alleged to be \nsurpluses as far as the eye could see. It was good times; following the \n1990s, budget surpluses nearly forever. The fact is, now we see budget \ndeficits that exhaust all of our patience as far as the eye can see; \nspending money we don't have, in some cases on things we don't need, \nyear after year after year. It won't go away because we ignore it. We \nignore it at our peril. We ought to deal with both.\n  We are preparing for armed conflict. Our thoughts and prayers go with \nthose who wear this country's uniform. We face severe and stiff \nchallenges in foreign policy with North Korea, Iraq, the threat of \nterrorism against our homeland, and the war against terrorism abroad.\n  At the same time that exists, we have an economy that is stuttering \nand in trouble. Then we are told that on top of fiscal policy, budget \ndeficits of over $400 billion in this year, at a time when we increased \ndefense spending by $45 billion, increased homeland security spending \nby over $30 billion, we are told at the same time by the President that \nhe wants a tax cut of $675 billion over the next 10 years on a \npermanent basis.\n  I don't understand how that adds up. Then, in addition to that fiscal \npolicy dealing with the Federal budget, we have these abiding trade \ndeficits. Those deficits at their root are about jobs.\n  It is about jobs that used to be here that are no longer. Millions of \npeople are out of work and their jobs are elsewhere. We have a large \ntrade deficit with China. Most people don't know that our trade deficit \nwith China is now over $100 billion a year. China sends us all their \ntrinkets, trousers, shirts, shoes. They flood our market with Chinese \ngoods. Then we try to get goods into China, and their markets are not \nvery open to ours.\n  Our trade negotiators negotiated an agreement with China and \neverybody said we have a bilateral agreement with China. I don't know \nwho negotiated it. I would love to get names and pictures so I could \ngive them credit. They apparently, in a room with the Chinese, \nnegotiated a circumstance that said, in the future, when we have trade \nwith automobiles from the United States and China--and incidentally \nthis is a country with 1.3 billion people who will need a lot of cars--\nwhen we have an agreement with China on the trade of automobiles, we \nwill agree, our negotiators said, to allow China to have a tariff that \nis 10 times higher in China on automobiles than we will have on Chinese \ncars coming to the U.S.\n  Our Government said: We will agree to have a tariff on U.S. cars \nbeing sold in the country of China that is 10 times higher than the \ntariff that would be imposed on a Chinese car sold in the United \nStates. Does that make sense? It doesn't.\n  My point is, the root of all of this is about jobs, about economic \nopportunity. Our economy is not going to get well unless it has some \nresurrection of strength in the manufacturing sector. We are, every day \nin every way, trading away manufacturing jobs.\n\n  The trade ambassador said: We are losing manufacturing jobs, but we \nhave cable television.\n  I don't understand that at all. Where does a statement like that come \nfrom? We lose some manufacturing plant and pick up some cable \ntelevision signals? Good for cable television. But the fact is, it is \nnot a replacement for manufacturing. No country will remain a strong \ninternational economic competitor if its sector dissipates. That has \nbeen happening.\n  I talked yesterday about the workers abroad with whom American \nworkers are required to compete: Those who make 14 cents an hour--and, \nyes, they do--at age 14, working 14 hours a day--yes, they do employ \nthose people in some parts of the world. Then the product of their \nlabor is sent to Pittsburgh, Denver, Los Angeles, Fargo, Topeka. It \ngoes on the store shelf, and it is all about profit.\n  People say: Isn't that wonderful for the consumer to have a lower \npriced product? It is not such a lower priced product. It is just that \nthe people who used to have the income to buy it lost their job when \nthe plant went overseas.\n  I also made a mistake yesterday. I mentioned the companies that \nrenounced their American citizenship to save on taxes. They not only \nmoved their plant overseas, but they renounced their American \ncitizenship so they could save on taxes. I talked about them becoming \nBahamian citizens. I should have said Bermuda. I guess some of them \nbecome citizens of the Bahamas, but it is more typical that they became \ncitizens of Bermuda. The Bahamas has a navy with 26 people--I guess \nthat is the Bermuda Navy. I want to correct that. The Bermuda Navy has \n26 people.\n  So if an American company that wants to become a citizen in Bermuda \nand renounce its citizenship runs into trouble someplace, and some \ndisparate country out there decides to expropriate the assets of this \ncompany that used to be American, but is now Bermudan, my feeling is, \nwhen they say let's call out the navy, I think they should call Bermuda \nand say call out your 26-member navy.\n  One of these companies actually had one ship grounded on a sand bar \nnear Cuba. Would you please call out the navy to help? That is what we \nought to tell them to do the next time they need assistance.\n  We have public policies both in fiscal policy dealing with the \nFederal budget and in trade policies that are in desperate need of \nattention. There is no attention paid to it at all at this moment, \nexcept for some of us in the Congress who want to see if we can do a U-\nturn on some of these policies and put us back on track towards more \neconomic growth and more jobs for this country. The sooner we get to \nthat real debate, the better.\n  This economy of ours can't run on paper. It can't run on promises. \nThis economy needs a shot in the arm by a Congress that is willing to \nstand up to these issues and say: Our fiscal policy doesn't add up.\n  I come from a very small school. My senior class was 9; 40 kids in \nall four\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\ngrades of high school in a town of 350 people that I came from. But \nthere is only one way they teach math. They taught math the same way in \nthat small school they teach it in the biggest and best school in the \nUnited States. That is, 1 and 1 equals 2, not 3.\n  I studied hard and I learned that. Some in this town with advanced \ndegrees have decided that 1 plus 1 is 3. In fact, you can find it in \nthe budget documents. The fact is, the American people all understand \nit is a mirage. None of this adds up. This is a tough time and it \nrequires tough choices. I wish it weren't. I wish it was a time when we \nhad unparalleled economic growth, when the economy was rebounding, the \nstock market was moving up, and everybody was employed. But the fact is \nthat is not the case.\n  We face serious, abiding economic challenges. This President needs to \nsend a program to this Congress and this Congress has a requirement, it \nseems to me--if this President won't act, the Congress has a \nrequirement to act to say we need to put this country back on track. \nThe current circumstances simply do not add up.\n  I used to teach economics in college for a couple years. Everyone \ntalks about the business cycle. We have been hit with things in this \neconomy that are pretty unparalleled. Some of us warned about this 2 \nyears ago when the President proposed a $1.7 trillion tax cut. Some of \nus said maybe we ought to be a little conservative here. What if the \nbottom falls out and we run into tough times, or turbulence, or get \nsome bad economic news? They said not to worry. We have blue skies as \nfar as you can see, straight ahead--budget surpluses forever, the \nPresident said. We passed that--not with my vote--long-term permanent \ntax cut, and then immediately we found out we were in a recession. We \ngot hit with the terrorist attack of 9/11, and we were at a war with \nterrorists; and we now have the largest budget deficits we have seen. \nWe had the largest corporate scandals in history. All of this is coming \ntogether at the same time, at the same intersection, and the budget \nsurpluses turned into deficits, and the deficits got bigger and bigger.\n  The President says the antidote is to give more tax cuts and make \nthem permanent. It seems to me he requires all of us to say we all like \ntax cuts. It would be nice if nobody had to pay any taxes. Count me in. \nI expect my constituents would appreciate the fact they would not have \nto pay taxes. Part of the cost of what we do together as citizens in \nbuilding roads, schools, and providing for the common defense--part of \nthe cost of that is the taxes we must pay. What the President is \nproposing in his budget is, by the way, let's be a bit short next \nyear--about $400 billion short--and we will charge it over to the kids. \nWe will let the kids assume that role of paying for it. We will consume \nmore than we are willing to raise, and we will let the kids pay it off \nsome time later. That doesn't add up, either.\n  By the way, the President also says, well, the economy is \nfundamentally sound, we don't need to do much right now in terms of \nstimulus. The fact is, when we teach about the contraction and \nexpansion side of the economy in the business cycle, you teach about \nconfidence. The expansion and contraction side of the business cycle is \nall about confidence. If people are confident in the future, they do \nthe following: Buy a house, buy a car, take a trip. They do the things \nthat manifest their confidence in the future because they have a job \nand they feel good about the future. And that confluence of individual \nacts around the country creates the expansion side of the business \ncycle. But when they are not confident about the future, they do the \nopposite. They defer the purchase of that appliance for their home, or \nthat automobile they were looking to purchase, or the home, or the \ntrip. When they defer that purchase, the economy contracts. It is all \nabout the confidence with which the people view the future.\n  At the moment, the people are not confident about the future. There \nis not a lot we can do about the mechanics of the economy, because now \nthe lead stories are about war, so there will never be confidence until \nwe get through this period. We cannot ignore what is happening in our \ncountry with fiscal policy, trade policy, and a whole series of issues \nthat some apparently feel we should pretend are all right but, in fact, \nare not all right--are seriously amiss.\n  That brings me back to the point I started with. The agreement that \nwill be on the floor of the Senate this week dealing with the Moscow \nTreaty is just another piece of pretend policy. Everybody will vote for \nit. Why wouldn't you? What is wrong with it? But it does nothing. It \nsays the U.S. and Russia are going to reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons, not by getting rid of them, but by putting them into storage. \nSo what does that do to make the world safer? The answer is nothing. \nMost people know it.\n  There is the other piece of responsibility that is required--yes, of \nthis President and of this Congress--and that is to provide world \nleadership and reduce the number of nuclear weapons, reduce the threat \nof nuclear war; and stop the spread of nuclear weapons around the \nworld. It is the President's and our responsibility here in Congress. \nWe ought not to pretend that we are taking action that really has very \nlittle impact with respect to fiscal policy, trade policy, nuclear arms \ncontrol policy, because that will not ensure the future of this country \nand will not give our children confidence about the future of this \ncountry or this world.\n  So, Mr. President, my hope and expectation is that we can make tough \ndecisions and come together and decide, yes, if it is heavy lifting, it \nrequires all of us to do it together. I am tired of ``let's pretend.'' \nThat is what is happening all too often both at the White House and \nalso here in the Congress. Let's pretend on nuclear arms policy. Let's \npretend on fiscal policy and trade policy. That, in my judgment, is a \nfoolish approach. We need to do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend starts, we have other \npeople who wish to speak who can come this afternoon. I am curious as \nto roughly how long the Senator wishes to speak.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I suspect 15 to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise once again to support Miguel \nEstrada's nomination to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia. Miguel Estrada is being treated unfairly by \nSenators on the other side of the aisle who continue to practice such \nblatant obstructionism in an effort to score petty partisan points. \nIndeed, the obstructing Senators are shirking, in my view, their duty \nby avoiding a vote on this gentleman, Miguel Estrada, who was nominated \n22 months ago by President Bush.\n  This is not mere payback; it is an escalation in a bitter battle by \nthe Senate Democrats to keep judges off this court who properly \nconstrue the Constitution and respect the laws duly enacted by the \nelected legislature. That is disappointing, and it is dangerous.\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\n  The Senate Democrats' filibuster is a recipe for endless gridlock and \na terrible disservice to the American people and the administration of \njustice.\n  Our protracted debate on the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia makes clear the \nimportance of sound reasoning judges on our circuit courts. For \nexample, look at the recent denial of a rehearing decision by another \ncircuit court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I object to the \ndecision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which will strip the \nPledge of Allegiance from classrooms and over 9,600,000 students in \nWestern United States. This decision is a miscarriage of justice.\n\n  The majority opinion lacks a clear reading of the constitutional \nintent and the legal precedent, and there is clearly a lack of common \nsense. This decision, frankly, is an abuse of power by the majority of \nthose judges who sit on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  We all know well the history of our Nation and the fundamental ideas \nof freedom, particularly those of religious freedom, which in Virginia \nwe call the first freedom. It was because of the desire to worship \nfreely, to escape religious persecution in European countries that many \ncame to settle in the American Colonies, from Pilgrims to French \nHuguenots. From New England to Virginia to South Carolina, many came to \nsettle in this country to get away from Europe, ruled in large part by \nmonarchs who served not by any talent, quality, or the consent of the \npeople, but, as they called it, divine right. That divine right was \ngenerally conferred upon them by the exclusive monopoly of one church. \nSo there was a co-conspiracy of a monarchy and an exclusive religion.\n  In the Virginia Colony, it was the Anglican Church that was forced \nupon the people. Baptists, in particular, were forced to pay to that \nestablished church. Indeed, when they talk about the Danbury letter to \nthe Baptists, the Baptists were very happy when Thomas Jefferson was \nelected President. If one looks at what is in the Virginia statute of \nreligious freedom, which was the predecessor of part of the first \namendment of the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution, one gets a \nbetter sense of what religious freedom and the so-called establishment \nclause is all about.\n  I will read from article I, section 16, in the Virginia Constitution \nthat still remains and, of course, is built upon Mr. Jefferson's \nstatute of religious freedom which was also involved in the Virginia \nDeclaration of Rights which became eventually the first amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  It reads:\n\n       That religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and \n     the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason \n     and conviction, not by force or violence; and, therefore, all \n     men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, \n     according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the \n     mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, \n     and charity towards each other. No man shall be compelled to \n     frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry \n     whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or \n     burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on \n     account of his religious opinions or belief; but all men \n     shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their \n     opinions in matters of religion, and the same shall in nowise \n     diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities. And the \n     General Assembly shall not prescribe any religious test \n     whatever, or confer any peculiar privileges or advantages on \n     any sect or denomination, or pass any law requiring or \n     authorizing any religious society, or the people of any \n     district within this Commonwealth, to levy on themselves or \n     others, any tax for the erection or repair of any house of \n     public worship, or for the support of any church or ministry; \n     but it shall be left free to every person to select his \n     religious instructor, and to make for his support such \n     private contract as he shall please.\n\n  That, in my view, is the full historical context, from the founding \ndocuments since Virginia first passed the Statute of Religious Freedom, \nof what the first amendment should be.\n  Obviously, the first amendment of our Constitution is but a few \nsentences, but this gives the historical and the legal grounding of the \nStatute of Religious Freedom.\n  We all know well the words written by Thomas Jefferson proclaiming \nour independence from the religiously oppressive British monarchy. \nThese words allowed our young Nation to:\n\n       Assume the powers of the Earth, the separate and equal \n     station to which laws of nature and of nature's God.\n\n  These are words that tell all of us, as Americans, that all men are \nendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among \nthese are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These words \nstill stir our hearts. They inspire us to continue to build that \nshining city on a hill, to be that beacon of freedom, religious or \notherwise, for people all around the world.\n  Our Constitution, the hallowed document, can be summed up by one word \nand one idea: Freedom. The Constitution and the institution and the \nformation of this Government to protect those God-given rights and \nthose freedoms states that Congress shall make no law respecting the \nestablishment of religion.\n  While some conveniently use this to perpetrate actions such as those \nwe saw out in San Francisco last week, it is often forgotten that the \nConstitution just as clearly states that the Congress shall make no law \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n  I feel confident that the scholarly Miguel Estrada, who was editor of \nthe Harvard Law Review, would have views similar to the dissent written \nby Judges O'Scannlain and Ferdinand Fernandez. As Judge O'Scannlain \nnotes in his well-reasoned and thoughtful dissent, this decision of the \nNinth Circuit Court is wrong on many levels. It is wrong because \nreciting of the Pledge of Allegiance is simply not a religious act, as \nthe two-judge majority asserts. The decision is wrong as a matter of \nSupreme Court precedent as properly understood. The decision is wrong \nbecause it denies the will of the people of California as expressed in \nsection 52720 of the California education code, and it is wrong as a \nmatter of common sense.\n  I trust the Supreme Court of the United States will grant a writ of \ncertiorari and promptly hear and decide this case. I, of course, hope \nthey will reverse it. Parenthetically, I support the resolution of \nSenator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska expressing support for the Pledge of \nAllegiance, and I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor \nof that measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. In the realm of public education, the Supreme Court--and \nthe Presiding Officer of the Senate right now is well aware of \nprecedent in the various decisions the Supreme Court has made when \ndealing in the realm and the issue of public education and prayer, or \nthe religious tests. There are at least three different but \ninterrelated tests used to analyze alleged violations of the \nestablishment clause--in other words, the establishment of a religion. \nIt is a three-pronged test, first articulated in the case of Lemon v. \nKurtzman, called the Lemon test, and that is to determine whether that \npublic activity had a primarily secular purpose. Here, the Pledge of \nAllegiance is primarily a patriotic event and purpose.\n  The second test is called the endorsement test. Here, there is no \nendorsement of any denomination of any religion. So that test is \npassed.\n\n  The third test is called the coercion test, and there is no coercion \nhere for students.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has commented that the \npresence of ``one nation under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance is \nconstitutional. The Supreme Court will have an opportunity to clearly \nresolve this because sometimes there are judges who have to be reversed \non many occasions before they understand the plain intent of the law, \nof previous opinions and the history of our country.\n  I will not discuss how the Ninth Circuit erred in the applications of \nthe facts of this case to the establishment clause, but I do commend to \nmy colleagues the dissent of Judge O'Scannlain, which I hope will give \nguidance to the Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court when they do review \nthis case.\n  As a resource, I direct the attention of my colleagues to some \noutstanding historical analysis prepared by a gentleman from Texas, \nDavid Barton, and an organization called Wall Builders.\n  If reciting the pledge is truly a religious act, in violation of the \nestablishment clause, then so the recitation of our Constitution itself \nwould be, which refers to the ``year of our Lord'' and our Declaration \nof Independence, which\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\ncontains multiple references to God. Our Founders claimed the right to \ndissolve the political bands based on the laws of nature and of \nnature's God.\n  The most famous passage, of course, is the ``all men are created \nequal'' and they are ``endowed by their Creator with certain \nunalienable rights.'' Subsequently, the signatories ``appeal to the \nSupreme Judge of the world to rectify their intentions''; our national \nmotto, which is ``in God we trust''; and the singing of the national \nanthem, a verse which says: ``And this motto: In God we trust.''\n  Furthermore, the Supreme Court, even the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, opens sessions with a call that says, ``God save the United \nStates and this honorable court.''\n  There is an undeniable and historical relationship between God and \nour Founders and the Government leaders throughout our history. In \nfact, it was Congress in 1837, acting on the will of the people, that \nauthorized the motto ``In God We Trust'' to be printed on our currency. \nWe can cite the actions of the entire body of Founding Fathers. For \nexample, in 1800 when Washington, DC, became the Nation's Capital and \nthe President moved to the White House and Congress into the Capitol, \nCongress approved the use of the Capitol Building as a church building \nfor Christian worship services. In fact, Christian worship services on \nSunday were started at the Treasury Building and at the War Office.\n  A scant review of the legislative history in States and the Federal \nGovernment and the intent of our Founders, from George Washington to \nThomas Jefferson, lays out the utter absurdity--no; actually, the \narrogance--of this Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and this decision.\n  Each of us who has the high privilege to sit in this Chamber is very \nwell aware of the circumstances by which the phrase ``one nation under \nGod'' became a part of the pledge in 1954. It was the will of the \nCongress, the will of the people, that put it there, and today it is a \nwill, unfortunately, of a few unelected judges who seek to remove it.\n  The State of California is not unique in encouraging students to \nengage in appropriate patriotic exercise. My Commonwealth of Virginia \nhas a statute requiring the daily recitation of the Pledge of \nAllegiance in every classroom. It is thoughtfully crafted. The Virginia \nstatute provides that:\n\n       No student shall be compelled to recite the Pledge if he, \n     his parent or legal guardian, objects on religious, \n     philosophical or other grounds to his participating in this \n     exercise. Students who are thus exempt from reciting the \n     Pledge shall remain quietly standing or sitting at their desk \n     while others recite the Pledge. . . .\n\n  As Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I was proud to have been \nable to sign into law a commonsense provision to develop guidelines for \nreciting the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools in 1996.\n  While we can go on about this, the point is that the pledge is a \npatriotic exercise. Thomas Jefferson, who authored the Statute of \nReligious Freedom, had no intention of allowing the Government to \nlimit, restrict, regulate, or interfere with public religious \npractices. He believed, along with the other Founders, that the first \namendment had been enacted only to prevent the Federal establishment of \na national denomination. This patriotic pledge establishes no religious \ndenomination.\n  These Ninth Circuit Court judges discredit, in my view, the \njudiciary. This is an example of government overreach in a very \ndifferent and harmful way. It is judicial activism at its very worst. \nIt is activism by unelected judges who, through this decision, and \ndecisions such as this, usurp the policymaking role given to this body \nand to the people of the States, the rights that are guaranteed to all \nof us and the people in the States by the U.S. Constitution.\n  Let me take a moment to put this decision into context. The Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals has a long recent record of issuing decisions \nthat are clearly out of step with most Americans--I daresay, reality--\nand out of the bounds of American jurisprudence.\n\n  The court has become famous--maybe I should say infamous--for several \ndecisions. The Ninth Circuit Court is the most overturned appeals court \nin the country. The decisions issued by this court have been reversed \nby the U.S. Supreme Court more frequently and by a larger margin than \nany other court of appeals in the Nation. In recent years, the reversal \nrate has hovered around 80 percent.\n  In one recent session of the Supreme Court alone, an astonishing 28 \nout of 29 appeal decisions of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals were \noverturned--97 percent were overturned.\n  What is the next decision out of this Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals? \nWill they ban the singing of ``God Bless America'' in our schools? Will \nthey redact our founding documents, some of which are the greatest \ndocuments in all the history of mankind and civilization? Will the \nCongress, the Supreme Court, and State legislatures across the land be \nprohibited from opening their sessions by saying the pledge because \nthat somehow might offend the sensibilities of someone watching a \nlegislative body open with the Pledge of Allegiance?\n  The fact is, this is not an argument of God or no God. It is not an \nargument about separation of church and state. It is not an argument of \nthe establishment of a religious denomination. Saying the pledge is no \nmore a religious act than is purchasing a candy bar with a coin that \nsays ``In God We Trust.''\n  Let us understand the fact is this, and I think most Americans agree: \nThe Pledge of Allegiance should remain in our schools and other public \nfunctions. As it is today, it should be a voluntary matter of personal \nconscience. On this issue and so many others, the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals is out of touch and flatout wrong. This errant decision \nclearly points out the need to put commonsense, reasonable, well-\ngrounded judges on the Federal bench, rather than dangerous activists \nwho ignore the will of the people of the States, who ignore common \nsense, and apparently disagree with or are pitifully ignorant of the \nfoundational principles of these United States.\n  This is a wake-up call, a wake-up call for those on the other side of \nthe aisle who are holding up the confirmation of people like Miguel \nEstrada, while at the same time maybe signing on to Senator Murkowski's \nresolution or maybe at the same time coming down to the floor to rail \nagainst activist decisions such as the one that came out of the Ninth \nCircuit last week.\n  I have come to this floor many times, as I know the Presiding Officer \nhas, to advocate for Mr. Estrada. The fact is, he is qualified. He has \nearned the unanimous highest rating from the American Bar Association, \nthe rating that my friends on the other side of the aisle have \npreviously, on other nominees, described as a gold standard for \njudicial nominees.\n  Mr. Estrada embodies the modern-day American dream that we so fondly \ntalk about. He, like many others who came to this country in recent \ndecades, came from a Latin American country. He, like those who came to \nJamestown, VA, in 1607, or in a later year, Cajuns, Irish, Scottish, \nGerman, Scandinavian, Italian, Polish, Korean, Vietnamese, Pakistani, \nIndian, Lebanese, Persians, or even my own mother, all came to this \ncountry to seek out a better life. He has overcome tremendous \nobstacles. He has worked hard. He has embraced the opportunity that \nbecame available to better himself and found a fulfilling life in \nthis land of opportunity.\n\n  Now Miguel Estrada stands at the precipice of service on an important \nDC Court of Appeals. He is ready, qualified, and more than able to take \nthe next step, and for no other reason than scoring political points \nhis nomination is being obstructed, delayed, and denied.\n  Let me say very clearly, those who deny Mr. Estrada a vote by this \nbody are doing more harm than they realize. For Miguel Estrada and \nevery other person who believes the American dream can happen, that \nshining city on the hill is dimmed today because of the partisan games \ntaking place in this body. I respectfully encourage those on the other \nside of the aisle to take a lesson today. Do the right thing. Work your \nwill and constitutional responsibilities. Have the gumption to take a \nstand and cast your vote.\n  I have no problem in taking a stand in explaining why I support \nMiguel Estrada. For those who are opposed, have the gumption to vote no \nand then explain your vote rather than perpetrating this irresponsible, \nduplicitous filibuster, which is thwarting the will of the majority of \nthe Senators.\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\n  Concerning both the Pledge of Allegiance and the confirmation of \nMiguel Estrada, the power of the dream and the promise of America is \nrooted in one idea: that the direction of our Nation is and will always \nbe determined by the consent and will of the people. The consent and \nwill of the people is not being effectuated by the irresponsibility of \na few, whether they be judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals or \nthe Senate. Senators need to exercise their responsibilities to advise \nand consent on nominees.\n  I hope and pray the U.S. Supreme Court will reverse this egregious \ndecision to ban the Pledge of Allegiance in the Western States of our \ncountry. I also hope and pray that Senators will exercise their duty, \ntake a stand, vote yes or no, explain it to their constituents, and the \nwill and the consent of the majority of the people of this country will \nbe effectuated.\n  I close by saying, God bless America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the procedure in the Senate, one of long \nstanding, is that we as Senators have the right to keep what we believe \nis our ability to have our voices heard. In this instance we have said \nnow for some time, if the majority wants to go forward on Miguel \nEstrada, we should have him come back before the Judiciary Committee, \nanswer questions, and with him bring the memos from the Solicitor's \noffice. They have been supplied on other occasions. It has been \nmentioned in the Record specifically how it was done.\n  I am not here, though, to debate the qualifications of Miguel \nEstrada. I am here to talk about my becoming a vocal critic of the \nAmerican Bar Association rating process for judicial nominees. I have \nto say, frankly, I have never been a big fan of the American Bar \nAssociation. I know they do some good things. I have lost significant \nrespect for the operation of rating judges. I do this not in any way to \ndenigrate Miguel Estrada. My statement I make today is in no way to \ndenigrate Miguel Estrada.\n  I have said before, Miguel Estrada graduated from Harvard. He could \nhave graduated at the bottom of his class at Harvard and he still would \nbe one of the more credible, more qualified people to go to law school. \nIt is hard to get into Harvard. But he did not graduate at the bottom. \nHe was one of 71 editors they had at the Law Review, and he was one of \ntheir better students. This is in no way to denigrate the academic \nqualifications of Miguel Estrada. It is to talk about and to criticize \nthe American Bar Association.\n  What the Estrada case has done is lifted the veil on how the ratings \nof the American Bar Association are made, revealing partisanship that \nhas no place in a process that should be as impartial as the judges it \nhelps to select. My criticism goes beyond the specific Estrada case. It \ndemonstrates that we cannot rely on the American Bar Association to \ngive us impartial ratings.\n  This may surprise some, but I will say I support the Republicans' \nstand on what should be done with the American Bar Association as it \nrelates to judges. I think we can and should take them out of the \nprocess. I don't think we need them. I am a convert to that.\n  Some asked why didn't I say I felt that way when Republicans did it \ninitially. I didn't have enough knowledge to do that. I recognize I was \nwrong.\n  So we have this funnel for all Presidential nominees, and when we \nwere a country of a few million people, that funnel was able to put \neverybody through very quickly. But the bigger the country becomes and \nthe more judges we authorize, the more Cabinet officers, the more \nsubcabinet people we authorize, this funnel becomes clogged.\n  The ABA is only one additional way of clogging that as it relates to \njudges. I feel we should get rid of them.\n  The Estrada case most starkly reveals that the ABA process is fatally \nflawed, that its gold seal is, indeed, tarnished. The gold seal of \nimpartiality has been replaced by a stealth seal of partiality. In my \nview, the ABA rating should not be relied on until the process is \nfixed.\n  Unfortunately, as I will discuss in a moment, the ABA is defending \nthis flawed process and its inherently flawed recommendation for Mr. \nEstrada. It defends both in the face of a case that very clearly \nviolates its own conflict of interest rules.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the ABA delegates that review of \npotential nominees to one individual ABA member of the ABA committee \nfor each circuit. In effect, one person is given responsibility to \nrecommend to the committee this person's qualifications. That \nindividual interviews colleagues who know the nominee, evaluates each \nnominee, and reports to the ABA with a recommended rating for the \nnominee.\n  The ABA has three ratings: Not qualified, qualified, and well \nqualified. Mr. Estrada received a well-qualified rating. The ABA \nCommittee member who recommended Mr. Estrada for that rating was Mr. \nFred Fielding. Given the sensitive nature of these recommendations, ABA \nrules specifically prohibit ABA committee members like Mr. Fielding \nfrom engaging in partisan activities while working for the ABA. The \nrules note that:\n\n       [T]he integrity and credibility of its process and the \n     perception of these processes are of vital importance.\n\n  The ABA rules go on to implement this important principle by \nproviding:\n\n       No member of the Committee shall participate in the work of \n     the Committee if such participation would give rise to the \n     appearance of impropriety or would otherwise be incompatible \n     with the purposes served and functions performed by the \n     Committee.\n\n  The rules then get even more specific:\n\n       As a condition of appointment, each member agrees while on \n     the Committee and for at least one year thereafter not to \n     seek or accept [a] federal judicial appointment and agrees \n     while on the Committee not to participate in or contribute to \n     any federal election campaign or engage in partisan political \n     activity. Partisan political activity means that a member, \n     while on the Committee, agrees not to host any fund-raiser or \n     publicly endorse a candidate for federal office. . . .\n\n  The rule concludes:\n\n       In view of the confidence reposed in the Committee and the \n     vital importance of the integrity and credibility of its \n     processes, these constraints are strictly enforced.\n\n  These rules were not enforced in the case of Mr. Estrada. Mr. \nFielding violated them. While on the ABA Committee, Mr. Fielding played \na high-level role in President Bush's transition team. He helped the \nPresident and the White House counsel clear the President's highest \nlevel executive branch appointments in 2000 and 2001. Certainly these \nare far more partisan roles than hosting a fund-raiser or endorsing \ncandidates for Federal office.\n  While on the ABA Committee, Mr. Fielding accepted an appointment from \nPresident Bush to an international center that settles trade dispute, a \njob that pays $2,000 a day plus expenses; $2,000 a day, $14,000 a week, \nthat's a lot of money.\n  While on the ABA Committee, Mr. Fielding helped co-found the partisan \nCommittee for Justice to run ads against Senators who oppose Mr. \nEstrada. Mr. Fielding's partisan activities, in fact, span back \ndecades. He served as deputy counsel to President Nixon. He served on \nthe Reagan-Bush campaign in 1980, the Thursday night group. He served \non the Lawyers for Reagan advisory group, the Bush-Reagan transition in \n1980-1981. He served as the conflict of interest counsel, ironically \nenough.\n  He served in the Office of Counsel to the President, as deputy \ncounsel to President Reagan. He served on the Bush-Quayle campaign in \n1988; as campaign counsel to Senator Quayle; as Republican National \nConventional legal advisor; as campaign counsel to Senator Quayle; and \nas deputy director of the Bush-Quayle transition team. He served on the \nBush-Quayle campaign in 1992; as senior legal advisor and conflict of \ninterest counsel to the Republican National Committee. He served as the \nlegal advisor to the Dole-Kemp campaign in 1996. Just from these \nstatements it would appear he should understand something about \nconflict of interest.\n  The ABA couldn't have picked a Republican with better partisan \ncredentials than Mr. Fielding. And Mr. Fielding didn't just give Mr. \nEstrada a well-qualified rating, every rating Mr. Fielding has handled \nfor President Bush to the D.C. Circuit has resulted in a ``well-\nqualified.'' All of those ratings, in my view, should be held suspect.\n  By contrast, Mr. Fielding did not give any of President Clinton's \nnominees to the D.C. Circuit--nominees who had similar qualifications \nas Mr. Estrada--a well-qualified rating.\n\n[[Page S3058]]\n\n  What has the ABA had to say about all of this? On Thursday, February \n26, 2003, the head of the ABA, Alfred P. Carlton, Jr. sent a letter to \nSenators Frist and Daschle. I was deeply disappointed by its content.\n  In that letter, the ABA declares that our criticism of Mr. Estrada's \ncase is ``unfair'' The ABA goes on to say that we seek to:\n\n       Impugn the integrity of members of the Committee and of its \n     process during the current Senate debate. . . .\n\n  I was also a little disappointed that Mr. Carlton failed to tell me \nabout this letter when he met privately with me a day after the letter \nhad been sent. I didn't ask for that meeting. He asked for it.\n  In that meeting, I strongly encouraged the ABA to strengthen its \nrules and disavow the process that led to Mr. Estrada's recommendation \nand possibly scores more of tainted recommendations. Mr. Carlton told \nme he would consider such a step.\n  I also encouraged Mr. Carlton to write to Senators Frist and Daschle \nand tell them that the ABA would clean up its act. Mr. Carlton also \ntold me he would consider sending such a letter.\n  He not only failed to mention that just the day before he had sent \nthe leaders a letter, but also that the letter was a strongly worded \ndefense of an indefensible process.\n  If the head of the ABA cannot be straight with me, what hope do we \nhave for this process? The letter he sent the leaders reveals that we \nshouldn't have much hope.\n  The ABA says in the letter that we have been critical of Mr. \nFielding's role based solely on the fact that he co-founded the \nCommittee for Justice. The ABA letter implies that this fact is not \nproblematic because the Committee for Justice was formed after Mr. \nFielding made his glowing recommendation of Mr. Estrada. The letter \nfails to mention several things: First, that even this post-Estrada \nactivity violates ABA's clear rules. Second, that Mr. Fielding was \nengaged in the Bush transition partisan activities at the time he was \nmaking his Estrada recommendation. The letter concludes that our \nattacks on this process are ``baseless'' . . .\n  If this is so, then the ABA's own rules are baseless. The ABA cannot \nclaim that our criticism of the way Mr. Estrada's recommendations was \nhandled is baseless when that recommendation violates the ABA's own \nrules. Is the ABA disavowing its own rules? Does it find them baseless?\n  Conflict of interest rules such as the ones that ABA has adopted are \nnot just designed to prevent the actual exercise of a bias in a way \nthat influences an outcome. These rules are also adopted to prevent the \nappearance of a conflict. Preventing the appearance of impropriety is \nimportant to assure the Senate and the American people that the process \nof evaluating our judges is as impartial as people expect judges to be.\n  Before we rely upon the judgment of the ABA in evaluating nominees \nfor lifetime judicial appointments, the ABA should not just pledge to \nenforce existing rules but should strengthen those rules. They should \nrevise them to provide that individuals so heavily steeped in partisan \nactivities not be permitted to serve in these crucial roles at all. \nThat is, the rules should be expanded to prevent partisans from passing \njudgment on judicial nominees. This shouldn't be limited merely to the \ntime period during which the individual is serving on the ABA \nCommittee.\n  It strains credulity to believe that someone who occupied partisan \nroles in the last several Republican administrations could be viewed as \nimpartial in this case. If Mr. Fielding had started the committee for \nJustice after he left the committee would the specter of bias really be \nany less? Mr. Fielding moved seamlessly from passing judgment on Mr. \nEstrada to becoming a leading advocate for his nomination.\n  The fact that the advocacy followed the judgment doesn't render the \njudgment any less suspect. Much has also been made of the fact that the \nfull ABA Committee endorsed Mr. Fielding's view of Mr. Estrada's \nqualifications. This doesn't cleanse the Fielding recommendation of its \ntaint. Mr. Fielding is an important person, a powerful man.\n  Mr. President, the hour of 12:30 is nearly here. I guess he left--I \nsaw my friend from Kansas here. I just have a couple of more minutes \nand it will run past 12:30. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nfinish my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It is impossible for us to know one way or another whether \nmembers of the committee felt pressure to endorse Mr. Fielding's view. \nIt is certainly possible. And that possiblity--like Mr. Fielding's \nclear conflict of interest--is the problem in this case.\n  There are thousands of lawyers in the United States, thousands who \nare not steeped in partisan politics--Democrat of Republican. That is \nevery obvious because the poorest contributors to campaigns of any \ngroup in America are lawyers. So most of them are not involved at all \nin politics.\n  We rightly cast a skeptical eye on judicial nominees who are heavily \ninvolved in partisan activities. We do that because we want those who \nwould define the breadth and depth of our constitutional protections to \nbe impartial and without bias.\n  Regardless of what side of the aisle you are on--Democrats or \nRepublican--we should be able to agree that those who occupy the most \npartisan roles of either party should not be part of the ABA process.\n  This does not, in the words of the ABA, impugn those partisans. It is \nto say that the fact of those partisan activities creates a clear \nappearance of improperity. It is that appearance that is impossible to \navoid. It is that appearance--and the doubt that it creates in the \nunderlying process--that is the heart of all conflict of interest \nrules.\n  This issue goes well beyond the nomination of Miguel Estrada. His \nnomination has simply brought to light a fatally flawed process that \nshould not be relied upon in the case of any of our nominees.\n  As I have said before, I now agree with the majority that the ABA \nshould be out of the process. I hope that the ABA will rethink the \nstaunch defense it made of its flawed process and flawed \nrecommendations. I hope that the head of the ABA will not continue to \nbe disingenuous when he meets with Members privately. Perhaps then the \nABA would merit the trusted role that it has long held by that, in my \nview, it no longer deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3058-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n         CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a few matters of \nimportance to us related to the nomination of Miguel Estrada, which is \nwhat we are now focused on, as well as some of the issues we should be \nfocused on which we are not doing because the majority leader has \ndetermined we will continue to debate Estrada.\n  Last week, something happened in the Judiciary Committee that more of \nour colleagues should know about because a lot of us find this very \nconfounding.\n  First, I have tremendous respect for and, indeed, consider the senior \nSenator from Utah my friend. I know he cares deeply about the issues \nand about the Senate. What we are seeing in the Judiciary Committee is \ngoing to do some significant harm--I hope not irreparable harm--not \nonly to the Judiciary Committee but to the whole body. Up until last \nweek, when we were moving closer and closer and closer to the edge of \nviolating the rules the Judiciary Committee has worked upon, there were \na lot of traditions on our committee. It is an important committee, a \ncommittee steeped in great legal tradition. If you look at the pictures \non the wall of the various chairs of the committee, it goes long and \ndeep.\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\n  But we have seen changes, first, in my judgment, when three court of \nappeals nominees were brought to a hearing at the same time. A court of \nappeals is an extremely important court. Every judge appointed to that \ncourt has a lifetime appointment. So the last chance there is to vet \nwho they are, what their views are, how they think, comes in the advise \nand consent process on the floor of the Senate and, in the first \ninstance, in the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Many of us protested to the chairman of the committee that to have \nthree courts of appeals witnesses, none of whom was without \ncontroversy, come before us on a single day did not make much sense. He \nsaid, well, that is how he wanted to do it. Although in fairness to \nChairman Hatch, he was apologetic and said he would not do it again. \nBut when we asked that we change it prospectively because these are \nimportant positions and important nominees, he said, no, he wanted to \ngo forward.\n  We went until 9 that night. I was there. Chairman Hatch was gracious. \nI had a previous engagement at 7:30 that I had to go to and came back. \nBy 9:30, with the members of the committee who had stayed that long \nquite exhausted, we had only really finished asking questions of one \nnominee, Jeffrey Sutton, to the Sixth Circuit.\n  I asked Senator Hatch if we could bring the two other witnesses back. \nHe said he didn't want to inconvenience them. With all due respect, I \nexpressed my disagreement. To inconvenience a nominee for the court of \nappeals, whether it be the Sixth Circuit or the DC Circuit, Mr. Roberts \nand Judge Cook, to ask them to spend an extra day here in return for \nwhat is a lifetime appointment didn't seem to me to be too much.\n  If normal workers, people who apply for jobs, are asked to come back \nby their prospective employer for a second interview or because \nsomething happened and that employer couldn't see them that day, they \nwould hardly say it would inconvenience them, if they wanted the job.\n  But we seem to be running on a different schedule. So two of the \nnominees never got questioned. I asked them some written questions. I \nmuch prefer to ask oral questions. Answers given before the committee \nin the give and take are much better.\n  For instance, some people asked why didn't I ask written questions of \nMiguel Estrada, because I questioned him for 90 minutes. His answers \nwere so obtuse and unenlightening, simply saying he will follow the \nlaw, he can't answer that because he hasn't seen the briefs, asking any \nwritten questions would have made no sense, to get those same answers \nback.\n  In any case, we did that. And then, of course, there was the hearing \nfor Miguel Estrada, and we have rehearsed and rehearsed that over and \nover and over again, where questions were simply not answered. To say \nhe was before the committee for a lengthy number of hours, and he \nanswered some 100, or 500, or however many questions, doesn't tell the \nstory. We all know that, because the answers he gave were to the \neffect: I cannot answer that; without the briefs, I cannot answer that; \nbecause it might be in a pending case before me, I cannot answer that.\n\n  Those are not real answers. With all due respect, in this Senator's \njudgment, I have never seen such stonewalling when a nominee was faced \nwith so many different questions. And we continue to debate the Estrada \nnomination on the floor, not because the minority wants to debate it--\nwe are happy to move on--but because the majority has chosen to debate \nit by filibuster, which is not ours but, rather, theirs. I hear we are \ngoing to move to the Moscow Treaty this week--that being the choice of \nMajority Leader Frist--which is proof that we don't have to stay and \ndebate the issue of Miguel Estrada. The schedule is in the hands of \nSenator Frist.\n  What happened in the Judiciary Committee last Thursday was even more \ndisappointing. We have had a rule that has existed in the Judiciary \nCommittee for quite a long period of time. I am not sure of the number \nof years, but it is certainly over a decade. That rule is not something \nthat is whimsy or simply tradition, such as the issue that we should \nnever have three judges before us--I have just been informed that rule \nhas been on the books since 1979. That is a written rule of the \nJudiciary Committee. It has been abided by by chairpeople, Democrats \nand Republicans, repeatedly throughout that period of time. I will \nrepeat that this is not a tradition, it is not something that is sort \nof fuzzy. This is not even like blue slips. That is another place where \nthe committee just changed. I didn't mention that, but I will take a \nminute to mention that.\n  We have always had a tradition of blue slips where, if a Senator from \na home State objected certainly to a district court judge, that judge \nwould not go forward. Many colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave used the blue slip with success, from their point of view, \nrepeatedly in the nineties, particularly when President Clinton was \nPresident, and when they controlled the Senate, or when they didn't \ncontrol it. That is a tradition simply cast aside by the majority.\n  So we have the way we conduct hearings, blue slips, and everything \ndealing with judicial nominees.\n  As I said, we were getting closer and closer to the edge of no longer \nhaving comity on the committee, abiding by traditions. It almost seems \nas if it is, like ``Alice in Wonderland,'' first the verdict, then the \ntrial; the majority determined the result they wanted and changed the \nrules to fit the result: We want a lot of nominees put on the bench \nquickly. OK, we will stack them up in hearings and not give every \nSenator a chance to ask all the questions he or she wants. We have a \nnominee whose views, in all likelihood, were questioned and gone over \nthoroughly at the White House, but we don't want the public or the \nSenate to know, so we will instruct him not to answer questions in any \ndispositive or enlightening way. We have nominees we could never get \nthrough, in terms of comity--bipartisan comity--so we will get rid of \nthe blue slip rule, or weaken it significantly.\n  As I said, all of those were traditions of the committee. I have been \ntold over and over again that this body is very mindful of traditions, \nbut they seem to be falling one by one--we have had more traditions \nfalling in this month and a half that we have been under new leadership \nthan in all the time I can remember being here. That is only 4 years.\n\n  But last Thursday, we had an unprecedented action. That action was \nthat a rule of the committee--not a tradition, not something subject to \nanybody's interpretation--was just steamrolled over--ignored, \nforgotten, et cetera. That is one of the reasons we may need courts. \nThat rule, which was written and ratified by the members of the \nJudiciary Committee when we organized this year, is a simple one. Rule \n4 says:\n\n       The chairman shall entertain a nondebatable motion to bring \n     a matter before the committee to a vote.\n\n  The rule goes on to say:\n\n       If there is objection to bring the matter to a vote without \n     further debate, a rollcall of the committee shall be taken, \n     and debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the \n     matter to a vote without further debate passes with 10 votes \n     in the affirmative, one of which must be cast by the \n     minority.\n\n  I will repeat that:\n\n       . . . debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the \n     matter to a vote without further debate passes with 10 votes \n     in the affirmative, one of which must be cast by the \n     minority.\n\n  That is crystal clear. What it says is that if you want to cut off \ndebate in the Judiciary Committee, you need one member of the minority \nparty to vote to cut off that debate. It is obvious why it was put in \nthe rules: so there would be some form of comity, so that the majority \nparty--even if they had 15 members of the Judiciary Committee and the \nminority party only had 5--could not shut off debate. It doesn't relate \nto the actual vote itself. It relates to how long one is entitled to \ndebate.\n  Well, last Thursday, when the committee was expected to vote on the \nthree nominees I mentioned earlier, two of whom were not questioned \nbecause they were all stacked up to be debated at one point--I believe \nit was Senator Leahy and Senator Kennedy who were there; I was not \nbecause I was in the Banking Committee hearing Chairman Greenspan. But \nSenator Leahy and Senator Kennedy invoked rule 4 and said, ``We want to \ncontinue debate.'' At that point in time, Chairman Hatch called for a \nvote.\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator this basic question because there are \nsome trying to follow this debate. Being lawyers and having been on \nCapitol Hill for a while working in this environment, we have a \ntendency to speak in terms that perhaps the average person may not \nunderstand. I want the Senator from New York to help me come to the \nbasic question about why any average person following debate on the \nfloor of the Senate in America should even care about the compliance \nwith rules because I think the Senator has made this point.\n  The Senator said that now, with the new Republican majority in the \nSenate, with the Miguel Estrada nomination, they are violating the \ntraditions of the Senate in terms of questions to be asked for those \nseeking lifetime appointments to the Federal judiciary. The chairman, \nOrrin Hatch of Utah, of the Judiciary Committee has now said he is \ngoing to change the way Senators from a given State can approve of the \nnominees before they come up for consideration before the committee.\n  Senator Hatch, in one of his first acts as chairman, scheduled three \ncontroversial nominees for one day, in an unprecedented scheduling, \nwhich, frankly, called into question whether there would be enough time \nto ask important questions. And now, as late as last week, Senator \nHatch has said he is going to virtually ignore the established rules of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee that have been in place through \nDemocrats and Republicans, to cut off debate in the committee.\n  My basic question to the Senator is: Why is this important to the \naverage citizen following this debate? Why should they care if Members \nof the Senate are twisted in knots over procedure and tradition? What \nis the bottom line here? Why is this significant? Is this the clash of \ntitanic Senate egos, or is there something more at stake in this issue?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for asking the question which, as \nusual, from his lawyer-like mind, is able to pierce through the \nlegalisms and reach the core of the debate that people can understand; \nit is an excellent question.\n  This is not simply a clash of egos, or even two lawyers arguing a \npoint for the sake of it. The bottom line here is that this is what our \ncountry is all about in terms of protecting the rights of average \npeople. The bottom line is that the Founding Fathers, and then \nCongresses from the very beginning--from 1789--understood the power a \nFederal judge has over an individual. The power of the judge is much \ncloser to the power of a king--who also has a lifetime appointment--by \ndefinition, than is the power of a President or a Senator or a \nCongressman, because that judge is appointed for life and can just make \nup his or her mind and decide that should be done.\n\n  What we have had through the years of tradition is a very careful \nvetting of who should become a judge. The rules are simply a device to \ndetermine who those people are in terms of back-and-forth questioning, \nof hearings, of votes, et cetera.\n  The Founding Fathers certainly shied away from the idea of the \nPresident simply appointing judges. They knew the awesome power judges \nhad, and they wanted to make sure there would be a thorough airing of \nwho this person was before that person ascended to this lifetime \nappointment to a powerful position.\n  Every one of the rules the Senator mentioned goes to whether a person \ncan organize in a union; whether a person can be discriminated against \nbecause of the color of his or her skin or their religion or their sex; \nwhether a corporation can violate the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts \nand affect our lungs and affect our children's health; whether, for \ninstance, an issue I know my friend from Illinois has been very much \ninvolved in, whether a meat packing company can decide how clean their \nplant ought to be, given there are Federal laws that govern them. The \njudges have all this kind of power.\n  The very reason we debate these issues and have these rules is we \nwant to make sure the people who become judges will, indeed, follow the \nlaw and not simply get up there and say: I promise you I will follow \nthe law. We have been there.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If this is not an ego trip between titanic Senate egos as \nto who is going to prevail, I ask the Senator from New York, what is \nthe agenda here? Why would the Republicans in the new majority of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee change the rules, change the traditions, \nchange the approach, take away power of individual Members of the \nSenate to ask questions of nominees, to have the time to try to come to \nunderstand the values they are going to bring to the judiciary, to have \ntime to at least debate the nominations? What is the larger question \nhere? What is it that is driving this kind of radical transformation of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee?\n  At this moment in our history, having just come off the last \nPresidential election so closely decided, followed by a congressional \nbiennial election which, again, was closely decided, what is it that is \ndriving this effort, does the Senator believe, on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to make such radical changes in the way we choose Federal \njudges?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for the question. It is a very good \nquestion. Of course, it would involve us going into the heads of our \ncolleagues, both on the other side of the aisle and the White House, in \nfiguring this out. But I will tell my colleague what I think.\n  For some reason, the other side fears an open debate. For some \nreason, the White House and the other side do not want their nominees \nfully questioned. They have gone through every device and, as of last \nThursday, even breaking the Senate rules. If the average citizen broke \nthe rules, whether it be the driving rules, the parking rules, the \nrules of how you have to maintain your house or your sidewalk, there \nwould be some recourse. I do not know what the recourse is here, but to \nabjectly break the rules and just say, I am breaking it, tough rocks, \nJack, is so against the traditions we have had. For some reason, they \ndo not want these nominees to be questioned. Why is that? We can only \nspeculate, but I will tell my colleague what I think. I think some of \nthese nominees' views are probably, and in some cases certainly, so far \nout of the mainstream that they do not want those views to become \npublic because then it would either be, at minimum, an embarrassment \nfor them, because this is not how President Bush was elected or most of \nthe Senators were elected. We have mainstream conservatives and \nmainstream liberals, but very few Americans say: Have such a change in \nthe way the courts and the Government functions that we should go back \nto the days of the 1930s or the 1890s.\n\n  There is a movement called the Federalist movement which basically \nhas been devoted to cutting back dramatically on Federal power, giving \nthat power to the States, giving that power to corporations, giving \nthat power to others. I did not hear any mandate in the elections of \n2000 or 2002 to go back to the 1930s, to go back to the 1890s, the way, \nsay, I believe Justice Scalia, who has gone through the process, \nthinks. In fact, not only was there no mandate, there was no \ndiscussion. So when one asks oneself the very good question my friend \nfrom Illinois has asked me, which is, Why are they so afraid of \nquestions of nominees, of debate, it is not certainly because they are \nafraid we are going to slow it down. We asked for 1 extra day of debate \nfor Judge Cook and for Mr. Roberts. We did not get it. All we want from \nMiguel Estrada is some answers to questions and some papers, which they \ncould have sent months ago. So this is, clearly, not just an issue of \ndelay. If it were simply an issue of delay, we could work out an \nagreement, put in a time limit, and vote.\n  In my judgment, it is clear they do not want these questions \nanswered. They do not even want them asked. That is why we are cutting \noff debate. Why? My guess--and it can only be a guess--is because the \nnominees to the judiciary, at least some of them, are so far over that \nif their real views were ascertained, the American people would be \naghast.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, yesterday \nin Chicago a reporter came up to me on the Miguel Estrada nomination. \nHe\n\n[[Page S3061]]\n\nsaid: Senator, isn't it a fact the reason you are blocking the Miguel \nEstrada nomination is because he is pro-life and you are pro-choice? \nYou disagree on the abortion issue.\n  I ask the Senator from New York who sat through the Judiciary \nCommittee with me over the last few years, is it not a fact that with \nover 100 nominees from the White House that President Bush has \nsuccessfully guided through this Senate, is it not a fact the \noverwhelming majority of those disagree with our position on choice, on \nabortion, and yet they have gone through this committee, almost all of \nthem, without controversy, many of them with routine rollcall votes? I \nask the Senator from New York, does this difference of opinion come \ndown to whether or not we are going to receive conservative nominees \nfrom the Bush White House and now we have the Democrats in the Senate \nJudiciary Committees stopping conservative nominees; is that what is at \nissue here?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I do not believe so at all. I do believe--and this is \nanother excellent question--a President should be given some degree of \nflexibility and latitude because the Constitution says the President \nshould nominate judges. We advise and consent.\n  If choice were the issue, then I probably would have voted against--I \nthink of the 106 nominees who have come before us, more or less, I have \nvoted for 100. My guess is of those 100, given they were nominated by \nPresident Bush who made commitments to the pro-life groups, that they \nwould agree with them and try to get judges to ``think like Scalia and \nThomas,'' that the overwhelming majority were pro-life. In fact, I know \nsome of them were because I have read their decisions. I have read what \nthey said in lower courts. I voted for them. I do not believe in a \nlitmus test. I believe very few Members of this Chamber on either side \nof the aisle believe in a litmus test.\n\n  My guess--and I cannot speak for others--when on issue after issue a \njudge would have such extreme views that he would take the courts and \nthe rulings so far out of the mainstream that Americans would be \naghast, that ideological-type judges, whether on the far left or the \nfar right, instead of doing what the Constitution says, interpret the \nlaw, rather make law because they feel so strongly that they have to \npull the country in a direction way beyond, those are the few judges \nwe--at least I--have objected to. Again, I have to use my judgment. \nObviously, this is not an objective meter here, but that is what we \nhave done.\n  I say to my colleague, the irony is this: Our good friend from Utah \nand many of the others on the other side of the aisle played the same \nwatchdog role when President Clinton was President, and we have quote \nafter quote from Senator Hatch, from Senator Sessions, from Senator \nAshcroft, from the leaders of the Judiciary Committee back in the \nnineties, that they had to be on guard against what they called \n``activist judges.''\n  To them, activist meant too far left. To me, activist means either \ntoo far left or too far right. An activist judge--I sort of sympathize \nwith that comment. An activist judge means that because they feel \nstrongly, instead of just interpreting the law and trying to figure out \nwhat Congress meant, they will impose their own views.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator from New York--I think it is \nimportant in this debate that we take this general and theoretical \nanalysis of judges and their impact on America and try to make it \nsomething closer to home so the average person following this debate \nunderstands what is at stake.\n  I can recall--and I am sure we were both Members of Congress at the \ntime--when we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This was amazing legislation because it was so strongly \nbipartisan. Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, then Senator Bob Dole of \nKansas, they came through and said, on a bipartisan basis, let us \nextend freedoms and opportunities to people in America who have been \ndenied those opportunities; let us pass a Federal law--Congress passes \nit, and the President signs it--and establish opportunities for \ndisabled Americans.\n  I think this is a good illustration of what happens with the Court \nwhen it goes too far in one direction. I ask the Senator from New York \nif he could give us an illustration of what happened with the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act when it came to the highest court in the land \nwhen they had a chance to take a look at it and say whether we will \nprotect disabled Americans and whether Congress had gone too far or not \nfar enough, so that people can put in context what we are debating. Can \nthe Senator give us an illustration of what happened with this law?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes. The bottom line is the Court, despite the fact that \nCongress, on a bipartisan basis--by the way, supported by George H.W. \nBush, the 41st President of the United States, who signed it into law--\nsomehow comes up with an interpretation that parts of the law are \nbeyond the Constitution and millions of disabled people are deprived of \nrights. That did not just happen for disabled people. In that case, \nwhich was the Garrett case, I believe my colleague is referring to, \nthey said the States did not have to abide by this. Even though it was \nclear that the intent of Congress was that everyone had to abide by it, \nthey said the States could discriminate against disabled people.\n  I know my colleague from Illinois was involved in a law that says \nsomeone cannot bring a gun into school. Again, somehow the Supreme \nCourt comes to the determination that a person can, or that the law \nthat we passed, which seemed to be a general mainstream consensus law--\nbecause some of these folks tend to be ideologues, they came up with \nsome God-forsaken reason that that could not happen.\n  Another one on which I worked long and hard, along with our colleague \nfrom Delaware, Senator Biden, and our colleague from California, \nSenator Boxer--I know the Senator from Illinois was very supportive--\nwas something called the Violence Against Women Act, which for the \nfirst time said that the Federal Government could be involved in \nhelping women who were abused by their spouses. Before that, it was a \nsort of dirty little secret hidden under the rug. The law had amazing \neffect.\n  I know this one better than I know the Garrett case, but it is the \nsame type of thing. It affects average people. For the first time, \nwomen were able to get hotlines, find out whom they could call when \nthey were abused. Shelters sprung up. When a woman was beaten in the \npast, all too often there would be nowhere to go and she would have to \ngo home to the same husband who beat her before.\n\n  On issue after issue, we helped women who were abused come out of \nhiding and seek help and become productive citizens again, having a \nhuge effect not only on them but on their children. Studies show that \nif a child is abused, which this act would have affected, or the \nchild's mom was abused by the husband, they are much more likely to be \ncriminals. So it affected all of us. All of a sudden, the Supreme Court \nsays that Congress's finding that this law affected commerce in the \nUnited States was undone and throws out part of the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  So this is not an abstract argument, this is not a bunch of lawyers \njust arguing how many angels can fit on the head of a pin, this is not \npartisanship--to me, at least. I have devoted my life to government. I \nwas elected when I was 23. I want to make the Government help people. I \nwant people to believe Government is on their side. When nonelected \njudges come in and take years of work that Congress does--whether it \naffects disabled people, kids in school, the cleanliness of the water \nwe drink, how a meatpacker has to obey certain laws, or the Violence \nAgainst Women Act--and throws it out on reasoning that 10 years before \nwould have been regarded as crazy, the very least we owe our \nconstituents, in my judgment, is the obligation--it is not simply a \nright, it is an obligation--to question nominees for the bench.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may ask the Senator another question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Please.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield the floor to him after this. At the same \nhearing, Chairman Hatch basically rejected a rule that I think has been \nin place almost 20 years in the Senate Judiciary Committee----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I might interrupt the Senator. Since 1979.\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. So for 14 years this had been the rule under Democrats \nand Republicans.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Twenty-four.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Twenty-four--I am sorry. This has been the rule.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. He is not on the math committee. He is on the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Right. Math was a minor. Law was a major.\n  But in this situation, where a decision was made that we can no \nlonger debate these nominees, we also had before us a nominee from \nOhio, a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court, Deborah Cook, whom I had a \nchance to ask a few questions of in that marathon hearing where three \ncontroversial nominees were scheduled for the same day. I do not know \nif the Senator from New York was present. But I sent a written question \nto this justice and asked her point blank: Tell me a little about your \nthinking, about your judicial philosophy, particularly the concept of \nstrict construction of the Constitution--that is a cliche almost, but \nit is a catch phrase that is used to try to judge whether someone is \nfar to the right, far to the left, or whatever it happens to be.\n  Justice Cook, in her reply to me, said that she did not characterize \nherself as a strict constructionist, but she went on to say that those \nwho were strict constructionists--and I wish I had the direct quote in \nfront of me--were less likely to decide in favor of such things as \nBrown v. The Board of Education, Miranda v. Arizona, and Roe v. Wade.\n\n  My staff has been kind enough to give me this question.\n  I asked her the following:\n\n       Do you think the Supreme Court's most important decisions--\n     Brown, Miranda and Roe--are consistent with strict \n     constructionism?\n\n  This is her answer, a judicial nominee:\n\n       If strict constructionism means that rights do not exist \n     unless explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, then the \n     cases you mention likely would not be consistent with that \n     label.\n\n  I said in the committee and I say here, that is a painful answer for \nme to hear, to think that those who believe that a strict construction \nof the Constitution would not lead them to integrate America's schools, \nto protect a woman's privacy, or to give to criminal defendants the \nmost basic rights, knowledge of their constitutional rights--painful \nfor me to read this, but painfully honest.\n  The point I make to the Senator from New York, and then I will let \nhim finish: Is that not what we are looking for? Are we not looking for \ncandor and honesty from the nominees to reach a conclusion on an up-or-\ndown vote?\n  In a situation where candidates, nominees, such as Miguel Estrada, \nrefuse to answer the traditional questions asked by Republicans of \nDemocratic nominees, where Senators from a home State do not have a \nvoice in whether a judicial nominee comes before the committee, when \nthree controversial nominees are put in a hearing in one day on the \nJudiciary Committee, where the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \neliminates the protection of the right to debate nominees, do we not \nhave a closing down of this kind of candor, openness, and honesty that \nwe are seeking, moving instead towards secrecy and stealth? Does this \nnot get to the heart of the issue as to whether or not the judges we \nselect for lifetime appointments to the highest courts of the land are \npeople whom we know, who answer questions honestly before they are \ngiven that terrific opportunity to serve our Nation?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I might answer, I think my colleague has hit the nail \non the head. This is so important. What we have come to is the fact \nthat nominees are often told not to answer questions.\n  There is an article in the Legal Times where one of the leading \nconservative judges of the court of appeals instructed nominees not to \nanswer questions. Why would someone say, do not answer questions; fudge \non the questions? I think I know why, as we talked about before. \nBecause if they gave their honest answers, they would become so \ncontroversial that many of them would not pass. But imagine the \nalternative: Not asking the question, or not getting the question \nanswered, and then this nominee who has views way beyond the mainstream \ngets on the court and starts doing things. Do you know what would \nhappen? Our constituents would come to us and say: Do something.\n  We would try, but it would be very difficult. We would probably have \npeople on the other side saying: Well, I didn't know he thought like \nthat. Yet when we have the opportunity to ask that nominee questions, \nto try and get some idea of how he thinks, we are denied the answers--\neither because we did not have time, as in the case of the three \nnominees, or in the case of not allowing discussion to go on in the \nJudiciary Committee, or because we had the time--with Miguel Estrada we \nhad plenty of time, but the nominee refused to answer the questions, \nsimply saying: I will follow the law.\n  We have been through that. It is legendary that when Clarence Thomas \nwas up for the Supreme Court, people wanted to know his view on Roe v. \nWade. For me, it is an important issue, but it is not a litmus test. Of \nthe 100 people I voted for judge, most are against Roe v. Wade, but I \ndon't have a litmus case.\n  But for a nominee to the Supreme Court to say he had never discussed \nit before while in law school--lawyers always discuss these cases--\nstruck many as disingenuous. I was not in the Senate then, but people \nvowed they were not going to let that happen again; that was a mockery \nof the process. This is too solemn a process.\n  Before I yield to my friend from Utah, and I appreciate him yielding \nto me and yielding to all Members, and I will yield to him, speaking \nfor myself, this transcends any one nominee. We are beginning to see a \ncomplete vitiation of the process whereby nominees will be nominated by \nthe White House and rubberstamped by the Senate. In my judgment, \nnothing that we do here could do more damage to the fundamental \nunderpinnings of our Republic than that.\n  I remind my colleagues, that is not what the Founding Fathers \nintended. The very first nomination to the Supreme Court was, I \nbelieve, Rutledge--I always forget if it was Randolph or Rutledge; my \ndaughter was in the play ``1776'' and she played Rutledge, and I was \nconstantly calling her Randolph, much to her chagrin. But in any case, \nRutledge was defeated because the Senate had the temerity, I guess, in \nthe opinion of my good friend from Utah, to ask Rutledge's judgment on \nsomething very controversial at the time, the Jay Treaty. The Jay \nTreaty was not what judges rule on, but the Founding Fathers--by the \nway, we just heard at our lunch that a large percentage of the first \nSenators were members of the Constitutional Conference, so they \ncertainly knew what they wanted to do.\n  If they were questioning Rutledge on the Jay Treaty, then certainly \nasking Miguel Estrada how he feels about the commerce clause and the \nright to privacy and the 11th amendment and the first amendment and all \nof these things could hardly be out of bounds.\n  In fact, I would argue if the Founding Fathers were watching this \ndebate, they would say: Yes, that is what we intended.\n  With that, I yield to my friend from Utah for a question only.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the Senator, is it possible the Senator could put \ntogether the questions he believes Miguel Estrada has not answered \nappropriately, and I will do my best to get him to answer them? If not \nappropriately, as defined by the Senator, but at least in more detail \nthan the Senator seems to be indicating here.\n  I know he answered a lot of questions appropriately, and I believe \nall of them appropriately, but I would be glad to assist the Senator if \nhe will give me a list of questions the Senator would like to have \nMiguel Estrada answer. I will do my best to see he answers them for the \nSenator, and hopefully that will have the Senator feel a little bit \nbetter and cause him to vote for him.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his question, and I think it is \na good-faith statement to break this deadlock which I hope we will do \nbecause we have made the arguments over and over again.\n  Let me make an alternative suggestion and see what the Senator thinks \nand then I yield to him. Why don't we bring Miguel Estrada back for a \nsecond\n\n[[Page S3063]]\n\nday of questioning? I find written questions never to bring out the \nsame analysis, the same understanding of how a person thinks. That is \nwhy we do not conduct trials by written question. Miguel Estrada may \nsay something, and I will want to immediately ask him, well, what about \nthis, and to take another week and ask another question and another \nquestion and another question, I am sure within a short amount of time \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle will be saying we are \nbeing dilatory.\n  If we could have another hearing of Miguel Estrada and if he could \nlet us see the documents he authored as attorney general, I think it \nwas my good friend's junior colleague from Utah who suggested we do \nthat, and then we would set--I cannot speak for my whole caucus, but I \nwill state what I would be for. I would be for setting a time certain \nwhen we vote for him, another day of hearings, ask Miguel Estrada to \ncome back for a day.\n  It cannot be too much to ask when one is 42 years old and, may God \ngrant him a long and healthy life.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. And to ask him for a day of questions and to give up \nthese documents which are very important, then we can settle this whole \nissue.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. As the Senator knows----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. For a question only.\n  Mr. HATCH. As the Senator knows, he cannot give up those documents. \nHe has no control over them. And the administration will not and \nneither would any other administration.\n  Would the Senator be willing to get the Democrats to agree to an up-\nand-down vote if we had one more day of hearings where the Senators \ncould ask additional questions? I am not saying we are going to do \nthat, I am just saying would we have an up-and-down vote.\n  We cannot produce those documents because they are privileged. I \nthink the Senator knows that. But if you had one more day of hearings \nwhere you could ask the questions, could we get the Democrats to agree \nto an up-and-down vote if you did that? I cannot say I can do that, but \nI certainly would look at it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me try to answer my colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH. I know the Senator cannot speak for all the Democrats, but \nif all the Democrats would agree, or if you can get the majority leader \nto agree and the Democrats to agree to stop the filibuster, I might \nconsider that--not because I don't think he answered the questions the \nfirst time; he did, in a very thick transcript--as a gesture.\n  I would have to look at this. I would have to talk to the \nadministration, the people on our side, and Miguel Estrada himself, but \nif I was assured we would have an up-and-down vote where people could \nvote whatever way they wanted to, I would give some consideration to \nthat, subject to my talking to our leadership on this side and talking \nto the White House. But there is no question they cannot give up these \ndocuments. He has no authority over those documents and the \nadministration will not give up those documents no matter what we do. \nBut I guess you would at least have an opportunity to ask additional \nquestions, in spite of the fact that the distinguished Senator who \nconducted the hearing said it was conducted fairly, that he asked every \nquestion he wanted to ask, that he had the right to ask any other \nquestions he wanted to, that he could have filed written questions, in \naddition.\n\n  But the Senator has said if he could have one more day of hearings, \nbecause written questions do not cut it as well as oral testimony, if \nhe could have one more day of hearings, I would consider this, and I \nwould talk to my side and I would talk to Mr. Estrada and the White \nHouse if I knew there would be an up-and-down vote, the filibuster \nwould end, this threat to the process would end. I would certainly give \nevery consideration to it and try to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me try to answer my colleague. Again, I have the \nsame caveat he does, even more so. I cannot speak for my Democrat \ncolleagues. I am not even chairman of anything.\n  I would say this to my colleague and make a couple of points. The \nbest evidence of how Miguel Estrada feels--given that he has not \nwritten articles, he has not been a judge where we can see his record--\nare these documents. We have debated this over and over again. There is \nno privilege. There is no anything else.\n  Senator Leahy and Senator Daschle, in a letter to my colleague--and I \nwill be delighted to yield when I have finished my answer--have laid \nout the conditions by which we believe we would at least get some bit \nof evidence to see who Miguel Estrada really is. That is not in terms \nof his history, which has been repeated over and over again on the \nfloor, and a wonderful history it is, but in terms of how he thinks and \nhow he would think and how he would rule as a judge.\n\n  So the best evidence is not hearsay evidence; it is the written \nevidence. But let me just say in regard to the hearing--and here is my \nproblem with the offer and why the written evidence is so important--\nlet us say Miguel Estrada again refuses. He sits for 10 hours and \nrefuses to answer--or answers, let's characterize it, in the same way.\n  I ask him--Dianne Feinstein asks him his feelings on Roe v. Wade, and \nhe says I can't tell you that.\n  And Senator Durbin, for instance, asks him how he feels, widely or \nnarrowly, the commerce clause should be interpreted, and he says: \nBecause I might rule on a case about the commerce clause, I can't \nanswer that.\n  By the way, I have checked with a whole bunch of legal ethicists, and \nthe canons--you know, what the lawyers say you are allowed to do when \nyou are nominated to be a judge--have nothing to do with broad \nquestions like that. They deal with specific cases.\n  So let us say we get, as we would characterize it, or as I would, \nstone- walled, no answers on anything.\n  As my colleague well knows, when I asked Miguel Estrada about \nprevious cases he liked or didn't like, he said: Well, I would have to \nread the briefs.\n  I have asked subsequent witnesses how they feel on cases and they \nhave given answers to me. I had an interview with someone the President \nis thinking of nominating in my State. I asked her what is a case you \nlike, what is a case you don't like? She was very forthcoming--you \nknow, that had already been ruled on. So we would be in a complete----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield in a minute. We would be \ngiving away the store without accomplishing our goal if we agreed, \nbefore we heard the answers, that we would agree to a date certain on \nthe vote.\n  Perhaps we should have the hearing, see how he answers those \nquestions, and then see where we are. If he is much more forthcoming, \nwhatever his answers are, we might be able to make some progress. But \nif he gives the same exact answers as he gave 3 weeks ago, I for one \ncould not agree to just having a vote on him unless we get the best \nevidence, the written evidence, which the administration will not give \nup. You are right. It is not Miguel Estrada, but it is the \nadministration which has nominated him. So they are not sort of players \nfrom far away; they are part of this whole process. Other \nadministrations, Democrat and Republican, have given up the same types \nof documents.\n  I don't want to get into a debate about that now, but that is our \nconfirmed view.\n  So an alternative which I cannot even--I would have to talk to my \ncolleagues about--would be: Let us have another day of hearings and \nthen let us see what happens there and see where we go. But I think it \nwould not make any sense, any sense whatsoever, to say today, or \ntomorrow, we will have a vote as long as he comes back. Because what if \nhe does the same exact thing he did last time, which I know you find \nwas fulsome and reliable--not reliable, but fulsome and elucidating \ntestimony, but I found to be completely evasive.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague for the purposes of another \nquestion only.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. Let us be honest about it. If you are going to ask \nhim how he feels about a case or how he feels about the commerce \nclause, I have to admit I don't think those are legitimate questions. \nWhat he feels is not important. What he is going to do as a judge is \nimportant.\n  I am hardly going to bring him back for another day, after we had one \nof the\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\nlonger hearings for a Circuit Court of Appeals nominee, after it was \nconducted by the distinguished Senator from New York and the Democrats, \nwhen my colleagues on the other side have said it was a fair hearing, \nquestions were asked--I am hardly going to bring him back for another \nday unless we have some sort of agreement we are going to have a vote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I say I am hardly going to bring him back just on the \nspeculation he is going to answer questions the way you think he ought \nto answer them when in fact he answered questions the way all of his \npredecessors have answered them. Basically, they were answered this \nway:\n  With regard to Roe v. Wade, he basically said regardless of my \npersonal feelings, I am going to uphold the law. That is the law. That \nis what everybody has said who appeared before my committee when I was \nchairman during the 6 years of the Clinton administration. They didn't \ncome out and say yes, I am for Roe v. Wade. If they had, I would not \nhave held that against them because I presumed they were, anyway. But \nthe fact of the matter is virtually every one of them basically said: \nRegardless of my personal views, I am going to uphold the law, which is \nwhat he said.\n  I guess what I am asking is--if you will give me a list of your \nquestions that you asked, that you feel there was not a forthright \nanswer--I don't know of any where there wasn't a forthright answer; it \nmay not have been what you wanted--I will be happy to take those back \nto him again and get you answers that would be more detailed, if that \nis what you want.\n  Or, as an alternative, would it be possible for us to have 1 day of \nhearings where we encourage him to answer questions in more detail, \nbecause that is what you appear to want--even though I thought his \nanswers were more than adequate--and I would attempt to do that. Of \ncourse, with the approval of my side; if I can. I would work in good \nfaith to do that.\n  But I would certainly want to have the filibuster ended, because this \nis a damaging thing to this institution, and it would be my way--if I \ncould do it and pull it off--of saying, look, we'll try to accommodate \nour friends on this side, but let's be fair and let us have a vote up \nor down.\n  It may be that vote will go the way you want it to go. You may vote \nfor him in the end. I don't know. But the point is, I would try to do \nthat in order to get this off of this filibuster, which I find \nextremely dangerous, and even beyond consideration of Miguel Estrada. \nIt is something I had to stop, as chairman during my 6 years, because \nwe had a few on our side who felt we should filibuster people like \nMarsha Berzon and Judge Paez and even Margaret Morrow.\n  As you know, as much as I have been maligned by at least one Senator \non your side, they would not have been sitting on the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals if it hadn't been for me, and I think some of the \naccusations that have been made have been very unfair about the time I \nwas chairman.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me reclaim my time because I am running out.\n  Mr. HATCH. But let me make that offer. I will either get him to offer \nmore detailed answers in writing or I will get him--I will do my very \nbest to have him answer more detailed answers in a 1-day hearing.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HATCH. But I would want to have a vote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I make a counterproposal to my colleague. Either we have \nhim come back for 1 day, and the administration, his nominator, \nreleases the papers as Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy have asked, \nand we agree to a vote ahead of time; the papers and a day of \nhearings--again, I can only speak for myself that that would satisfy \nme--or, in an effort to break the deadlock, we have the day of hearings \nwithout any commitment. Because, in all candor--you know, the Senator \nfrom Utah is a very fine lawyer and probably a lot better than I am. \nBut I am not going to give away the store for a pig in a poke.\n  If we were to agree to a vote right now and Miguel Estrada were to \ncome before us and just verbatim give the exact same answers he gave \nbefore, we would not have accomplished anything.\n  So I say to my colleague, in an effort to break the deadlock which we \nall want to break, believe me, let us have Mr. Estrada come back for a \nday of hearings, no preconditions. There will be lots more people \npaying attention to those hearings now. And let the American people \nmake a judgment as to whether he is being forthcoming or not. Maybe his \nanswers will change and they will say he is. Then we will decide where \nwe go from there.\n  Because I will say this: This is one place I disagree with what my \ncolleague said. To say, poor Mr. Estrada, he sat through 9 hours of \nhearings and to ask him to do it again is not fair seems to me to be--\nwe are lawyers. Probably right now Mr. Estrada, who is earning a great \nsalary because he is an excellent lawyer, sits through far more than 9 \nhours to try to win a single case. This, appointment to the second most \nimportant court in the land, is a lot more serious than any one single \ncase Mr. Estrada is arguing.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So I say to my colleague, to achieve a lifetime \nappointment on this very serious court, Mr. Estrada ought to be willing \nto sit--I am not saying we should do this--for a week or a week and a \nhalf. He is 42 years old. He is likely to be on the bench for 30 years, \nGod willing he has good health. So that should not be the \nconsideration.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to my colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to make this as brief as I can. I \ncommend the Senator from Utah coming to the floor. I would like to ask \nthis question of the Senator from New York.\n  I think you have taken a reasonable position. Having practiced law \nfor a number of years, as the Senator from Utah did, and I believe the \nSenator from New York, you know, in the discovery process, when the \nother side refuses to turn over a document, goes into this long fight, \nyou begin to suspect, on your side of the case, there is something very \nimportant in that document.\n  These documents of Miguel Estrada have become the crux, the center \npoint, of the debate about what this man has said and done and thought \nas assistant to the Solicitor General in the Department of Justice. So \nI think the Senator from New York is right in insisting that be part of \nany compromise ending this deadlock.\n  I also hope we will insist, on the Democratic side, that if we are \ngoing to end this deadlock, we return to the regular order of the \nJudiciary Committee, that we do not put three controversial nominees on \nthe calendar in the same day, that we do not ignore the blue slips \nrequired of each Senator from the State, that we do not violate the \nrules of the Senate that have been in place for 24 years in relation to \ndebate in the committee.\n  I think all of those would be a good-faith effort to go back to the \nregular order and establish some comity and understanding between us, \nwhich I hope will guarantee that we will not face this kind of \nsituation in the future.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Answering my colleague's question, he is exactly right. \nI am not someone who has practiced law, like my colleague from Illinois \nand my colleague from Utah--I was elected to the assembly right after \nlaw school--but every good lawyer knows, even every good law student \nknows, that hearsay evidence is not as good as written evidence.\n  So when we hear all these people say--I have heard my good colleague \nfrom Utah say: This one and this one and this one say he is great, and \nthis one and this one say he will follow the law. If my colleague truly \nbelieves that, then he has nothing to hide in terms of giving up these \ndocuments because they will show that Miguel Estrada will follow the \nlaw.\n  The problem is, we have just as many people who worked with him in \nthe Solicitor General's Office who said: Oh, no, this guy is so far \nover that he writes his own laws, and he would write his own laws.\n  Mr. HATCH. Name one. Name one person. Give me a name.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I don't know which is true and which isn't.\n  His superior.\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Who? Bender?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Bender, who was his immediate superior.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is the only name you can come up with?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am going to reclaim my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Give me a break.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. He was his immediate superior. But the bottom line is \nthis: My colleague from Utah immediately discounts Mr. Bender because \nhe does not agree with his view on certain issues. OK. If, if, if, if \nMr. Bender is wrong, the documents will show it. If Mr. Bender is \nright, the documents will show it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Not yet. I will in a minute.\n  But the bottom line is, as my colleague from Illinois stated, when \nsomebody will not release documents, that you know can be released, \nthen you say to yourself, What is in there?\n  Again, we are not just dealing with one case. We are not dealing with \njust one situation. We are dealing with a lifetime appointment to the \nsecond most important court in the land.\n  Why won't Mr. Estrada or the administration--which is his sponsor, \nhis mentor in this particular situation--why won't he give up these \ndocuments?\n  I will tell you what most people think when they hear about it. And I \nhave talked to my constituents, the few who ask me about this. They say \nhe is hiding something. Do I know he is hiding something? Absolutely \nnot. I have not seen the documents. But I tell you one thing: The great \nlengths that the administration and my colleagues on the other side \nhave gone to not give up these documents makes one suspect there is \nsomething there they do not want people to see.\n  So the documents are crucial. And I, for one, believe we cannot agree \nto a date certain to vote until those documents are given up or unless \nMr. Estrada somehow answers the questions in a truly dispositive way.\n  By the way, I say to my colleague, he said everyone else answered \nquestions the same way. Absolutely not. And we have shown, in case \nafter case, in nominee after nominee--the very nominee after Mr. \nEstrada, when I asked him the same exact question, was far more \nforthcoming than saying, ``I can't,'' or ``I will follow the law.''\n  So the bottom line is, I would repeat my tentative offer--because I \nwould have to check with my colleagues--let's have a day of hearings of \nMr. Estrada and see where that leaves us, see if he gives the same \nanswers. And let everyone see him answer the questions the way we saw \nhim. And let's see if they think he is being forthcoming. And let's see \nif they think--when he is asked crucial questions that will affect \npeople's live--he gives answers that satisfy people that he be \nappointed to the second most powerful court in the land. That is a way \nto resolve this.\n  Shakespeare once said: Me thinks the lady doth protest too much. \nThere has been so much protestation about figuring out Miguel Estrada's \nrecord--not his legal qualities, not his story of being the son of an \nimmigrant coming to America when he was 17, not speaking English. That \nis all great. He deserves a pat on the back for that. But that alone, \nin my judgment, does not entitle him to appointment to the second \nhighest court in the land with a lifetime appointment.\n  I will be happy to yield to my colleague in 1 minute. But, again, it \nis certainly worth, with all due respect, the chairman's time, and all \nof our time, to hear him again. And maybe he will be somewhat more \nforthcoming. And then maybe we can come up with a compromise.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for really----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts for a \nquestion only.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nNew York for his presentation today. I want to ask him a question or \ntwo.\n  In looking at his position in the broader context--which I think is \nfair to do, which is important for the American people to understand--\nthe debate on what institution should have the power for nominating \njudges was an issue that was before the Constitutional Convention.\n  I heard earlier in the debate that the Senator from New York pointed \nout this was an issue that was considered by the Constitutional \nConvention--to just have the sole power with the President--and that \nwas overwhelmingly defeated--overwhelmingly defeated.\n  I ask the Senator whether he would not agree with me that at least it \nappears there are some Members of this body who still believe it is the \nPresident who has the sole power and kind of exercise of responsibility \nthat the Senator from New York and others have attempted to provide in \nexercising an informed and balanced judgment in fulfilling their \nconstitutional role of advice and consent.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me that any fair reading of the \ndebates of the Constitutional Convention put a prime responsibility on \nthe Senate of the United States to exercise good judgment? And, \nfurther, would he not agree with me that if there is not going to be a \nresponse to Senators' inquiries, so they cannot have the information to \ncarry forward and make a judgment, then this is a failure of the \nnominee in meeting their responsibility under the Constitution, being \nnominated by the President of the United States?\n  Would the Senator not agree with me that this is a constitutional \nissue? We hear a great deal about what is constitutional and that the \nSenator from New York and others are basically undermining the \nConstitution by refusing to let the Senate make its will. On the other \nhand, I think the Senator, as I understand it, is doing exactly what \nthe constitutional Founders intended the Senate to do; and that is, to \nhave a shared responsibility and give a balanced and informed judgment \nin meeting the requirements of the advice and consent provisions of the \nConstitution.\n  I am just asking the Senator if he does not agree with me that we \nought to have some understanding among at least ourselves as to what \nthe role is because often we hear those voices saying, what are you \nobjecting to? The President has nominated him. Why aren't you just \ngoing along? I would be interested in the Senator's answer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator is right on the money. The bottom line is, \nthe Founding Fathers wanted the Senate to be actively involved in the \nprocess. It is my understanding, as I read the Federalist papers and \nthe deliberations of the Founding Fathers, for a good period of time \nthey were so afraid of the President, so much like a king, having too \nmuch power and knowing that judges would have lifetime appointments and \nhave absolute power, at least on the cases they rendered, that for a \nlong period of time they wanted the Senate to appoint the judges.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Without the President involved?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Without the President involved, exactly. I can't \nremember if it was Madison or somebody else, but they argued it would \nbe too diffuse, that the buck will have to stop somewhere, so they were \ngoing to have the President nominate. But to keep the President's power \nin check, the very thing they intended--my good friend from \nMassachusetts is exactly on the money--was that the Senate play an \nactive role.\n  Let me repeat, many of the very first Senators who debated whether \nthe first nominee, Mr. Rutledge, should become a judge on the Supreme \nCourt were members of the Constitutional Convention. We heard today \nthat of the first eight who showed up, six were members of the \nConstitutional Convention. I don't know how many out of the original 22 \nbecause I think there were just 11 States that had ratified the \nConstitution then. And guess what debate they had in rejecting Mr. \nRutledge? They debated his views on the Jay treaty, which was a treaty \ninvolving France and England and all sorts of foreign entanglements, as \nthey used to refer to it in those days.\n  Let me say that if the Jay Treaty was legitimate grounds to determine\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\nwhether the Senate should consent, then certainly someone's views on \nthe commerce clause and the first amendment and the second amendment \nand the fourth amendment and the 11th amendment and the right to \nprivacy and the right to free speech should be.\n  Let's just get some corroboration for my colleague's excellent \nquestion. Here is what our good friend from Utah said when the shoe was \non the other foot, when President Clinton was nominating people, and \nmany of our colleagues on the other side were worried they would be too \nactivist, which meant too many people who would let their own liberal \nviews trump accurate interpretation of the law. I have great respect \nfor the Senator from Utah. He knows this stuff inside out.\n  He said:\n\n       Determining which of President Clinton's nominees will \n     become activists is complicated and it will require the \n     Senate to be more diligent and extensive in its questioning \n     of nominees' jurisprudential views.\n\n  Well, one day of hearings and no other record, is that extensive when \none is considering a lifetime appointment? I would argue not. It is not \neven close to extensive enough.\n  Let me read another quote from Senator Hatch:\n\n       The careful scrutiny of a judicial nominee is one important \n     step in the process, a step reserved to the Senate alone . . \n     . I have no problem with those who want to review these \n     nominees with great specificity.\n  Well, I hope the Senator who had no problem then when Senator \nSessions and Senator Ashcroft and other Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee wanted to ask a whole lot of questions--and believe me they \ndid, of the people they were worried about, the Paezes and the Bersons, \nnot to mention them, but all the nominees who never got hearings. Great \nspecificity? Nine hours of hearings for the second most important job \non the judicial side of the Government? Nine hours, when the answers, \nwhen talking about his history, Miguel Estrada was specific. It is not \na character trait. It is only when he was asked his views on matters of \ngreat judicial importance, this is with great specificity, to simply \nsay, on question after question: I will follow the law, is that \nanswering questions with great specificity?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Was the Senator trying to elicit from the nominee the \noutcomes of particular cases or was he inquiring of the nominee to have \nthe nominee's general understanding of the particular provisions, \nconstitutional provisions which are the basis for protecting individual \nrights and liberties? If you listen to the debate, some would say the \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee who were asking questions were \ntrying to basically unethically demand answers of the nominee as to the \noutcome of particular cases. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nAs I understand, what the Senator is talking about now is to try and \ngain an understanding about whether the nominee had an understanding of \nthe core provisions of the Constitution and the protections of those \ncore provisions and understood the context with which they were at \nleast passed or considered and interpreted over time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for his question. He is exactly \nright once again in terms of his question. No one said: How will you \nrule on this case that is now in the lower courts in DC. No one said, \nthere is a case in Texas about a meat packing company that refuses to \ngo along with what the FDA wants them to or the Department of \nAgriculture wants them to. No one asked even close to that degree of \nspecificity.\n  When one asks, what is your view on the commerce clause and how \nexpansively or narrowly it should be interpreted, what is your view on \nthe first amendment--I asked him, for instance, how it would affect his \nview on campaign finance spending. These are not questions of specific \ncases. In fact, the Senator was off the floor when I mentioned that I \nhave made inquiries of some of the legal ethicists in our country who \nmake a living by interpreting the canons of the ABA, what a lawyer can \nand cannot do. Not one of them thought any of the questions even came \nclose in terms of the level of specificity.\n  One might think that was just a ruse, that that was a way to avoid \ngiving one's opinions. And when one sees the article that was in the \nLegal Times in 1986, where it was reported that at a Federalist society \nmeeting, Judge Silberman, already a member of the DC Court of Appeals, \nsuggested to prospective nominees that Ronald Reagan might nominate, \ndon't answer the questions, that was the beginning. That was the seed \nwe are now seeing bear its evil fruit, which is to stonewall. And \nbasically the Senator was exactly right in his previous question, at \nleast in my opinion, going back to the view that the President should \nappoint.\n  Do you know what these hearings would be? They would be hearings for \nshow.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for another point?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I can remember the time when the nominees for the \nSupreme Court, nominated by Democrat or Republican Senators, when \nSenators actually gave the questions to the nominees. I used to do that \nfor years and years so that the nominee would have an opportunity to \nthink about these issues and be able to talk about the fundamental \nprotections of the Constitution and constitutional rights. This was \nnever viewed to be a game in the Judiciary Committee. It was to try to \nelicit from the nominee their understanding and the nature of their \nkind of commitment to core values. That was always the case.\n  Now we find, as the Senator has historically interpreted, we can \nnever get the responses, the answers. I mentioned the other day about \nunderstanding what the roles are of these two institutions. There is an \nextremely important and vital responsibility on every Member of this \nbody in exercising their judgment. It is a shared responsibility. I can \nunderstand the chairman of the Judiciary Committee would rather have it \nso it is just the President's responsibility. But that defies history \nand what our Founding Fathers wanted. This is a shared responsibility.\n\n  I again ask the Senator, how are we going to ever fulfill our \nresponsibilities under the Constitution when the nominees are basically \ngoing blank, refusing to respond to members of the committee? I further \nask the Senator, is he not concerned this is beginning to be a trend, \nin terms of nominees we are having now before the committee, where they \nbelieve they just don't have to respond?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator agree this isn't just a matter for the \nSenators from New York and Massachusetts, this is a matter for the \nAmerican people? That is what our Founding Fathers, who were the \narchitects of the greatest Constitution in the history of the world, \nintended: If we fail to exercise our rights on this, we fail our \nresponsibilities under the Constitution? I feel that way very strongly. \nI just inquire of the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. Again, I completely agree with him \non every one of the questions he has asked. I would like to cite for my \ncolleagues this article I mentioned. It was in the Legal Times of April \n22, 2002. Here is a quote from the article:\n\n       President George Bush's judicial nominees received some \n     very specific confirmation advice last week: ``Keep your \n     mouth shut.''\n\n  That statement in that article makes a mockery, as my good friend \nfrom Massachusetts has stated in his question, of the U.S. \nConstitution. ``Keep your mouth shut.'' One has to ask: Why should you \nkeep your mouth shut? It is not because there is anything unethical you \ndid. I don't think Miguel Estrada has done anything unethical. It is \nnot because you are ashamed of your history or of something that \nhappened in your past. Why are these nominees being told to keep their \nmouth shut, if this article is true?\n  We all know why. Because the people who are advising them are afraid \nif they gave their whole views, they would be rejected not only by the \nSenate but by the American people. And then there would have to be \nsomething different. The Senator is exactly right. We are on the road \nto mutilating our Constitution. I believe in this document. The older I \nget, the more in awe I am of the Constitution. The Founding Fathers \ncalled this country ``God's noble experiment.'' I believe that.\n  America took my family as refugees from Europe a hundred years ago--a\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\nlittle more than that. They were discriminated against; they could not \nhave any kind of job; but they were given a chance. My father never \ngraduated from college and his son is a Senator. This is an amazing \nplace. It is not just in the way my teenage children would say it, but \nin the biblical sense, an awesome place, where the angels tremble \nbefore God in awe.\n  Part of that awe that we so cherish is the fact that we try to \nfulfill what the Founding Fathers wanted and wished. For an immediate \npolitical purpose, to put before the courts people who might be out of \nthe mainstream, to make a mockery of the process by having three \ncontroversial court of appeals nominees appear on the same day so that \ntwo could not be questioned, to change by fiat the blue slip rule, \nwhich had been in existence for quite a while, and not debate and vote \non what should happen on the blue slip rule--but to just change it--to \nthen take a rule that had been in the Judiciary Committee since the \nSenator was on the Judiciary Committee before in 1979----\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It was before.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The rule was even before he was chairman. It said you \ncould debate an issue and not shut off debate, unless one member of the \nminority side--by the way, it wasn't written for a 10-to-9 minority; it \ncould have been written for a 19-to-1 minority. On the Judiciary \nCommittee some comity would have to reign. To take all these, and then \nthis hearing, this nomination, where Miguel Estrada, being the good \nstudent he is, basically kept his mouth shut, I don't care how many \nthick books they put on the table. Read the answers, I say to my \nfriends in America. Compare them to the answers of other judges, and \nthen look at the fact that the only records we have of Miguel Estrada, \nhis work as an Assistant Solicitor General, where we could determine \nhow he thinks, other than by what he said at the hearing, where he \ndidn't answer dispositively on anything in terms of his views--and the \nadministration all of a sudden says we are not giving up such \ndocuments--it makes you scratch your head and wonder.\n  So I say to my colleague--and I will relinquish the floor in a \nminute--to me, this is not a fight over Miguel Estrada or Mr. Jeffrey \nSutton or Judge Cook or John Roberts or Mr. Bybee or Mr. Tymkovich or \nany of the others; this is a fight for the sacredness of our \nConstitution. This is not the first time people who are a lot smarter \nthan I am have tried to figure out ways around the Constitution and \njust say they are invoking the Constitution. That has happened \nrepeatedly throughout our history.\n  But I believe, based on the patriotism that burns within me, based on \nmy belief that this America still is ``God's noble experiment,'' it is \nour job to try to keep the flame of that Constitution burning brightly. \nPart of that flame is to have a full vetting of nominees for the one \nnonelected part of the Government, the article III part of the \nGovernment; and to rush nominees through and say they don't have any \nmore time for a 40-year lifetime appointment, to say that they can \nanswer every question by basically obfuscating, I believe in my heart \nof hearts is not what Madison or Hamilton or Jay or Washington or any \nof the Founders intended.\n  I yield for a final question to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. This will be my last intervention \nat this time. I wanted to ask whether this understanding and this \npresentation is your understanding, again, about the Constitutional \nConvention. I will take a moment. I ask him whether this is his \nunderstanding as well.\n  On May 29, 1787, the convention began its work on the Constitution \nwith the Virginia Plan, introduced by Governor Randolph, which provided \n``that a National Judiciary be established, to be chosen by the \nNational Legislature.'' Under this plan, the President had no role at \nall in the selection of judges.\n  When this provision came before the convention on June 5, several \nmembers were concerned that having the whole legislature select judges \nwas too unwieldy. James Wilson suggested an alternative proposal that \nthe President be given sole power to appoint judges.\n  That idea had no support. Rutledge of South Carolina said that he \n``was by no means disposed to grant so great a power to any single \nperson.''\n  A week later, Madison offered a formal motion to give the Senate the \nsole power to appoint judges, and this motion was adopted without a \nsingle objection. On June 19, the convention formally adopted a working \ndraft of the Constitution, and it gave the Senate the exclusive power \nto appoint judges.\n  July of 1787 was spent reviewing the draft Constitution. All the \ndecisions having been made, this issue was revisited three different \ntimes. On July 18, the convention reaffirmed its decision to grant the \nSenate the sole, exclusive power. James Wilson again proposed ``that \nthe judges be appointed by the Executive,'' and again his motion was \ndefeated.\n  The issue was considered on July 21 and the Convention again agreed \nto the exclusive Senate appointment of judges.\n  In a debate concerning the provision, George Mason called the idea of \nexecutive appointment of Federal judges a ``dangerous precedent.''\n  Not until the final days of the Convention was the President given \npower to nominate. On September 4, 2 weeks before the Convention's work \nwas completed, the committee proposed the President should have a role \nin selecting judges. It stated:\n\n       The President shall nominate, and by and with the Advice \n     and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . judges of the \n     supreme Court. . . .''\n\n  The debates made clear, however, that while the President had the \npower to nominate the judges, the Senate still had a central role. \nGovernor Morris of Pennsylvania described the provision as giving----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me read this. Governor Morris of Pennsylvania \ndescribed the provision as giving the Senate the power ``to appoint \nJudges nominated to them by the President.'' The Constitutional \nConvention adopted this reworded provision giving the President the \npower, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to nominate and \nappoint judges.\n  It could not be clearer what our role is. It could not be clearer as \nto what the constitutional Founders wanted us to do.\n  I commend the Senator from New York for fulfilling that \nresponsibility with regard to nominees. There are others who believe we \nought to be a rubberstamp. The Senator from New York is speaking now to \nhis responsibilities as outlined by our Founding Fathers. I welcome the \nopportunity to join with him. I commend him for his contribution to \nthis debate.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. Again--and I am going to yield the \nfloor; we have had it a long time--that sums it up: The central role is \nthe Senate. Can the Senate engage in a central role, not the \nPresident--and we hear all the people who are criticizing what we are \ndoing, saying the President should be able to choose. Those very same \npeople want to be strict constructionists.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts, in outlining what happened at the \nConstitutional Convention, shows who are the real strict \nconstructionists in this Senate today. It is those of us who are trying \nto make sure the Senate has some real say in who the judges are--not a \nhearing at nine at night, not failure to answer questions, not somebody \nwho will not give up their whole record. This is a job for which we \nwould have lines from here to Baltimore if we offered it to every \nlawyer in America. How many of them would say: I won't give up my \nrecords, or I won't come and answer your questions. This is a standard \nthat perverts the views of the Founding Fathers.\n  Again, I say to the American people, why is it Miguel Estrada and \nthose supporting him are so afraid that we learn of his views? If they \nare mainstream, if they are moderate, if they are not way off the deep \nend, would not release of documents, would not his answering questions \nwithout evasion vindicate him? But instead, we have had a 3-,\n4-, 5-week battle to get simple answers out of a man who seeks to be \nappointed to the second most powerful court in the land that will \naffect every one of the 280 million Americans who are living today, \ntheir lives and the lives of their children and the lives of their \ngrandchildren. My colleague is exactly right.\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator agree, if I can ask him one other \nquestion, particularly seeing our leaders on the floor, would the \nSenator not agree with me that actually this is the wrong priority for \nthe Senate to be debating for weeks and weeks when we have serious \neconomic challenges facing this country, and I see our Democratic \nleader trying to get his proposal before the Senate, and the \nRepublicans saying no; or to try and get a prescription drug program \nbefore the Senate. I do not know whether the Senator has had an \nopportunity to see the President's proposal which effectively says to \nthe senior citizens they will no longer have the choice of their own \ndoctor if they want to get the prescription drug they need. A \nprescription drug program should be part of the Medicare system and \nshould not be a gift to the HMOs and the private insurance companies.\n  Would not the Senator finally agree with me that we have had this \ndebate, and we ought to be debating the country's business in terms of \nour economic recovery, the issues of prescription drugs, or even the \nissue of going to war with Iraq?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for that question. First, I say to \nhim, certainly, and let the American people who are watching today and \neverybody else understand the reason we have been on the issue of \nMiguel Estrada is not the choice of the Senator from Massachusetts, the \nSenator from New York, or our Democratic leader. It is the choice of \nthe Republican side. It is the choice of the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Any moment--we do not control the floor; we are in the minority--any \nmoment our friend from Tennessee, the majority leader, should say, \nLet's start debating how we are going to start getting jobs for the \nAmerican people, more than 2 million of whom have lost jobs, any time \nthe majority leader from Tennessee should say, let's debate \nprescription drugs, we would be off this issue of Miguel Estrada and \ndebating those issues. I say to my colleague, as long as our colleagues \ninsist on debating Miguel Estrada, I for one, and I speak, I think, for \nmany of us, will not let the Constitution be rolled over, will not \nallow the very discussion that the good Senator from Massachusetts \noutlined, where it is clear the Senate should have more power than the \nPresident in appointing judges, be made a laughingstock. This document, \nthe Constitution, is far too sacred.\n  It is my preference, to be honest, that the majority leader, the \nRepublican leader from Tennessee say: Let's start debating other \nissues. It is his choice. But as long as he does not, I will be here at \n10 of 4 in the afternoon or 10 of 4 in the middle of the night to \ndefend this Constitution and prevent it from becoming a laughingstock \nbecause of some temporary whim of a small number of people in this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the majority leader is here to propound a \nrequest. Let me make a couple of remarks, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be able to retain the floor after he finishes with his request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, all I can say is the Pharisees of the \nmeridian of time would have loved these arguments. In fact, they are \nvery worthy of that type of reasoning that existed during the meridian \nof time of our society. To stand here and talk like they are supporting \nand sustaining the Constitution when they are saying Republicans think \nthe President should have the sole power, nobody is arguing that. That \nis what you call another red herring along with their requests for \ndocuments that they know no self-respecting administration will give, \nas evidenced by the seven former Solicitors General, four of whom are \nDemocrats, who said those documents should not be given because they \nwould interfere with the work of the Solicitor General, the people's \nrepresentative.\n  The fact of the matter is that the Founding Fathers--and I have \nenjoyed this wonderful discussion by the Pharisees of modern times, \nbecause to say we are arguing that only the President has some role \nhere is not only ridiculous, it is ridiculously sublime. It is almost \nunbelievable for me to hear this as constitutional argument. Why, they \nwould be thrown out of the Supreme Court and asked never to come back \nagain by the liberals on the Supreme Court.\n  Madison himself offered a resolution to have a supermajority vote by \nthe Senate, and it was rejected 6 to 3--rejected 6 to 3. The \nappropriate language is right here in article II of the Constitution. \nIf we are going to talk about the Constitution, let's talk about the \nConstitution, not a bunch of gibberish. It says, talking about the \nPresident:\n\n       He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of \n     the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the \n     Senators present concur;--\n\n  That is a supermajority vote written in the Constitution, where \nsupermajority votes should show up.\n\n       and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and \n     Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other \n     public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, \n     and all other Officers of the United States, whose \n     Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which \n     shall be established by law; but the Congress may by Law vest \nthe Appointment. . . .\n\n  But it says, ``by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.''\n  Here are my colleagues acting holier than thou, acting as \nconstitutional experts, who are arguing that they should be able to \nsustain a filibuster that would require a supermajority vote out of \nthat clause, which says advice and consent, which very clearly made it \nclear they are talking about an up-or-down vote. When Madison tried to \nget a supermajority vote, he was voted down. Madison, the Founder of \nthe Constitution, was voted down 6 to 3.\n  These specious arguments, in my opinion, are not worthy of the \nSenate. There is a lot more I have to say, and I will complete my \nremarks after the majority leader takes the floor to make a unanimous \nconsent request. I have never heard such arguments before as have been \nmade throughout this afternoon, and I intend to answer some of them. It \nis not worthy of our time to answer all of them, but I am certainly \ngoing to answer some of them.\n  I respect my colleagues. It can be truthfully said I love my \ncolleagues. People know that. And especially these two who have been \narguing back and forth. But, again, they would have made wonderful \nPharisees in the meridian of time because they would beat an issue to \ndeath even though the issue does not exist.\n  In this particular case, some of these arguments never existed in \nconstitutional law or principle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. Res. 71\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 4:20 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 71 regarding the recent decision relating to \nthe Pledge of Allegiance; provided further that no amendments be in \norder to the resolution or preamble, and that there then be 10 minutes \nfor debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to \na vote on adoption of the resolution without any intervening action or \ndebate. I further ask unanimous consent that if the resolution is \nadopted, the preamble be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader if it is his \nintention to schedule any additional votes today after we have had the \nvote on this particular resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that would be the final vote of the day, \nand that would be at 4:30.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader.\n\n\n   Electing William H. Pickle, of Colorado, as Sergeant at Arms and \n                        Doorkeeper of the Senate\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as in legislative session, I send to the \ndesk a resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 72) electing William H. Pickle of \n     Colorado as the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the \n     Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to \nand that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 72) was agreed to, as follows:\n       Resolved, That William H. Pickle of Colorado be, and he is \n     hereby, elected Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate \n     effective March 17, 2003.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I welcome and introduce to my colleagues, \nwhich the Democratic leader and I have had the opportunity to do to our \nrespective caucuses today, Bill Pickle, to be our new Sergeant at Arms, \neffective March 17. Currently, Bill is the Federal director at the \nDenver International Airport. He was the first director appointed when \nthe Transportation Security Administration was created last year. Prior \nto that point, he served briefly as the Deputy Inspector General at the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  His real experience and career is with the Secret Service, which he \nserved for a period of 26 years. He served in a number of senior \nmanager positions, the most recent ones being Deputy Director for \nTraining and Human Resources, Special Agent in charge of the Vice \nPresidential Division, and head of the Secret Service Congressional \nAffairs Office.\n  Bill is a highly decorated Vietnam veteran. He served with the first \nAir Cavalry Division from 1968 to 1969 as an infantry sergeant and \nmedevac helicopter doorgunner. Mr. Pickle attended American University, \nas well as Metro State College in Denver, and holds a degree in \npolitical science. He is married and has two children.\n  Again, I welcome him to this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first let me commend the distinguished \nmajority leader for his choice in this proper position. In this time of \nuncertainty and with the experiences that the Senate has endured over \nthe course of the last couple of years in particular, we are all the \nmore sensitive about the role and the responsibilities of the Sergeant \nat Arms.\n  The Senate owes a big debt of gratitude to Al Lenhardt, the man who \nhas filled this position so admirably for the last couple of years. He \nhas endured, he has led, he has inspired. So we say farewell to Mr. \nLenhardt, and we acknowledge once again the extraordinary contribution \nhe has made not only to the Senate but to his country. I am proud of \nhis work. I am proud to call him a friend.\n  I am pleased that Bill Pickle has agreed to take on this enormous \nresponsibility. He comes extraordinarily well qualified. His \nexperiences will serve him well as he begins to undertake the \nresponsibilities and the expectations of the Senate as we look to the \nmany challenges the Senate faces in dealing with security and the many \nother issues that will be on his desk as he holds this position. I \ncongratulate him. I wish him well. I know I can say without \nequivocation that unanimously our caucus expresses our willingness to \nwork closely with him as he begins his work in the Senate.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I also want to add my appreciation to Al \nLenhardt, our current Sergeant at Arms. I have had the opportunity to \nwork with Al closely in that he came right before the time when anthrax \nfirst struck Washington, DC. I have had the chance to work with him on \nan intimate basis through that challenge and also over the last year \nand a half as he brought a current state-of-the-art discipline to that \nposition to give the protection we depend on each and every day.\n  I had the opportunity to share my gratitude directly with the \nDemocratic leader yesterday in his office as we met with Al and Bill \nPickle.\n\n\n   Unanimous Consent Agreement--The Moscow Treaty, Document No. 107-8\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 tomorrow \nthe Senate proceed to Executive Session to consider Calendar No. 1, the \nMoscow Treaty; provided further it be considered under the following \nlimitation: The treaty be considered advanced through its various \nparliamentary stages, up to and including the presentation of the \nresolution of ratification; all recommended committee conditions and \ndeclarations be considered agreed to and provided further that all \namendments to the resolution of ratification be relevant; further, that \nfollowing the disposition of the relevant amendments and the conclusion \nof the debate on the resolution, the Senate then immediately proceed to \na vote on the adoption of the resolution of ratification, as amended, \nwith no further intervening action or debate, and that following the \nvote the President then be notified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to turn to a final matter of \nbusiness for me, and it concerns the subject of the Estrada nomination. \nI want to take a couple of minutes to comment on where we are today. \nThis nomination, as my colleagues know, has been pending on the floor \nsince February 5. It has been just about a month ago that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee brought forth this \nnomination. Over that period of time, we have had ample opportunity to \nhave a very good debate. We have had a thorough discussion, and we have \nhad thoughtful discussion, and we have had reasonable discussion. Both \nsides of the aisle, indeed, have been patient, recognizing the \nimportance of this nomination.\n\n  We have listened very carefully to the arguments of the other side of \nthe aisle to see if there is any way possible we could get an up-or-\ndown vote, a vote to confirm or not to confirm, but to have the vote. \nThe response to that has been a filibuster, which has been ongoing now, \nfor an exceptional nominee.\n  Again, after a lot of time, a lot of focus, a lot of patience, a lot \nof thorough discussions, I feel it is time to give more definition to \nwhere we are in this nomination. Over this last month we have had 12 \nsession days dedicated to the nomination. We have had active debate and \ndiscussion for over 85 hours. We have put forth 17 separate unanimous \nconsent requests which have been denied. We have seen mounds of \neditorial support accumulate from across the country. The latest count, \nfrom 29 States and the District of Columbia, 72 editorials calling for \nthe end of the filibuster and/or support of Miguel Estrada; only ten \nsupporting the other side. We have had the McConnell-Miller letter \nwhich was signed by 52 Senators, indicating strong support for Miguel \nEstrada. We have had offers by the White House to make Miguel Estrada \navailable to Senators who might want to visit with him one on one.\n  I outline that to demonstrate we are doing everything possible to \nachieve a very simple goal. That goal, consistent with the \nConstitution, consistent with the advice and consent, is to have an up-\nor-down vote on this nominee, allowing each Senator to express their \nwill, either yes or no.\n  As I said, the time has come, after being patient, to give increased \ndefinition to the debate for people to actually stand up and be \ncounted. I have been denied the only other means I have to reach a \nvote, and that is through unanimous consent. Thus I have to rely on my \nonly alternative now. That is to generate a vote so that people in this \nbody and indeed the American people can know where each Member stands. \nThat vote will be filing cloture. I do want to point out that filing of \ncloture is intended to identify where individuals stand and in no way \nmeans any walking away from this nomination. In fact, it is just the \nopposite. If cloture fails, it is the real beginning, I believe, of \nthis important debate that has been underway now for almost 30 days, \nbut which we permitted to continue in order to have that up-or-down \nvote. If cloture is successful, which I hope, we will be able to go \nimmediately to the vote and we will be able to have this nominee \nconfirmed. If Democrats go on record through this vote as supporting an \nactive filibuster, we and their constituents will be able to address \neach one of them and ask for an explanation.\n  Filing of cloture represents, in my mind, an active campaign to \nensure this fine nominee ultimately is voted upon and thus will win \nbecause we know we have the majority votes for him to be confirmed. \nThus, this is our first step.\n  By filing this cloture motion we will be, if unsuccessful, racheting \nup the attention level for this well-qualified\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\nnominee. Members will have that opportunity to decide whether this man \ndeserves that up-or-down vote I referred to. Members will get a chance \nto say whether the President of the United States deserves to have his \nnominee, the President's nominee, acted upon, voted upon, in this \nSenate--again, an opportunity for the President's nominee to have an \nup-or-down vote.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  With that said, I now send a cloture motion with 51 signatures to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 21, the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada to be \n     United States circuit judge for the District of Columbia \n     circuit.\n         Bill Frist, Orrin Hatch, Trent Lott, Bob Bennett, Peter \n           Fitzgerald, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Lisa Murkowski, \n           Conrad Burns, John Warner, John E.

For the information of all Senators, this vote will occur \nThursday morning. We will alert Members to the precise timing of this \nvote.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent the live quorum under rule XXII \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I listened carefully to the words of the distinguished \nmajority leader and certainly understand his decision to file cloture. \nMany of us had anticipated a cloture motion would be filed. We are more \nthan ready to have one or more votes when and if they are scheduled. \nThose votes, of course, would not be necessary were the information we \nrequested from the beginning provided. We have simply asked that Mr. \nEstrada fill out his application for this lifetime employment, as every \nother one of his predecessors has, providing information about his \nrecord, providing information about his position, providing information \nin ways that will allow Senators a far better appreciation of the vote \nthey are taking on this important matter prior to the time he begins \nserving on the second highest court in the land.\n  We welcome the vote. As I said, we will welcome subsequent votes if \nthey are filed. We believe the constitutional obligation we have as \nSenators requires we demand the same degree of compliance to the rules, \nthe same degree of willingness to cooperate that all those who have \nserved in the past and have provided that information have been willing \nto provide in their cases, as well.\n  We will certainly anticipate that vote, the recognition that this \ndebate goes on unnecessarily. It would not have to take 30 days. It \nwould not have had to take 12 legislative days. It would not have had \nto take 85 hours for Mr. Estrada to be more forthcoming, more willing \nto provide the information his predecessors have provided.\n  I understand the actions just announced by the majority leader. But I \nwill say it really does not change anything. The only thing that will \nchange the circumstances we currently face is if Mr. Estrada becomes \nmore cooperative and he fulfills his obligations under the \nConstitution, as his predecessors have so ably done for so many years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one thing it does establish is that there \nreally is a filibuster by our colleagues on the other side. They have \nbeen denying this right up to now, so that is why we have to have a \ncloture vote to show that there is a filibuster; for the first time in \nhistory, a true filibuster against a circuit court of appeals nominee.\n  That is a constitutional issue and it is an important constitutional \nissue. I was really blown away by my colleague's assertion that we are \ntrying to just make an imperial President. That is not at all the case. \nWe know the Senate has an obligation to look at these judges. As a \nmatter of fact, whenever we say we treated their judges better than \nthey are treating Miguel Estrada, they are using a double standard on \nMiguel Estrada, and they say their judges were not controversial.\n  Give me a break. I will be willing to ask Miguel Estrada to give \ndetailed answers to every question that was asked of Marsha Berzon, \nevery question that was asked of Judge Paez, every question that was \nasked of Margaret Morrow. Those hearings lasted minutes. This lasted a \nsolid day, more than most nominees in the history of the country for \nthe Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  By the way, for those on the other side who keep trying to imply--I \nwas interested in my words that were put up. What was wrong with those \nwords? They were absolutely true. We should not have activist judges on \nthe bench.\n  I disagree with their characterization that activist means anything \nbut activist. I agree with Senator Schumer's discussion on activism. I \ndon't like activism from the left and I don't like it from the right. I \ndon't think it is right in either case. Activism is ignoring the law; \nusing your judicial position to make laws from the bench that you were \nnever nominated and confirmed to make.\n  Judges are not elected to make laws. The purpose of judges is to \ninterpret the laws made by those of us who have to stand for \nreelection. We are the ones who make the laws. The President and the \nexecutive branch also can make laws.\n  But where in the Constitution, or in anything said by the Founding \nFathers, does it say that a minority of the Senate has a right to \nprevent a vote up or down on a President's nominee? Nowhere.\n  In that provision I read, where does it say you can have a \nsupermajority vote? In fact, the only supermajority vote mentioned in \narticle II is the clause I read from, that is a two-thirds vote for the \nratification of treaties. But in that same paragraph it said the Senate \nhas a right to advise and consent on nominees.\n  Those words they put up of mine regarding activist judges, I don't \nsee anything wrong with those words. They apply today, and I have \nalways gone by them. But to imply that their judges were not treated \nproperly when we put through 377 Clinton judges, the second all-time \nrecord in the history of the Senate, in the history of the nomination \nprocess, 5 less than the all-time champion Ronald Reagan, while 6 years \nthe Judiciary Committee was in the control of the Republicans, the \nopposition party, where President Reagan had 6 years of his own party \nto assist him--and to act like that was not a remarkable job of \nfairness to President Clinton, again makes my point that these are \nmodern-day Pharisees who would distort anything in order to make their \narguments.\n  I would like to get to a couple of things that have really been a \nlittle irritating to me. I have heard a lot of whining about last \nweek's Judiciary Committee markup where I had to rule we are not going \nto filibuster in committee and we were going to have votes up and down \non the circuit court nominees.\n  I have also heard arguments that to have three nominees in one \nhearing is just awful. It has never been done before. I am going to \ntalk about those two things just for a minute or two, because I think \nit is important to understand.\n  First of all, on that rule, I checked with our parliamentarians, two \nof them, in this body. They upheld me and told me I was right in the \ninterpretation of the rules that I made. But the rule they are hiding \nbehind is rule 4. They are saying that rule 4 prevented me from being \nable to call for a vote unless I got at least one member of the other \nside to agree.\n  By the way, each one of those judges had at least two members of the \nother side in agreement, so there is nothing to complain about, even \nthen. But the text of rule 4 says this:\n\n       The chairman shall entertain a nondebatable motion to bring \n     a matter before the committee to a vote.\n\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\n\n  A nondebatable motion. There was no motion made. There was a point of \norder raised which I overruled. There was an objection raised, which I \noverruled. Listen to this again:\n\n       The chairman shall entertain a nondebatable motion to bring \n     a matter before the committee to a vote.\n\n  There has to be a motion. That didn't happen.\n\n       If there is objection to bringing the matter to a vote, \n     without further debate a rollcall vote of the committee shall \n     be taken and debate shall be terminated if the motion to \n     bring the matter to a vote without further debate passes with \n     10 votes cast in the affirmative, one of which is cast by the \n     minority.\n\n  That is the rule that allows any Senator to make a motion to bring \nany matter to a vote, so long as that Senator has all of his own party \nand one, at least one from the other. It is not a rule that can be used \nto stop the chairman from having a vote and from ending debate, which \nhad clearly ended, and to stop a filibuster in the committee.\n  So all this whining and crying about that is a total \nmisinterpretation of the very expressly worded rule. You would think \nthey were mistreated. Not at all. They were treated very fairly. They \njust want to be able to slow down this process so President Bush's \njudges do not get hearings, they don't get markups in committee, and \nwhen they come to the floor they are going to filibuster some of them--\nmaybe all of them, for all I know.\n  By the way, their argument there is specious. It is wrong. It is \nirrelevant. It is a misinterpretation of the very rule they are citing. \nAnd it is unworthy because I happen to know that they checked with the \nparliamentarians who said I was right in what I did. And I was right in \nwhat I did.\n  With regard to their other argument attacking me for putting three \ncircuit court of appeal nominees on one hearing, I put those three up \nin the spring of 2001. I was told by the Democrats they didn't want to \ngo forward, that they would like me to give them a little more time. I \nagreed.\n  In the intervening time, Senator Jeffords decided to go independent \nand vote with the Democrats, and the committee chairmanship changed. So \nI was unable to bring them up at that time. They will have been sitting \nhere for almost 2 years. These are some of the top appointees in the \nhistory of the judiciary. I might add that John Roberts has been \nsitting there for 12 years, three nominations by two different \nPresidents. It just plain is not right.\n  I might also add that, having been attacked for holding what a number \nof Members on the other side of the aisle called an unprecedented \nhearing because the agenda included three circuit court nominees, you \nmight be interested to hear I have subsequently found out that January \n29 hearing was the 13th time since President Carter's administration \nthat this committee has considered more than two circuit nominees in a \nsingle hearing. The 13th time--not unprecedented, I would say. Hardly \nat all.\n  But that is not all I learned. One of those 13 hearings was chaired \nby Senator Kennedy, who was then the committee chairman, on June 25, \n1979. I was there. That included seven circuit judges.\n  What they throw out is: Well, they weren't controversial. I assure \nyou that every Carter circuit judge was controversial. But there was a \ncomity in the Senate then and there was also a 62-vote majority of the \nDemocrats in the Senate versus 38 Republicans. But there was a comity, \nthat people just didn't raise the kind of ridiculous arguments that are \nbeing raised today in the Judiciary Committee. I assure you, those were \ncontroversial nominees, but nobody complained about that because of the \ncomity and also because of the overwhelming control of the Democrats. \nThey knew they could get away with it, and they did. And nobody really \nraised a fuss about it.\n\n  They were all nominated by President Carter and all for the same \ncircuit court of appeals. Talk about balance, which is what we are \nhearing right now from the other side.\n  Three weeks later, on July 18, 1979, Chairman Kennedy held another \nhearing with four more Carter circuit nominees--all controversial--\nmaybe not all but controversial ones again.\n  Then, on September 21 of that year, he held yet another multiple \ncircuit hearing that included three circuit nominees. All three \nhearings occurred within a 4-month period. So it is all right for them \nto hold multiple circuit court nominee hearings, but it is an \nunprecedented thing for us. I agree, it probably is, because I do not \nknow that we have ever been in charge long enough to do that before we \nheld three.\n  But I know this, I held, I think, 11 or 13 two-nominee hearings when \nI was chairman, and Mr. Clinton, their President, was President. I \ncertainly do not mean to single out my friend Senator Kennedy, so I \nshould also point out that when Senator Biden was chairman of this \ncommittee, he held two hearings that included three circuit nominees \neach; one on July 21, 1987, another on October 5, 1990. Senator \nThurmond held five such hearings when he was chairman. And Senator \nEastland, back in November 1977, who was chairman at that time, held a \nhearing for three circuit judges in one hearing. So much for the \nprecedented.\n  Senator Kennedy's advice and consent argument, while interesting, is \nwrong on the law and wrong on the facts. His argument ignores the basic \nunderpinnings of the Senate's role in the advise and consent process.\n  In fact, I would submit that the other side's effort to demand Mr. \nEstrada's personal views on certain legal issues is itself an \nunconstitutional threat to the separation of powers inherent in our \nsystem of government and to the Framer's desire to maintain an \nindependent judiciary.\n  It has never been the case that the Senate is constitutionally \nentitled to an answer to any question it chooses to ask a nominee while \nexercising its advise and consent responsibility. The reason for this \nis clear: the Framers sought to ensure that the judicial branch would \nremain independent of the legislative branch.\n  According to Federalist Papers 78, judicial independence ``is an \nexcellent barrier to the despotism of the prince'' and ``in a republic \nit is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions \nof the representative body.''\n  For this reason, the Constitution prohibits Congress from reducing \nFederal judges' salaries, guarantees that judges will remain on the \nbench ``during good Behavior,'' and allows Congress to remove them only \nby impeachment. These protections were born of the Framers' fear that \nthe federal legislature, like King George III before it, would pressure \njudges into reaching outcomes of which it approved, or that otherwise \nwere consistent with its interests.\n  The Framers' intent to insulate Federal judges from the political \ninfluence of the legislative branch also informed their decision to \nrestrict the role of the Senate in the confirmation process.\n  The Senate's limited function is apparent from the Constitution's \nvery text. To state the obvious, the President holds the power to \nnominate candidates to the Federal bench, while the Senate's role is \nrestricted to providing ``advice and consent.''\n  The Constitution assigns the Senate a limited role in the selection \nof judicial nominees; it simply allows that body to ratify the \nPresident's choices, or decline to do so. Put simply, the President \nselects, then the Senate reviews and reacts.\n  As Alexander Hamilton explained in the Federalist No. 66:\n\n       There will, of course, be no exertion of choice on the part \n     of the senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, \n     and oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves \n     choose--they can only ratify or reject the choice he may have \n     made.\n\n  This is not to say that the Senate must act as a ``rubber stamp'' to \na President's choices for the judiciary. As has been the case \nthroughout history, the Senate is entitled to detailed information \nabout a nominee's background, career and qualifications for the bench. \nAnd Mr. Estrada has provided ample information to allow the Senate to \ndetermine his qualifications.\n  First, it bears repeating that the American Bar Association \nunanimously rates Mr. Estrada ``Well qualified'' for this position. The \nDemocrats' ``gold standard.''\n  Second, Mr. Estrada testified for a full day in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on a range of subjects, and then answered within followup \nquestions for committee members. It should be mentioned that only two \nmembers of the\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\ncommittee decided to pose such questions.\n  Third, Mr. Estrada has received broad bipartisan support from lawyers \nwho know him best, including former Clinton Solicitor General Seth \nWaxman,\n  Vice President Gore's former Chief of Staff Ron Klain, former Clinton \nJustice Department officials Randolph Moss and Bob Litt, as well as 14 \nformer colleagues of his in the Solicitor General's Office. All have \nwritten glowing recommendations of Mr. Estrada.\n  Fourth, the Senate is free to review the briefs and other publicly \navailable written work Mr. Estrada performed on behalf of clients in \nthe more than 15 Supreme Court cases he has handled during his career. \nThe record is voluminous.\n  All of this information is more than adequate to address Mr. \nEstrada's qualifications. however, this body must, in order to maintain \nthe proper constitutional balance, refrain from seeking just the sort \nof information Mr. Estrada's opponents now demand: his personal views \non legal issues.\n  Many distinguished Democrats have themselves noted that seeking \npersonal views simply is inappropriate:\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall made this point in 1967, when he refused to \nanswer questions at his confirmation hearing about the Fifth Amendment:\n\n       I do not think you want me to be in the position of giving \n     you a statement on the fifth amendment, and then, if I am \n     confirmed and sit on the Court, when a fifth amendment case \n     comes up, I will have to disqualify myself.\n\n  Lloyd Cutler, President Clinton's former White House Counsel who also \nwas at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue at the same time as the \nSenator from New York, disagrees with efforts to discern a nominee's \nideology during the confirmation process. According to Mr. Cutler:\n\n       It would be a tragic development if ideology became an \n     increasingly important consideration in the future. To make \n     ideology an issue in the confirmation process is to suggest \n     that the legal process is and should be a political one. That \n     is not only wrong as a matter of political science; it also \n     serves to weaken public confidence in the courts. Just as \n     candidates should put aside their partisan political views \n     when appointed to the bench, so too should they put aside \n     ideology. To retain either is to betray dedication to the \n     process of impartial judging.\n\n  Former Senator Albert Gore, Sr. also believed that efforts to discern \na nominee's personal views was inappropriate. Former Senator Gore noted \nthe following in connection with the 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas:\n\n       [A] judge is under the greatest and most compelling \n     necessity to avoid construing or explaining opinion of the \n     Court lest he may appear to be adding to or subtracting from \n     what has been decided, or may perchance be prejudging future \n     cases.\n\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee agreed with Senator Gore, noting the \nfollowing in a Committee Report on the Fortas nomination that year:\n\n       Although recognizing the constitutional dilemma which \n     appears to exist when the Senate is asked to advise and \n     consent on a judicial nominee without examining him on legal \n     questions, the committee is of the view that Justice Fortas \n     wisely and correctly declined to answer questions in this \n     area. To require a Justice to state his views on legal \n     questions or to discuss his past decisions before the \n     committee would threaten the independence of the judiciary \n     and the integrity of the judicial system itself. It would \n     also impinge on the constitutional doctrine of separation of \n     powers among the three branches of Government as required by \n     the Constitution.\n\n  Finally, the ABA's Model Code of Judicial conduct also prohibits a \nnominee from discussing his personal views. Canon 5A(3)(D) of the ABA's \nModel Code of Judicial Conduct states that prospective judges ``shall \nnot . . . make pledges or promises of conduct in office other than the \nfaithful and impartial performance of the duties of office . . . [or] \nmake statements that commit or appear to commit the candidate with \nrespect to cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come \nbefore the court.''\n  Mr. Estrada's opponents in essence are asking him to violate this \nethical cannon.\n  Mr. Estrada possesses an excellent record--one which merits \nconfirmation. Efforts by the other side to deny him confirmation in the \nface of this excellent record are unfair and degrading to the \nconfirmation process.\n  The arguments made by the other side are not constitutional, they are \npolitical. The other side knows that the Constitution prohibits this \nbody from intruding on the independence of the judiciary, and from \nforcing candidates to provide us with their personal views on legal \nissues. I hope the Senate will reject these unconstitutional efforts \nand that we will vote soon to confirm Miguel Estrada.\n  During the course of this debate, there have been many serious \nmisrepresentations of the record on Mr. Estrada. I want to address in \nsome detail one of the more serious distortions, which concerns the \nanswers that Mr. Estrada gave to questions that members of the \nJudiciary Committee asked him.\n  The charge being leveled against Mr. Estrada is that he did not \nanswer questions put to him in general, and did not answer questions \nabout his judicial philosophy in particular. This charge is pure bunk.\n  It is important to remember the circumstances under which this \nhearing took place. The hearing was held on September 26, 2001. It was \nchaired by my Democratic friend, the senior Senator from New York. It \nlasted all day. Both Democratic and Republican Senators asked scores of \nquestions, which Mr. Estrada answered. And if any Senator was \ndissatisfied with Mr. Estrada's answers, every member of the committee \nhad the opportunity to ask Mr. Estrada followup questions--although \nonly two of my Democratic colleagues did.\n  Now, a number of the questions Mr. Estrada was asked sought, directly \nor indirectly, to pry from him a commitment on how he would rule in a \nparticular case. Previous judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate \nhave rightly declined to answer questions on that basis, just as Mr. \nEstrada did.\n  Let me give you some examples.\n  In 1967, during his confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court, \nJustice Thurgood Marshall responded to a question about the Fifth \nAmendment by stating:\n\n       I do not think you want me to be in a position of giving \n     you a statement on the Fifth Amendment and then, if I am \n     confirmed and sit on the Court, when a fifth amendment case \n     comes up, I will have to disqualify myself.\n\n  During Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's confirmation hearing, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, the former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, defended her refusal to discuss her views on abortion. He \nsaid:\n\n       It is offensive to suggest that a potential Justice of the \n     Supreme Court must pass some presumed test of judicial \n     philosophy. It is even more offensive to suggest that a \n     potential justice must pass the litmus test of any single-\n     issue interest group.\n\n  Likewise, Justice John Paul Stevens testified during his confirmation \nhearing:\n\n       I really don't think I should discuss this subject \n     generally, Senator. I don't mean to be unresponsive but in \n     all candor I must say that there have been many times in my \n     experience in the last five years where I found that my first \n     reaction to a problem was not the same as the reaction I had \n     when I had the responsibility of decisions and I think that \n     if I were to make comments that were not carefully thought \n     through they might be given significance that they really did \n     not merit.\n\n  Justice Ruth Baker Ginsburg also declined to answer certain \nquestions, stating:\n\n       Because I am and hope to continue to be a judge, it would \n     be wrong for me to say or to preview in this legislative \n     Chamber how I would cast my vote on questions the Supreme \n     Court may be called upon to decide. Were I to rehearse here \n     what I would say and how I would reason on such questions, I \n     would act injudiciously.\n\n  Like these previous nominees, all of whom the Senate confirmed, Mr. \nEstrada refused to violate the code of ethics for judicial nominees by \ndeclining to give answers that would appear to commit him on issues \nthat he will be called upon to decide as a judge. But again and again, \nhe provided answers, in direct response to questions, that make his \njudicial philosophy an open book.\n  Let me share some specific examples.\n  Responding to a question to identify the most important attribute of \na judge, Mr. Estrada answered that it was to have an appropriate \nprocess for decision making. That, he said, entails having an open \nmind, listening to the parties, reading their briefs, doing all of the \nlegwork on the law and facts, engaging in deliberation with colleagues \nand being committed to judging as a\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\nprocess that is intended to give the right answer. These are not \nextreme views. I don't think we could ask more from any judge.\n  When asked about the appropriate temperament of a judge, he responded \nthat a judge should be impartial, open minded and unbiased, courteous \nyet firm, and one who will give ear to people that come into his \ncourtroom. These are the qualities of Miguel Estrada. He testified that \nhe is and would continue to be the type of person who listens with both \nears and be fair to all litigants.\n  Mr. Estrada was asked a number of questions about his views and \nphilosophy on following legal precedent. Let me highlight a bit of that \nexchange:\n  Question:\n\n       Are you committed to following the precedents of higher \n     courts faithfully and giving them full force and effect even \n     if you disagree with such precedents?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       Absolutely, Senator.\n\n  Question:\n\n       What would you do if you believe the Supreme Court or the \n     Court of Appeals had seriously erred in rendering a decision? \n     Would you apply that decision or would you use your own \n     judgment of the merits, or the best judgment of the merits?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       My duty as a judge and my inclination as a person and as a \n     lawyer of integrity would be to follow the orders of the \n     higher court.\n\n  Question:\n\n       And if there were no controlling precedent dispositively \n     concluding an issue with which you were presented in your \n     circuit, to what sources would you turn for persuasive \n     authority?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       In such a circumstance my cardinal rule would be to seize \n     aid from any place where I could get it--related case law, \n     legislative history, custom and practice, and views of \n     academics on analysis of the law.\n\n  This exchange illustrates clearly Miguel Estrada's respect for the \nlaw and his willingness and ability to faithfully follow the law. He \nfurther testified, in response to other questions:\n\n       I will follow binding case law in every case. Even in \n     accordance with the case law that is not binding, but seems \n     instructive on the area, without any influence whatsoever \n     from any personal view I may have about the subject matter.\n\n  This is what we expect judges to do. I can see no good reason why \nanyone would be opposed to a nominee who promised to follow the law.\n  When asked about the role of political ideology in the legal process, \nMr. Estrada replied with a response that, in my view, was entirely \nappropriate and within the mainstream of what all Americans expect from \ntheir judiciary. He said:\n\n       [A]lthough we all have views on a number of subjects from A \n     to Z, the first duty of a judge is to self-consciously put \n     that aside and look at each case with an open mind and listen \n     to the parties. And, to the best of his human capacity, to \n     give judgment based solely on the arguments on the law. I \n     think my basic idea of judging is to do it on the basis of \n     law and to put aside whatever view I might have on the \n     subject to the maximum extent possible.\n\n  When asked about his views on interpreting the Constitution, Mr. \nEstrada was forthright and complete in his responses. For example, in \nan exchange regarding the literal interpretation of the words of the \nConstitution, Mr. Estrada responded:\n\n       I recognize that the Supreme Court has said on numerous \n     occasions in the area of privacy and elsewhere that there are \n     unenumerated rights in the Constitution. And I have no view \n     of any sort, whether legal or personal, that would hinder me \n     from applying those rulings by the Court. But I think the \n     Court has been quite clear that there are unenumerated rights \n     in the Constitution. In the main, the Court has recognized \n     them as being inherent in the right of substantive due \n     process and the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\n  Mr. Estrada was asked questions about the appropriate balance between \nCongress and the courts. His answers make clear his view that judges \nmust review challenges to statutes with a strong presumption of the \nstatutes' constitutionality. For example, in responding to a question \nabout environmental protection statutes, he stated:\n\n       Congress has passed a number of statutes that try to \n     safeguard the environment. I think all judges would have to \n     greet those statutes when they come to court with a strong \n     presumption of constitutionality.\n\n  At the same time, he recognized that, as a circuit court judge, he \nwould be bound to follow the precedent established by Lopez and other \nSupreme Court cases.\n  So, it is clear from the record that Mr. Estrada did answer the \nquestions put to him at his hearing. His judicial philosophy is an open \nbook. But if my Democratic colleagues are still inclined to vote \nagainst him--as misguided as I believe that choice to be--they should \ndo so. Vote for him or vote against him; do what your conscience \ndictates. Just votes. And stop the unfairness of this filibuster.\n  And let me make one more point. Even if my colleagues still believe, \ndespite the facts and precedent, that Mr. Estrada should answer more \nquestions, well they have their chance. In a February 27 letter, White \nHouse Counsel Al Gonzales made the following offer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, February 27, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Frist, Senator Daschle, Senator Hatch, and \n     Senator Leahy: I write in connection with the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada. Some Democrat Senators have indicated that \n     they would like to know more about Mr. Estrada's record \n     before a vote occurs. As I stated in my letter of February 12 \n     to Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy, we believe that the \n     Senate has had sufficient time and possesses sufficient \n     information to vote on Miguel Estrada. More important, a \n     majority of Senators have indicated that they possess \n     sufficient information and would vote to confirm him.\n       But if some Senators believe they must have more \n     information before they will end the filibuster of this \n     nomination, we respectfully suggest that there are three \n     different and important sources of information that have been \n     and remain available and that would appropriately accommodate \n     the request for additional information. We ask that you \n     encourage interested Senators to avail themselves of these \n     sources as soon as possible.\n       First, as I have written to you previously, individual \n     Senators who wish to meet with Miguel Estrada may and should \n     do so immediately. We continue to believe that such meetings \n     could be very useful to Senators who wish to learn more about \n     Mr. Estrada's record and character.\n       Second, Senators who have additional questions for Mr. \n     Estrada should immediately pose such questions in writing to \n     him. We propose that additional questions (in a reasonable \n     number) be submitted in writing to Mr. Estrada by Friday, \n     February 28. Mr. Estrada would endeavor to answer such \n     questions in writing by Tuesday, March 4. He would answer the \n     questions forthrightly, appropriately, and in a manner \n     consistent with the traditional practice and obligations of \n     judicial nominees, as he has before.\n       Third, Senators who wish to know more about Mr. Estrada's \n     performance and approach when working in the United States \n     Government--and, in particular, how that relates to his \n     possible future performance as a Circuit Judge--should \n     immediately ask in writing for the views of the Solicitors \n     General, United States Attorney, and Judges for whom Mr. \n     Estrada worked and ask them to respond by Tuesday, March 4. \n     In particular, interested Senators could immediately send a \n     joint letter to each of the following individuals for whom \n     Mr. Estrada has worked in the United States Government: Judge \n     Amalya Kearse, Justice Anthony Kennedy, former United States \n     Attorney Otto Obermaier, former Solicitor General Ken Starr, \n     former Solicitor General Drew Days, former Solicitor General \n     Walter Dellinger, and former Solicitor General Seth Waxman. \n     In our judgment, these men and women could provide their \n     views on Mr. Estrada's background and suitability to be a \n     Circuit Judge by March 4 without sacrificing the integrity of \n     the decisionmaking processes of the Judiciary, United States \n     Attorney's office, and Solicitor General's office. And their \n     views could assist Senators who seek more information about \n     Mr. Estrada.\n       We believe that these sources of information, which have \n     been available for some time, would readily accommodate the \n     desire for additional information expressed by some Senators \n     who have thus far supported the filibuster of a vote on this \n     nominee. We ask that you encourage Senators who have objected \n     to the scheduling of a vote to avail themselves of these \n     sources of information. And we respectfully ask that the \n     Senate vote up or down as soon as possible on Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination, which has been pending for nearly two years.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. To my knowledge, no Senators have taken advantage of this \noffer, which makes me question how serious they are about the merits of \nMr. Estrada's nomination, which brings me to another point. Mr. \nEstrada's hearing was held under Democratic control of the committee on \nSeptember 26, 2002. If\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nthere was any question about the quality of Mr. Estrada's testimony, \nthey could have held another hearing, since they controlled the \ncommittee for another 3 months.\n  My colleague from New York has stated that, according to an article \nthat appeared in the Legal Times in April 2002, D.C. Circuit Judge \nLaurence Silberman has advised President Bush's judicial nominees to \n``keep their mouths shut.''\n  In fact, as the rest of the article explains, Judge Silberman simply \nexplained that the rules of judicial ethics prohibit nominees from \nindicating how they would rule in a given case or on a given issue--or \neven appearing to indicate how they would rule.\n  As the same article reported, Judge Silberman stated:\n\n       It is unethical to answer such questions. It can't help but \n     have some effect on your decisionmaking process once you \n     become a judge.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Judge Nominees Told To Speak Very Softly\n\n\n  On a panel last week, Silberman offered same advice he gave Antonin \n                                 Scalia\n\n                          (By Jonathan Groner)\n\n       President George W. Bush's judicial nominees received some \n     very specific confirmation advice last week: Keep your mouths \n     shut.\n       The warning came from someone who has been a part of the \n     process: Laurence Silberman, a senior judge on the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, told an audience of 150 at a \n     Federalist Society luncheon that he served as an informal \n     adviser to his then-D.C. Circuit colleague Antonin Scalia \n     when Scalia was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1986.\n       ``I was his counsel, and I counseled him to say nothing [at \n     his confirmation hearings] concerning any matter that could \n     be thought to bear on any cases coming before the Court,'' \n     Silberman said.\n       Silberman said his advice led to Scalia's speedy \n     confirmation by keeping the nominee out of trouble on Capitol \n     Hill. He also explained that the advice was intended to be \n     rather far-reaching.\n       Scalia called Silberman at one point, the latter recalled, \n     and told him he was about to be questioned about his views \n     about Marbury v. Madison, the nearly 200-year-old case that \n     established the principle of judicial review.\n       ``I told him that as a matter of principle, he shouldn't \n     answer that question either,'' Silberman said. He explained \n     that once a prospective judge discusses any case at all, the \n     floodgates open and he would be forced to discuss other \n     cases.\n       ``It is unethical to answer such questions,'' Silberman \n     said. ``It can't help but have some effect on your decision-\n     making process once you become a judge.''\n       In contrast, Silberman said, ``my friend Bob Bork'' \n     ventured into the legal thickets and suffered for it. Bork \n     ``thought he could turn the confirmation process into a Yale \n     Law School classroom,'' Silberman explained.\n       The Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork, also a D.C. \n     Circuit judge, was defeated in 1987, party because Bork \n     expressed controversial views in this writings and on the \n     stand.\n       Silberman went on to say that for many nominees, landing a \n     judgeship might not be the best result. Referring to a recent \n     Supreme Court decision not to review a case brought by judges \n     seeking pay raises, Silberman said that anyone who is not \n     already wealthy ``faces an immediate decline in his or her \n     real income'' if seated on the federal bench.\n       ``The first prize is not to get a hearing,'' he noted. \n     ``The second prize is to get a hearing and not to be \n     confirmed. The third prize is to get confirmed.''\n       Other panelists at the Federalist Society's discussion on \n     judicial independence were Sen. Joy Kyl (R-Ariz.), former \n     presidential counsel Fred Fielding of Wiley Rein & Fielding, \n     and moderator Stuart Taylor Jr. of National Journal.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. This advice is consistent with Canon 5A(3)(d) of the ABA's \nModel Code of Judicial Conduct, which states that prospective judges:\n\n     shall not . . . make pledges or promises of conduct in office \n     other than the faithful and impartial performance of the \n     duties of office . . . [or] make statements that commit or \n     appear to commit the candidate with respect to cases, \n     controversies or issues that are likely to come before the \n     court.\n\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall made the same point in 1967, when he \nrefused to answer questions about the Fifth Amendment during his \nconfirmation hearing for the Supreme Court. He said:\n\n       I do not think you want me to be in the position of giving \n     you a statement on the fifth amendment, and then, if I am \n     confirmed and sit on the Court, when a fifth amendment case \n     come up, I will have to disqualify myself.\n  Mr. President, my remarks make it very clear that they were \ncontroversial nominees and these arguments are not worth the time they \nhave taken to make them. I think it is time to quit making the very \nsame type arguments and start talking about the truth.\n  The truth is, we have a filibuster on our hands. One of the \nDemocratic Senators even said on network TV 2 weeks ago they are not \nfilibustering. Well, now we know they are. So let's let everybody in \nthe country know that a double standard is being applied to Miguel \nEstrada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3074-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3074-S3076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 71.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have no objection to the Senator, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, using his 5 minutes any way he \nwants. I will reserve the 5 minutes for Senator Leahy and the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Alaska \nis in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this resolution, which resolves that the \nSenate strongly----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator permit the clerk to report \nthe resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 71) expressing support for the Pledge \n     of Allegiance.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I support what I am confident the Senate's \nposition will be, to strongly disapprove the decision of the panel of \nthe Ninth Circuit in the Newdow case and the decision of the full court \nnot to consider this case en banc.\n  The reason I wanted the floor for a few minutes this afternoon is \nthere have been statements made today by the majority that the whole \nproblem with the Pledge of Allegiance case has been caused by \nDemocratic appointees. There could not be anything further from the \ntruth.\n  The original Ninth Circuit panel opinion holding that the Pledge of \nAllegiance violated the first amendment was authored by a person who \nwas appointed by a Republican President. Several Ninth Circuit judges, \nnominated by Republican Presidents, such as Judges Trott, Rymer, and \nNelson, did not join in the dissent that criticized the original \npetition. Before the Ninth Circuit, they were holding a hearing to \ndetermine if they would rehear this. That would have been something \nthat would support the position we are taking here on the Senate floor \ntoday.\n  Now, Mr. President, listen to this. The majority of the judges who we \nknow voted to rehear the case en banc--and the only reason we are able \nto determine this is because of dissenting opinions filed, because the \nhearing was, in effect, off the record--were, in fact, Clinton \nappointees. Six out of nine dissenting judges were Clinton nominees.\n  So, Mr. President, simple arithmetic says there were 24 active \nsitting judges who were allowed to vote on this rehearing. If we had \nseven of the Republican nominees, there would have been a majority, and \nthere would have been a rehearing. I repeat, if we had seven judges, \nwho were appointed by Republicans, together with the six judges who \nwere appointed by President Clinton, there would have been a rehearing.\n  So let's decide this matter, not on what we do not know but what the \nfacts are. Six of the nine dissenting judges were Clinton nominees. \nThese six judges, appointed by Clinton, either authored or joined \ndissenting opinions that advocated for a rehearing of the Newdow case \nby an en banc panel.\n  So, Mr. President, I disagree with what the Ninth Circuit did, but \nlet's not blame it on judges appointed by Democratic Presidents. In \nfact, the reverse is true.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 249\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have a technical amendment at the \ndesk to S. Res. 71. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order at this \ntime, and I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 249:\n       On page 3, line 7 of the resolution strike ``again'' and \n     insert ``either''\n       On page 3, line 9 of the resolution strike ``and, if unable \n     to intervene,'' and insert ``or''\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 249) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list \nof 43 cosponsors be added to my resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think all of us can agree that last \nweek's decision by the full Ninth Circuit refusing to review an earlier \ndecision that bars children in public schools from voluntarily reciting \nthe Pledge of Allegiance was fundamentally wrong.\n  Unfortunately, citizens in the States who are within the Ninth \nCircuit's jurisdiction have had to contend for decades with the court's \ndysfunctional jurisprudence. The pledge decision highlights how out of \ntouch this court is from common sense and constitutional values. We who \nlive within the court's jurisdiction know that the judges on this court \ntoo often ignore the law and the Constitution and, instead, seek to \nsubstitute their values for constitutional values.\n  I think Judge O'Scannlain, writing for six judges in dissent, said it \nbest. He called the panel decision:\n\n       wrong, very wrong--wrong because reciting the Pledge of \n     Allegiance is simply not a ``religious act'' as the two-judge \n     majority asserts, wrong as a matter of Supreme Court \n     precedent properly understood, wrong because it set up a \n     direct conflict with the law of another circuit, and wrong as \n     a matter of common sense.\n\n  The judge went on to say: ``If reciting the pledge is truly `a \nreligious act' in violation of the Establishment Clause, then so is the \nrecitation of the Constitution itself, the Declaration of Independence, \nthe Gettysburg Address, the National Motto or the singing of the \nNational Anthem,'' a verse of which says: ``And this our motto: In God \nis our trust.''\n  I have no doubt that the Supreme Court will hear the appeal of this \ncase. And if one considers that the Ninth Circuit is the court with the \nhighest reversal rate in the country, I expect the Court will summarily \noverturn this ill-conceived decision.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the resolution.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska for her work in this regard and for getting so many cosponsors \nin such a short period of time.\n  A panel in the Ninth Circuit declared the Pledge of Allegiance to be \nunconstitutional. This is so, two of the three judges decided, because \nit contains the words ``under God.'' It did not matter to the judges \nthat these two words endorse no particular religion or denote any \nspecific being. Nor did it matter to the majority that no student is \nrequired to recite these words--much less any other portion of the \nPledge of Allegiance. And worse yet, the majority completely failed to \nexplain how its remarkable ruling could be squared with out \ngovernment's long-established reference to God in other areas.\n  The United States Supreme Court begins each session with the phrase: \n``God save the United States of America and this Honorable Court.'' \n``God Bless America'' is routinely sung at many Government functions. \nAnd this body not only elects a Chaplin, but also has begun every \nsession for 207 years with a prayer.\n  This activist ruling is--as so many of the Ninth Circuit's rulings \nhave been--bad law. It is flatly inconsistent with a unanimous, decade-\nold ruling of the Seventh Circuit, where the court held that ``schools \nmay lead the Pledge of Allegiance daily, so long as pupils are free not \nto participate.'' The Ninth Circuit disagreed, citing the supposed \n``coercive effect'' on a child from being required to listen every day \nin school to the phrase ``one nation under God.'' And from this \npurported coercion, the Ninth Circuit went on to divine \nunconstitutionality. This is truly a remarkable feat of judicial \nactivism.\n  This country was founded on religious freedom by founders, many of \nwhom were deeply religious. For this reason, the first amendment does \nnot prohibit religion, but an ``establishment'' of religion. In fact, \nit also plainly guarantees to each American the freedom of religion and \nthe free exercise of religion. As every court prior the Ninth Circuit's \ndecision has recognized, the mere reference to a higher being does not \namount to a religious act or a formal religious observance.\n  The Ninth Circuit is the biggest and most ungainly federal circuit \ncourt of appeals. It is also a court that is seriously out of balance, \nwith 17 of its 24 active judges appointed by Democratic Presidents. The \nNinth Circuit is also the most reversed circuit court of appeals in the \nnation--by a wide margin. I would like to say that rulings like Newdow \nrepresent an anomaly, but I can't do that because there have been so \nmany other recent rulings in the Ninth Circuit that were unanimously \nreversed by the Supreme Court.\n  I fully expect the Supreme Court to review this decision and, yet \nagain, reverse the Ninth Circuit and set this ludicrous ruling right. \nWhile we wait for that to happen, however, millions of students in the \nNinth Circuit will be prevented from pledging allegiance to our flag \nand our Nation. It is truly regrettable that they will be prevented \nfrom doing so at a time when our Nation is under attack by terrorists \nand when we particularly need everyone to come together and support our \nPresident and our troops all over the world.\n  It is about time we let the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals know, as \nthe most reversed court in the country, that they really ought to think \ntwice before they do something like this. Just think about it. The \nConstitution does not prohibit religion; it prohibits the establishment \nof religion. In fact, it plainly guarantees to each American the \nfreedom of religion and the free exercise of religion.\n  As every court prior to the Ninth Circuit decision has recognized, \nthe mere reference to a Higher Being does not amount to a religious act \nor a formal religious observance. The Ninth Circuit is the largest and \nmost ungainly Federal circuit court of appeals.\n  It is also a court that is seriously out of balance, with 17 out of \nits 24 active judges appointed by Democratic Presidents. Thirteen of \nthose 17 were appointed by President Clinton. And the Ninth Circuit is \nalso the most reversed circuit court of appeals in the Nation--by a \nwide margin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time controlled by the Senator from Utah has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say, this is a very important resolution. It \nshows how important it is to have good judges on the bench rather than \nactivists. This decision was made by activists.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the resolution, S. Res. 71, as \namended.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, today marks the 166th birthday of the city \nof Chicago, and it would have been the 96th birthday of a great Chicago \nlegend, Eleanor ``Sis'' Daley. I would like to talk about each briefly.\n  On March 4, 1837, Chicago was incorporated as a city with a \npopulation of 4,170 by the Illinois State Legislature. Today, Chicago \nis one of our Nation's largest and most vibrant cities, with 2.9 \nmillion residents, and it remains a vital center of business, finance, \neducation, the arts, sports, and tourism.\n  Chicago's early history is a great American story of a great city, \nfrom Father Marquette to du Sable, a Haitian immigrant, in the 17th and \n18th centuries, to Fort Dearborn, Northwestern University, Abraham \nLincoln's Presidential nomination, the Chicago fire, and the World's \nColumbian Exposition in the 19th century.\n  In fact, ``City of The Century,'' a book and a documentary, detailed \nthis city's humble beginnings and chronicled the development of the \n``city that works.'' Chicago's modern history is synonymous with one \nfamily, the Daley family. Mayor Richard J. Daley was elected a record \nsix consecutive terms and served 21 years in city hall. His son, \nRichard M. Daley, was reelected Chicago mayor last week and will \nshortly begin his 15th year in office. A Daley has been mayor of \nChicago for 34 of the past 50 years.\n  The family glue was well-known to be Eleanor ``Sis'' Daley, the \ncurrent mayor's mother and the wife of the former mayor for over 40 \nyears. Today would have marked Sis Daley's 96th birthday. She shared a \nbirthday with the city of Chicago. Sadly, Sis Daley passed away in her \nBridgeport home on February 16, leaving behind 6 surviving children--\nMayor Richard M. Daley, former U.S. Commerce Department Secretary Bill \nDaley, Cook County Commissioner John Daley, and Michael, Patricia, and \nMary Carol; in addition, 20 grandchildren, including John Daley, a \nmember of my Governmental Affairs Committee staff; a number of great \ngrandchildren, and many admirers.\n  Much has been said and written about Sis Daley in recent weeks, a \ndevoted mother, a loyal fan of the Chicago White Sox. She was really \ndevoted to her family more than anything. She raised all seven kids in \nwhat was originally a bungalow in Bridgeport, a section of Chicago \nwhich was built by her and her husband in 1939. During her husband's \nfirst election night victory in 1955, the mayor-elect and his wife Sis \nabruptly ended the celebration party, packed up the kids, and headed \nhome at 10:15 and said, it is bedtime at the Daley home.\n  Sis Daley was not afraid to speak her mind when it was necessary. \nWhen an unflattering book about her husband appeared in a local grocery \nstore in 1971, she was offended and she asked the store manager to \nremove it, after she turned around the book so people could not read \nthe cover. He and the entire chain removed it, but not before it became \na national story, bringing a lot more money to the author, but Sis \nDaley had stood up for her family, as she did every single day.\n  In 1972, she very publicly appealed for the restoration of the main \nChicago library building, an 83-year-old structure targeted for \ndemolition by the mayor, her husband. The building was saved, and today \nit serves as the Chicago Cultural Center. She greeted queens and \npresidents, politicians and stars, never forgetting where she came \nfrom.\n  The last time I saw her was with her son Bill Daley, at a little \ngathering for Hillary Clinton in the city of Chicago. It was great to \nsee that warm Irish smile on her face. In turn, Eleanor ``Sis'' Daley \nwill never be forgotten in Chicago and in the hearts and minds of her \nfamily and those who knew her. It is fitting that the city of Chicago \nshares its birthday with Sis Daley.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I draw the attention of my colleagues \nto an event that happened yesterday which was very impressive--catching \na key terrorist in Pakistan. It was the front page top story in \nvirtually all of our newspapers around the country, probably around the \nworld, with his picture. This is a person we have sought for some \nperiod of time. This was a big catch.\n  I do not want to focus on the individual. What I want to focus on is \nthe cooperation we received from Pakistan and from the Pakistani \nauthorities in making this possible. This capture could lead us to many \nmore terrorists in the al-Qaida network who plague us, and it is very \nimportant for us.\n  I particularly want to thank the Pakistani authorities, the Pakistani \nGovernment, President Musharraf, and others who helped in this \ncooperation to get this done.\n  President Musharraf and his government, in facing a population in \nPakistan that is frequently not pro United States, has worked very \nclosely and very carefully with us in dealing with terrorists and now \nhas yielded one of the largest, if not the largest, terrorist captures \nwe have had in recent times, if not in recent memory altogether. That \nis something we should take note of, and we should be appreciative of \nthose who have cooperated with us. Not all governments around the world \ncooperate with the United States. Not all are in as difficult a \nsituation as Pakistan is where a substantial portion of the population \ndoes not want their government to be working with the United States, \nand yet we had the two come together taking on the issue of terrorism, \neven though it is difficult in their own country to do it, and we \nnetted a major terrorist capture. We still want and we are still \nlooking for, if he is alive, which he apparently probably is, Osama bin \nLaden, but second to him, this is probably the largest capture we could \nask to have taken place.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. I do say thank you to \nthe Government of Pakistan for its help in this capture of a major \noperative in the war on terrorism.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I want to announce a very exciting \nevent taking place this evening in my hometown of Aberdeen.\n  Tonight, in conjunction with the 2003 Women in Space Conference, \nNorthern State University will host NASA astronaut, Dr. Karen Nyberg. \nOriginally from neighboring Minnesota, Dr. Nyberg received her \nundergraduate degree at the University of North Dakota and her \ndoctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of Texas. After \nfinishing her education she worked for NASA, where she was granted a \npatent for work done on a robot assembly. Dr. Nyberg also worked \nextensively on improving the internal thermal control system of the \nspace suits used by the astronauts. In July of 2000, she was selected \nin to the astronaut program, and she is awaiting an assignment on a \nfuture space flight as a mission specialist.\n  The tragic loss of the Columbia space shuttle on February 1 \ndemonstrated to all Americans the dangers inherent to space \nexploration. However, the exciting opportunities space exploration \npresents require us to push forward, take risks and broaden our \nhorizons by emulating the courage and fortitude demonstrated by the \ncrew of the Columbia. As the President stated in his address to the \nnation, ``Mankind is led into the darkness beyond our world by the \ninspiration of discovery and the longing to understand. Our journey \ninto space will go on.''\n  Thank you, Dr. Nyberg, for taking the time to visit Aberdeen and \nshare your experiences and knowledge. To all the attendees and \norganizers, I wish you the best and congratulate you on what I am sure \nwill be a successful and inspiring conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3077-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3077-S3079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A KOREAN GOVERNMENT BAILOUT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today as a longstanding proponent \nof free international trade. I am confident that if given the chance, \nU.S. companies that operate in the global market-place will set the \nstandard by which all international business will be conducted. This \nfact has been proven over-and-over again. Many great American owned \ncompanies are conducting business all over the world. I am a strong \nbeliever that these U.S. companies that operate in the global \nmarketplace have a direct and positive impact world wide on consumers \nby allowing them competitive pricing and variety of choices in an \nincreasingly discerning global market.\n  This benefit to society, however, is only as good as the business \npractices employed by foreign-owned companies. U.S. companies must \noperate in a competitive market that requires them to continue to \ninnovate, cut costs, and effectively market their products. This is not \nalways the case in certain industries in some foreign markets. In \nparticular, I'd like to point out an important problem facing one of \nthe largest employers in my State of Utah. Micron Technologies, the \nlargest U.S. producer of D-RAM semiconductors, long has been plagued \nwith unfair competition from its principal Korean competitor, Hynix, a \ncompany that has time and time again employed illegal government \nfinanced bail-out schemes to keep them in business.\n  This is not the first time that Micron has faced difficulties due to \nunfair trade practices. In the mid-1980s, Micron almost went out of \nbusiness because of dumping by Japanese companies. Several of us in the \nSenate worked successfully to help put a stop to the illegal dumping. \nUltimately, the Department of Commerce imposed duties that offset this \ndumping and Micron was not only able to survive, but eventually to \nbecome the second largest producer of semiconductors in the world \ntoday.\n  Micron has a very large facility in Lehi, Utah, that has employed \nover 500 of Utah's skilled laborers. This facility has the capacity of \nemploying well over 5,000 people--a feat that will never be realized if \nthe Korean Government is allowed to continue to subsidize Hynix.\n  It is important to point out that, just last December, Hynix received \nyet another direct financial bailout from the government of Korea. This \npractice must simply not be allowed to continue. Companies that operate \nin the global marketplace must be assured that they will be able to \ncompete on a level playing field--and not against government-subsidized \ncompanies that may produce a substandard product, but are allowed to \ncontinue their operations because of an artificial infusion of \noperating capital. These illegal subsidies are costing the U.S. jobs \nand are weakening our technology base.\n  Let's examine the underlying facts about the trade distorting \npractices that Micron faces when competing in the world market.\n  Since October 2000, the government of Korea, acting through the banks \nthat it owns and controls, has provided an astounding $16 billion in \nsubsidies to Hynix, a Korean producer of D-RAM semiconductors and the \nprincipal global competitor to Micron Technologies.\n  Hynix is a company with massive debts resulting from the easy lending \npractices of Korean banks during the late 1990s. With these \npreferential loans, Hynix built substantial new capacity and became the \nthird largest D-RAM producer in the world.\n  Starting in late 2000, Hynix became unable to repay the principal and \ninterest on these loans and bonds. Rather than letting Hynix undergo \nformal bankruptcy, which would have resulted in substantial asset sales \nand restructuring, the Government of Korea orchestrated no less than \nfive separate bailouts.\n  These subsidies have permitted Hynix to stay in business and that\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\ncompany continues to run all its D-RAM labs full out, flooding the \nmarket with subsidized products. Despite all these subsidies, Hynix \ncontinues to lose money--by all accounts, roughly $8 billion over the \npast three years.\n  And yet, the Korean government continues to pour money into this \ncompany. Just two month ago, there was another bailout amounting to \n$4.1 billion. This is almost twice Hynix's revenues in all of 2002, \nwhich only amounted to $2.4 billion.\n  The Korean government must not be allowed to continue to underwrite \nthe horrendous operating losses of this company as it has done for the \npast three years.\n  In the highly competitive D-RAM market, subsidies of this sort act as \na trade distorting measure. Every other D-RAM company in the world is \nbeing crippled by the subsidized D-RAM that Hynix floods the market \nwith. This has resulted in the worst and longest downturn the D-RAM \nsector has ever experienced.\n  Just last week, Micron announced that it was laying off ten percent \nof its worldwide workforce. This translates into 1,800 lost jobs in the \nUnited States. Hynix subsidies have had a real impact on Micron's \nbottom line as well--the subsidies have impacted pricing to such an \nextent that even Micron, one of the most efficient D-RAM producers in \nthe world, has lost two billion dollars over the past two years. We \ncannot afford to see an important technology like D-RAMs lost in the \nUnited States, because of foreign government subsidies.\n  These sorts of subsidies have absolutely no place in today's global \neconomy, particularly as we are engaged in a new round of trade talks \naimed at further liberalizing trade regimes around the world.\n  All indications are that Hynix will use the debt forgiveness to \ncontinue to expand capacity. Just last week, Hynix announced that it \nwould begin work on a new fabrication line to produce D-RAMs on state-\nof-the-art 300 mm wafers, which will result in even more subsidized D-\nRAM from Hynix. Now, we read in the papers that Hynix and other Hyundai \ncompanies are being investigated for illegally transferring about $500 \nmillion to North Korea in 2000, in return for lucrative contracts, and \nit did so with the help of South Korean banks and with the approval of \nthe President of South Korea. This is the country that plans to \nreactivate its nuclear arms program.\n  In closing, I feel it incumbent upon me to point out that many \nMembers of the United States Senate are paying close attention to the \nKorean Government's business practices as they relate to Hynix. Korea \nis one of the most developed economies in Asia and is a good friend to \nthe United States in a wide variety of ways. But the government of \nKorea must realize that this type of illegal subsidy runs contrary to \nall the rules in the WTO and is not permitted under U.S. trade law. I \ncall upon the Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative \nto help put an end to these illegal acts.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I want to speak briefly on the clear \nviolation of Judiciary Committee rules that occurred last week in our \nexecutive business meeting. It was a sad moment for our committee and \ndoes not bode well for the harmonious functioning of the committee this \nyear. I believe that a discussion of this issue is also relevant to our \ndebate of Miguel Estrada. In both cases we are talking about rules that \nprotect the rights of the minority in this body from being run over by \nthe majority. And in both cases we are talking about the use of those \nprotections by the minority not to stonewall or block action by the \nmajority indefinitely but to seek information about nominees that has \nnot been forthcoming.\n  Let me quickly review the background of what happened last Thursday. \nAll of this goes back, of course, to our duty under Article II, Section \n2 of the Constitution, which specifically provides that the President \nshall appoint judges to our courts ``by and with the Advice and Consent \nof the Senate.'' The Senate's role is not just a matter of historical \ntradition, or comity with the Executive Branch, it is constitutionally \nmandated. All of us on the Judiciary Committee, and in the full Senate \ntake this responsibility very seriously.\n  One of the ways that we exercise our constitutional responsibilities \nin this area, on behalf of the Senate and our colleagues who are not on \nthe committee, is to closely examine the records of judicial nominees. \nWe do that in part by holding hearings so that nominees can be \nquestioned about their records, their judicial philosophy, their \nprevious writings, their judicial opinions if they are currently or \nhave been judges on other courts, and their views on legal issues. \nThese hearings are not a mere formality, they are crucial to the role \nof the Judiciary Committee in carrying out the Senate's \nconstitutionally mandated responsibilities.\n  This year, it appears that there is an effort underway to push \nthrough nominations in the shortest possible time. Prior to the \nPresident's Day recess, the committee held three nominations hearings \nin three weeks. By February 12, the committee had held hearings on five \ncircuit court nominees. This is an extraordinary pace, particularly \nwhen you consider that the earliest that the committee had held \nhearings on five circuit court court nominees during President \nClinton's term was April 29. In some years, that milestone wasn't \npassed until June, July, or even September, and in 1996, the committee \nnever held a hearing on a 5th nominee to the circuit courts.\n  So this effort really gives the impression of a forced march. Our \nconstitutional responsibilities are being subjugated to a schedule that \nseems to be aimed at forcing nominations through as quickly as \npossible, without regard to the Senate's prerogatives.\n  The Democrats on the committee have not tried to block all of the \nnominees. We voted on Miguel Estrada, and Jeffrey Sutton, and Jay Bybee \nin the ordinary course of business on the committee. But when it came \nto two other nominees, Justice Deborah Cook, a nominee for the Sixth \nCircuit and John Roberts, nominated to the D.C. Circuit, we tried to \ndraw a line.\n  The reason we made that effort was that Justice Cook and Mr. Roberts \nwere both considered in a single hearing on January 29th, along with \nJeffrey Sutton, who was reported to the floor just prior to the recess. \nActually, it is misleading to say they were considered in that hearing. \nThey were all sitting at the witness table, but the vast majority of \nthe questioning was directed to Mr. Sutton. There simply was not \nsufficient time for members of this committee to examine the other \nnominees.\n  A number of Senators asked repeatedly that further hearings be \nscheduled so that Senators could examine Justice Cook and Mr. Roberts. \nWe even made the offer to have a single additional hearing for these \ntwo important nominees, even though we would prefer to examine a single \ncontroversial nominee at a time. We were rebuffed at every turn, even \nwhen it became abundantly clear that the single hearing would not \nsuffice to let members of this committee examine the records of all of \nthese nominees.\n  The single hearing that was held on January 29, 2003, on these three \nnominees was unprecedented. Never before has the committee held one \nhearing on three circuit court nominations over the objections of the \nminority. Indeed, it is highly unusual for the committee to hold a \nsingle hearing on even two controversial nominees, as a 1985 agreement \namong Senators Dole, Byrd, Thurmond, and Biden demonstrates. That \nagreement was that only one controversial nomination would be \nconsidered at a time. It gave the minority some control over the pace \nof nominations, without of course giving it any kind of veto.\n  A number of Democrats on the committee raised the need for an \nadditional hearing on Justice Cook and Mr. Roberts publicly during the \nhearing and privately during the breaks. We have repeated that request \nto the chairman of the committee on many occasions subsequently.\n  Early last week, when it become clear that the chairman would not \nschedule a second hearing so that Justice Cook and Mr. Roberts could \nreceive proper consideration by the committee, we tried another \napproach. The nominees had said they are available to meet with us to \nanswer any questions we have. So we sent a letter to the White House \nand requested that the two nominees make themselves available for a \nmeeting to answer further\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\nquestions. In order to be able to proceed quickly in the committee \nfollowing such a meeting, we suggested a joint meeting that Senators \ncould attend at different times based on their individual schedules. We \nstated that we would have a transcript of the meeting prepared so that \nwe could refer back to the nominees' answers, and that the meeting \nwould be open to the public.\n\n  The response from the White House, which has repeatedly offered to \nhave nominees meet with us privately was an immediate ``No.'' The \nimmediate and unqualified refusal to our reasonable request seem to be \npart of the forced march. The Administration seems to be saying, ``We \nare to going to jam these nominees through, our way, regardless of how \nreasonable your request is.''\n  So that left us with only one option: To delay the vote on these two \nnominees until agreement could be reached on a further hearing, or some \nsubstitute for it. Some Senators on the Democratic side were simply not \nprepared to vote on Justice Cook or Mr. Roberts. We did not believe the \ncommittee has been given adequate opportunity to assess the \nqualifications and examine the record of Justice Cook and Mr. Roberts.\n  So when the chairman of the committee asked for a vote on Justice \nCook, we objected. The proper course under our committee's longstanding \nRule IV was for the chairman to hold a vote on a motion to end debate \non the matter. The Rule provides that debate will be ended if that \nmotion carries by a majority vote, including one member of the \nminority. In this case, our side was united in opposing ending the \ndebate, so the motion would have failed. It is, in effect, as the \nchairman of the committee himself recognized in 1997 when the Rule was \ninvoked in connection with the Bill Lann Lee nomination, a kind of \nfilibuster rule in the committee. The vote to end debate is like a \ncloture vote, and it cannot succeed unless at least one member of the \nminority votes for it.\n  Now I have heard the argument, made by the chairman of the committee \nin a letter to the Democratic leader, that this rule was designed to \nallow a majority of the committee to force a so-called ``rogue \nchairman'' to hold a vote on a matter when he doesn't want to, but not \nto limit the chairman's ability to call for a vote over the objections \nof the minority. That is clearly an erroneous interpretation. It \nconflicts with text of the rule, the practice of the committee for 24 \nyears under five separate chairmen, including the current chairman, and \nwith the history of the rule itself.\n  The rule was adopted in 1979 when Senator Kennedy chaired the \ncommittee. The committee at that time had 10 Democrats and 7 \nRepublicans. Until that time there was no way to end debate in the \ncommittee. Recent years had seen controversial matters such as the \nEqual Rights Amendment stalled in committee. The Civil Rights era had \nseen the committee headed by a segregationist chairman block civil \nrights legislation by allowing it to be filibustered and never voted \non. Chairman Kennedy sought a new committee rule to allow him to bring \na matter to a vote. His original proposal was simply to let a majority \nvote of the committee end debate. On January 24, 1979, he proposed such \na committee rule.\n\n  Republicans on the committee, including Senator Thurmond who was the \nranking member, and Senators Simpson, Dole, Cochran, and Hatch, spoke \nup to protest that the minority should retain the right to debate a \nmatter for as long as it felt it needed to. The next week, the \ncommittee reached agreement and adopted Rule IV, which has been in \neffect ever since. The compromise ended the ability of one or a few \nSenators to tie up the committee indefinitely. But it gave the majority \nthe power to end debate if it could convince one member of the minority \nto agree. That was the compromise reached, and that is the rule we have \nhad for over two decades.\n  The chairman's argument that the rule places no limit on his ability \nto end debate is clearly answered by this history. It is clearly wrong. \nThe committee rule was violated when Justice Cook and Mr. Roberts were \nreported over the objection of some members without a ``cloture vote'' \nin the committee. There is simply no question about this.\n  It is very disappointing to have to discuss and debate committee \nrules on the floor of this body. This might seem like a petty matter. \nBut it isn't. Honoring the rules of the Senate and the rules of the \ncommittees gives credibility and legitimacy to the work we do here. \nRules are the hallmark of a democracy. In many ways our rules are \nanalogous to the rule of law in our society. We have to respect those \nrules or we have nothing left.\n  In situations like these, I often think of the words of the great \nphilosopher Sir Thomas More as portrayed in the play ``A Man for All \nSeasons.'' More questions a man named Roper whether he would level the \nforest of English laws to punish the Devil. ``What would you do?'' More \nasks, ``Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?'' \nRoper affirms, ``I'd cut down every law in England to do that.'' To \nwhich More replies:\n\n       And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round \n     on you--where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? \n     This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast . \n     . . and if you cut them down . . . d'you really think you \n     could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, \n     I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.\n\n  It is clear from the history of Rule IV that it was insisted on by \nRepublican Senators then in the minority to preserve their rights in \ncommittee. They should not cut down that forest just to have their way \nnow that they are in the majority. We cannot permit that kind of \nresults-oriented approach to the rules of the committee or of this \nbody. The rules of this body, like the laws of this country, protect \nall of us. We must stand up to efforts to ignore them. What happened in \nthe committee last week did not reflect well on this body. I sincerely \nhope that the chairman will reconsider his rulings and return some \ncomity to our proceedings.\n  Let me just finally say that I voted Present on both Justice Cook and \nMr. Roberts. I have not made a final decision on their nominations. I \ncould very well support one or both of them here on the floor. But I \nthink the committee must hold a proper hearing on them, giving all \nSenators a better opportunity to be well informed on these nominees \nbefore exercising their constitutional responsibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3079-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3079-S3080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise today to discuss an issue that \nhas arisen out of a technical problem in the farm bill Congress passed \nlast year.\n  Section 10806(b) of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002 amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act by placing \nlimitations on the use of the term ``ginseng'' as the common or usual \nname for plants classified within the genus Panax. The purpose of this \nprovision was to address confusion that had arisen from products \nderived from different plants being labeled as ``Siberian ginseng'', \nand the like.\n  However, I must note that the use of the term ``ginseng'' for plants \nclassified in a genus other than Panax was not illegal under Federal \nlabeling laws in place prior to the passage of the Farm Security and \nRural Investment Act of 2002. In these types of situations where a \nlabeling change is proposed, the Food and Drug Administration \nrecognizes that, in order to assure an orderly and economical industry \nadjustment to new labeling requirements, a sufficient lead time is \nnecessary to permit planning for the use of existing label inventories \nand the development of new labeling materials.\n  Unfortunately, the ginseng provision Congress included in the farm \nbill lacked a specific effective date that would have allowed FDA's \ntypical transition period to occur. As one of the lead authors of the \nfarm bill, and as chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee at the \ntime, I want to be clear this was simply an oversight on the part of \nthe Senate and House in writing that portion of the farm bill that \nneeds to be corrected as soon as possible.\n  I proposed to correct this omission in the Omnibus Appropriations \nbill for FY 2003, PL 108-7, and supply an effective date of May 13, \n2003 for Section 10806(b) Ginseng Labeling of the Farm Security and \nRural Investment Act of 2002. Unfortunately, in the rush to complete \nwork on that bill, the provision was left out even though no one had \nany objections to it.\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\n  Because it is important to address this as soon as possible, I want \nmy colleagues to know that I plan to offer my amendment to supply an \neffective date for the ginseng provision again, either on the \nsupplemental legislation we are likely to receive soon or other \nlegislation moving on the floor of the Senate. It is my hope we can \nmore quickly to correct this oversight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3080-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE HEINZ AWARDS 2003\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, after the sudden and untimely death of \nour colleague--and my friend--Senator John Heinz, in 1991, his wife, \nTeresa Heinz, set about devising a suitable and characteristic memorial \nto his memory. As she has said, such a task is especially difficult \nwhen the goal is to honor someone as complex and multi-faceted as \nSenator Heinz was. She realized that no static monument or self-serving \nexercise in sentimentality would do, and that the only tribute \nbefitting Senator Heinz would be one that celebrated his spirit by \nhonoring those who live and work in the same ways he did.\n  Those of us who had the privilege of knowing Senator Heinz remember, \nwith respect and affection, his tremendous energy and intellectual \ncuriosity; his commitment to improving the lives of people; and his \nimpatience with procedural roadblocks when they stood in the way of \nnecessary progress. For Senator Heinz, excellence was not enough; \nexcellence was taken as a given. What made the difference was the \npractical--and, yes, pragmatic--application of excellence to the goal \nof making America a better nation and the world a better place. \nAlthough John Heinz thought and worked on a grand scale, he understood \nthat progress is more often made in small increments: one policy, one \nprogram, even one person, at a time. We also remember the contagious \nenthusiasm and palpable joy with which he pursued his goals and lived \nhis life.\n  Teresa Heinz created the Heinz Awards to celebrate and carry on these \nqualities and characteristics--five awards in each of five categories \nin which John was especially interested and active during his \nlegislative and public career: Arts and Humanities; the Environment; \nthe Human Condition; Public Policy; and Technology and the Economy. In \neach of these areas, the Heinz Awards recognize outstanding \nachievements. In fact, the annual Heinz Awards are among the largest \nindividual achievement prizes in the world.\n  The six men and women who are being honored with this year's Heinz \nAwards--the ninth annual Awards--have just been named and were honored \nlast night. They are a distinguished and accomplished group of men and \nwomen whose lives and work have truly made a difference.\n  This year the Arts and Humanities Heinz Award is being presented to \nDr. Bernice Johnson Reagon. Dr. Reagon's deep commitment to civil \nrights and song has led her down the path of activism, the arts, and \nacademics. Dr. Reagon's experiences in Albany, Georgia during times of \nsegregation led to her founding the women's vocal ensemble, Sweet Honey \nin the Rock, which is celebrating 30 years of struggle, action, and \ntriumph. As a curator at the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. Reagon has \nworked tirelessly to ensure that the tradition and story of African-\nAmericans in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries are not forgotten. In \naddition, Dr. Reagon spearheaded the museum's efforts to preserve the \noral history of the Civil Rights Movement culture and African-American \nsacred music and worship traditions.\n  This year the Heinz Award in the Environment is being shared by Dr. \nMario, J. Molina and Dr. John D. Spengler. Dr. Molina, an expert on \nozone depletion at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, shared \nthe 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on the effects of \nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and was one of the most vocal scientists \nthat led the charge to have CFCs banned in 1979. He is currently one of \nthe most influential and respected voices in environmental policy.\n  Dr. Spengler of Harvard University's School of Public Health is being \ncommended for his efforts in understanding the consequences of indoor \nand outdoor air pollution on public health. His findings that indoor \nair quality had a tremendous impact on overall health guided the focus \nof air quality standards toward a holistic approach, as opposed to a \nsingular focus on outdoor air pollution. As the vice chairman of a \nNational Research Committee that ultimately recommended the 1986 \nairliner smoking ban, Dr. Spengler solidified his reputation as an \nexpert in his field as well as a dedicated advocate for public health. \nDr. Spengler currently serves as an adviser to the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the World Health Organization.\n\n  Dr. Paul Farmer receives the Heinz Award for the Human Condition. As \na physician and medical anthropologist, Dr. Farmer, of Harvard Medical \nSchool, has unfailingly committed himself to the study of HIV and \ntuberculosis treatment around the world. Dr. Farmer has spent the \nbetter part of his career opening the world's eyes to the abject \ninequalities in public health as well as developing practical programs \nthat deliver life-saving services. His efforts in public health have \nled the World Health Organization to reconsider its position on \ntreating HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.\n  The Heinz Award for Public Policy is being awarded to Ms. Geraldine \nJensen of Toledo, Ohio. Ms. Jensen founded the Association for Children \nfor Enforcement of Support (ACES), the largest child support \nenforcement organization in the United States with over 50,000 members \nnationwide. After a divorce that left her and her children with very \nfew opportunities, Ms. Jensen rallied single parents experiencing the \nsame hardships to stand up for themselves and their children and demand \njustice. A committed advocate for children and families, Ms. Jensen's \nwork has resulted in the passage of three federal laws on child support \nand safeguards to ensure that fewer children will become victims of \npoverty.\n  Dr. Paul MacCready receives the Heinz Award for Technology, the \nEconomy and Employment. Named the ``Engineer of the Century'' in 1980 \nby the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Dr. MacCready invented \nand built the first flying machine powered solely by a human, the \nGossamer Condor. Dr. MacCready, however, did not stop there. He also \nhelped to create non-fossil fuel automobiles, the first solar powered \ncar, and the first viable mass-market electric car, among his many \nother inventions. A generation later, Dr. MacCready's ideas on the \nrelationship between advancing technology and preserving the earth's \nresources continue to impact the field of engineering and will not \ndoubt continue to do so for years to come.\n  I know that every Member of this body joins me in saluting Teresa \nHeinz for creating such an apt and appropriate way of honoring the \nmemory of our late colleague; and also in congratulating these \ndistinguished Americans, recipients of the ninth annual Heinz Awards, \nfor the way their lives and contributions have--and continue to--carry \non the spirit and the work of Senator John Heinz.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3080-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3080-S3081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2003\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today in honor and \nrecognition of Black History Month. Inspired by an Illinois native, Dr. \nCarter G. Woodson, the month of February allows Americans an \nopportunity to honor and celebrate the achievements African Americans \nhave made to our country.\n  Earning his bachelors and master's degrees from the University of \nChicago, Dr. Woodson feared that the history of African Americans was \nquickly fading into obscurity. Realizing that past contributions by \nAfrican Americans needed to be documented and taught, Dr. Woodson \ndevoted his time popularizing Black history amongst the masses. He \nconcluded, ``if a race had no recorded history, its achievements would \nbe forgotten and, in time, claimed by other groups.'' In 1915, Dr. \nWoodson founded the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and \nHistory, ASNLH, and in 1916 they released the first publication of the \nJournal of Negro History, a publication for which Dr. Woodson served as \neditor and director until his death in 1950.\n  In 1926, Dr. Woodson established Negro History Week, which expanded \nto Black History Month in 1976. Thanks to the efforts and achievements \nof Dr.\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\nWoodson and others, each year our Nation celebrates the history of \nAfrican Americans and the contributions they have made for the entire \nmonth of February.\n  I am proud to say my home State of Illinois is rich in African-\nAmerican History and I would like to share some of the great \naccomplishments African-American Illinoisans have made to our country. \nBeyond the well known Illinoisans like Miles Davis and James Cleveland \nwho transcended racial lines in the music industry, there exist lesser-\nknown Illinoisans who have made tremendous impacts on our society.\n  Take for example Dr. Mae C. Jemison, the first African-American woman \nin space. Raised in Chicago, Dr. Jemison graduated from Morgan Park \nHigh School in 1973. At age 16, she entered Stanford University on \nscholarship where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in \nchemical engineering, and fulfilled the requirements for an A.B. in \nAfrican and Afro-American Studies. On September 12, 1992, Dr. Jemison \nflew into space aboard the space shuttle Endeavor, becoming the first \nwoman of color to venture into space. Along with this tremendous \naccomplishment, Dr. Jemison has focused on improving the status, \nquality, and image of the scientist, specifically encouraging women and \nminorities to pursue careers in science. For example, she founded The \nJemison Group, Inc., to research, develop, and implement advanced \ntechnologies suited to the social, political, cultural, and economic \ncontext of the individual, especially for the developing world.\n  Along with Dr. Jemison, there are countless others in Illinois that \nhave had a tremendous impact on the lives of many Americans. One such \nexample is those affiliated with the Illinois Theater Center in \nChicago. In honor of Black History Month each February, the Illinois \nTheater Center produces an African-American play. This year is no \ndifferent, with the Theater presenting a play titled ``Master Harold \nand the Boys''. The drama is the work of South Africa's leading \nplaywright, and was recently chosen as ``One of the Most Significant \nPlays of the 20th Century'' by the National Royal Theater in London. \nSet in Port Elizabeth, South Africa in 1950, it depicts the coming-of-\nage of a white teenager and his relationship with the two black men who \nwork as waiters at his parents' restaurant.\n  Dr. Jemison, and those of the Illinois Theater Center continue to \ncarry on Dr. Woodson's goal of popularizing Black history. Black \nHistory Month allows others, like myself, to commend these remarkable \nindividuals on their tireless efforts and accomplishments. However, \nwhile we honor the great strides made by African Americans in \novercoming obstacles and color barriers, we must also look ahead and \nrecognize the great obstacles that still hinder African Americans \ntoday.\n  One such obstacle is the issue of HIV/AIDS. Although African \nAmericans make up about 12 percent of the U.S. population, they \naccounted for half of the new HIV cases reported in the United States \nin 2001. African Americans have accounted for nearly 315,000 of the \nmore than 816,000 AIDS cases reported since the beginning of the \nepidemic. By the end of December 2001, more than 168,000 African \nAmericans had died from AIDS. These astonishing statistics remind us \nthat the issue of HIV/AIDS infiltrates all borders and is not exclusive \nto developing nations.\n  Earlier this month the Center for Disease Control and Prevention \nnoted that the 25 States that track HIV cases reported an increase in \nnew diagnoses. As the number of HIV cases increase, prevention programs \nmust continue to develop in cities across the United States. One \nparticular prevention program, the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, works to \nreduce the risk of HIV among African Americans living in shelters and \nother transitional living facilities throughout the greater Chicago \narea. The program trains shelter staff and volunteers to be HIV and STD \nprevention peer educators and provides personalized HIV counseling, \ntesting and referral services to those at risk for HIV. Programs like \nthese will help fight this terrible epidemic.\n  To fulfill the dreams of visionaries like Dr. Woodson and Dr. \nJemison, progress must be made in breaking down barriers that continue \nto hinder African Americans. All of these great Illinoisans, and the \ncountless others, struggled against violence and bigotry, but each \nmanaged to demonstrate through their distinctive talents that racism \nand bigotry are un-American. I urge all Americans to learn more about \nthe history of African Americans in this country, and acknowledge the \ncontributions of African Americans to our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3081-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3081-S3082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SALUTE TO BLACKSMITH PHILIP SIMMONS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I am inserting an article from \na recent Post and Courier about one of my home State's legendary \nblacksmiths, Philip Simmons. He is a 90-year-old retiree, who was told \n70 years ago that the car would kill the market for blacksmiths. Yet, \nto this day, he still passes his knowledge of the art on to young \npeople, and I think we can all be inspired by his enthusiasm for an old \nAmerican art that he won't let be lost.\n  The citizens of my state have the opportunity to see and enjoy Mr. \nSimmons' work all over Charleston. In 1975, he forged a piece for the \nSmithsonian that all Americans can take delight in. As he continues to \nstay active and show his work, I hope my colleagues in the Senate join \nthis admirer of a great American in wishing him health and happiness in \nthe years to come.\n  I ask to print the article in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Post and Courier, Feb. 19, 2003]\n\n                            Inspires Others\n\n                           (By Penny Parker)\n\n       Master blacksmith Philip Simmons hasn't slowed down much \n     since turning 90 last June. He still takes any chance he gets \n     to pass on his enthusiasm for ornamental iron working to \n     future generations.\n       As special guest of the Charleston Trident Home Builders \n     Association, he will be doing just that at this year's \n     Lowcountry Home and Garden Show at the Charleston Area \n     Convention Center. Simmons will be at the show from 10 a.m. \n     to noon on Saturday and from 2 to 4 p.m. on Sunday.\n       Simmons and students from the School of the Building Arts \n     (SoBA) will be on hand at the Home and Garden Show to offer \n     insight into the building arts of the past, and the \n     importance of passing on this knowledge to future \n     generations. Simmons will answer questions and sign copies of \n     his books and posters, which will be on sale during the show. \n     Plant hangers with his named inscribed on them and jewelry \n     made from his designs will be available as well. New items \n     this year include Christmas ornaments, wrapping paper and a \n     2003 calendar also features ``Good Friday'' by Jonathan Green \n     on the cover.\n       Proceeds from the sales of these items go towards the \n     Philip Simmons Foundation and its effort to build the Philip \n     Simmons Blacksmith Museum at the Camden Towers Cultural Arts \n     Center, which is set to be completed in 2004.\n       Simmons was born on Daniel Island on June 9, 1912, and \n     moved to the Charleston peninsula when he was 8 years old. He \n     became an apprentice for blacksmith Peter Simmons (no \n     relation) at the age of 13. he started out shoeing horses and \n     repairing and making wagon wheels in Peter Simmons' shop on \n     Calhoun Street. Once cars became the more popular mode of \n     transportation, he switched to making trailers, but big \n     businesses such as Sears soon put an end to that venture.\n       In 1938, he switched to ornamental iron work when a client \n     commissioned him to make a gate from a set of plans. The rest \n     is history.\n       Over the years, he as fashioned more than 500 decorative \n     pieces of ornamental wrought iron gates, fences, balconies \n     and window grills. His work can be seen throughout \n     Charleston, in Columbia and even at the Smithsonian Institute \n     in Washington, D.C.\n       In 1982, the National Endowment for the Arts awarded him \n     its National Heritage Fellowship, the highest honor the \n     United States can bestow on a traditional artist. This was \n     followed by a similar award from the South Carolina state \n     legislature for ``life-time achievement'' and commissions for \n     public sculptures by the S.C. State Museum and the City of \n     Charleston. Simmons was inducted into the S.C. Hall of Fame \n     in Myrtle Beach on Jan. 31, 1994.\n       Pieces of Simmons' work have been acquired by the National \n     Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institute, the \n     Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, N.M., the \n     Richland County Public Library and the Atlanta History \n     Center. Two gardens in Charleston have been dedicated in \n     Simmons' name, one at his church, St. John's Reformed \n     Episcopal Church at 91 Anson St., and a children's garden at \n     701 East Bay St., near his house and workshop.\n       While the awards and accolades mean a great deal to \n     Simmons, one of his big thrills now comes from teaching his \n     craft and passing on the artistry of ornamental iron work to \n     a new generation of craftsmen.\n       ``I don't want it (ornamental wrought iron work) to become \n     a lost art,'' he says. ``I can't work anymore, but I can \n     teach. A lot of\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\n     young people see the need to keep these old crafts going, and \n     they want to learn.''\n       Simmons teaches workshops at SoBA and has students come to \n     his shop for hands-on lessons also. He gladly welcomes \n     visitors to his workshop on Charleston's East Side because he \n     sees it as a way to pass on the old way of working with \n     wrought iron.\n       ``I bring people to look at the shop all the time,'' he \n     says. ``It reminds them of the past. You had to use these \n     hands. There were no machines.\n       ``The machines can cut the wood and the iron, but it's not \n     the same. It's not the art. You can create so many things \n     with that forge. You can really knock yourself out.''\n       Of all the pieces Simmons has crafted, he says his favorite \n     piece is the one he made at the Smithsonian Institute in 1975 \n     and which has been on display there ever since. ``The one at \n     the Columbia (State) Museum and the one at the (Charleston \n     International) Airport are the prettiest. The Smithsonian one \n     with the fish, the moon and the stars might not be the \n     prettiest, but it shows the country what is going on in South \n     Carolina. So many people have seen it and can learn my craft. \n     That's the piece I love the best, not for looks, but for its \n     purpose in serving this country.''\n       Simmons adds that although many people tried to tell him \n     that the car would kill the market for blacksmiths, he never \n     thought of leaving the field. ``In the '30s and '40s, people \n     told me that blacksmith was a dying art. I would shake my \n     head and say, `OK.' That didn't stop me. I didn't close up \n     shop and go work at the Navy Yard or something. I kept on \n     going, and made a great living at it. Not rich, but live well \n     and take care of my family. Now I want to get people excited \n     about it and pass it on.\n       ``Craftsmen enjoy making things people have never seen. \n     It's a joy. That's what keeps me going.\n       ``I'd be in there beating on that forge right now if my \n     health were good. But I do enjoy passing it on.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3082-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3082-S3083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE BURMESE JUNTA'S PERSISTENT USE OF CHILD SOLDIERS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I recently read an article \nthat appeared in the Washington Post on February 10, 2003 by Ellen \nNakashima that details particularly repulsive human rights abuses \ncommitted by the Burmese military junta, whose brutal totalitarian \nmisrule has shattered the lives of its citizens and ruined Burma's \neconomy. I am grateful for Ms. Nakashima's excellent reporting, and am \npleased to draw attention to this important issue. I will ask that Ms. \nNakashima's article, entitled ``Burma's Child Soldiers Tell of Army \nAtrocities,'' be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  Reports of widespread use of child soldiers, forced labor, and human \nrights abuse come as no surprise to anyone with even casual knowledge \nof recent Burmese history. Tragically, these recent reports are not \n``news,'' but rather business as usual in one of the world's most \nrepressive countries.\n  While the corrupt military junta has recently been conducting a \npropagandistic offensive to convince naive Western diplomats that Burma \ncan be a responsible member of the international community, the \ncontinual flow of evidence regarding Burma's gross abuses of human \nrights illustrates how hollow recent Burmese ``reform'' has been. \nAnyone duped into believing that the junta's decision to loosen the \nshackles that bind Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically elected leader \nof Burma who has spent nearly a decade under house arrest, represents a \nliberalization of the junta should think again. Proof that the Burmese \njunta continues its repression of democracy came yesterday when the \nDefense Ministry announced that it had detained seven members of Aung \nSan Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Party, NLDP, members. Their \ntreasonous crime appears to be distributing anti-government leaflets.\n  The Burmese junta maintains power through its gratuitous use of \nmilitary force against ethnic minorities and political dissidents. Now, \nthe evidence is overwhelming that the junta exploits children as young \nas 11 years old in pursuit of greater coercive military power. Human \nRights Watch reports that Burma's army of 350,000 includes nearly \n70,000 boys under the age of 18.\n  If these children are fortunate enough to survive the physical and \nemotional abuse heaped on them by their military superiors during their \n``training,'' they are then forced into combat, often against domestic \nKarenni and Shan minorities. As part of the ethnic cleansing and \nintimidation campaigns the Burmese junta has conducted against these \nethnic minorities for decades, these children soldiers are often \nencouraged to torture, rape, and kill innocent villagers. In one \ninstance, Burmese military commanders ordered some of these child \nsoldiers to force Karenni villagers to clear a minefield by walking \nthrough it. The children were subsequently ordered to shoot villagers \nwho refused to walk through the minefield.\n  Recently, the Burmese junta has sought to improve its standing in the \ninternational community by touting its supposedly more intense efforts \nto curb the production and trafficking of heroin. Mr. President, this \nclaim is laughable. American State Department officials should not be \ndeluded into believing that Burma has become a partner in the war \nagainst drugs. Burmese child defectors from the army who now live in \nrefugee camps in Thailand have corroborated reports that the Burmese \nmilitary has fueled its soldiers by making them take amphetamines, \nwashed down with whiskey, before going into combat. Countries that \nforce drugged children into deadly combat should not be considered \nallies by the United States in any war.\n  In response to Human Rights Watch's report, a Burmese military \nspokesman denied that Burma ``recruits'' underage soldiers and \nincredulously asserted that Burma's military is an all-volunteer army. \nSuch brazen lies should convince no one that the Burmese government has \nchanged its repressive ways.\n  If Than Swe, as head of the Burmese government, is committed to \nupholding international standards of human rights, it can begin by \nenacting meaningful and verifiable economic, political, and judicial \nreforms. It should release the seven NLDP members it has unjustly \narrested and all other political prisoners, and it should allow Aung \nSan Suu Kyi to meet and communicate freely with Burmese citizens \nthroughout the country, as well as with international representatives. \nUntil the Burmese junta agrees to hold free and fair elections to allow \nthe Burmese people the opportunity to choose their own leaders, it must \nbe aware that American sanctions will continue.\n  I ask that the article to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 10, 2003]\n\n             Burma's Child Soldiers Tell of Army Atrocities\n\n                          (By Ellen Nakashima)\n\n       He was taught how to hold an assault rifle and aim it at an \n     enemy. He was taught how to pull a trigger, aim at the next \n     enemy and pull the trigger again. He learned all this, he \n     says, by the time he was 12, when he was officially declared \n     a soldier of Burma and sent to the front lines of a long-\n     running civil war.\n       Now 14, the taciturn boy Kyaw Zay Ya lives in a rebel-held \n     village in Burma near the Thai border, one of the few places \n     in the country willing to protect him from service in what \n     human rights monitors call the largest child army in the \n     world.\n       According to New York-based Human Rights Watch, Burman's \n     army of 350,000 includes as many as 70,000 youths under 18. A \n     study the group issued last October found that rebel groups \n     fighting the army also use child soldiers, though in far \n     smaller numbers.\n       The numbers would make the military-ruled Burma, also known \n     as Myanmar, the worst violator of international laws against \n     using children in armed conflicts, Human Rights Watch \n     contends.\n       The Burmese government has denied that its army takes in \n     recruits under 18, and says that its force is all volunteer. \n     But people interviewed in safe houses and camps along the \n     border disputed those contentions.\n       In a two-hour talk here, Kyaw said he was press-ganged into \n     the army at age 11, took part in combat repeatedly and felt \n     ``afraid and very far from home.''\n       Another young man, Naing Win, said he was 16 when he was \n     ordered into a nasty firefight. To fuel the soldiers, he \n     said, the commander made them take amphetamines, washed down \n     with whiskey. The troops, Naing recalled, ``got very happy.''\n       In the encounter, each soldier was ordered to lob five \n     grenades at the enemy. Naing, whose forehead bears a shrapnel \n     scar, said he was sufficiently high on the drugs that at one \n     point he was throwing stones. With one grenade, he forgot to \n     remove the pin that allows it to explode. then he was ordered \n     to run forward exposed to enemy fire, retrieve the grenade, \n     take out the pin and throw it again. The battle killed his \n     best friend, 15.\n       Another time, after his unit had won a battle against \n     ethnic Karenni rebels, his commander wanted the area cleared \n     of mines. But 40 Karenni villagers were made to walk through \n     the mined zone, he said. In the ensuing explosions, some died \n     and some lost their legs. Those who survived were lined up. \n     Naing said he and several other soldiers were ordered to \n     shoot them. They did.\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\n       ``I'm very sorry,'' he said.\n       For much of Burma's history since it gained independence in \n     1948, the national army has been fighting guerrilla armies \n     fielded by ethnic groups that want control of their own \n     affairs and regions. Currently, army operations consist \n     largely of low-intensity conflicts against a handful of \n     opposition groups, notably the Shan State Army, the Karen \n     National Liberation Army and the Karenni Army.\n       The army has a major advantage in numbers over these \n     groups, none of which has more than 15,000 troops, according \n     to Karen and Karenni officials and Human Rights Watch, but \n     they say the army still employs underage soldiers.\n       ``Children are picked up off the street when they are 11 \n     years old,'' said Jo Becker, child advocacy director for \n     Human Rights Watch. ``Many have no chance to contact their \n     families and see their parents again. Everyone we had talked \n     to had been beaten during the training. Most were desperately \n     unhappy.''\n       The Burmese government denies the charges. ``I am totally \n     flabbergasted at the assertions in the Human Rights Watch \n     report,'' said Col. Hla Min, deputy head of the Defense \n     Ministry's International Affairs Department in the capital, \n     Rangoon. ``The Myanmar Defense Forces does not recruit \n     underage and, in fact, MDF is a voluntary army. Today, after \n     98 percent of all the insurgents have made peace with the \n     government, there is not much need for recruitment as accused \n     by certain quarters.''\n       In a faxed reply to a query, he stated that the Burmese \n     troops are now engaged in work similar to that of the U.S. \n     Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.\n       U Kyaw Tint Swe, Burma's ambassador to the United Nations, \n     said in a statement to the U.N. Security Council on Jan. 14 \n     that ``there is no credible evidence of the use and \n     recruitment of children by the Myanmar armed forces.''\n       U.S. policy is that people can enlist in the military at \n     age 17, but must be at least 18 to serve on front lines.\n       In an interview, a 19-year-old named Aung, who asked that \n     his full name not be used, said he was taken into the army in \n     1998 at age 14 after seven years in an army-run prep camp, \n     named Ye Nyunt. There he and others learned to march in \n     straight rows, clean guns and recognize land mines. Aung was \n     9 when he first picked up a gun, a standard army-issue G-3. \n     The gun was taller than he was, he recalled.\n       Aung though that after he finished his studies, he would \n     become an army captain. But one June day in 1998, when he was \n     14, a general showed up at the school. All boys older than 13 \n     who had not finished the 10th grade were pulled aside. He and \n     his schoolmates thought they were just being sent to another \n     class. Instead, they were trucked to a holding center in \n     Mandalay. ``I got to the army by force,'' he said, ``not \n     voluntarily.''\n       Aung said he first saw battle at the age of 15, and he was \n     sick for three days afterward. But he grew used to it: In the \n     following two years, he took part in seven major firefights \n     and countless minor skirmishes, he said.\n       The worse battle lasted from early morning into the \n     evening, in the village of Loi Lin Lay in 1999. The fighting \n     began at the back of the village and by afternoon had moved \n     to the front, where he and his friend, another 15-year-old, \n     were deployed. By nightfall, most of his Burmese counterparts \n     were dead.\n       ``During the fighting, you don't have time to think,'' he \n     says. ``Only shoot.''\n       He said he felt powerless to resist. In the army, ``if a \n     bad person gives an order, you have to follow it. If he says \n     burn the village, you have to burn it. If he says kill a \n     person, you have to do it.''\n       Naing Win, the boy soldier who recounted use of \n     amphetamines, said in an interview that he was picked up at a \n     train station near Mandalay when he was 15. Authorities found \n     he had no identification card and gave him a choice: Join the \n     army or go to prison. He was forced into a truck with 40 \n     other people, 16 of whom were boys. They were taken to an \n     army base, then to a holding camp for recruits.\n       If a boy refused to east his food, was late or missed a \n     task, the other soldiers would often be forced to beat the \n     victim with bamboo strips or a whip, Naing said. There were \n     other forms of punishment, the former soldiers said, such as \n     jumping in the sand like frogs for 10 minutes, or lying flat \n     on the ground and staring at the sun.\n       One boy was stripped naked, his hands and legs tied, Naing \n     recalled. After 20 or 30 blows, his skin was bloody. An \n     officer rubbed salt into the wounds on his back. The boy \n     screamed in pain. Hours later, he was dead.\n       But not all officers were harsh, said Kyaw, who recounted \n     being plucked for military service from a bus stop near \n     Rangoon at age 11. One officer let the boys watch videos, \n     including James Bond movies. Others would arrange \n     surreptitious meetings between a youngster and his parents.\n       In the field, they had duties that included rounding up \n     villagers in rebel areas to serve as porters, the former \n     soldiers said. Those who balked or could not keep up were \n     beaten or killed. Naing said he also witnessed Karenni \n     villagers being raped. A general told the soldiers that \n     raping women serves ``to give the soldiers energy.''\n       ``Some of my friends said, `It's okay. They're not Burmese. \n     They're Karenni.'' Once, he said, he saw a teenage girl being \n     raped repeatedly in an open field in the evening. First came \n     the battalion leader, then a bodyguard, then ordinary \n     soldiers. She was screaming and crying. She was left to die, \n     he said.\n       All three of the former soldiers said they eventually \n     deserted.\n       Naing fled in 1995, after six years in the army. He married \n     a Karenni woman and joined the Burma Patriotic Army, a group \n     of 30 fellow deserters whose aim is to oppose the central \n     government in Rangoon. He said he has pretty much abandoned \n     hope of seeing his family in Mandalay province again, unless \n     there is a change in government. He still dreams about his \n     friend who was killed.\n       Aung escaped in May 2001. Today, he lives in a Thai town \n     near the border and works odd jobs. He is waiting for the \n     political situation to change, so that he can return home to \n     Rangoon province. The only way he expects that to be possible \n     is if ``people in the outside world put a lot of pressure on \n     the government.''\n       And last September, after three years in uniform, Kyaw was \n     bathing alone in a stream near a waterfall. No one was \n     watching. He bolted. After walking for four hours, he reached \n     a Karen village, where soldiers tied his hands an punched \n     him, thinking he might be a spy. After he convinced a Karen \n     officer that he was a true deserter, he was given refuge in a \n     border village.\n       He does not dare to go home. ``They will put me in \n     prison,'' he said. He has no desire to resume studying. His \n     only desire is to be a kickboxer one day, like his favorite \n     Burmese boxers Shwe da Win and Wan Chai. He says he does not \n     think much about the army. He has no nightmares. ``I don't \n     dream,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3083-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3083-S3084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING LINDA MORGAN\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I want to pay tribute to an \noutstanding public servant, Linda Morgan, as she prepares to leave the \nSurface Transportation Board next month. She has been a Commissioner of \nthe Board, and its predecessor, the Interstate Commerce Commission, \nsince 1994, much of that time as Chairman. As such, she demonstrated \nreal leadership, presiding when there were difficult years for the \nrailroad industry as many companies merged.\n  I know Linda's excellent work firsthand. She served for 15 years as a \nprofessional staff member with the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, and I was proud to name her the first \nfemale General Counsel to the Committee. It is fair to say that Linda \nMorgan is responsible for much of the legislation that established the \nframework for today's surface transportation system.\n  Last month, the Washington Post interviewed Linda, seeking out her \nviews on the railroad industry. I think it would do all members of this \nbody well to read what this dedicated model of public service had to \nsay.\n  I ask to print the following article in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 27, 2003]\n\n                Railroad Regulator Linda Morgan Resigns\n\n                           (By Don Phillips)\n\n       Linda J. Morgan, the federal official who saw the railroad \n     industry through a decade of turbulent mergers, said she will \n     resign from the Surface Transportation Board on April 8, \n     almost nine months before her term expires.\n       Morgan, a Democrat who had a cordial relationship with Bush \n     administration officials, had been asked to remain as \n     chairman until the administration could name a replacement, a \n     process that took a year. Roger P. Nober, a Transportation \n     Department official, was named chairman of the three-person \n     board in December. Morgan's departure as a member had been \n     expected. She said she will not decide on a future career \n     until after she leaves.\n       Chairman of that board and its predecessor, the Interstate \n     Commerce Commission, since March 23, 1995, Morgan presided \n     over the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger in 1996 that \n     resulted in a meltdown in rail service nationwide, and the \n     1999 division of Conrail between Norfolk Southern and CSX \n     Transportation, which created serious service problems that \n     were not solved for months. Those systems have recovered from \n     their problems and service appears to be improving.\n       The Surface Transportation Board, in addition to approving \n     rail mergers, also has some powers in regulating the \n     commercial end of the railroad industry.\n       Morgan said she believes that the railroad industry has \n     emerged from the merger period better, because the companies \n     learned to pay closer attention to their customers and to \n     day-by-day operations.\n       ``This period without mergers has been good for the \n     industry,'' she said. ``For a time, mergers were the answer \n     to everything.''\n       But Morgan said she fears for the future of freight rail \n     because the railroads, shippers, Congress and states are \n     polarized over whether government should impose conditions to \n     guarantee greater competition, which would cause freight \n     rates to fall. Such ``open access'' proposals could hurt \n     customers more than they help, she said.\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\n       Everyone is trying to gain narrow advantage rather than \n     engaging in a debate on what role railroads should play in \n     the future, she said.\n       Morgan said that freight railroads, although more \n     successful than ever, do not yet earn enough to pay for the \n     cost of maintaining and expanding their infrastructure. But \n     she said the railroads may have a difficult time investing in \n     infrastructure they would need to move more freight in the \n     future, if some customers and Congress continue to push for \n     even lower rates.\n       ``Railroads can't be all things to all people,'' she said. \n     ``They can't be giving people lower rates but then sustaining \n     the network they have in place today and opening up their \n     line to commuters for some sort of low cost. You can't do it \n     all. Somehow the finances have to make sense.''\n       Unless there is a comprehensive and sensible debate, Morgan \n     said, Congress and shippers may some day find that their only \n     two choices are to let the industry shrink or to let the \n     federal government take over the railroads or railroad \n     infrastructure at a high cost.\n       ``The customers want lower rates,'' she said. ``But do they \n     also understand that over time, over some period of time, if \n     all these rates keep coming down, then there won't be the \n     revenue coming into the system to sustain the network that \n     exists today in the private sector? Then will that mean the \n     customers will lose service that they don't want to lose, and \n     will they be prepared for that?\n       ``Will members of Congress understand that if we go in \n     certain directions from a policy position, and that ends up \n     with a situation where there are not enough revenues coming \n     into the system to sustain this rail network in the private \n     sector, will they then be prepared to do what's necessary to \n     do the next thing? . . . I want to make sure that everybody \n     understands that is the challenge for the industry.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3084-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PROFESSOR ANTHONY JONES\n\n Mr. DURBIN.

Professor Jones has been awarded the honor of Commander of \nthe British Empire by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth for services in the \npromotion of British art in the United States. King George V created \nthe Commander of the British Empire honor in 1917 to reward services to \nthe World War effort by civilians at home and service personnel in \nsupport positions. The orders are now awarded in both military and \ncivil divisions for public service or other distinctions.\n  Originally from Wales, Tony Jones is an internationally-known arts \nadministrator, broadcaster, writer and historian of art design. \nProfessor Jones studied at the University of London and the Newport \nCollege of Art, and came to the United States as a Fulbright Scholar. \nHe earned his graduate degree from Tulane University in New Orleans, \nLA.\n  Before coming to Chicago, Tony Jones had been Director of the Glasgow \nSchool of Art. He created the ``Welsh Chapels'' exhibition of the \nNational Museum of Wales, and is the author of ``Chapel Architecture in \nthe Merthyr Valley'' and ``Welsh Chapels.'' In 1999, his research on \nthe architectural parallels of Glasgow and Chicago was examined in the \nBBC documentary ``A Tale of Two Cities: Glasgow and Chicago.'' \nProfessor Jones is a recognized authority on the development of art, \ndesign and architecture in the Modern Age, especially the work of the \narchitect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Celtic Revival \nmovement designer Archibald Knox.\n  Professor Jones's accomplishments have earned him international \nrecognition. In addition to his positions as Senior Fellow of the Royal \nCollege of Arts in London, where he also served as Director, and as \nFellow of the Royal Society of Arts, he was appointed Honorary Director \nof Japan's Osaka University of the Arts in 2001 and was conferred the \nAustrian Cross of Honor for Science and the Arts in 2002. Here in the \nUnited States, Professor Jones was elected Honorary Member of the \nAmerican Institute of Architects and has won the National Council of \nArts Administrators Award for Distinguished Service in the Arts. He \ncurrently serves as the president of the School of the Art Institute of \nChicago and as president of the Alliance of Independent Colleges of Art \nand Design.\n  Professor Jones was granted the honor of Commander of the British \nEmpire in recognition of his long years of distinguished service to the \narts and culture, international education, and the promotion of British \narts in the United States. The honor will be awarded by Her Majesty \nQueen Elizabeth at an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace later \nin the Spring.\n  It is my privilege to congratulate Professor Jones on the occasion of \nthis prestigious award and to acknowledge his extensive contributions \nto the arts.

During his career, he commanded at \nmany levels and served in staff positions at the highest levels of the \nArmy, always ably leading and training America's soldiers at home and \noverseas. His duty locations over the years included Fort Riley, KS; \nMainz, Germany; Fort Leavenworth, KS, as the Executive officer for the \nArmy's School of Advanced Military Studies; Fort Stewart, GA, with the \n24th Mechanized Division as both a Battalion and Brigade Operations \nOfficer, as a Battalion Executive Officer and as a Brigade Adjutant \nduring Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm ; and, finally, in the \nPentagon and Senate in the Office of Legislative Liaison. Lieutenant \nColonel Pusey also served as a Tactics instructor at the Royal Armoured \nCorps Centre in Bovington Camp, England. He has always been placed in \npositions of responsibility throughout his Army career.\n  Since October 1995, Ted Pusey has served with distinction in the \nArmy's Office of Legislative Liaison where he has superbly represented \nthe Army Chief of Staff and Secretary and promoted the interests of \nsoldiers and civilians of the Army. His professionalism, mature \njudgment and inter-personal skills earned him the respect and \nconfidence of the Members of Congress and Congressional staff with whom \nhe worked. In over 8 years on Capitol Hill, Ted Pusey has been a true \nfriend of not only the Army he loves, but also of the United States \nSenate and the Congress. Serving as the primary point of contact for \nall Senators, their staffs, and committees, he helped Congress \nunderstand Army policies, actions, operations and requirements in a \nprompt, coordinated and factual manner. Additionally, he provided \ninvaluable assistance to Members and their staffs while planning, \ncoordinating and accompanying Senate delegations traveling worldwide. \nHis substantive knowledge of the key issues, insight, and ability to \neffectively advise senior members of the Army leadership directly \ncontributed to the successful representation of the Army's interests \nbefore Congress.\n  Throughout his career, Ted Pusey has demonstrated his profound \ncommitment to our Nation, his selfless service to the Army, and a deep \nconcern for soldiers and their families. Committed to excellence, he \nhas been a consummate professional who, in over 27 years of service, \nhas personified those traits of courage, competency and integrity that \nour Nation has come to expect from its professional Army officers.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking LTC Ted Pusey for his \nhonorable service to the Army of the United States. We wish him and his \nfamily all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3084-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURE HELD AT DESK\n\n  The following resolution was ordered held at the desk by unanimous \nconsent:\n\n       S.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage and accelerate the nationwide production, retail sale, and \nconsumer use of new motor vehicles that are powered by fuel cell \ntechnology, hybrid technology, battery electric technology, alternative \nfuels, or other advanced motor vehicle technologies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the CLEAR ACT, \nwhich is short for the Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting from \nAdvanced Car Technologies Act of 2003.\n  Joining me in this effort are Senators John Rockefeller and Jim \nJeffords, who have been my partners in this legislation and its earlier \nversions since the 106th Congress. We are also being joined by an \nimpressive and bipartisan lineup of original cosponsors, which includes \nSenators Olympia Snowe, John Kerry, Gordon Smith, Joe Lieberman, John \nEnsign, Hillary Clinton, Mike Crapo, Byron Dorgan, Susan Collins, and \nLincoln Chafee.\n  I believe the CLEAR ACT is the most comprehensive and effective plan \nwe have seen in this country to accelerate the transformation of the \nautomotive marketplace toward the widespread use of fuel cell vehicles. \nAnd it does so without any new Federal mandates. Instead, it offers \npowerful market incentives to promote the combination of advances we \nmust have in technology, in infrastructure, and in alternative fuels if \nour goal of bringing fuel cell vehicles to the mass market is to become \na reality.\n  As many of my colleagues know, fuel cell vehicles are the most \npromising long-term automotive technology, offering breakthrough fuel \neconomy of up to three times today's levels with zero emissions. For a \nvariety of reasons, the commercial production of fuel cell vehicles is \na number of years away. Many things need to change in the automotive \nmarketplace before\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\nwidespread use of these vehicles of the future becomes a reality. With \nthe CLEAR ACT, we can achieve this goal much faster, while in the \nmeantime we can reap the benefits of cleaner air and a reduced \ndependency on foreign oil.\n  Bridging the gap between today's conventional vehicles and the day \nwhen all of us will be driving fuel cell vehicles are alternative fuel \nand advanced technology vehicles, such as hybrid electrics. These \nvehicles are available today, but not yet widely accepted in the \nmarketplace.\n  Currently, consumers face three basic obstacles to accepting the use \nof these alternative fueled and advanced technology vehicles. These \nobstacles are the higher cost of these vehicles as compared with their \nconventional counterparts, the cost of the alternative fuel, and the \nlack of an adequate infrastructure of alternative fueling stations. Mr. \nPresident, the CLEAR ACT would lower all three of these barriers.\n  First, we provide a tax credit of 50 cents per gasoline-gallon \nequivalent for the purchase of alternative fuel at retail. This would \nbring the price of these cleaner fuels much closer in line with \nconventional automotive fuels. And, to give customers better access to \nalternative fuel, we extend an existing deduction for the capital costs \nof installing alternative fueling stations. We also provide a 50-\npercent credit for the installation costs of retail and residential \nrefueling stations.\n\n  Finally, we offer CLEAR ACT credits to consumers who purchase \nalternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. These credits would \nlower the price gap between these cleaner and more efficient vehicles \nand conventionally fueled vehicles of the same type. To make certain \nthat the tax benefit we provide translates into a corresponding benefit \nto the environment, we split the vehicle tax credit into two. The \namount the consumer receives in a CLEAR ACT credit would depend, first, \non the level of technology used in the vehicle and, second, on the fuel \nefficiency and emissions reduction of the vehicle. In this way, we are \nconfident that the CLEAR ACT will create the greatest social benefit \npossible for every tax dollar.\n  The transportation sector in the U.S. accounts for nearly two-thirds \nof all oil consumption, and we are 97-percent dependent on petroleum \nfor our transportation needs. Is it any wonder that 50 percent of our \nurban smog is caused by mobile sources? If we want to clean our air and \naddress our Nation's energy dependency, we must focus on the \ntransportation sector. And we must focus first on those technologies \nand alternative fuels that are already available and abundant \ndomestically. The CLEAR ACT is the shortest path to achieving these \ngoals.\n  Air pollution and energy independence are issues of critical concern \nin my home State of Utah. According to a study by Utah's Division of \nAir Quality, on-road vehicles in Utah account for 22 percent of \nparticulate matter. This particulate matter can be harmful to citizens \nwho suffer from chronic respiratory or heart disease, influenza, or \nasthma. Automobiles also contribute significantly to hydrocarbon and \nnitrogen oxide emissions in my State. These two pollutants react in \nsunlight to form ozone, which in turn reduces lung function in humans \nand hurts our resistance to colds and asthma. In addition, vehicles \naccount for as much as 87 percent of carbon monoxide emissions. Carbon \nmonoxide can be harmful to persons with heart, respiratory, or \ncirculatory ailments.\n  While Utah has made important strides in improving air quality, it is \na fact that each year more vehicular miles are driven in our State. It \nis clear that if we are to have cleaner air, we must encourage the use \nof alternative fuels and technologies to reduce vehicle emissions.\n  Another key aim of the CLEAR ACT is greater energy independence. \nWhether during the energy crisis in the 1970s, during the Persian Gulf \nwar, or during our current energy challenge, every American has felt \nthe sting of our dependence on foreign oil. And I might add that our \ndependency on foreign oil has steadily increased to the point where we \nnow depend on foreign sources for about 60 percent of our oil. When \nenacted, the CLEAR ACT will play a key role in helping our Nation \nimprove its energy security by increasing the diversity of our fuel \noptions and decreasing our dependency on gasoline.\n  Our Nation's energy strategy will not be complete without an \nincentive to increase the use of alternative fuels and advanced car \ntechnologies. In the future we will not use gasoline-fueled vehicles to \nthe same extent we do today. The technology is here today to help \ntransform us to the benefits of the future much sooner. We just need to \nfind a way to lower those barriers to widespread consumer acceptance, \nwhich will in turn put the power of mass production to work to lower \nthe incremental cost of this technology. In short, our legislation \nwould bring the benefits of cleaner air and energy independence to our \ncitizens sooner.\n  I am very proud to offer this groundbreaking and bipartisan \nlegislation. It represents the input and hard work of a very powerful \nand effective coalition the CLEAR ACT Coalition. This coalition \nincludes the Union of Concerned Scientists, Ford Motor Company, the \nNatural Resource Defense Council, Toyota, Environmental Defense, Honda, \nthe Alliance to Save Energy, the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, the \nPropane Vehicle Council, the Methanol Institute, and others. The CLEAR \nACT reflects the untiring effort and expertise of the members of this \ncoalition, and for this we owe them our gratitude.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me, the CLEAR ACT's \ncosponsors, and this coalition in this forward-looking approach to \ncleaner air and increased energy independence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the CLEAR ACT be inserted \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSummary of the CLEAR ACT of 2003 (Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting \n                    From Advanced Car Technologies)\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       The primary purpose of this bill is to enhance national \n     energy security and promote cleaner air by reducing the \n     consumption of petroleum and advancing alternative fuels. \n     Transportation accounts for nearly \\2/3\\ of all oil \n     consumption and is almost 97 percent dependent on petroleum.\n       This legislation will set the stage for a consumer-based \n     and technology-led transformation of the transportation \n     marketplace. All major vehicle manufacturers are introducing \n     new technology and alternative fuel vehicles into the \n     marketplace. These new technologies reduce petroleum \n     consumption and improve air quality as a result of \n     breakthrough improvements in fuel economy or from the use of \n     non-petroleum alternative fuels. Accelerated acceptance by \n     consumers of these new technologies is needed to increase \n     production volumes and make them cost competitive with \n     conventional vehicles.\n       Providing tax incentives for a limited time to consumers \n     will help offset the higher costs associated with new \n     technology and alternative fuel vehicles. As the vehicles \n     gain consumer acceptance and production volumes increase, the \n     cost differential between these and conventional vehicles \n     will be reduced or eliminated.\n\n\n                    Key Components of the CLEAR ACT\n\n       Tax incentives for new technology and alternative fuel \n     vehicles under this legislation go directly to the consumer. \n     These incentives are based both on technology and \n     performance.\n       Fuel Cell Vehicles. Fuel cell vehicles are the most \n     promising long-term technology offering breakthrough fuel \n     economy of up to 3 times today's levels with zero emissions. \n     The CLEAR ACT offers a $4,000 base credit ($8,000 for fuel \n     cell vehicles placed in service before 2009) along with an \n     additional credit of up to $4,000 depending on fuel economy \n     performance. These credits are available for ten years.\n       Hybrid Electric Vehicles. Electronics that integrate \n     electric drive with an internal combustion engine offer near-\n     term improvements in fuel economy. The CLEAR ACT offers a \n     credit of up to $1,000 for the amount of electric drive power \n     along with an additional credit of up to $3,000 depending \n     upon fuel economy performance. These credits are available \n     for 6 years.\n       Dedicated Alternative Fuel Vehicles. Vehicles solely \n     capable of running on alternative fuels promote energy \n     diversity and significant emissions reductions. Natural gas, \n     LPG, and LNG are the most commonly used fuels for \n     dedicated alternative fuel vehicles. The CLEAR ACT \n     provides a base credit of up to $2,500 with an additional \n     $1,500 credit for vehicles certified to ``Super Ultra Low \n     Emission'' (SULEV) standards. ``Flex-fuel'' vehicles are \n     not eligible since they can operate on either gasoline or \n     E85 (ethanol) and are available in the market without any \n     incremental cost.\n       Battery Electric Vehicles. Vehicles that utilize stored \n     energy from ``plug-in'' rechargeable batteries offer zero \n     emissions and are not dependent upon petroleum-based\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\n     fuels. The CLEAR ACT offers a base credit of $4,000 and an \n     incremental credit of $2,000 for vehicles with extended range \n     or payload capabilities.\n       Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicles. Medium and heavy duty \n     applications of the same vehicle technologies utilized for \n     passenger vehicles offer similar benefits related to energy \n     efficiency, diversity, and emission reductions. The CLEAR ACT \n     offers credits for individual weight categories and amounts \n     vary with the largest vehicles over 26,000 pounds (e.g., \n     large metro busses) receiving up to $40,000 for fuel cell or \n     battery electric, $32,000 for alternative fuel, or $24,000 \n     for hybrid applications.\n       Alternative Fuel Incentives. Alternative fuels such as \n     natural gas, LNG, LPG, hydrogen, B100 (biomass) and methanol \n     are primarily used in alternative fueled vehicles and fuel \n     cell vehicles. To encourage the installation of distribution \n     points to support these applications, a credit of up to 50 \n     cents for every gallon of gas equivalent is provided to the \n     retail distributor,. This credit is available for 6 years.\n       Alternative Fuel Infrastructure. Complimentary to the \n     credit for the fuel itself, the CLEAR ACT extends the \n     existing $100,000 tax deduction for 10 years and also \n     provides a 50 percent credit for actual costs of up to \n     $30,000 for the installation of alternative fuel sites \n     available to the public.\n\n\n                        broad coalition support\n\n       A broad and diverse group that includes representatives \n     from the environmental community, automobile manufacturers, \n     and alternative fuel groups support the CLEAR ACT. \n     Environmental coalition support comes from the Union of \n     Concerned Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council, \n     Environmental Defense, and the American Council for an Energy \n     Efficient Economy. Ford Motor Company, Honda, and Toyota are \n     among the key automotive industry supporters. Industry \n     coalitions include the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, the \n     Propane Vehicle Council, the American Methanol Institute, and \n     the Electric Drive Transportation Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 506. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to ensure the safety of meals served under the school lunch program \nand the school breakfast program; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould dramatically improve the safety of food served in our Nation's \nschools. This bill, known as the Safe School Food Act, would fill gaps \nin the inspection, testing, procurement and preparation of food served \nto our schoolchildren, and provide school officials with the necessary \ntools and information to help them prevent food-borne illness among our \nmost vulnerable population.\n  Each day, more than 27 million children eat meals provided through \nthe National School Lunch Act. Despite increased attention in recent \nyears to the safety of food provided to schoolchildren, there is \nevidence of serious problems with our school lunch system--between 1990 \nand 2000, there were nearly 100 reported outbreaks of food-borne \nillness in our schools affecting thousands of children, with several \noutbreaks resulting in significant health consequences. Since food-\nborne illness is preventable, these statistics indicate we are not \ndoing enough to protect our children's health when they consume food \nserved at our schools.\n  Currently, 17 percent of the food served in schools is donated by the \nFederal Government and undergoes stringent U.S. Department of \nAgriculture food-safety standards for inspections and pathogen testing. \nSuppliers' food safety records also are reviewed before they are \ngranted contracts to provide food to the USDA donated commodity \nprogram. However, the remaining 83 percent of food consumed at schools \nis purchased locally and is not subject to these more stringent USDA \ndonated commodity standards. State education officials also do not have \naccess to the safety records of food suppliers to make the same \ninformed decisions as their counterparts at the Federal level.\n  If a tainted product enters the food supply, it is often difficult \nfor local education officials to quickly determine if they have that \nfood in their schools' kitchens due to a complex web of food \nmanufacturers, distributors, and brokers who deal with schools. A food \nproducer's tainted food may be repackaged by a distributor, leaving a \nschool unaware it is serving the product. And many Americans may be \nsurprised to discover that our Federal food agencies do not even have \nthe authority to mandate the recall of contaminated food in schools. \nSuch recalls are currently voluntary.\n  The Safe School Food Act would address these gaps in our School Lunch \nProgram and provide schools with the tools and information on how to \nmore safely purchase and prepare food served to our children.\n  Improving Inspections: This legislation will ensure stringent \ninspection and pathogen testing for USDA meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, \nand produce donated to the School Lunch Program, and gives the USDA \nSecretary the authority to require similar pathogen testing as \nnecessary for foods purchased directly by the schools. Cafeterias also \nwould be inspected more frequently, inspection exemptions would be \neliminated, and those inspection reports would be made available to the \npublic.\n  Purchasing Safe Food: By incorporating USDA food safety guidelines in \ntheir procurement contracts to the maximum extent possible, schools \nwill have the tools to help ensure the safety of the food they serve. \nAnd by providing State education officials with food-safety histories \nof the companies they purchase from, schools can make more informed \ndecisions in the purchasing process.\n  Planning and Serving Safe Meals: The USDA will provide training and \nassistance to schools in the preparation of required plans to address \nthe food-safety risks of meals they prepare.\n  Providing Notice and Recalling Unsafe Food: Each State will have an \nup-to-date list of the vendors and suppliers who provide food to their \nschools to enable easier tracking of food that may be tainted. If a \nfood product that has been distributed to schools is found to be \nunsafe, the USDA Secretary will have the authority to require a \nmandatory recall of the product if voluntary efforts are unsuccessful. \nDesignated food safety coordinators in each State will assist with \nrecalls, as well as safety training and information-sharing issues.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to \nimprove the safety of the food served in our schools. The health of our \nschoolchildren is at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 506\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Safe School Food Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the national school lunch program under the Richard B. \n     Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) is \n     a federally-assisted meal program that--\n       (A) operates in more than 97,000 public and nonprofit \n     private schools; and\n       (B) provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free \n     lunches to more than 27,000,000 children each school day;\n       (2) children are among the populations most vulnerable to \n     foodborne illness, which sickens an estimated 76,000,000 \n     individuals in the United States each year;\n       (3) nearly 100 reported outbreaks of foodborne illnesses \n     occurred in schools between 1990 and 2000;\n       (4) Department of Agriculture procurement policies and \n     procedures--\n       (A) help ensure the safety of foods donated to schools, \n     which comprise about 17 percent of the school lunch supply; \n     but\n       (B) do not apply to the remaining 83 percent of food served \n     under the national school lunch program, which is purchased \n     locally by schools;\n       (5) it is essential to maintain public confidence in--\n       (A) the safety of the food supply in the schools of the \n     United States; and\n       (B) the ability of the Federal Government and State \n     governments to exercise adequate oversight of foods served in \n     the schools of the United States; and\n       (6) public confidence can best be maintained by--\n       (A) improving Department of Agriculture procurement and \n     testing standards, and extending the standards, to the \n     maximum extent practicable, to foods purchased by schools;\n       (B) preparing and implementing plans to prevent identified \n     food safety risks in the preparation of school meals; and\n       (C) improving food safety training, information sharing, \n     and coordination between the Federal Government and States.\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives to introduce new technologies to reduce energy consumption \nin buildings; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the EFFECT Act, \nthe Energy Efficiency through Certified Technologies Act, which has \nbipartisan support as I am pleased to be joined by cosponsors Senator \nFeinstein of California, Senator McCain of Arizona, Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts, Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, and Senator Reid of \nNevada.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I strongly believe that we must \ndevelop responsible tax credit incentive policies that will increase \nthe efficiencies of the homes we build and live in and the buildings in \nwhich we work. We did an admirable job last year providing sound tax \nincentives in the omnibus energy bill, and it is regrettable that bill \ndid not get out of conference and these incentives are not available \nfor our consumers to use. That is especially true as the storm clouds \ngather in the Middle East and the price of oil, for instance, reaches \n$40 a barrel.\n  This bill provides tax incentives for advanced levels of energy \nefficiency and peak power saving technologies in the buildings in which \nwe live, work, and learn. Buildings consume some 35 percent of energy \nnationwide and are responsible for the emissions of a comparable \npercentage of pollution; importantly, they account for more than one-\nhalf of the Nation's energy costs.\n  Incentives provided through the tax system are necessary to \ncomplement existing energy efficiency policies at the Federal and State \nlevels. The issue is, incentive programs already being operated cannot \nprovide multiyear commitments of money. Such commitments are absolutely \nvital in inducing industries to invest in these technologies. The 1-\nyear commitments that are offered by many current programs are \ninsufficient to promote dramatic new energy efficiency technologies \neven when they are very cost effective.\n  Our goal in introducing the legislation is to accelerate the \ncommercial success of technologies that are already cost effective but \nare currently impeded by market barriers. These barriers can be \novercome by financial incentives. Savings of up to 50 percent add up to \nreductions in climate pollution emissions of 65 million metric tons of \ncarbon annually after 10 years, accompanied by consumer energy bill \nreductions of $30 billion per year and the creation of almost 500,000 \nnew jobs as well as stimulation in the growth of small businesses.\n  The bill provides for a 6-year--and, in some cases, 3-year--sunset \nfor the incentive. Incentives are provided for commercial buildings \nboth new and remodeled, including schools and other public buildings \nand rental housing; for air-conditioning, heating, and water heating \nequipment which can reduce peak power demand quickly; for new homes and \nthe retrofitting of existing homes; and for solar electricity.\n  The incentives provided for in this legislation are based on three \nprinciples: One, independent third-party certification is required so \nthat energy savings are certified and the Government is getting real \nenergy savings for the tax money invested; two, the incentives are \nworkable, not bureaucratic, and are built on programs that have already \nbeen shown to work with minimal bureaucratic intervention or effort; \nand, three, the incentives sunset in order to provide a transition to a \nmarket system that already promotes energy efficiency.\n  The incentives are performance-based so that the consumer and \nproducer have the motivation to reduce costs and to introduce new \ntechnologies to achieve energy goals in more cost-effective ways than \nexisting technologies. The documentation required for certification has \nvalue in the marketplace in allowing property markets to reflect \nenhanced property values based on energy efficiency.\n  Many American homes, for instance, were built years before energy-\nefficient technologies were developed. This is certainly true in an \nolder State such as\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\nmy home State of Maine and an incentive for a retrofit such as simply \nputting in certifiable high-energy-efficient doors and windows, such a \nlow-emissivity glass, will save a great deal of energy loss because of \nthe huge amount of seepage that now occurs through the existing \nwindows.\n\n  This bill will also leverage cost-effective investments in saving \npeak powers as well as energy--110,000 megawatts after 10 years. It is \none of the few public policies that can be enacted that can help avert \npeak power shortages in the next 4 or 5 years. It will lower energy \ncosts for consumers and businesses and promote competition and \ninnovation.\n  The bottom line is, we have the opportunity to raise the bar for our \nfuture domestic energy systems. Solutions exist in available \ntechnologies, and most of all in the entrepreneurial spirit of the \nAmerican people. I look forward to working with the chairmen of the \nFinance Committee, as I did last year, to mark up tax incentives that \nreflect the provisions of this legislation, and with the Energy \nCommittee chairmen to further our Nation's energy efficiency goals that \nwill save on our energy usage--and this will be reflected in the energy \nbills consumers must pay--and thus allow us to use less electricity, \nand less oil and natural gas to produce that energy.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators representing States throughout \nthe country and urge others to seriously consider this legislation and \njoin us in working towards our goal for achieving greater energy \nefficiency in the near future.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the Efficient \nEnergy through Certified Technologies Act which I have cosponsored \nalong with Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine.\n  The EFFECT Act will provide tax incentives to encourage homeowners \nand businesses to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings and \nequipment. This legislation will stimulate the economy, cut energy \nbills, reduce energy usage, and reduce pollution.\n  This bill was originally introduced in the 107th Congress to address \nthe Western energy crisis which, as we all know, created exorbitantly \nhigh prices for power and rolling blackouts. This legislation \nincorporates improvements based on last year's Senate energy tax bill.\n  While conditions in the West have improved because there are more \nplants coming online and families and businesses have reduced their \nenergy usage, it is important to take steps to continue to increase our \nenergy efficiency and reduce energy consumption.\n  Simply put, there are only two things one can do when there is not \nenough power to go around: increase supply or decrease demand.\n  Without a doubt, the quickest way to address future demand and supply \nimbalances is to provide incentives to increase energy efficiency to \nreduce demand.\n  This bill creates economic incentives for Americans to increase \nenergy efficiency by establishing the following tax deductions and tax \ncredits for commercial and residential properties using specific energy \nefficient technologies:\n  A tax deduction of $2.25 per square foot for newly constructed or \nremodeled commercial buildings, including schools and other public \nbuildings as well as rental housing, that achieve a 50-percent \nreduction in total annual energy costs, compared to existing national \nstandards.\n  A $2,000 tax credit to builders of new homes that use 50 percent less \nenergy than a national model standard.\n  A performance-based tax credit of as much as $6,000 for installing \nsolar technology.\n  A tax credit of as much as $300 if businesses install a super-\nefficient, new electric heat pump, a new central air-conditioner, or a \nnew gas or electric water heater.\n  A tax credit of as much as $500 if homeowners, tenants, or landlords \nretrofit their homes to achieve a 30 percent or 50 percent reduction in \nannual energy costs.\n  The benefits of increasing energy efficiency are immense.\n  First, increasing energy efficiency will cut heating, cooling, and \nelectricity costs. Homeowners and businesses spend over $250 billion \neach year on heat, air-conditioning, and related energy costs for their \nbusinesses and homes. If we can reduce energy costs by increasing \nenergy efficiency, money will be freed to fuel the economy in other \nareas and create new jobs. Furthermore, increasing energy efficiency \nwill reduce the impact of future energy price spikes that harm families \nand businesses. And the incentives will cause businesses to invest in \nproducing more efficient equipment and services beginning immediately \nafter the bill is enacted.\n  Second, increasing energy efficiency will reduce air pollution. \nEnergy generation to heat, cool, and light our homes and offices \nproduces 35 percent of the air pollution emitted nationwide. If we \nincrease efficiency, then less energy will be needed to power our \nbuildings, and consequently, we will be able to reduce emissions from \npowerplants.\n  Third, increasing energy efficiency will help maintain the \nreliability of our Nation's electricity supply. Since most of our peak \nelectricity demand comes from heating, cooling, or lighting needs, \nincreasing energy efficiency will lower the probability of blackouts or \nbrownouts.\n  In fact, with this legislation in place, peak electricity demand in \nthe summer would be reduced by tens of thousands of negawatts \nnationwide after a decade--or the equivalent output produced by \nhundreds of large powerplants.\n  This could result in over 10,000 MW of savings over the summer just \nin our State and much more on the Western grid that California shares \nwith neighboring States.\n  Meanwhile, this legislation will also create a market for firms to \ndevelop more energy-efficient products, such as air-conditioners, heat \npumps, lighting equipment, windows, insulation, water heaters, and \nsolar panels.\n  Just think how conditions could have improved in California during \nthe Western energy crisis if we had been able to reduce our energy \nconsumption instead of purchasing power at exorbitant rates from out-\nof-State suppliers.\n  According to the Department of Energy, California is already one of \nthe most energy-efficient States in the Nation--ranking fourth in \noverall energy efficiency and second in electricity efficiency.\n  Nevertheless, Californians responded to the crisis and further \nincreased their energy efficiency. This legislation will take energy \nefficiency to the next level and create the opportunity for all \nfamilies and businesses nationwide to make energy efficient \nimprovements.\n  Instead of waiting for the next energy emergency to occur, we should \ntake steps now to reduce energy consumption across the board.\n  The bill introduced in the 107th Congress had the support of \nCalifornia Governor Gray Davis, the California Energy Commission, the \nSacramento Municipal Utility District, the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, Union of Concerned Scientists, the California Building \nIndustry Association, most California utilities and many other \norganizations and businesses. We expect similar widespread support for \nthe bill we are reintroducing today.\n  This bill is an important step to help reduce demand. It provides \nfinancial incentives to offset some of the costs of building new \nenergy-efficient buildings and homes, and improving existing structures \nto make them more energy efficient.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Harkin, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 509. A bill to modify the authority of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission to conduct investigations, to increase the \npenalties for violations of the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act, \nto authorize the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nto contract for consultant services, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, yesterday the State of California \nsubmitted a filing to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which \nprovides a wholesale indictment of energy companies and shows how a \nnumber of energy firms engaged in deceptive trading practices to drive \nup prices in the Western Energy Market. I have called on FERC to make \nthis evidence public\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\nand I want to reiterate my request again.\n  I am also introducing a bill with Senators Fitzgerald, Harkin, Lugar, \nCantwell, Wyden, and Leahy to close a loophole which allows energy \ntrades to take place electronically, in private, with no transparency, \nrecord, audit trail or any oversight to guard against fraud and \nmanipulation.\n  But before I reintroduce this bill, I want to reiterate the important \nrevelations that have been uncovered in the past year and detail what \nwe know about yesterday's filing at FERC.\n  Last week I came to the floor to update the Senate on recent evidence \nof fraud and manipulation in the energy sector. Today I want to pick up \nwhere I left off and introduce the Energy Market Oversight Act.\n  Mr. President, I draw my colleagues' attention to a filing made at \nFERC. This ``Public Version'' is a 27-page summary of the filing with \nconfidential information removed, but it provides a detailed overview \nof the fraud and manipulation carried out by energy companies during \nthe Western energy crisis.\n  In addition to testimony by expert witnesses, 348 exhibits, \ntranscripts of depositions, tapes of trader telephone conversations, \nemails, and other data, the California parties submitted a 161-page \nbrief to FERC. The document I have inserted into the Record includes \nthe Table of Contents, the Introduction and Overview, and the \nConclusion of this 161-page document. To be clear, it is part, but not \nall of the brief filed by the State of California.\n  Mr. President, the filing submitted by the State of California \nyesterday shows that there was an extensive and coordinated attempt by \nenergy companies to engage in the following schemes to drive up prices \nin the Western Energy Market:\n\n       1. Withholding of Power--driving up prices by creating \n     false shortages;\n       2. Bidding to Exercise Market Power--suppliers bid higher \n     after the California ISO declared emergencies, knowing the \n     State would need power and be willing to pay any price to get \n     it;\n       3. Scheduling of Bogus Load, aka ``Fat Boy'' or ``Inc-\n     ing''--suppliers submitted false load schedules to increase \n     prices;\n       4. Export-Import Games, aka ``Ricochet or ``Megawatt \n     Laundering''--suppliers exported power out of California and \n     imported it back into the State in an attempt to sell power \n     at inflated prices;\n       5. Congestion Games, aka ``Death Star''--suppliers created \n     false congestion and were then paid for relieving congestion \n     without moving any power;\n       6. Double-Selling--suppliers sold reserves, but then failed \n     to keep those reserves available for the ISO;\n       7. Selling of Non-Existent Ancillary Services, aka ``Get \n     Shorty''--suppliers sold resources that were either already \n     committed to other sales or incapable of being provided;\n       8. Sharing of Non-Public Generation Outage Information--the \n     largest suppliers in California shared information from a \n     company called Industrial Information Resources that provided \n     sellers detailed, non-public information on daily plant \n     outages;\n       9. Collusion Among Sellers--sellers were jointly \n     implementing or facilitating Enron-type trading strategies;\n       10. Manipulation of the Nitrous Oxide (NOX) \n     Emission Market--sellers manipulated the market for \n     NOX emissions in the South Coast Air Quality \n     Management District through a series of wash trades that \n     created the appearance of a dramatic price increase that may \n     have been fabricated. For example, Dynegy, together with AES \n     and others, entered into a series of trades of NOx \n     credits in July and August of 2000 by which Dynegy would sell \n     a large quality of credits and then simultaneously buy back a \n     smaller quantity of credits at a higher per credit price.\n\n  We can assume that the thousands of pages filed by the California \nparties at FERC detail these examples of market abuse. At this point we \ncannot know all of the instances because the specifics remain \nconfidential, but we have plenty to go on.\n  Yesterday I wrote another letter to FERC Chairman Pat Wood asking the \nCommission to lift its ``Protective Order'' to make this information \npublic so that families and businesses harmed during the Western Energy \nCrisis can know the extent of fraud and manipulation that occurred.\n  I believe the filing yesterday presents a key decision for FERC. \nClearly the Commission cannot ignore this mountain of new evidence \nsubmitted--especially since it comes at a time when other disclosures \nhave been made to show pervasive fraud and manipulation in the Western \nEnergy Market.\n  Last month Jeffrey Richter, the former head of Enron's Short-Term \nCalifornia energy trading desk, pled guilty to conspiracy to commit \nfraud as part of Enron's well known schemes to manipulate Western \nenergy markets. Richter's plea follows that of head Enron trader Tim \nBelden in the fall of 2002. Belden admitted that he schemed to defraud \nCalifornia during the Western energy crisis and also plead guilty to \nconspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n  The Enron plea came on the heels of FERC's release of transcripts \nfrom Reliant Energy that reveal how their traders intentionally \nwithheld power from the California market in an attempt to increase \nprices. This is one of the most egregious examples of manipulation and \nit is clear and convincing evidence of coordinated schemes to defraud \nconsumers.\n  Let me read just one part of the transcript to demonstrate the greed \nbehind the market abuse by Reliant and its traders.\n  On June 20, 2000 two Reliant employees had the following conversation \nthat reveals the company withheld power from the California market to \ndrive prices up:\n\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``I don't necessarily foresee \n     those units being run the remainder of this week. In fact you \n     will probably see, in fact I know, tomorrow we have all the \n     units at Coolwater off.'' (The Coolwater plant is a 526 \n     Megawatt plant.)\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2: ``Really?''\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``Potentially. Even number \n     four. More due to some market manipulation attempts on our \n     part. And so, on number four it probably wouldn't last long. \n     It would probably be back on the next day, if not the day \n     after that. Trying to uh . . .''\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2: ``Trying to shorten supply, uh? \n     That way the price on demand goes up.''\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``Well, we'll see.''\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2: ``I can understand. That's \n     cool.''\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``We've got some term \n     positions that, you know, that would benefit.''\n\n  Six months after this incident, as the Senate Energy Committee was \nattempting to get to the bottom of why energy prices were soaring in \nthe West, the President and CEO of Reliant testified before Congress \nthat the State of California ``has focused on an inaccurate perception \nof market manipulation.''\n  Reliant's President and CEO went on to say, ``We are proud of our \ncontributions to keep generation running to try to meet the demand for \npower in California. Reliant Energy's plant and technical staffs have \nworked hard to maximize the performance of our generation.''\n  These transcripts prove otherwise and reveal the truth about market \nmanipulation in the energy sector.\n  Despite this clear and convincing evidence of fraud, on January 31 of \nthis year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chose to only give \nReliant a slap on the wrist for this behavior. The company paid only \n$13.8 million to sweep this criminal behavior under the rug and settle \nwith FERC.\n  Let me turn to some other recent examples that demonstrate how other \nenergy companies manipulated the Western Energy Market as Reliant did. \nOn December 11th, FERC finally released audio tapes that show how \ntraders at Williams conspired with AES Energy plant operators to keep \npower offline and drive prices up.\n  The tapes depict how on April 27, 2000, Williams outage coordinator \nRhonda Morgan encouraged an AES operator at the company's Alamitos \nplant to extend a plant outage because the California grid operator was \npaying ``a premium'' for power at the time. The Williams employee \nstated, ``that's one reason it wouldn't hurt Williams' feelings if the \noutage ran long.''\n  Later that day, Eric Pendergraft, a high-ranking AES employee called \nto confirm with Ms. Morgan that Williams wanted the plant to stay \noffline by saying, ``you guys were saying that it might not be such a \nbad thing if it took us a little while longer to do our work?'' ``I \ndon't want to do something underhanded,'' Ms. Morgan responded, ``but \nif there is work you can continue to do . . .'' At this point Mr. \nPendergraft interrupted to cut off their suspicious conversation, \nsaying, ``I understand. You don't have to talk anymore.''\n  Clearly, this is evidence of a calculated intent to withhold power to \nraise prices. I find it unconscionable.\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\n  Let's turn to some other examples.\n  On January 27, 2003, Michelle Marie Valencia, a 32-year-old former \nsenior energy trader for Dynegy was arrested on charges that she \nreported fictitious natural gas transactions to an industry \npublication.\n  On December 5, 2002, Todd Geiger, a former vice president on the \nCanadian natural gas trading desk for El Paso Merchant Energy, was \ncharged with wire fraud and filing a false report after allegedly \ntelling a trade publication about the prices for 48 natural gas trades \nthat he never made in an effort to boost prices and company profit.\n  These indictments are just the latest examples of how energy firms \nreported inaccurate prices to trade publications to drive energy prices \nhigher.\n  Industry publications claimed they could not be fooled by false \nprices because deviant prices are rejected, but this claim was \npredicated on the fact that everyone was reporting honestly--which we \nnow know they weren't doing.\n  CMS Energy, Williams, American Electric Power Company, and Dynegy \nhave each acknowledged that its employees gave inaccurate price data to \nindustry participants. On December 19th Dynegy agreed to pay a $5 \nmillion fine for its actions.\n  In September an Administrative Law Judge at FERC issued a landmark \nruling concluding that El Paso Corporation withheld natural gas from \nCalifornia and recommended penalty proceedings against the company. \nSince the El Paso Pipeline carries most of the natural gas to Southern \nCalifornia, this ruling has tremendous implications. The FERC \nCommissioners are expected to take up this case for a final judgement \nsoon.\n  These have been the latest revelations in a series of energy \ndisclosure bombshells that began on Monday, May 6th when the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission posted a series of documents on their \nwebsite that revealed Enron manipulated the Western Energy Market by \nengaging in a number of suspect trading strategies.\n  These memos revealed for the first time how Enron used schemes called \n``Death Star,'' ``Get Shorty,'' ``Fat Boy,'' and ``Ricochet'' to fleece \nfamilies and businesses in the West.\n  The filing made yesterday to FERC shows how other companies did \nengage in these Enron-type trading strategies. The brief submitted by \nthe State of California and others states that suppliers ``were jointly \nimplementing or facilitating Enron-type trading strategies.''\n  Let us turn to other types of fraudulent trades that many energy \nfirms have admitted to.\n  Dynegy, Duke Energy, El Paso, Reliant Resources Inc., CMS Energy \nCorp., and Williams Cos. all admitted engaging in false ``round-trip `` \nor ``wash trades.''\n  What is a ``round-trip'' trade, one might ask?\n  ``Round-trip'' trades occur when one firm sells energy to another and \nthen the second firm simultaneously sells the same amount of energy \nback to the first company at exactly the same price. No commodity ever \nactually changes hands, but when done on an exchange, these \ntransactions send a price signal to the market and they artificially \nboost revenue for the company.\n  How widespread are ``round-trip'' trades? Well, the Congressional \nResearch Service looked at trading patterns in the energy sector over \nthe last few years and reported, ``this pattern of trading suggests a \nmarket environment in which a significant volume of fictitious trading \ncould have taken place.''\n  Yet, since most of the energy trading market is unregulated by the \ngovernment, we have only a slim idea of the illusions being perpetrated \nin the energy sector.\n  Consider the following recent confessions from energy firms about \n``round-trip'' trades:\n\n       Reliant admitted 10 percent of its trading revenues came \n     from ``round-trip'' trades. The announcement forced the \n     company's President and head of wholesale trading to both \n     step down.\n       CMS Energy announced 80 percent of its trades in 2001 were \n     ``round-trip'' trades.\n\n  Remember, these trades are sham deals where nothing was exchanged, \nyet the company booked revenues from the trades.\n\n       Duke Energy disclosed that 1.1 billion dollars-worth of \n     trades were ``round-trip'' since 1999--roughly two-thirds of \n     these were done on InterContinental Exchange, which means \n     that thousands of subscribes would have seen these false \n     price signals.\n       A lawyer for J.P. Morgan Chase admitted the bank engineered \n     a series of ``round-trip'' trades with Enron.\n       Dynegy and Williams have also admitted to this round-trip \n     trading.\n       And although these trades mostly occurred with electricity, \n     there is evidence to suggest that ``round-trip'' trades were \n     made in natural gas and even broadband.\n\n  By exchanging the same amount of a commodity at the same price, I \nbelieve these companies have not engaged in meaningful transactions, \nbut deceptive practices to fool investors and possibly drive energy \nprices up for consumers.\n  It is therefore imperative that the Department of Justice, FERC, the \nSEC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and every other \noversight agency conduct an aggressive and vigorous investigation into \nall of the energy companies who participated in Western Energy Market.\n  Beyond that I believe Congress must re-examine what tools the \ngovernment needs to keep a better watch over these volatile markets \nthat are little understood. In the absence of vigilant government \noversight of the energy sector, firms have the incentive to create the \nappearance of a mature, liquid, and well-functioning market, but it is \nunclear whether such a market exists.\n  The ``round-trip'' trades, the Enron memos, and the filing at FERC \nraise questions about illusions in the energy market.\n  To this end, I believe it is critical for the Senate to act soon on \nthe legislation I offered last April to regulate online energy trading.\n  I am re-introducing this legislation to subject electronic exchanges \nlike Enron On-Line to the same oversight, reporting and capital \nrequirements as other commodity exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile \nExchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of \nTrade.\n  I am pleased Senator Fitzgerald, Senator Harkin, Senator Lugar, \nSenator Cantwell, Senator Wyden, and Senator Leahy have again signed on \nto this legislation. I am proud of the work we did in the 107th \nCongress and I hope we can complete action on this bill soon.\n  Without this type of legislation, there is insufficient authority to \ninvestigate and prevent fraud and price manipulation since parties \nmaking the trade are not required to keep a record.\n  Right now, energy transactions are regulated by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission (FERC) when there is actual delivery.\n  For example, if I buy natural gas from you, and you deliver that \nnatural gas to me, FERC has the authority to ensure that this \ntransaction is transparent and reasonably priced.\n  However, many energy transactions no longer result in delivery. A \ngiant loophole has opened where there is no government oversight when \nthese transactions are done on internet exchanges.\n  In 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in \n2000 which exempted energy and metals trading from regulatory oversight \nand excluded it completely if the trade was done electronically.\n  So today, as long as there is no delivery, there is no price \ntransparency. Again, this lack of transparency and oversight only \napplies to energy. It does not apply if you are selling wheat or pork \nbellies or any other tangible commodity.\n  And it did not take long for Enron Online, and others in the energy \nsector, to take advantage of this new freedom by trading energy \nderivatives absent any regulatory oversight.\n  Thus, after the 2000 legislation was enacted, Enron OnLine began to \ntrade energy derivatives bilaterally without being subject to proper \nregulatory oversight. It should not surprise anyone that without the \ntransparency, prices soared.\n  Just yesterday Warren Buffett published a warning in Fortune Magazine \nsaying that ``Derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction.'' \nIn his annual warning letter to shareholders about what worries him \nabout the financial markets, Warren Buffett called derivatives and the \ntrading activities that go with them ``time bombs.''\n  In the letter, Warren Buffett states, ``In recent years some huge-\nscale frauds and near-frauds have been facilitated by derivatives \ntrades. In the energy and electric utility sectors, for example, \ncompanies used derivatives and\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\ntrading activities to report great `earnings'--until the roof fell in \nwhen they actually tried to convert the derivatives-related receivables \non their balance sheets into cash.''\n  We clearly saw this with Enron.\n  Was Enron and its energy derivative trading arm, Enron-On-Line the \nsole reason California and the West had an energy crisis? No.\n  Was it a contributing factor to the crisis? I certainly believe that \nit was. Unfortunately, because of the energy exemptions in the 2000 \nCFMA, which took away the CFTC's authority to investigate, we may never \nknow for sure.\n  In the 107th Congress, this legislation was debated during \nconsideration of the Senate Energy Bill and it was the subject of a \nhearing in the Agriculture Committee, but time ran out before the \nlegislation could be marked up and passed.\n  Since that time, Senators Lugar and Harkin have made significant \nimprovements to the legislation and we have added stronger penalties \nfor market abuse and wrongdoing.\n  Today I am pleased to note that the following companies and \norganizations are supporting this legislation:\n\n       The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association,\n       The Derivatives Study Center,\n       The American Public Gas Association,\n       The American Public Power Association,\n       The California Municipal Utilities Association,\n       The Southern California Public Power Authority,\n       The Transmission Access Policy Study Group,\n       The U.S. Public Interest Research Group,\n       The Consumers Union,\n       The Consumers Federation of America,\n       Calpine,\n       Southern California Edison,\n       Pacific Gas and Electric, and\n       FERC Chairman Pat Wood.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters of support from these \norganizations and companies be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Federal Energy\n\n\n                                        Regulatory Commission,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for bringing to my \n     attention your proposed legislation on, inter alia, the \n     penalty provisions in the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the \n     Natural Gas Act (NGA), refund provisions in the FPA, and \n     federal oversight of financial transactions involving energy \n     commodities. Your amendment would expand the penalties \n     allowed under the FPA and NGA, and also allow oversight by \n     the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of financial \n     transactions involving energy commodities.\n       I support your proposed changes to the FPA and NGA. \n     Increased penalty authority will help ensure compliance with \n     the requirements of these statutes. Also, your proposed \n     changes to the FPA refund provisions will allow greater \n     protection of utility customers.\n       Finally, you know how strongly I feel about customers \n     having access to the broadest range of useful market \n     information. Greater transparency is needed in energy \n     markets. Thus, I support providing for, or clarifying, CFTC \n     or other Federal regulatory oversight of trading platforms \n     that are relied on for price discovery. However, the details \n     of your proposed changes to the Commodity Exchange Act would \n     be better addressed by the CFTC or others and I would defer \n     to them with respect to any changes to the Commodity Exchange \n     Act.\n           Best regards,\n                                                     Pat Wood III,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             PG Corporation,\n\n                               San Francisco, CA, January 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran: Congratulations on your assumption of \n     the Chairmanship of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \n     Committee. We are writing to communicate our support for an \n     important bipartisan legislative proposal considered by the \n     Committee last year to provide oversight of energy \n     derivatives trading markets.\n       As you know, the Committee considered last summer a \n     proposal introduced by Senator Feinstein and co-sponsored by \n     Senators Harkin and Lugar, S. 2724, to repeal the current \n     exemption of energy derivatives trading from the jurisdiction \n     of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''). The \n     proposal was similar to legislation offered earlier in the \n     year by Senator Feinstein as an amendment to the Senate \n     Energy Bill. Enclosed for your information is a letter that \n     was sent from our corporation to Senator Feinstein last year \n     concerning her amendment.\n       The legislation, which we hope Congress will consider again \n     this year, would re-establish authority over energy \n     derivatives trading to the CFTC, which has the most relevant \n     oversight capability, having regulated such trading prior to \n     2000. As a market participant, we believe that Senator \n     Feinstein's legislation will encourage transparency of market \n     information and ensure market stability, which in turn would \n     enable market participants to better manage risk, reduce \n     price volatility for electricity consumers and preserve \n     ultimately the viability of this marketplace.\n       We appreciate your considering our views on this important \n     issue, and look forward to working with you in the 108th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dan Richard,\n     Senior Vice President, Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                      Calpine,\n\n                                   San Jose, CA, February 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to let you know of \n     Calpine's continuing support for additional oversight of \n     certain energy derivative markets, as intended by the \n     legislation you plan to introduce again this year. While we \n     do not believe that energy trading was a primary cause of the \n     California energy crisis, we do believe there is a crisis of \n     confidence in the energy markets and that your legislation \n     will assist in restoring much needed public confidence in the \n     energy sector.\n       Specifically, we support the bill's strengthening of the \n     CFTC's anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority and its \n     provision for increased cooperation and liaison between the \n     CFTC and the FERC. We are also pleased that your legislation \n     addresses concerns about the oversight and transparency of \n     electronic trading platforms. It is important that such \n     facilities, which play a significant price discovery role in \n     the energy trading markets, be subject to appropriate \n     reporting and oversight by the CFTC.\n       However, I also understand that typical over the counter \n     bilateral trading operations, such as those that operate from \n     a trading desk where various potential counterparties are \n     separately contacted by phone or email, are not intended to \n     be treated as electronic trading facilities under your bill. \n     This is an important distinction and one that may need \n     further clarification as the bill proceeds through the \n     legislative process.\n       Calpine would like to thank you for your leadership in \n     advocating reasonable measures to ensure the integrity of \n     important energy trading markets and we stand ready to \n     provide you with any information or assistance that you may \n     need.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Joseph E. Ronan, Jr.,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government and Regulatory Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Edison International,\n\n                                   Rosemead, CA, February 4, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for asking Edison \n     International for our views on your Exempt Commodities \n     Transactions Act, soon to be reintroduced in the 108th \n     Congress. As you know, Edison shares your concern over \n     manipulation of the California electricity market by some \n     market participants, which contributed to the serious \n     problems the state faced from out-of-control energy prices. \n     Your legislation would provide transparency in the \n     electricity derivatives trading market, an industry that is \n     currently exempted from regulation under the Commodity \n     Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA).\n       I support your legislation, with a suggestion for your \n     consideration to further refine it. Our company and others \n     use energy derivatives trading to protect and hedge the \n     revenue from our power plants. This is in contrast to \n     companies that conduct middleman financial trading with no or \n     few power plants and trade to make money on financial \n     arbitrage. There should be guidance in the final language \n     which recognizes the difference between these two types of \n     businesses, particularly regarding further capital \n     requirements. Otherwise companies that trade in order to \n     hedge physical assets may be required to pay twice--once in \n     order to obtain capital for the assets and a second time in \n     order to meet any capital requirements to back their trades.\n       Thank you again for your efforts on behalf of California \n     consumers and businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               John E. Bryson,\n\n                                           Chairman, President and\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              American Public Gas Association,\n\n                                    Fairfax, VA, January 22, 2003.\n     Re amending the Commodities Exchange Act.\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Public Gas Association \n     (APGA) is very pleased that you and Senator Lugar have again \n     taken the lead to amend the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The \n     provisions you propose, which amend the CEA, are significant \n     steps towards ensuring that natural gas prices are determined \n     in a competitive and informed marketplace. We applaud your \n     efforts to undo special exclusions and exemptions granted in \n     the closing hours of the\n\n[[Page S3098]]\n\n     106th Congress, especially when those exclusions and \n     exemptions were specifically rejected by the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee.\n       The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) plays a \n     front-line role in promoting a competitive natural gas \n     marketplace. Closing the gaps that impede effective federal \n     oversight of the natural gas marketplace is essential in \n     order to foster competitive commodity futures markets and \n     protect market users and the public from fraud, manipulation, \n     and abusive practices. APGA fully supports your provisions to \n     clarify and restore the CFTC's ability to monitor activity in \n     off-exchange, or over-the-counter (OTC), derivatives markets \n     that trade substantial volumes of natural gas derivatives. \n     Your limited and measured steps ensure a fair balance between \n     free market activities and the necessary protections from bad \n     conduct, which undermines the confidence and integrity of \n     market participants and consumers.\n       Eliminating those special exclusions and exemptions, which \n     were already rejected three years ago in the committee of \n     jurisdiction, will help the CFTC meet its obligation to make \n     sure that no important trading activities fall between the \n     cracks leaving some energy markets without a federal agency \n     with oversight authority. The consumers served by public gas \n     utilities across the country will benefit from your efforts \n     because they are less likely to be victimized by activities \n     that occur in a market where the CFTC exercises oversight.\n       Again, public gas utilities and the hundreds of communities \n     that we serve commend you for your thoughtful and deliberate \n     leadership on this very important issue. While there may be \n     some who will oppose this amendment, one need not look far to \n     see whether the opposition is looking out for the best \n     interests of Wall Street or Main Street. We pledge to work \n     with you in any way we can to pass this much-needed \n     amendment. Please let me know how I can assist you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Cave,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            American Public Power Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the American Public \n     Power Association (APPA), I want to express support for the \n     intent and thrust of your legislation entitled the ``Energy \n     Market Oversight Act'' and to commend you for your leadership \n     in addressing these important consumer protection issues.\n       APPA represents the interests of more than 2,000 publicly \n     owned electric utility systems across the country, serving \n     approximately 40 million citizens. APPA member utilities \n     include state public power agencies and municipal electric \n     utilities that serve some of the nation's largest cities. \n     However, the vast majority of these publicly owned electric \n     utilities serve small and medium-sized communities in 49 \n     states, all but Hawaii. In fact, 75 percent of our members \n     are located in cities with populations of 10,000 people or \n     less.\n       It is my understanding that your legislation would provide \n     the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with \n     jurisdiction over trading in energy derivatives and other \n     financial products. APPA is particularly supportive of \n     language in your bill that would increase the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission's (FERC) ability to investigate market \n     manipulation and penalize such behavior.\n       Some of APPA's members may have concerns regarding the \n     impact the bill may have on public power, and I look forward \n     to working with you and your staff in an effort to resolve \n     these concerns. I would also like to join the California \n     Municipal Utilities Association (CMUA) in raising an issue \n     that I believe is consistent with the intent of your bill. \n     CMUA has attempted to get the California ISO to do a \n     benchmarking study comparing their costs to other ISOs \n     throughout the United States. The California ISO has informed \n     CMUA that they cannot conduct such a study because they \n     cannot get the information from other ISOs. To address this \n     problem, while keeping with your bill's goal of increasing \n     transparency, I would use you to add a provision to the bill \n     that would require FERC to gather such information as is \n     necessary from each ISO to compare their cost of services on \n     an annual basis.\n       APPA looks forward to working with you and your staff on \n     this legislation and other issues in the 108th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alan H. Richardson,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 New York Mercantile Exchange,\n\n                                                     New York, NY.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: As a result of concerns surrounding \n     the Enron bankruptcy, numerous congressional committees, \n     regulators, and financial institutions are closely examining \n     the broad impact of the collapse on American markets, \n     investors and employees. Much attention has been paid to \n     corporate governance, financial and accounting standards, and \n     market practices, with considerable focus on the energy \n     marketplace. On behalf of the New York Mercantile Exchange, \n     Inc. (``NYMEX'' or the ``Exchange''), we wish to applaud your \n     efforts to bring more accountability and greater transparency \n     to this nation's vitally important energy marketplace.\n       NYMEX is the world's largest forum for the trading and \n     clearing of energy futures contracts. As a federally \n     chartered marketplace, it is overseen by the independent \n     federal regulatory agency, the Commodity Futures trading \n     Commission (``CFTC''). NYMEX serves a diverse domestic and \n     international customer base by bringing price transparency, \n     market neutrality, competition and efficiency to energy \n     markets, and provides businesses with the financial tools to \n     deal with market uncertainty.\n       After studying your legislative proposal, we have concluded \n     that it is very worthy of support for the following reasons:\n       The proposal would refine the definition of trading \n     facility as applied to energy derivatives markets and would \n     further require that any such market not otherwise regulated \n     by the CFTC would be accountable to them.\n       In addition, the proposal would give the CFTC vitally \n     important tools to monitor such markets, including large \n     trader reporting and net capital standards.\n       The proposal would also ensure that the CFTC has the \n     authority and ability to obtain access to information \n     critical to market oversight and to make market information \n     public to the extent that the Commission determines that it \n     is in the public interest to do so.\n       With numerous reports of reduced confidence in market \n     integrity in the wake of the Enron bankruptcy, never has it \n     been more important to restore faith in the great American \n     resource, our competitive markets. S. 517's provisions \n     relating to addressing regulatory gaps in the CFTC regulatory \n     ``umbrella'' can provide an important and meaningful \n     improvement in market oversight, and is an important step in \n     building faith and confidence in a competitive energy \n     marketplace.\n       We strongly support your efforts to enhance market \n     transparency and accountability, and we look forward to \n     working with you in this important endeavor.\n           Sincerely,\n     Vincent Viola,\n       Chairman.\n     J. Robert Collins,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Southern California\n\n\n                                       Public Power Authority,\n\n                                                February 28, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Southern \n     California Public Power Authority (SCPPA), I would like to \n     express our support for your proposed legislation, the \n     ``Energy Market Oversight Act,'' which would provide more \n     authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \n     and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to \n     oversee the trading in energy derivatives and other financial \n     transactions and to investigate and punish market \n     manipulation.\n       SCPPA is a non-profit, joint action agency formed in 1980 \n     to represent the cities of Anaheim, Azusa, Banning, Burbank, \n     Cerritos, Colton, Glendale, Los Angeles, Pasadena, Riverside, \n     and Vernon; and the Imperial Irrigation District. The \n     community-owned utilities that make up SCPPA's membership \n     serve approximately five million citizens from northern Los \n     Angeles County to the Mexican border.\n       We support the intent of your legislation because we \n     believe it will enhance safeguards for consumers and foster a \n     more fully functioning competitive market. As you are well \n     aware, lack of effective market monitoring and market \n     transparency combined to allow for manipulation of the \n     markets, to the extreme detriment of California consumers. We \n     believe that federal legislation that promotes more effective \n     monitoring and remedies for fraud and market abuses will \n     improve the climate for investment in new generation, \n     increase consumer confidence, and reduce market volatility.\n       We are encouraged that this legislation increases the civil \n     and criminal penalties for manipulation, allows for prompt \n     investigatory action by FERC, and allows for an earlier \n     refund effective date when rates are not ``just and \n     reasonable.'' We think these actions will provide an improved \n     regulatory deterrent, as well as a means for swift and \n     complete refunds to consumers.\n       SCPPA commends you for taking a leadership role on these \n     critical issues and looks forward to working with you to \n     address a few issues of particular concern to our municipal \n     utility members.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bill Carnahan,\n     SCPPA Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Rural Electric\n\n\n                                      Cooperative Association,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, January 29, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I would like to take this \n     opportunity to express the appreciation of the National Rural \n     Electric Cooperative Association for our efforts to restore \n     transparency and integrity to the energy markets. We are \n     pleased that you have introduced legislation with Senators \n     Lugar, Harkin, Fitzgerald and others (the Energy Market \n     Oversight Act) that reestablished the ability of the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission to police all energy \n     derivatives\n\n[[Page S3099]]\n\n     markets for fraud and commodity price manipulation.\n       Today, consumers and investors have little confidence that \n     the energy markets are operating fairly and for the benefit \n     of all. Much blame for the current crisis in confidence can \n     be placed on the so-called ENRON exemption, adopted in 2000, \n     as part of the legislation that deregulated the over-the-\n     counter derivatives market for energy commodities.\n       The legislation created a gap in the regulation of energy \n     derivatives where price and trade manipulation can occur \n     unchecked by adequate regulatory oversight. Although the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has authority to \n     prosecute fraud and price manipulation that occurs on the \n     commodity exchanges, the CFTC has no clear authority to \n     pursue violations of the Federal anti-fraud and anti-\n     manipulation laws in the over-the-counter energy market.\n       Energy derivatives contracts, whether traded on well-\n     regulated commodities exchanges or in the over-the-counter \n     market, play an important role in determining the costs and \n     availability of electricity and other energy products to \n     consumers. But, consumers suffer when much of the market for \n     energy derivatives lacks transparency and operates without \n     accountability for manipulation and fraud, which is the case \n     for the over-the-counter markets.\n       Recent headlines underscore the need for this important \n     legislation. The news has been filed with the indictments of \n     energy traders for manipulation of the energy markets and \n     admissions by energy companies that they have engaged in \n     deceptive market practices, including wash trades on an \n     unregulated over-the-counter exchange.\n       Consumer-owned electric co-ops now purchase more than 50% \n     of their electric power on the market and are exposed to the \n     risks that an unstable market creates. As the representative \n     of America's 900 consumer-owned electric co-op utilities, the \n     NRECA believes that it is vitally important to restore \n     confidence in the energy markets by ensuring that market \n     participants have access to reliable and credible \n     information.\n       Your legislation represents an important step in creating \n     more transparent energy markets. I want to thank you for your \n     leadership on this critical issue and offer the support of \n     America's electric cooperatives in this effort to restore \n     credibility to the nation's energy markets. We look forward \n     to working with you and your staff to improve the legislation \n     as it moves forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Glenn English,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 February 7, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing to express our \n     support for the Energy Market Oversight Act being offered by \n     yourself and Senators Lugar, Cantwell and Leahy. This \n     important legislation will assure that over-the-counter \n     derivatives markets in ``exempt'' commodities such as energy \n     will be covered by federal prohibitions on fraud and \n     manipulation. This regulatory assistance comes at a critical \n     time. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's \n     Director of the Office of Market Oversight, ``energy markets \n     are in severe financial distress.'' Along with the decline in \n     credit quality in these markets, the loss of confidence and \n     trust has led to a ruin in the liquidity and depth of these \n     markets. This legislation will go a long way to address this \n     problem.\n       Derivatives are highly leveraged financial transactions, \n     and this allows investors to potentially take a large \n     position in the market without committing an equivalent \n     amount of capital. Moreover, derivatives traded in over-the-\n     counter markets are devoid of the transparency that \n     characterizes exchange-traded derivatives such as futures, \n     and this lack of transparency that characterizes exchange-\n     traded derivatives such as futures, and this lack of \n     transparency introduces a greater potential for abuse through \n     fraud and manipulation.\n       Derivatives are often combined into highly complex \n     structured transactions that are difficult--even for seasoned \n     securities traders and finance professionals--to understand \n     and price in the market. Enron used such over-the-counter \n     derivatives extensively in order to hide the nature of their \n     activities from investors. The failure of Enron and the \n     demise of other energy derivatives dealers has had a \n     devastating impact of the level of trust in energy markets.\n       This legislation would help ensure that over-the-counter \n     derivatives markets operate with proper federal oversight \n     which will make the markets more stable and transparent. It \n     is appropriate to place this oversight authority with the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission which, as the principal \n     federal regulator of derivatives transactions since its \n     founding in 1975, will provide oversight, surveillance and \n     enforcement of anti-fraud and anti-manipulation laws. The \n     CFTC has the experience to handle these complex financial \n     transactions and to develop the best rules to implement these \n     protections. The legislation also requires the cooperation of \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the entity charged \n     with overseeing the energy markets, in providing a stable and \n     honest market for the investing public.\n       At a time when these energy markets are deeply distressed \n     and the investing public looks skeptically at derivatives \n     trading and firms engaged in derivatives trading, we should \n     take decisive steps to ensure that the public is protected \n     from Enron-like abuses. This amendment is just such a step, \n     and we support it.\n       Thank you for introducing this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Adam J.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I understand that you will be \n     introducing shortly a stand-alone bill, entitled The Energy \n     Market Oversight Act, which is similar to the amendment you \n     offered last season to S. 517, the Energy Policy Act of 2002. \n     This bill would, among other things, place derivative \n     products for energy under the jurisdiction of the Commodities \n     Future Trading Commission (CFTC), and enhance the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) remedial and penal \n     authority.\n       On behalf of the Transmission Access Policy Study Group \n     (TAPS), I would like to express our support for the policy \n     objective of your proposed legislation: better protecting \n     consumers from manipulation in the volatile energy markets. \n     We look forward to working with you to refine the bill as it \n     moves through the legislative process. Expanding the CFTC and \n     FERC role in preventing and redressing energy market abuses \n     is one of a number of avenues for enhanced consumer and \n     market power protection that should be included if an \n     electricity title moves forward this year. TAPS \n     representatives would like to sit down with your staff and \n     discuss the details of your bill and related matters, when \n     convenient.\n       The other key related components of any electricity title \n     are (i) strong consumer protections, as were offered in the \n     Cantwell amendment (SA 3234) to the Energy Policy Act of \n     2002, (ii) expanding FERC's merger review authority as was \n     done in S. 517, (iii) a strong market transparency \n     requirement, and (iv) further strengthening FERC powers to \n     remedy and penalize abuses of market power and market \n     manipulation. Finally, we would strongly urge you to oppose \n     repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act this year. \n     Repealing PUHCA would lead to massive consolidation in the \n     industry, increasing dramatically opportunities for \n     manipulation of the market.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                       Roy Thilly,\n                                                    TAPS Chairman.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, here is an explanation of what this \nbill does: It applies anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority to all \nexempt commodity transactions--an exempt commodity is a commodity which \nis not financial and not agricultural and mainly includes energy and \nmetals.\n  The bill sets up two classes of swaps. For those made between \n``sophisticated persons,'' basically institutions and wealthy \nindividuals, that are not entered into on a ``trading facility''--for \nexample, an exchange--anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions apply \nand wash trades are prohibited.\n  The following regulations would apply to all swaps made on an \n``electronic trading facility'' and a ``dealer market'', which includes \ndealers who buy and sell swaps in exempt commodities, and the entity on \nwhich the swap takes place: anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions \nand the prohibition of wash trades apply; if the entity on which the \nswap takes place serves a pricing or price discovery function, \nincreased notice, reporting, bookkeeping, and other transparency \nrequirements; and the requirement to maintain sufficient capital \ncommensurate with the risk associated with the swap;\n  Except for the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions, the CFTC \nhas the discretion to tailor the above requirements to fit the \ncharacter and financial risk involved with the swap or entity. While \nthe CFTC could require daily public disclosure of trading data like \nopen and closing prices, similar to the requirements of futures \nexchanges, it could not require real-time publication of proprietary \ntrading information or prohibit an entity from selling their data.\n  The CFTC may allow entities to meet certain self-regulatory \nresponsibilities- as provided in a list of ``core principles.'' If an \nentity chose to become a\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\nself-regulator, these core principles would obligate the entity to \nmonitor trading to prevent fraud and manipulation as well as assure \nthat its other regulatory obligations are met.\n  The penalties for manipulation are greatly increased. The civil \nmonetary penalty for manipulation is increased from $100,000 to $1 \nmillion. Wash trades are subject to the monetary civil penalty for each \nviolation, and imprisonment up to 10 years.\n  The FERC is required to improve communications with other Federal \nregulatory agencies. A shortcoming in the main anti-fraud provision of \nthe CEA is also corrected by allowing CFTC enforcement of fraud to \napply to instances of either defrauding a person for oneself or on \nbehalf of others.\n  It requires the FERC and the CFTC to meet quarterly and discuss how \nenergy derivative markets are functioning and affecting energy \ndeliveries.\n  It grants the FERC the authority to use monetary penalties on \ncompanies that don't comply with requests for information. It is \nessentially the same authority that the SEC has.\n  It makes it easier for FERC to hire the necessary outside help they \nneed including accountants, lawyers, and investigators for \ninvestigative purposes.\n  It eliminates the requirement that FERC receive approval from the \nOffice of Management and Budget before launching an investigation or \nprice discovery of electricity or natural gas markets involving more \nthan 10 companies.\n  It increases the penalty amounts to $1 million instead of the current \n$5,000 for violations of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act; \nfive years instead of the current two for violations of the statute; \nand, $50,000 per violation per day instead of the current $500 for \nviolations of rules or orders under the Federal Power Act and Natural \nGas Act.\n  The Commission's authority to impose civil penalties is broadened to \nall sections of Part II of the Federal Power Act and the penalty amount \nis increased from $10,000 to $50,000 per violation per day.\n  It modifies Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to allow for an \nearlier refund effective date to increase the opportunity for refunds \nas a deterrent to fraudulent and manipulative behavior in the energy \nmarkets.\n  This legislation is not going to do anything to change what happened \nin California and the West. But it does provide the necessary authority \nfor the CFTC and FERC which will help protect against another energy \ncrisis.\n  When regulatory agencies have the will but not the authority to \nregulate, Congress must step in and ensure that our regulators have the \nnecessary tools. Unfortunately, sometimes an agency has neither. In \nthis case I am glad to have the support of FERC and I hope that the \nCFTC will reconsider and support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 510. A bill to establish a commercial truck highway safety \ndemonstration program in the State of Maine, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nSenator Collins, to introduce legislation, the Commercial Truck Highway \nSafety Demonstration Program Act, to create a safety pilot program for \ncommercial trucks.\n  This bill would authorize a safety demonstration program in my home \nState of Maine that could be a model for other States. I have been \nworking closely with the Maine Department of Transportation, \ncommunities in my State, and others to address statewide concerns about \nthe existing Federal interstate truck weight limit of 80,000 pounds.\n  I believe that safety must be the No. 1 priority on our roads and \nhighways, and I am very concerned that the existing interstate weight \nlimit has the perverse impact of forcing commercial trucks onto State \nand local secondary roads that were never designed to handle heavy \ncommercial trucks safely. We are talking about narrow roads, lanes, and \nrotaries, with frequent pedestrian crossings and school zones.\n  I have been working to address this concern for many years. During \nthe 105th Congress, for example, I authored a provision providing a \nwaiver from Federal weight limits on the Maine Turnpike, the 100-mile \nsection of Maine's interstate in the southern portion of the State, and \nit was signed into law as part of TEA-21. I have also shared my \nconcerns with the Department of Transportation and the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to urge them to work with me in \nan effort to address this challenge.\n  In addition, the Main Department of Transportation is in the process \nof conducting a study of the truck weight limit waiver on the Maine \nTurnpike, and I have been working closely with the State in the hopes \nof expanding this study, which will focus on the safety impact of \nhigher limits, infrastructure issues, air quality issues, and economic \nissues as well, in order to secure the data necessary to ensure that \ncommercial trucks operate in the safest possible manner.\n  Federal law attempts to provide uniform truck weight limits, 80,000 \npounds, on the Interstate System, but the fact is there are a myriad of \nexemptions and grandfathering provisions. Furthermore, interstate \nhighways have safety features specifically designed for heavy truck \ntraffic, whereas the narrow, winding State and local roads don't.\n  The legislation I am submitting today would simply direct the \nSecretary of Transportation to establish a 3-year pilot program to \nimprove commercial motor vehicle safety in the State of Maine. \nSpecifically, the measure would direct the Secretary, during this \nperiod, to waive Federal vehicle weight limitations on certain \ncommercial vehicles weighing over 80,000 pounds using the Interstate \nSystem within Maine, permitting the State to set the weight limit. In \naddition, it would provide for the waiver to become permanent unless \nthe Secretary determines it has resulted in an adverse impact on \nhighway safety.\n  I believe this is a measured, responsible approach to a very serious \npublic safety issue. I hope to work with all of those with a stake in \nthis issue, safety advocates, truckers, States, and communities, to \naddress this matter in the most effective possible way, and I hope that \nmy colleagues will join me in this effort.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to join with my senior colleague \nfrom Maine in sponsoring the Commercial Truck Highway Safety \nDemonstration Program Act, an important bill that addresses a \nsignificant safety problem in our State.\n  Under current law, trucks weighing as much as 100,000 pounds are \nallowed to travel on Interstate 95 from Maine's border with New \nHampshire to Augusta, our capital city. At Augusta, trucks weighing \nmore than 80,000 pounds are forced off Interstate 95, which proceeds \nnorth to Houlton. Heavy trucks are forced onto smaller, secondary roads \nthat pass through cities, towns, and villages.\n  Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are permitted on interstate \nhighways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York as well as the \nCanadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. The weight limit \ndisparity on various segments of Maine's Interstate Highway System \nforces trucks traveling to and from destinations in these States and \nprovinces to use Maine's State and local roads, nearly all of which \nhave two lanes, rather than four. Consequently, many Maine communities \nalong the interstate see substantially more truck traffic than would \notherwise be the case if the weight limit were 100,000 pounds for all \nof Maine's interstate highways.\n  The problem Maine faces because of the disparity in truck weight \nlimit is perhaps most pronounced in our State capital. Augusta is the \nMaine Turnpike's northern terminus where heavy trucks that are \nprohibited from traveling along the northern segment of Interstate 95 \nenter and exit the turnpike. The high number of trucks that must \ntraverse Augusta's local roads, and particularly its two rotaries, \ncreates a hazard for those who live and work in as well as visit the \ncity.\n  The Maine Department of Transportation estimates that the truck \nweight disparity sends 310 vehicles in excess of 80,000 pounds through \nAugusta every day. These vehicles, which are sometimes transporting \nhazardous materials, must pass through Cony Circle, one of the State's \nmost dangerous traffic circles and the scene of 130 accidents per year. \nThe fact that the circle\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\nis named for the 1,200 student high school that it abuts adds to the \nseverity of the problem.\n  A uniform truck weight limit of 100,000 pounds on Maine's interstate \nhighways would reduce the highway miles and travel times necessary to \ntransport freight through Maine, resulting in economic and \nenvironmental benefits. Moreover, Maine's extensive network and local \nroads will be better preserved without the wear and tear of heavy truck \ntraffic. Most important, however, a uniform truck weight limit will \nkeep trucks on the interstate where they belong, rather than on roads \nand highways that pass through Maine's cities, towns, and \nneighborhoods.\n  The legislation that Senator Snowe and I are introducing addresses \nthe safety issues we face in Maine because of the disparities in truck \nweight limits. The legislation directs the Secretary of Transportation \nto establish a commercial truck safety pilot program in Maine. Under \nthe pilot program, the truck weight limit on all Maine highways that \nare part of the Interstate Highway System would be set at 100,000 \npounds for 3 years. During the waiver period, the Secretary would study \nthe impact of the pilot program on safety, and would receive the input \nof a panel that would include State officials, safety organizations, \nmunicipalities, and the commercial trucking industry. The waiver would \nbecome permanent if the panel determined that motorists were safer as a \nresult of a uniform truck weight limit on Maine's Interstate Highway \nSystem.\n  Maine's citizens and motorists are needlessly at risk because too \nmany heavy trucks are forced off the interstate and on to local roads. \nThe legislation Senator Snowe and I are introducing is a commonsense \napproach to a significant safety problem in my State. I hope my \ncolleagues will support passage of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3101-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3101-S3102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 71--EXPRESSING THE SUPPORT FOR THE PLEDGE OF \n                               ALLEGIANCE\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \nAllen, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Bennett.

ELIGIBILITY AND USE OF FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Requirements.--The Secretary shall prescribe \n     requirements for applications by States for funding, \n     including provisions for auditing of and reporting on the use \n     of the funds and criteria to ensure that weed management \n     entities recognized by States are capable of carrying out \n     projects, monitoring and reporting on the use of funds, and \n     are knowledgeable about and experienced in noxious weed \n     management and represent private and public interests \n     adversely affected by noxious weeds. Eligible activities for \n     funding shall include--\n       (1) applied research to solve locally significant weed \n     management problems and solutions, except that such research \n     may not exceed 8 percent of the available funds in any year;\n       (2) incentive payments to encourage the formation of new \n     weed management entities, except that such payments may not \n     exceed 25 percent of the available funds in any year; and\n       (3) projects relating to the control or eradication or \n     noxious weeds, including education, inventories and mapping, \n     management, monitoring, and similar activities, including the \n     payment of the cost of personnel and equipment that promote \n     such control or eradication, and other activities to promote \n     such control or eradication, if the results of the activities \n     are disseminated to the public.\n       (b) Project Selection.--A State shall select projects for \n     funding to a weed management entity on a competitive basis \n     considering--\n       (1) the seriousness of the noxious weed problem or \n     potential problem addressed by the project;\n       (2) the likelihood that the project will prevent or resolve \n     the problem, or increase knowledge about resolving similar \n     problems in the future;\n       (3) the extent to which the payment will leverage non-\n     Federal funds to address the noxious weed problem addressed \n     by the project;\n       (4) the extent to which the weed management entity has made \n     progress in addressing noxious weed problems;\n       (5) the extent to which the project will provide a \n     comprehensive approach to the control or eradication of \n     noxious weeds;\n       (6) the extent to which the project will reduce the total \n     population of a noxious weed;\n       (7) the extent to which the project uses the principles of \n     integrated vegetation management and sound science; and\n       (8) such other factors that the State determines to be \n     relevant.\n       (c) Information and Report.--As a condition of the receipt \n     of funding, States shall require such information from grant \n     recipients as necessary and shall submit to the Secretary a \n     report that describes the purposes and results of each \n     project for which the payment or award was used, by not later \n     than 6 months after completion of the projects.\n       (d) Federal Share.--The Federal share of any project or \n     activity approved by a State or Indian tribe under this Act \n     may not exceed 50 percent unless the State meets criteria \n     established by the Secretary that accommodates situations \n     where a higher percentage is necessary to meet the needs of \n     an underserved area or addresses a critical need that can not \n     be met otherwise.\n\n     SEC. 6. LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (A) Landowner Consent; Land Under Cultivation.--Any \n     activity involving real property, either private or public, \n     may be carried out under this Act only with the consent of \n     the landowner and no project may be undertaken on property \n     that is devoted to the cultivation of row crops, fruits, or \n     vegetables.\n       (b) Compliance With State Law.--A weed management entity \n     may carry out a project to address the noxious weed problem \n     in more than one State only if the entity meets the \n     requirements of the State laws in all States in which the \n     entity will undertake the project.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--Funding under this Act may not be used \n     to carry out a project--\n       (1) to control or eradicate animals, pests, or submerged or \n     floating noxious aquatic weeds; or\n       (2) to protect an agricultural commodity (as defined in \n     section 102 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. \n     5602)) other than--\n       (A) livestock (as defined in section 602 of the \n     Agricultural Trade Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1471); or\n       (B) an animal- or insect-based product.\n\n     SEC. 7.

Res. 73\n\n       Whereas mankind lost 7 heroes with the tragic explosion of \n     the Space Shuttle Columbia on February 1, 2003;\n       Whereas the families and friends of the 7 astronauts, the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the entire \n     Nation, and people around the world who followed the historic \n     mission will deeply miss the 7 crew members of the Space \n     Shuttle Columbia;\n       Whereas the astronauts made an important contribution as \n     models of bravery, courage, and excellence for men, women, \n     and children around the world;\n       Whereas 2 of these heroes, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel \n     Michael Anderson and Navy Commander William ``Willie'' \n     McCool, are particularly close to the hearts of residents of \n     the State of Washington;\n       Whereas Lieutenant Colonel Anderson was a beloved son of \n     the Spokane community since moving there at the age of 11, \n     and a cherished hero for men, women, and children in \n     Washington;\n       Whereas Lieutenant Colonel Anderson was a hero, long before \n     accepting the challenge of the Columbia mission, for leading \n     a life characterized by courage, achievement against many \n     odds, and sacrifice for this country;\n       Whereas the story of Lieutenant Colonel Anderson is even \n     more remarkable in light of the barriers to success that \n     young African-Americans in this country have had to overcome;\n       Whereas this remarkable story has long been shared at the \n     childhood church of Lieutenant Colonel Anderson and \n     throughout the\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\n     Spokane African-American community, and has inspired a \n     generation of children;\n       Whereas throughout his early education in Spokane area \n     public schools, Lieutenant Colonel Anderson focused on \n     voyaging to space as an astronaut and became an exceptional \n     science student;\n       Whereas since becoming an astronaut in 1994, Lieutenant \n     Colonel Anderson took to heart the special responsibility of \n     serving as a role model for children around the country and \n     back home;\n       Whereas after his 1998 flight on the Space Shuttle Endeavor \n     to the Mir Space Station, Lieutenant Colonel Anderson \n     returned to Cheney High School in Spokane and told a crowd of \n     enthralled students that dreams such as his of becoming an \n     astronaut can be achieved with hard work and clear goals;\n       Whereas Lieutenant Colonel Anderson embodied excellence and \n     provided a triumphant example of accomplishment for Americans \n     of all colors, races, and backgrounds;\n       Whereas the Washington family lost another dear friend in \n     Commander McCool, who made Anacortes, Washington his home \n     during 2 periods of service at Naval Air Station Whidbey \n     Island;\n       Whereas community members remember Commander McCool for his \n     kindness, professionalism, and love of his children;\n       Whereas Commander McCool continued to pay visits to the \n     Anacortes community and was a cherished member of the \n     community; and\n       Whereas Lieutenant Colonel Anderson and Navy Commander \n     McCool will be missed but never forgotten: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate remembers and honors the heroic \n     lives of astronauts Lieutenant Colonel Michael Anderson and \n     Commander William McCool.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3107-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MARCH 5, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I further ask unanimous consent that following the \nprayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of \nproceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be \nreserved for their use later in the day, and that there then be a \nperiod of morning business until the hour of 11 a.m., with the time \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees; provided \nfurther that at 11 a.m. the Senate then resume executive session and \nthe consideration of the Estrada nomination; that the time until 12 \nnoon be equally divided between the chairman and ranking member or \ntheir designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I wonder if it would be helpful--unless I \nam reading this wrong--it would be helpful if either the majority or \nminority have the first 45 minutes of the morning business time; \notherwise we have people waiting around trying to find out when to \nspeak. We have no problem as to when we do it, either first or last, \nbut if we can do that, that would be helpful.\n  Mr. FRIST. My understanding is you would have the first half and we \nwould have the second half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the information of all Senators, tomorrow there will \nbe a period of morning business to allow Senators to introduce \nlegislation and also to make statements. At 11 a.m. we will once again \nresume the Estrada nomination.\n  As a reminder to our colleagues, the cloture motion was filed on the \nEstrada nomination earlier this afternoon. That cloture vote will occur \non Thursday morning and Members will be notified as soon as a specific \ntime is locked in for the vote.\n  Under a previous unanimous consent agreement, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the Moscow Treaty at noon tomorrow. Relevant \namendments are in order to the resolution of ratification, and \ntherefore Senators should expect rollcall votes during tomorrow's \nsession.\n  While I regret that such action had to be taken, in terms of the \nfiling of cloture, I believe it is in the best interests of the Senate \nto move this process forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/04/senate-section/article/S3107-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
