Mr. President, I welcome everybody back from a short \nrecess over the Thanksgiving holiday. I hope everyone did have a safe \nand a restful period after a very busy 3 to 4 weeks just prior to that. \nI hope everybody had an opportunity to spend good time, quality time \nwith family and friends.\n  As I announced before the break, we have returned today with the hope \nof completing our work on the appropriations process. Chairman Stevens \nfinished the negotiations on the omnibus measure, and that conference \nreport was filed in the House of Representatives before we departed for \nThanksgiving.\n  Today, we hope to take up that conference report and dispose of it, \nalthough I understand this will not be possible. I will be discussing \nmomentarily other options with the Democratic leader and will likely be \npropounding a unanimous consent request for consideration of the \nomnibus bill here later this morning.\n  We will not have any rollcall votes today, but in addition to any \nagreements we may reach here on the omnibus measure, we would like to \nalso consider other legislative and executive matters that can be \ncleared over the course of the day. Specifically, there are a large \nnumber of important executive nominations that are pending on the \ncalendar that I hope we will be able to address. Again, I will be \nworking with the Democratic leader to proceed to any of these \nnoncontroversial nominations before we conclude our business today.\n  At this juncture, I will be happy to yield to the Democratic leader, \nand then likely we will go into a period of morning business, and we \nwill have a discussion about the further plans for the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16082-5", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I, too, hope they all had a good \nThanksgiving holiday, and I appreciate the work that has been done at \nthe staff level over the course of the last couple weeks as we have \nprepared for this day.\n  I look forward to our discussions in the next couple of minutes with \nregard to how we might proceed. I have a more extensive statement with \nregard to the omnibus appropriations bill that I will make at a later \ntime.\n  Obviously, there are some executive nominations that we believe could \nbe addressed. We have been working together to find how we might move a \nlarge number of them today, and I hope before the end of this day we \nwill have completed our work on that as well.\n  I look forward to working with the majority leader and our colleagues \nin the hope we can make this a very productive day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Is there objection? The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object--and I will have a \nlengthier statement--I ask unanimous consent, instead, that later \ntoday, at a time to be determined by the two leaders, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of a resolution to correct the flaws in \nthe omnibus appropriations bill by: Reinstating the Senate-passed \nprovision to prohibit the administration's plan to abolish overtime for \n8 million workers; reinstating the Senate-passed provision on media \nownership; striking the House language blocking the implementation of \ncountry-of-origin labeling; striking the provision that weakens the \nbackground check requirements of the Brady bill; striking the provision \nto impose a voucher system on the DC public school system; striking the \nprovision to allow the contracting out of over 400,000 Federal jobs and \nreinstating the House-passed language; and striking the provisions \nimposing arbitrary across-the-board cuts to education, Head Start, \nveterans health care, highway construction, and other needed programs. \nI further ask consent that the resolution be subject to 1 hour of \ndebate equally divided, that no amendments or motions be in order, and \nthat after the expiration of the time, the bill be agreed to and sent \nto the House of Representatives. Finally, I ask consent that upon \napproval of this correcting resolution by the House, the omnibus \nappropriations bill be agreed to by the Senate, and that it be sent to \nthe President for his signature.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the leader so modify his request?\n  Mr. FRIST. I object to the Democratic leader's request.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, then I object to the request made by the \nmajority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, both requests have thus far been objected \nto; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to the conference report to \naccompany the omnibus bill, provided, further, that there be 5 hours \nfor debate to be equally divided in the usual form. I further ask \nconsent that following the use or yielding back of debate time, the \nSenate proceed to a vote on the adoption of the conference report, with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am not surprised by these objections. I \nthink that a number of colleagues, including the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia and others on their side, have been very open and \nforthright with their intent to object to this legislation.\n  The conference report was filed before Thanksgiving, and it was my \nhope that over the intervening period of time people would have had the \nopportunity to review the language before we proceeded. I hope they \nhave taken that opportunity to do so.\n\n[[Page S16083]]\n\n  Given the objections we have just heard, it appears as though we will \nneed to file cloture on the measure to assure a vote on the conference \nreport. That cloture vote will occur on January 20. It is my hope that \nduring this period Members will take the additional time to review it \nso everyone can fully understand the importance of much of the funding \nin this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16083-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n      RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I think much \nof what is in the Foreign Operations bill and part of the real focus of \nthe proposed unanimous consent request is on global HIV/AIDS funding. \nAs most in this body know, I do believe HIV/AIDS has presented the \ngreatest moral, humanitarian, and public health challenge of really the \nlast 100 years, if you look at the impact it is having.\n  We are under a continuing resolution and I have looked very closely \nto make sure that sufficient moneys will not be interrupted over the \nintervening period of time.

Mr. President, unless the majority leader has additional \ncomments, I wish to take a few moments to address my concerns about the \ncurrent draft of the appropriations bill.\n  I believe the appropriations process has fallen apart. This is a \nFrankenstein monster of a bill born of a badly broken process. It is \ntime to send it back to the laboratory.\n  At the beginning of the year, we were told the White House and the \nSenate Republican leadership would make sure the appropriations process \nran more smoothly than ever before. In fact, the process broke down to \nan extent never seen before, opening the door to the worst kind of \nlegislative abuses and special interest giveaways.\n  This bill, this monstrosity, combines 7 appropriations bills, \nincluding 11 of 15 Cabinet-level Departments, comprising $820 billion \nin Government spending. To agree to a unanimous consent request this \nmorning I believe would represent a shocking abrogation of our \nresponsibilities to the people of this country. We have not finished \nuntil 2\\1/2\\ months into the fiscal year. This was supposed to have \nbeen done on October 1. It is now early December.\n  These delays are becoming regrettably common. But what makes this \nomnibus unique is its utter disregard for the expressed will of each \nHouse of Congress. The process was an abomination, closed largely to \nDemocrats, hidden from the light of day, written to satisfy nothing \nmore than special interest wish lists.\n  It didn't have to be this way. The Senate passed 12 of the 13 \nappropriations bills by wide bipartisan margins. The House passed 13 \nappropriations bills with wide margins. None of the bills posed \ndifficulties. The only reason the process was handled this way was to \nram through divisive provisions and pork spending that could never win \nthe support of the Congress on their own.\n  I thank Chairman Stevens and especially my ranking member, Senator \nByrd, for the work they did to avoid this calamity. They understand the \nproper process and worked to employ it in this case. However, they were \noverruled by the White House and Republican leadership. That's why we \nfind ourselves in this regrettable situation today.\n  This brand of legislating opens the door to the most ludicrous \nexamples of pork spending, which has contributed to citizens' loss of \nfaith in the process itself.\n\n[[Page S16084]]\n\n  Even the conservative Taxpayers for Common Sense said:\n\n       This bill includes thousands of frivolous, bizarre, and \n     special interest earmarks for every congressional district in \n     the nation.\n\n  For example, in this bill, somewhere in these pages, you will find $2 \nmillion to encourage young people to play golf; half a million dollars \nfor halibut data collection; money for a replica mule barn in LaSalle, \nIL; and most ironic, a half a million dollars for the ``Exercise in \nHard Choices'' Program at the University of Akron which attempts to \nreplicate House and Senate meetings in which congressional members \nreview a budget and vote to include or exclude various options.\n  Alongside this kind of wasteful spending, this bill includes several \nmean-spirited damaging offsetting cuts. These cuts will result in \n24,000 fewer children who will be served by title I educational \nprograms; 5,500 fewer kids will be able to attend Head Start; 26,500 \nfewer veterans will receive medical care; and $170 million will be cut \nfrom needed highway construction projects. I could go on all day.\n  What is most troubling about this bill is the fact that some of the \nmost egregious provisions that were sneaked into this bill at the last \nminute had already been rejected by one or both Houses of Congress. The \nfact that the White House directed conferees to include them shows a \ncontempt both for the procedures of Congress and the citizens they were \ndesigned to protect.\n  This bill once more allows the White House to end overtime protection \nfor American workers. The Senate voted to stop the White House's plan \nby a vote of 54 to 45. The House agreed by a vote of 221 to 203. The \nreason is clear. Ending overtime is bad for working families, and it is \nbad for the economy. At this precarious moment for our economy, the \nWhite House's plan would deliver a pay cut to 8 million workers, \nincluding emergency medical personnel, criminal investigators, nurses, \nphysician assistants, teachers, agriculture inspectors, and more.\n  Overtime accounts for nearly a quarter of these workers' take-home \npay. For many Americans, their overtime offers them the chance to save \nfor college or a down-payment for a house, or simply to meet their \nmedical bills. It has been vital protection for workers for the past 70 \nyears, and now Congress's defense of working families, overwhelmingly \napproved by both the Senate and in the House, mysteriously was stripped \nfrom this bill.\n  Media ownership is another example. Real damage to our democracy \noccurs when a few companies control the airwaves. We had broad \nbipartisan support for maintaining the limits--wide majorities, again, \nin both the House and the Senate.\n  After first agreeing to retain the language passed by the House and \nSenate to limit the number of stations a network can own, conferees \nbowed to White House pressure to permanently raise the limit to make it \neasier on media conglomerates, again, directly overturning rollcall \nvotes taken in the House and Senate on media ownership. Mysteriously, \nonce more, the legislation confronted reality and the sentiment of the \nMembers of both bodies.\n  Consider country-of-origin labeling: The omnibus legislation I have \nin front of me includes language actually delaying the implementation \nof country-of-origin labeling for 2 years. The Senate passed country-\nof-origin labeling on two occasions--in May of 2002 as part of the farm \nbill, as well as just last month with a vote of 56 to 32.\n  Consumers deserve the right to make informed choices. The economic \nbenefit to farmers and ranchers in struggling rural communities could \nnot be more apparent. It was supported by 167 farm organizations \nrepresenting 50 million Americans but opposed by the four meatpackers \nthat control 80 percent of the U.S. beef market. They worked behind the \nscenes to kill this rule and that, too, is in this legislation.\n  This bill also undermines our ability to stop gun crimes: This bill \nrequires the destruction of background check records within 24 hours. \nCurrent law requires records to be maintained for 90 days. It is vital \nto the war on terror, as well as to domestic violence cases, that \nretention of these records be maintained. The retention of records has \nbeen critical to audit NICS and correct mistaken approvals. We will no \nlonger have that ability as a result of the provisions included in this \nbill.\n\n  The General Accounting Office reports that the 90-day retention \nallowed the FBI to retrieve 235 guns that were bought by people with \ncriminal records.\n  We also had a big debate--a very aggressive debate--about DC \nvouchers. We stripped out the provision that was reinserted to \ncircumvent Democratic objections. There was no accountability here. In \naddition, we are undermining the Washington, DC, schools to advance a \ntheory that absolutely has no evidence to back it up. Vouchers threaten \nto create two-tiered education system in which more children each year \nare left behind. But as with the other controversial provisions, \nvouchers, for the first time at the Federal level, are in this bill.\n  This bill also undermines our protection of federal workers. Language \nwas dropped that blocked the OMB plan to contract out 400,000 Federal \nworkers. The conferees had reached a bipartisan compromise, but that \nwas rejected by the White House. What remains provides so many \nloopholes for OMB that the Federal workers have very little protection.\n  This bill is to good legislating what a dank basement corner is to \ngood housekeeping. Both could stand a good dose of sunlight, and that \nis just what we intend to do.\n  We will not allow this bill to be sneaked through a procedural back \ndoor when no one is looking. It may mean further delay, but 1 more \nmonth of delay is nothing compared to the enduring damage this bill \nwill cause to the Senate, our Government, and our Nation.\n\n\n         Extension of the Federal Unemployment Benefits Program\n\n  Mr. President, with regard to the unanimous consent request I had \nmade, this holiday season is bringing the same bad news that millions \nof jobless workers heard last year. Nearly 3 million Americans have \nlost their jobs; 2.6 million in manufacturing alone. The number of \npeople looking for work for more than 6 months has now tripled since \nthe beginning of the Bush administration.\n  In fact, the economy would have to create over 347,000 jobs per month \njust to keep the Bush administration from having the worst rate of job \ncreation of any administration since the Great Depression.\n  Today, there are three job seekers for every job opening. Yet the \nRepublican leadership in the Congress is again refusing to address this \nurgent problem.\n  During this holiday season, the temporary Federal Unemployment \nBenefits Program will expire. This means each week after December 21, \nmore than 80,000 Americans will run out of their State unemployment \nbenefits. These workers will not be eligible for any additional \nassistance.\n  Last fall, before Congress adjourned, the Senate worked on a \nbipartisan basis to ensure that unemployment workers would not be left \nout in the cold. Unfortunately, the House Republican leadership decided \nto turn its back on these families, and the administration has failed \nto act as well. As a result, thousands of workers were stranded until \nCongress reconvened, and we were able to pass an extension. Over the \nlast several weeks, Senate Democrats have repeatedly propounded \nunanimous consent requests to pass an extension to the Federal \nUnemployment Insurance Program. We faced Republican objections every \ntime. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay went so far as to say he sees no \nreason to extend the Federal unemployment compensation program.\n  Clearly, inaction is an unacceptable position. It was last year, and \nit remains so this year. Since it appears Congress may not return until \nthe end of January, it is now even more urgent that the administration \ninfluence congressional Republicans to work with us to pass a 6-month \nextension before Congress adjourns.\n  As we approach the holiday season, we have to ensure that families \nare not left without the ability to make ends meet while searching for \nemployment.\n\n\n                  Foreign Operations Conference Report\n\n  Mr. President, finally, let me briefly explain why I felt the need to \nask unanimous consent to pass the Foreign Operations conference report. \nAIDS is the worse public health crisis the world has ever known. Mr. \nPresident, 8,000 people--8,000--die each and every day;\n\n[[Page S16085]]\n\n15,000 people contract HIV every day, the majority of them young \npeople.\n  The Foreign Operations conference report provides $800 million for an \nincrease--a much needed increase--in the Global AIDS Program. It is a \npositive step in our effort to fight and defeat this pandemic. It \nshould have been done 2 months ago. We should not have to wait another \n2 months. The crisis is simply too pressing.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership and the House Appropriations \nCommittee would have us wait. There are a lot of controversial items in \nthis huge omnibus, but let's be clear: The Foreign Operations \nconference report and the increased AIDS funding is certainly not one \nof them. Foreign Operations was signed by every single conferee. It was \nminutes from being filed. Unfortunately, some Republicans intervened \nand demanded that it be rolled into the larger bill.\n  Why? Because they wanted increased leverage on the omnibus and the \ncontroversial policy provisions, provisions that go against the will of \nbipartisan majorities in both Houses of Congress.\n  So let's be clear. The reason they insisted on this was to hold \nincreased AIDS funding hostage to these special interest giveaways. In \na season of disappointments, that is especially disappointing. So I am \nvery deeply disappointed that by unanimous consent we could not take up \na bill that had passed unanimously in conference, signed by all the \nconferees, recognizing that 8,000 people who die every day will not get \nthe kind of attention, the resources, the commitment, and the response \nthey so desperately need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16085-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ARMY CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER BRIAN VAN DUSEN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to remember a native of Columbus, \nOH, a brave man who sacrificed his life to save another, that of a \nlittle Iraqi girl who had been severely injured in an explosion near \nthe Tigris River. That man is Army CWO Brian Van Dusen. On May 9, 2003, \nBrian, age 39, and fellow soldiers, CWO Hans Gukeisen from Lead, SD, \nand CPL Richard Carl from King Hill, ID, were killed when their air \nmedical helicopter crashed after that little girl had been safely \ncarried away in a separate aircraft.\n  These three men were selfless. They were courageous. They understood \nhow precious human freedom is and how precious human life is. At a \nmemorial service for them at Fort Carson, CO, Chaplain James Ellison \nsaid: Our last act can demonstrate our life's purpose.\n  Indeed, Brian Van Dusen's purpose was to preserve and protect freedom \nfor his children and his family, for us and our families, and, yes, for \nthat little girl in Iraq and her family. He gave his last full measure \nof devotion so that a little girl whom he did not know, a little girl \nliving in a land far away from his own children, could grow up and live \nher life in freedom with a future filled with hope and opportunity.\n  Brian Van Dusen had been flying military helicopters for 19 years. He \nwas stationed with the 571st Air Ambulance Medical Company in Fort \nCarson. In fact, he voluntarily deferred a post in Germany so that he \nwould be deployed with his own company to Iraq. He chose to go to Iraq \nbecause he believed in saving lives, and he believed in what we were \ndoing. He wanted to go.\n  He did, in fact, save lives. He also wanted to bring hope to the \nIraqi people, especially the children. He also wanted to serve our \ncountry.\n  When he left for Iraq, Brian filled his duffle bag full of lollipops \nthat he would give to the children in Iraq. Not only did he give all of \nthose lollipops away but he wrote letters home asking his wife to send \neven more.\n  Brian Van Dusen cared. His friends and family say he had a gentle \nmanner; that he was a family man, a loving husband to his wife \nBridgette and devoted father to his younger children Angel and Joseph \nand to his older children Joshua and Kelly. Bridgette described him as \na selfless man and a wonderful father.\n  From Iraq, he took the time to write home regularly to send his love \nand make sure Angel and Joseph were learning to ride their mini-\nmotorcycles. ``Make sure mommy takes you riding,'' he wrote. He loved \nhis children and his family with all of his heart.\n  Brian Van Dusen also loved NASCAR and was an avid hunter. He \ncherished the deer hunting trips he took with his older brother David. \nAs David so eloquently said after Brian's death:\n\n       You just can't take anything for granted. I'm going to miss \n     him. He was a good brother and a great father. God bless \n     him--wherever he is.\n\n  Brian Van Dusen was a man of great devotion. He was devoted to his \nwife. He was devoted to his children. He was devoted to our Nation. He \ngave of himself in every way. He served selflessly with compassion, \ncourage, and strength. Clare Booth Luce once said that courage is the \nladder on which all other virtues mount. Without question, CWO Brian \nVan Dusen's courage created a ladder with rungs of great virtue. He is \nan American hero who will live on in our hearts and minds forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the House passed the fiscal \nyear 2004 omnibus appropriations bill by a bipartisan vote. Republicans \nand Democrats alike joined in adopting this bill. I had hoped today the \nSenate could be given the opportunity to pass this bill which would \nfund a variety of programs critical to the American people and indeed \nthe world.\n  That does not seem possible now, but the consequences of delay on \nthis bill are real and the dangers are great. Many people will be \naffected by this delay. One of the bills included in the omnibus \nappropriations bill is the foreign operations budget. That measure \nincludes increases in funds to combat the world's growing AIDS \nepidemic. With the support of Democrats and Republicans alike, $2.4 \nbillion was added to this bill to combat AIDS, tuberculosis, and \nmalaria around the world. This money would be used to buy life-giving \nmedicines to treat people suffering with AIDS. It will help save the \nlives of mothers, fathers, and their children afflicted by this deadly \ndisease of AIDS.\n  If they have to wait another month or two, will it make a difference? \nUnfortunately, the stark answer is yes.\n  Bono, the founder of Data, a worldwide humanitarian group, has urged \nus to pass this bill now. He knows better than most of us what a delay \nwill mean to the people on the ground who wait patiently for our help. \nCan they wait another month or two? Probably not.\n  Closer to home, there are others who will suffer if this measure is \ndelayed. Our conferees provided an increase of $38 million to provide \nmore AIDS drugs domestically through the AIDS drug assistance program \nat the Health and Human Services Department.\n  Our Nation's veterans will be among groups hit hardest by a delay on \nthis bill.\n  Again, on a bipartisan basis, the Senate led the way in providing \nadditional funds to make sure America's veterans will get the medical \ntreatment they were promised. In my own State of Alaska, some veterans \nhave had to wait months for a basic doctor's appointment. \nUnfortunately, the veterans in Alaska are not alone. The waiting lists \nfor veterans around the country, from Arizona to West Virginia, North \nDakota to Florida, are on the rise. As veterans return from Iraq, the \ndemand for medical care will increase even more. Coupled with the 1 \npercent attrition rate for VA doctors per month--I repeat that, a 1 \npercent attrition rate in VA doctors per month--the waiting periods for \nveterans will only get longer with this delay.\n  Likewise, without the additional money provided in the bill, 48 \ncommunity-based outpatient clinics will be in jeopardy. Since the VA is \nforced to operate under the lower funding level provided in the \ncontinuing resolution, those clinics cannot open. In addition, pharmacy \ncosts are going up for our Nation's veterans. In 2003, drug costs rose \nby a whopping 11 percent. The VA is incurring increased demands for \nprescriptions every month. To cover the high cost of drugs, the VA has \nbeen forced to cut other high-priority medical programs. They are \nforced by this\n\n[[Page S16086]]\n\ndelay to continue operating under last year's lower funding level. So \nthe problem, again, will only get worse.\n  Some of the older veterans, especially those with whom I served \nduring World War II, may be forced to wait longer for long-term care \nbecause of the delay of this bill. The VA had planned to increase long-\nterm care by 20 percent with the funds in this bill. I am not sure \nthose veterans from World War II can wait additional months for that \ncare.\n  Worst of all, the VA has raised concerns that the continuing \nresolution may not authorize mandatory compensation and benefit \npayments for veterans which were scheduled to begin in January. So, \naccording to that information that we received from the VA, unless we \npass this bill this week, beginning on New Year's Day, the VA will not \nbe able to make the compensation payments to 2.5 million veterans and \n314,000 of their survivors. There remains some confusion about this \nissue.\n  Likewise, the VA will not be able to make benefit payments to another \n537,000 veterans. These benefit payments are needs-based pensions and \nsustain veterans with no other means of support. The payments will \naverage $790 per person per month. Obviously, those with no income \ncannot wait another month without the money to pay for their rent or \ntheir food.\n  I do not think it is fair to ask disabled veterans, for some of whom \nthis is their only income, to wait an additional time. I do not think \nthis is how our returning veterans from Iraq should be welcomed home.\n  Unfortunately, it is not just our Nation's veterans who will suffer \nas the Government is forced to continue operating under last year's \nlevels for another month or two. The Federal Housing Administration at \nHUD has indicated to our committee that its prorated insurance \nauthority under this continuing resolution is not enough to meet the \ncurrent projections for either FHA mutual mortgage insurance or the FHA \ngeneral insurance and special risk insurance fund. That means that \nsometime in January the FHA insurance program for single-family and \nmultifamily housing will run out of money. Needy families will also be \nforced to wait for the section 8 rent subsidy vouchers. They are living \nin shelters and must stay there for a few more months because we cannot \nbring this bill to a vote.\n\n  Under the continuing resolution, the AmeriCorps Program, which helps \nneedy families and communities, would also be in jeopardy. Passage of \nour omnibus bill in January will delay this. Unless we pass this \nomnibus bill in January, there will be a delay in the enrollment of \ntens of thousands of new volunteers.\n  The Nation's schoolchildren will also suffer if we do not pass this \nomnibus bill before the end of the year. On a bipartisan basis, the \nconferees agreed to an increase of $2.9 billion for education programs \nto help our Nation's schools. Unfortunately, that money is just not \navailable under the continuing resolution, based on last year's \nappropriations. Undoubtedly, now, despite our pledge, some children \nwill be left behind.\n  Under the continuing resolution, assistance for school districts, \nStates, and colleges will also be delayed. For example, the conferees \nprovided an increase of $728 million for poor schools under the title I \ngrant program which helps disadvantaged children. These moneys are not \navailable under the continuing resolution based on last year's level, \nand that money will not be there when the second semester starts the \nfirst week of January.\n  Kids with disabilities are also going to suffer. The conferees \nprovided $1.26 billion in new funding to help States meet their \nresponsibility for kids with learning disabilities and physical and \nmental challenges. Instead of continuing impressive increases in \nFederal commitment to reaching the 40 percent payment authorized for \nstudents with disabilities, under the continuing resolution the Federal \ncontribution will be frozen at 17.5 percent. This bill would have paid \n40 percent; the continuing resolution provides only 17.5 percent. I do \nnot think our Nation's schools should have to wait for this additional \nmoney, which they should have received back in October shortly after \nthe school year began.\n  Other education programs will suffer under the continuing resolution. \nNew funds for reading, some $57 million, will be delayed; impact aid, \nabout $49 billion for children of military families, will be affected; \n$50 million for our Nation's colleges will be in jeopardy. Saddest of \nall, to me, will be the delay in funding for Head Start. We had \nprovided an additional $148 million to expand and improve Head Start \nprograms around the country. That also will be delayed because the \nmoney is not within the continuing resolution.\n  In addition to the adverse impact on health care for our veterans, \nthe continuing resolution will also have a negative effect on health \ncare programs for other Americans. Most immediate, this bill provides \nan additional $50 million to prepare for a pandemic flu outbreak, which \nis upon us now. It is upon us as I speak. Normally the flu season does \nnot begin in earnest until late January, but this year it is early. If \nthis measure is delayed, that $50 million will sit in the Treasury \nwhile Americans go untreated and unvaccinated for the flu. I seriously \nquestion whether they can wait for January for that flu shot. I hope \nsomething will be done to meet that very pressing problem.\n\n  Likewise, the $261 million provided in this measure for the Centers \nfor Disease Control to combat emerging infectious diseases is also not \navailable under the continuing resolution. That means the funds needed \nto combat diseases such as SARS, monkeypox, and hepatitis may not be \nthere when they are needed.\n  The $122 million the conferees added to strengthen and expand \ncommunity health centers will be delayed under the continuing \nresolution. This medical care to the underserved and uninsured across \nthe country should not be delayed, but it will be.\n  Similarly, the $1 billion in new money for health research at the \nNational Institutes of Health will be delayed under the continuing \nresolution. That is research on heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and \nother killers. It will have to be delayed until the bill is finally \npassed.\n  Our omnibus bill also includes an additional $159 million to combat \nsubstance abuse and mental health diseases. Hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans suffering from addiction and mental illness, who could have \nreceived additional care, will go untreated under the continuing \nresolution. These additional funds could treat thousands of Americans. \nThey will not be available now.\n  The omnibus bill also funds the Agriculture Department which helps \nfeed the Nation. On a bipartisan basis, the conferees agreed to make \nsubstantial increases in funding for programs to make sure that no \nchild goes to bed hungry.\n  The conferees provided an additional $3.6 billion over the 2003 \nfunding level for the Food Stamp Program. That money is continued now \nat the 2003 level--not at the higher level of this bill. In fact, it is \nnot enough money to allow every qualified applicant to participate in \nthe Food Stamp Program without this bill.\n  Not only that, but this bill provides an additional $1 billion in \nreserve funding to provide for any unanticipated increase in program \nparticipation in food stamps.\n  In total, that is an extra $4.6 billion for the Food Stamp Program, \nor just under $400 million a month. That is what is going to be \ndelayed--at least $400 million a month.\n  This bill cannot possibly get to the President until the end of \nJanuary. It means that almost $800 million will not be available to \nfeed hungry families between now and the end of January. It means that \nsome families may not have a Christmas dinner.\n  Likewise, the conferees provided an additional $837 million over the \n2003 funding level for other child nutrition programs--programs such as \nschool lunches, school breakfasts, child and adult food programs, and \nthe special milk program. Since this bill has been delayed, that money \nwill not be available to help the hungry. A 2-month delay will mean \nabout $70 million a month will not be there for those people.\n  The omnibus appropriations bill funds the Department of \nTransportation programs for fiscal year 2004, as well as other critical \nprograms.\n  For example, the conferees agreed to add an additional $1.5 billion \nto complete preparations for the November\n\n[[Page S16087]]\n\nPresidential election. Continued operation under a continuing \nresolution means the full amount of funding will be delayed, along with \nthe installation of state-of-the-art voting machines. This is very \ncritical to our Nation. We all remember the last election, and we \npledged to fix that. I do not think it will be possible because of the \ndelay of this bill.\n  This measure also funds transit programs at $7.3 billion to address \ntraffic congestion around the country. It provides $13.9 billion for \nthe Federal Aviation Administration to ensure the safety of our air \ntransportation system. Increases in both programs are now in jeopardy \nbecause this bill will not pass before the end of the year.\n  I have great concerns about the delay in funding for counterterrorism \nthat will result in not passing this measure now. The conference report \nincludes significant new funding for the Department of the Treasury to \ndisrupt the financing of terrorist groups. Delayed funding could hamper \nthe ongoing efforts to disrupt the cash-flow to the terrorist groups \nthroughout the world.\n  The State-Justice-Commerce bill is also included within this omnibus \nmeasure. If this bill is not adopted, critical funds for the FBI and \ncounterterrorism programs will be delayed. In addition, the United \nStates would be late in paying its dues to the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, which is due \nJanuary 1.\n\n  The District of Columbia bill is funded in this legislation, \nincluding the voucher program which was controversial, I will admit. \nBut it is to give kids attending failing schools a chance to succeed in \nlife. If this voucher program which is now authorized is delayed, it \nprobably cannot go into effect the next semester. It is uncertain \nwhether the program can be up and running by the next school year \nunless this bill passes before the end of this year.\n  Despite reports in the press and some opponents, I think this is a \nbipartisan bill. I don't believe there is a Senator in the Chamber who \ncannot or has not claimed credit for at least one program in this bill. \nIt funds programs for Republicans and Democrats alike, and includes \nprojects for Senators who are up for election regardless of party. Each \nof these seven bills was worked out largely by the chairman and ranking \nmember, a Republican and a Democrat, on each subcommittee. Only a \nhandful of these issues were resolved at the full committee level in \nconference.\n  Are there provisions in this bill to which the minority object? Yes. \nDoes the White House endorse all of what we have done in this bill? \nAbsolutely not. Are there sections in the bill that even I oppose? Yes. \nI do oppose some of the provisions. But the bill is the product of \ncompromise, and unfortunately, it is a compromise that comes about when \nwe are forced to join bills together into an omnibus bill. Senator Byrd \nand I have consistently opposed the concept of omnibus bills, and we \nsought to have bills pass singularly as they should be--13 separate \nappropriations bills.\n  I know there are items in here with which Senator Byrd disagrees. As \nI said, I know there are provisions with which I disagree. But the one \nthing I do thank the Senator from West Virginia for is working to try \nto get 13 separate bills. It has not been possible for us to do that. \nWe were forced at the last minute to make some concessions to the White \nHouse and to the House in order to get a bill that the House would pass \nand which the President would sign. Some of those concessions are not \nacceptable to the minority. I understand that. I understand the \nprocess. Unfortunately, the timing of this bill is such that we had no \nalternative but to make the concessions in order to get the bill to the \nHouse.\n  I had hoped that we would be able to pass it today. I know that is \nnot possible. Delay of this bill is going to cause real problems for \npeople around this country and around the world, as I said in the \nbeginning. It will hit the neediest among us hardest of all. And for \nsome, unfortunately, this delay may be a matter of life or death. \nDuring the season of peace and helping each other, particularly the \nspirit of Christmas and the spirit of bipartisanship, I had hoped the \n2004 omnibus appropriations bill would be able to pass today. I regret \ndeeply as chairman of committee that is not possible. I take full \nresponsibility for the delay because it was just not possible for us, \nwithin the rules, to finish the bills and get them to the Senate before \nthis time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my colleague, \nSenator Stevens, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for the \nexcellent work he has done on the bill that is now before the Senate, \nH.R. 2673, the omnibus appropriations bill. It consists of seven \nappropriations bills. Senator Stevens has consistently sought to avoid \nhaving omnibus appropriations bills. He has zealously tried to have all \nof the 13 appropriations bills pass on time before the beginning of the \nnew fiscal year and sent to the President of the United States for his \nconsideration. Senator Stevens has at all times been fair--eminently \nfair to me and to all members of the Appropriations Committee. I \ncongratulate Senator Stevens. He is an excellent chairman. And I \ncongratulate the other members of the committee, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, for working together as they have on this bill and as they \nhave always done as long as I have been on that committee; and that is \n45 years.\n  I share the disappointment of the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. I share his disappointment. He has been \nvaliant in his efforts. He has been consistent in his search for ways \nby which we can come together and pass a bill on time. I could ask for \nnothing more.\n\n  Members of this Congress have a duty and a responsibility to the \nAmerican people, to the men and women who send us to represent them in \nthis great Capitol. Those men and women who send us to represent them \nin this Capitol do not expect us to rubberstamp legislation. They do \nnot expect us to cash our own paychecks without doing the work that we \nwere sent here to do. Senators are paid to be in the Capitol when votes \nare taken. Today is such a day, yet few Senators are present.\n  The 1,182-page conference report before the Senate totals more than \n$328 billion. I hold my hand on the top of this 1,182-page conference \nreport. Here it is. What a mammoth bill, 1,182 pages. Yet we were asked \nto adopt this mammoth piece of legislation by unanimous consent. The \nmajority leader asked Senators for their consent to bring this bill up, \nwhich is in the form of a conference report, and pass it without a \nrollcall vote. Is that the way the American people want their business \nto be conducted?\n  This bill totals more than $328 billion. It provides funds for 11 of \n15 Federal Departments. It wraps together the work of seven \nappropriations bills. This conference report funds our Nation's schools \nand highways, our veterans clinics, workplace safety initiatives, and \nmedical research. It funds priorities that directly touch the lives of \nevery American citizen. Yet Members of this body do not have the time, \napparently, or the will, to be here at their desks in the Senate and \nvote on this mammoth piece of legislation. Instead of a rollcall vote, \nthe majority leader sought unanimous consent to take up and pass this \nlegislation by voice. My voice is not so good today but it is good \nenough to say no. I object to passing this bill without a rollcall.\n  I announced my intention days ago to object to any unanimous consent \nrequest to pass this bill without a rollcall vote. I am here, at my \nplace, as I said I would be. Senators may have travel plans or schedule \nconflicts. They may prefer to be in their home States or traveling \naround the globe rather than be here in the Capitol. Our responsibility \nis here in this Chamber when we have an appropriations measure of this \nnature, of this size, of this importance.\n  Our responsibility is to work. Our responsibility is to debate and \nvote on this conference report. We should not have postponed this \nmatter until next year. We should not have put this matter off for \nseveral weeks. There is no good excuse for putting this debate on hold.\n  Now, stop and think for a moment. We have had since April to pass \nthese seven bills. The budget resolution was adopted in early April, on \nApril 11.\n\n[[Page S16088]]\n\nThat gave us our directions and the Appropriations Committees could go \nforward at that time. Here we have been since April 11 and we have only \npassed and sent to the President of the United States six \nappropriations bills. So more than half of the total of 13 \nappropriations bills are right here in this conference report and no \nSenator--no Senator and I daresay no House Members, perhaps a few--I \nwill leave myself a little wiggle room--I can say no Senator has seen \neverything that is in this massive bill. No Senator, under God's \nheaven, knows everything that is in this conference report. No \nSenator's staff person knows everything that is in this conference \nreport. This represents the people's business.\n  It is the people's money and Senators are asked to come here today \nand vote no. They were asked to come and pass this massive piece of \nlegislation without a rollcall vote. This is an abomination. The \nAmerican people deserve better from us.\n\n  I understand the reluctance of the majority leader. The leadership \nworries there may not be enough votes to pass the conference report and \nsend it to the White House. But we would not know that until we voted. \nIt is not unheard of to ask Members of the Senate to come back and \nvote. It has been done before. I have done it when I was majority \nleader. It has been done by other majority leaders. I don't criticize \nthe current majority leader. He is doing what he thinks he has to do \nunder the circumstances. But I think we all could have done better. I \nthink the Members should have been asked to come back and do their work \nand finish the job, debate the conference report, have a rollcall vote \nand then go home for Christmas.\n  Make no mistake, there are many problems with this conference report: \ncontracting out Federal jobs, stripping employees of bipartisan job \nprotections, voiding an effort to protect overtime protections \nestablished by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, taking away the \nright of as many as 8 million employees to earn time and a half for \nextra hours worked. Last minute closed-door changes would postpone \ncountry-of-origin labeling. Let me say that again: Last minute closed-\ndoor changes would postpone country-of-origin labeling on meat and \nvegetables, robbing Americans from knowing where their food was grown \nfor 2 years and breaking the balance crafted as part of the 2002 farm \nbill.\n  The 1-year limitation on the FCC media ownership rule was turned into \na permanent cap at 39 percent. The practical effect of changes demanded \nby the White House is to protect Rupert Murdoch's FOX Television \nNetwork and CBS-Viacom from having to comply with the lower 35-percent \nownership caps a congressional version of the bill would put in \nplace. The White House is boosting special corporate interests at the \nexpense of the people's interest for balanced news and information.\n\n  One could go on for quite some time ticking off the problems that are \nin this conference report, problems dictated to Congress by the Bush \nWhite House.\n  There are many provisions within this package that never came before \nthe Senate--never. Yet Senators were asked to buy a pig in a poke, to \nvote for a pig in a poke, unknown, unseen, yet vote by unanimous \nconsent--no, not vote, but asked to pass this gargantuan piece of \nlegislation here by unanimous consent without a rollcall vote.\n  Can you imagine, $328 billion and not even a recorded vote? What \nwould Everett Dirksen say today? He said: A billion here and a billion \nthere and pretty soon you have a lot of money. He should be here today. \nThere is $328 billion. That is $328 for every minute since Jesus Christ \nwas born. That is a lot of money. We are asked to close our eyes, plug \nour ears--no debate, no questions asked--just hold your nose and vote \nfor it. Hold your nose and say: Pass it without a vote. That is what we \nare asked to do.\n  Four of the bills contained in this omnibus did not have a recorded \nvote in the Senate. One of the bills, the Commerce-Justice-State bill, \nwas never even debated in the Senate, let alone adopted. Scores of \nprovisions are included in the so-called Miscellaneous Appropriations \nAct portion of the conference report that were never debated in the \nHouse or Senate.\n  Under pressure from the White House, provisions that were approved by \nboth the House and the Senate have been dropped. Under pressure from \nthe White House, controversial provisions that were written as 1-year \nlimitations when they were before the House or Senate have been mutated \ninto permanent changes in authorization law. Now, that is going a far \npiece--going a fer piece, I would say. Houdini was nothing when \ncompared with what the conference did here under pressure from the Bush \nWhite House.\n  In fact, the majority leadership created a new appropriations \nauthority: the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act. That is a new one on \nme. There are 13 appropriations subcommittees, but I have yet to meet \nthe chairman of the Subcommittee on Miscellaneous Appropriations.\n  That section, whatever its genesis, is home to administration pet \nprojects and priorities. Scores of provisions are included in the so-\ncalled miscellaneous appropriations umbrella that were never debated in \nthe House or Senate. Under direct pressure from the White House, \nprovisions approved previously by both the House and the Senate have \nbeen dropped. Under pressure from the White House, controversial \nprovisions originally crafted by the House or Senate as 1-year \nlimitations, may I say again, have mutated into permanent changes in \nauthorization law.\n  This conference report includes an across-the-board cut that has \nnever been debated in the Senate, an arbitrary cut that would apply to \nlegislation already signed into law. It would cut homeland security. We \nare talking about your safety, and your safety, Mr. President, the \nsafety of your home, your children, your grandchildren. Homeland \nsecurity is the usual term. It would cut counterterrorism efforts. It \nwould cut education and health care. This across-the-board cut would \nreach back into bills signed months ago and say: No, sorry. No, no, \nsorry, but that is just too much money. So we are going to take a \nlittle off the top.\n\n  Apparently, in the view of the White House, the United States can \nafford $1.7 trillion in tax cuts. When it comes to the Medicare bill, \nwe can afford $12 billion for subsidies for private insurance \ncompanies. When it comes to the Energy bill, we can afford over $25 \nbillion of tax cuts and $5 billion of mandatory spending for big energy \ncorporations. But when it comes to initiatives funded in these \nappropriations bills, initiatives that help Americans every day, the \nPresident insists: Cut, cut, cut, cut. A cut of 0.59 percent would \nreduce funding for No Child Left Behind programs by more than $73 \nmillion, resulting in 24,000 fewer children being served by title I.\n  We are talking about this across-the-board cut now. This across-the-\nboard cut does not sound like it would be much, a cut of 0.59 percent, \nbut what does it do to the No Child Left Behind program? It would \nreduce funding for the No Child Left Behind program by more than $73 \nmillion, resulting in 24,000 fewer children being served by title I. \nOverall, the title I Education for the Disadvantaged program would be \n$6 billion below the level authorized by the No Child Left Behind Act \nthat the President signed in January of 2002 with great fanfare--\nanother promise unfulfilled.\n  The across-the-board cut would reduce Head Start funding by $40 \nmillion, resulting in 5,500 fewer children attending Head Start. \nVeterans medical care funding would be cut by $159 million, resulting \nin 26,500 fewer veterans receiving medical care or 198,000 veterans not \ngetting the prescription drugs they need.\n  I spoke earlier about cuts in homeland security. The across-the-board \ncut would chop funding for homeland security initiatives. How many more \nbaggage screeners would be laid off resulting in longer lines and less \nsecurity at our airports? How many flights will have fewer air marshals \non board? How many fewer flights will have air marshals on board? How \nmany more containers will come into this country uninspected? How many \nmore illegal aliens will be able to remain in this country or how many \nwill be able to come into this country? This is a threat to the \nNation's security. How many potential terrorists will never be \ninvestigated because of cuts in the FBI program?\n  All this, and the distinguished majority leader sought consent that \nthis\n\n[[Page S16089]]\n\npackage be approved without a rollcall vote. That is no way to \nlegislate. How would I feel facing my constituents and having to say: \nWell, it was getting close to Christmas and Members had other things \nthey had to do; we did pass it; I wish now we would have had a rollcall \nvote but I wasn't there to object?\n  That is no way to be accountable to the American people. Taxpayers of \nthis country rightly expect Senators to be accountable for funds drawn \nout of the Federal Treasury. It is your money. How many times have we \nheard that? I say to those who are looking at the Senate Chamber today \nthrough those electronic lenses: It is your money. How can Members be \naccountable when they are scattered to the four winds across the globe? \nWhat kind of perversion of the appropriations process would result in \nSenators approving this monstrosity without a recorded vote?\n  When Members took their oath of office, they pledged, standing right \nthere at the Presiding Officer's desk with their hands on the Bible--\n``so help me God,'' they said--that they would support and defend the \nConstitution. So we have a responsibility to faithfully discharge the \nduties of the office of U.S. Senator. We took a pledge to do that. We \ntook an oath to do that. We took an oath before God and man to do that. \nSenators did not pledge to do so just when it was convenient or when \nthe schedule permits.\n  The House of Representatives saw fit to return to vote on this \nconference report. Why then could the Senate not do the same? We all \nget the same pay. Senators as well as House Members are paid to work \nfor 12 months each year, not 10 months.\n  Chairman Stevens and I worked with each Senator on the Appropriations \nCommittee to produce 13 individual appropriations bills to send to the \nPresident. I have commended--and do so again--the senior Senator from \nAlaska for his effort, but the process was hijacked.\n  By whom? Who is doing the hijacking? The Bush White House. The White \nHouse hijacked the process. The process was hijacked by the White House \nand the Republican leadership in both Houses. Instead of sending 13 \nfiscally responsible appropriations bills to the President, the Senate \nwas asked to close its eyes, plug its ears, and be gagged in order to \nrubberstamp a 1,182-page conference report combining 7 appropriations \nbills for 11 of the 15 Departments of the Federal Government, on an \nunrecorded approval of a unanimous consent request. No vote to it--no \nrollcall vote, no vote by division, no vote viva voce, no vote by \nvoice, with only a handful of Senators. You could count the number of \nSenators in this Chamber on one hand this morning. This would be \nlegislating without accountability.\n  What is the use of having elections if the voters are prevented from \nknowing how their Senators voted on investing $328 billion of the \npeople's money, your money? This is wrong. The people have a right to \nknow how their elected representatives stand on this legislation which \nwill affect the lives of so many.\n  I am saddened by the majority leader's decision to postpone a vote on \nthis legislation until January 20. This is no way to govern. We have \nhad since April 11 to pass these seven bills. That is no way to serve \nthe American people.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank all Senators. I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment this morning to \nhonor a dear friend of mine and a former colleague in the other \nChamber, the late Congressman Bill Emerson of Missouri. On December 13, \na new bridge spanning the Mississippi River at Cape Girardeau in \nMissouri is being dedicated to Bill who represented the people of \nsouthern Missouri in the House of Representatives with dedication and \nintegrity for 15 years before his untimely death in 1996.\n  I was privileged to meet, know, and work with Bill Emerson during my \nfreshman year in Congress. He was an example of hard work, common \nsense, and the ability to put differences aside to get the job done. \nBill and I shared a common constituency of rural Americans and served \non the House Agriculture Committee together. Bill's spirit of \nuncompromising principle and his ability to lead under the most \ndifficult circumstances are assets that I have endeavored to emulate.\n  Bill's commitment to his family was unparalleled. His wife Jo Ann \nsucceeded him in his congressional seat, and he would be so proud of \nher today for the work she is doing. His daughters, Abby, Liz, Tory, \nand Katharine, were the lights of his life. I have come to know all \nfour of them over the years, and he would, again, be so proud of them.\n  Jo Ann has carried on Bill's legacy of building bridges between \npeople to promote communication, trade, and civic pride and is making a \nmark in her own right. This is something which I know would have \nbrought Bill a great deal of satisfaction.\n  Bill Emerson's habit of bridging gaps between people is captured \nperfectly in the Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge. This $120 million \nstructure replaces the bridge that was built 76 years ago. It will tie \ntogether the two States of Missouri and Illinois and promote trade and \nprogress. It is a fitting monument to a man who brought credit to his \nfamily, his community, his State, his country, and the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  Bill Emerson was a dear friend. I miss him every day. What a fitting \ntribute to a great man and a great American.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is the Senate still in morning business with \na 10-minute limitation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as \nlong as I must speak. I can assure the Chair it will not be over 30 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues a very thoughtful article written by Kofi Annan, \nSecretary General of the United Nations, entitled ``Search For A New \nU.N. Role.''\n  I commend the Secretary for his strong leadership over these years, \nand particularly for the courage he has shown as manifested by this op-\ned piece, the courage he has shown to look to the future and to take \nsuch, what you might call, corrective measures or revisions as will \nfurther strengthen the United Nations as we, the body of nations, face \na very perilous and uncertain world, a world filled with threats which \nreally have little precedent in history and weapons that have little \nprecedent in history.\n\n[[Page S16090]]\n\n  Fifty-two years ago, this humble soul was a second lieutenant in the \nU.S. Marine Corps and served under the United Nations banner in the \nKorean conflict in Korea. My service was--I say with deepest humility--\nvery modest, for I have often said on this floor that such military \nservice as I had in the closing months of World War II and in Korea was \nvery modest compared to others, but it did much for me. I am \ncontinuously trying to pay back to the current generation, the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces, what was done for me.\n  I simply cite that it was the U.N. banner under which the U.S. forces \nand the forces of a number of other nations, a coalition, fought those \nbattles. This was the United Nations' first military mission, as I look \nback over this half century. Of course, we all recognize there has been \nno peace treaty. There has never been one signed. But also there has \nbeen no recourse to major military use of force on the Korea peninsula \nin this half century. So that mission of the United Nations, I would \nsay, had a strong measure of success. To this day, our U.S. forces \nstill serve in that theater under the U.N. banner to keep the peace on \nthat peninsula.\n  As Secretary Annan notes in his op-ed piece, the United Nations has \nbeen greatly tested in recent years. To his credit, the Secretary has \nbeen willing to face head on these challenges to the historic \ninstitution he is privileged to lead and has led with great \ndistinction. Indeed, one of those tests was with the United States as \nwe approached obligations which I strongly support, obligations the \nPresident has pointed out many times, obligations to bring a greater \nmeasure of freedom to the people of Iraq. But that is history. It was \nclearly a lesson learned by all who participated.\n  Last week, Secretary Annan announced he has convened a panel to take \na hard look at the mission of the U.N. and what changes the U.N. should \nmake to ensure that it can be a relevant and effective institution in \nthe future. The panel is expected to issue a report in the fall of \n2004.\n  I commend the Secretary for his courage in looking to the future and \ntasking this panel to give their views not only to him but to the \nentire community of nations which proudly form the United Nations. \nWithout a doubt, the world needs a stronger United Nations, one that \ncan address with greater decisiveness and swiftness the challenges to \nfreedom in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed piece be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 4, 2003]\n\n                       Search for a New U.N. Role\n\n                           (By Kofi A. Annan)\n\n       We have come to a decisive moment in history. The great \n     threat of nuclear confrontation between rival superpowers is \n     now behind us. But a new and diverse constellation of threats \n     has arisen in its place. We need to look again at the \n     machinery of international relations. Is it up to these new \n     challenges? If not, how does it need to be changed?\n       The events of the last year have exposed deep divisions \n     among members of the United Nations on fundamental questions \n     of policy and principle. How can we best protect ourselves \n     against international terrorism and halt the spread of \n     weapons of mass destruction? When is the use of force \n     premissible--and who should decide? Does it have to be each \n     state for itself, or will we be safer working together? Is \n     ``preventive war'' sometimes justified, or is it simply \n     aggression under another name? And, in a world that has \n     become ``unipolar,'' what role should the United Nations \n     play?\n       These new debates come on top of earlier ones that arose in \n     the 1990s. Is state sovereignty an absolute and immutable \n     principle, or does our understanding of it need to evolve? To \n     what extent is it the international community's \n     responsibility to prevent or resolve conflicts within states \n     (as opposed to wars between them)--particularly when they \n     involve genocide, ``ethnic cleansing'' or other extreme \n     violations of human rights?\n       These questions cannot be left unanswered. Yet they are not \n     the only questions. And for many people they may not even be \n     the most urgent.\n       In fact, to many people in the world today, especially in \n     poor countries, the risk of being attacked by terrorists or \n     with weapons of mass destruction, or even of falling prey to \n     genocide, must seem relatively remote compared to the so-\n     called ``soft'' threats--the ever-present dangers of extreme \n     poverty and hunger, unsafe drinking water, environmental \n     degradation and endemic or infectious disease.\n       Let's not imagine that these things are unconnected with \n     peace and security, or that we can afford to ignore them \n     until the ``hard threats'' have been sorted out. We should \n     have learned by now that a world of glaring inequality--\n     between countries and within them--where many millions of \n     people endure brutal oppression and extreme misery is never \n     going to be a fully safe world, even for its most privileged \n     inhabitants.\n       Today, the common ground we used to stand on no longer \n     seems solid. In seeking new common ground for our collective \n     efforts, we need to consider whether the United Nations \n     itself is well suited to the challenges ahead.\n       During the last year, the United Nations has been held \n     under a microscope. In an atmosphere of acrimony surrounding \n     the crisis in Iraq, the importance and, indeed, the relevance \n     of the institution have in some quarters been called into \n     question. This was especially true at the time of the United \n     States decision to go to war in Iraq without the explicit \n     approval of the Security Council.\n       I know that over the years our record has been far from \n     perfect. The Security Council has been unable to prevent \n     horrendous atrocities--the rule of the Khmer Rouge in \n     Cambodia, ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, genocide \n     in Rwanda. But, to paraphrase Henry Cabot Lodge, the United \n     Nations may not have brought us to heaven but it played a \n     vital role in saving us from hell.\n       Peace was brought to many lands through the U.N.--Cambodia, \n     El Salvador, Guatemala, Mozambique. We helped protect against \n     a drift toward nuclear holocaust, including during the Cuban \n     missile crisis. We served as a vehicle for action against \n     North Korea, against Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait. We've \n     brought relief to millions affected by fighting, famine and \n     floods, and we have helped reduce child mortality and \n     eradicate smallpox. We were critical in helping the \n     developing world throw off the yoke of colonialism.\n       To my mind, recent events have only underlined the need for \n     the United Nations. That's why I convened a panel, chaired by \n     former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun of Thailand, to \n     examine the future of our organization. The panel holds its \n     first meeting this weekend.\n       Its role is threefold: to analyze current and future \n     threats to peace and security; to assess the contribution \n     that collective action can make in meeting these threats; and \n     to recommend the changes needed to make the United Nations a \n     legitimate and effective instrument for a collective \n     response. How, in particular, can the United Nations ``take \n     effective collective measures for the prevention and removal \n     of threats to the peace,'' which is one of its purposes, as \n     defined in Article I of its charter? I hope the panel will \n     complete its report by autumn 2004.\n       If it does its work well, history may yet remember the \n     current crisis as a great opportunity that wise men and women \n     used to strengthen the mechanisms of international \n     cooperation and adapt them to the needs of the new century.\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner and Mr. DeWine pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1993 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16090-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16090-S16091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THANKING STAFF\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

When I was sworn in, in 1978, I believe, I filled a vacancy that \noccurred in December, and I did it on the second or third of January. \nSo actually my 25th anniversary occurs in the first few days of \nJanuary.\n  It has been an enormously great, rewarding privilege for this humble \nsoul to have served in the Senate.\n  I believe I have served with well over 100 Senators in addition to \nthose I am privileged to serve with in this Congress. Again, I am \nalways mindful of all of those who make it possible in the \ninfrastructure and the institution of the Senate to enable me and \nothers to serve our Nation as best we can in diverse but nevertheless \nconstructive ways for the betterment of all mankind and, yes, America \nand much of the free world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two Ohioans \nwho dedicated their lives to serving their local community of Urbana. \nLewis B. Moore passed away on October 21, 2002, at the age of 91. His \nwife, Jean, passed away on September 12, 2001. I would like to take a \nfew moments to reflect here today on this couple's legacy of service \nand the mark they left on the people of Urbana.\n  Lewis Moore--Lew to his friends--was born in Paducah, KY, on July 23, \n1911. He graduated from Cleveland Heights High School in 1929 and from \nCase Institute of Technology in Cleveland in 1933 with a bachelor of \nscience degree in electrical engineering. He married Jean Lillian \nWenger in 1938, and they moved to Urbana in 1940, where Lew joined \nGrimes Manufacturing Company as a sales engineer. Later he served as \nchief engineer, sales manager, and vice president before eventually \nbecoming president and board chairman.\n  Under Lew's leadership, the company grew from 12 to more than 1,300 \nemployees. As president, he served as a mentor to many and as an \nexample to all. If there were ever a disagreement with a customer, Lew \nused to tell his employees to always be honest with the customers. He \nwould say: ``Tell them the truth--tell them what happened.'' Indeed, \nLew Moore was a model of integrity.\n  Together, Lew and Jean's values and visions for the future changed \nUrbana. Lew eventually ran for public office and served as Mayor of \nUrbana from 1980 to 1991. Under his leadership, Urbana underwent some \nbig changes in the city government. Known affectionately as ``Mr. \nUrbana,'' Mayor Moore transformed the City of Urbana from a statutory \nsystem into a charter form of government--one of the most important of \nhis contributions to the city government, noted Larry Wolke, former \ndirector of administration. According to David Martin, former Grimes \nemployee and current Urbana City Council president, ``He had the best \ninterests of the city and the citizens of Urbana in his heart and \nmind.''\n  Working side-by-side with Lew to serve the Urbana community, Jean \nparticipated in the campaign that created the city's first youth center \nand organized and led her church's Prayer Connection. As one Prayer \nConnection member, Jack Neer, said of Jean, ``She was there for anyone \nin need.''\n  No better illustration of their commitment to the interests and \ncommunity of Urbana is found, however, than in Lew and Jean's \ninvolvement with the University of Urbana, where Lew served as building \nfundraiser and Jean served on the board of trustees for more than 35 \nyears. Through much of their lifetimes, Lew and Jean dedicated much of \ntheir time and resources to expanding and improving the institution. As \nDr. Robert Head, Urbana University president said, ``It is not an \noverstatement to say that if it hadn't been for Lew and Jean Moore, \nUrbana University would not be here today.''\n  Together, Jean and Lew spearheaded several campaigns to raise funds \nto enhance the university. In one project, they helped raise $400,000 \nto build the Warren G. Grimes Community Center. In the early 1990's, \nLew co-chaired efforts to raise funds for the math and science center--\na project totaling $3.1 million. According to Dr. Francis Hazard, \nformer University president, ``When no one else stepped forward to head \nthe campaign, they volunteered.'' He added that as the campaign neared \nits end and the structure had been completed, Moore cashed in a $75,000 \ninsurance policy to furnish its classrooms and laboratories.\n  Lew and Jean Moore were selfless. They loved their community--their \nfamily, their friends, and their neighbors. It is no wonder the Urbana \ncommunity affectionately refers to Lew as ``Mr. Urbana.'' Throughout \ntheir lives, they were devoted to their community. And through their \nservice, Lew and Jean Moore provided a vision for Urbana's future. That \nis their legacy. We certainly miss them both deeply.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to remember Lew, and we continue to \nremember Jean. They were both great friends. Left to cherish their \nmemories and to pass on this legacy are their sons, Keith and Greg, and \ntheir wonderful families.\n  We thank both Lew and Jean for their wonderful service to their \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16091-2", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16091-S16092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDGE WILLIAM AMMER\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute here on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate to a dear friend, a gracious man, and a \nwonderful human being. That man is former Pickaway County, OH, Common \nPleas Judge William Ammer. Judge Ammer, of Circleville, Ohio, passed \naway January 30, 2003 at the age of 83.\n  William Ammer was born on May 21, 1919, to Moses and Mary Ammer. He \ngraduated from Circleville High School in 1937, and then went on to \nreceive a business degree from the Ohio State University. After serving \nin the U.S. Army for 3 years during World War II, he returned to Ohio \nState to get his law degree.\n  After law school, he quickly proved himself a skilled attorney. He \nserved as Assistant Ohio Attorney General from 1951 to 1952 and then \nreturned to Pickaway County as a prosecuting attorney from 1955 to \n1957.\n  During this time, he was also Circleville's Assistant City \nProsecutor, while finding the time to maintain a busy private law \npractice. He developed a reputation as a tireless worker and dedicated \npublic servant.\n  In 1957, he was appointed to the post in which he would serve the \nrest of his career--he was appointed Pickaway County Common Pleas Court \nJudge and was re-elected to this post every six years until his \nretirement on December 31, 1994.\n  While serving on the bench for those 37 years, Judge Ammer handled \nmore than 30,000 cases. Few of these cases were appealed, and most of \nthose cases that were appealed were affirmed by higher courts. As a \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I can tell you that this low \nreversal rate is one of the best indicators of a good, sound judge.\n  But I can also say that another great indicator is the man's \nreputation in the community. Anyone who knew Judge Ammer, and anyone \nwho knew the attorneys who practiced in Pickaway County or the area \ncertainly knew Judge Ammer's great reputation. And they knew how well \nrespected he was in the Pickaway County community and the surrounding \ncounties.\n  In addition to handling cases in Pickaway County, Judge Ammer often \nwas assigned to preside in other counties by the Supreme Court of Ohio. \nThis is also the mark of a good, well-respected judge. Only those \ncapable of handling the toughest cases are sent on assignments to other \njurisdictions. Once again, Judge Ammer's reputation for hard work and \ndiligence clearly preceded him.\n  While Judge Ammer was frequently sent on assignment outside of \nPickaway County, his heart remained in Circleville. Each year, Judge \nAmmer sent out memorable Christmas cards depicting Circleville \nlandmarks.\n  Certainly my wife Fran and I each year were recipients of those \nChristmas cards as were so many other people. And we always looked \nforward to receiving them. These cards reflected his love for the \ncommunity and were eagerly awaited each holiday season by those of us \nfortunate enough to be on his Christmas card list.\n  Judge Ammer was also involved with a number of community \norganizations. He was President of the Ted Lewis Museum, an institution \nhonoring that great native of Circleville. He was actively involved in \nthe American Legion, the Kiwanis Club, the Pickaway Country Historical \nand Genealogical Society, and the Masonic Lodge.\n  Perhaps the greatest testament, however, to his connection to the \nCircleville community comes now after his death. As the last member of \nthe Ammer family in Circleville, Judge Ammer arranged to have much of \nhis\n\n[[Page S16092]]\n\nestate go toward providing scholarships for Circleville High School \nstudents. This act certainly reveals Judge Ammer's generous and giving \nnature and his desire to help other Circleville natives succeed.\n\n  In tribute to Judge Ammer, who has been a true role model for so many \nof us in Ohio, my wife Fran and I say thank you. Judge Ammer was a kind \nhuman being who left an unbelievable print on the lives of so many \ncountless people who he touched. He truly helped people. He changed \nlives. He made a difference. We all miss him. We miss him dearly. He \nwill always be remembered by his beloved community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16092-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16092-S16093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DELBERT LATTA\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this afternoon I pay tribute to a dear \nfriend and beloved Ohioan, a man who has been a great public servant \nfor the last half century, a man who I served with in the House of \nRepresentatives for a number of years. I am talking about \nRepresentative Delbert Latta. Representative Delbert Latta devoted 30 \nyears of distinguished service to Ohio's 5th Congressional District in \nthe House of Representatives. In his honor, earlier this year, \nPresident George Bush signed into law a bill that renamed the Bowling \nGreen Ohio Post Office the Delbert L. Latta Post Office Building. This \nis a well-deserved tribute to a man who inspires all around him to \nstrive to be a better public servant.\n  This afternoon I will take a few minutes to explain to my colleagues \nwhy Del is so revered by the citizens of the 5th District and all the \ncitizens of Ohio. Del was raised in McComb, OH. He graduated from \nMcComb High School and later worked in a shoestore and put himself \nthrough Ohio Northern University from where he received his \nundergraduate and then his law degree.\n  Del practiced law in Bowling Green for several years before he \nsuccessfully ran for an Ohio State Senate seat. After serving three \nterms in the Ohio State Senate, Del Latta decided to serve his \ncommunity at the Federal level and was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1958.\n  Before retiring from the House of Representatives in 1989, \nconstituents of Ohio's 5th District showed Del their appreciation by \nelecting him and reelecting him 15 times. He was the dean of the Ohio \nRepublican delegation and as dean of the delegation was deeply \nrespected for the leadership role he played for fellow Ohio \nRepresentatives as well as for the party. He was the person to whom, \nfrankly, we all went.\n  I remember when I was first elected in 1982. I remember driving north \nto Bowling Green and going to see Del in his office and talking to him \nabout committee assignments. I told him I wanted to be on the Judiciary \nCommittee if that were possible. I remember Del sitting behind his desk \ntalking to me about that and telling me he would see what he could do \nabout it. It was not too long after that I was on the Judiciary \nCommittee in the House of Representatives. Del was the person you went \nto. Del was the person you went to for advice, for counsel, and to get \nthings done.\n  Del served as leader of the Rules Committee. Del was the ranking \nRepublican in all the House on the Budget Committee. Del was not only \nrecognized as a key leader of the Republican Party, he was a consensus \nbuilder who also earned the respect of Members on both sides of the \naisle. The Honorable Democrat Senator and Representative Claude Pepper, \nof Florida, had this to say about Del:\n\n       Del's conduct as a Member of the [Rules] Committee and a \n     Member of the House has exemplified the best and noblest \n     traditions of this House. His integrity has been exemplary. \n     His kindliness, gentleness and graciousness of manner have \n     endeared him to all of his colleagues. I shall always honor \n     the service Del Latta has rendered to the Rules Committee, to \n     the Budget Committee and the House because what he did, he \n     did as an able, honorable patriotic American.\n\n  Del Latta had a significant impact on so many pieces of legislation \nand events over his 30-year tenure in the House. One notable example is \nthe leadership he demonstrated during Watergate, but perhaps he is best \nwell-known as a champion of balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility. \nIn 1981, Del spearheaded President Reagan's economic recovery program \nin the House by sponsoring and helping to pass the Gramm-Latta bill. \nThis bill is often cited as the single most influential measure in \nstimulating America's economic recovery in the 1980s. Del Latta was \nthere. Del Latta led. It was Del Latta who got it done.\n\n  Expressing his admiration for Del's humility and work ethic, the \nHonorable Chip Pashayan, Jr., of California, said this about a dinner \nexperience he had with Del after the passage of this momentous bill \nthat bears Del Latta's name.\n\n       No gloating, no bragging, no brandishing. To [Del] Gramm-\n     Latta was just another bill, just another day's work for the \n     American people. . . . As usual, we finished dinner by 8:30 \n     or 9 p.m. because Del had to get back to his office to do \n     some constituent work. No constituency ever had a harder \n     working Member that I ever saw.\n\n  I could not agree more. In 1982, when I first came to the House of \nRepresentatives, as I said, Del was instrumental in teaching me the \nropes. What I admired most about Del was his ability to work with an \nunwavering commitment and passion for his constituents. He never forgot \nwho sent him to Washington. He never forgot who he worked for. In \neverything he did, you could see how much he cared for the people he \nrepresented, the people of northwest Ohio. He understood how much he \ncared about our great country.\n  People have always come first for Del Latta. It is what drives him. \nHe has said his greatest satisfaction comes from helping people find \nsolutions to their problems, whether it is big problems or small \nproblems, helping people find solutions to their problems, especially \nproblems they could not solve on their own.\n  At his retirement Del said this:\n\n       Being a representative [of Ohio's 5th district] has given \n     me and members of my family the opportunity to make untold \n     thousands of wonderful friendships which we shall always \n     treasure. I will also cherish the many friendships I have \n     made over the years with my congressional colleagues.\n\nAnd to be sure, Del Latta has not finished giving of himself, certainly \nnot. To this day, he continues to do everything he can for his \ncommunity. From local businessmen to neighborhood schoolchildren, Del \nLatta is there for them.\n  The dedication of the Bowling Green Post Office in Del's name--a post \noffice that Del once helped secure funds to build--is simply a reminder \nthat although it has been 15 years since he has retired from the \nCongress, Del has continued to work tirelessly for his community. The \nrenaming of this post office, in many ways, is a symbol--a great \nsymbol--of the civic spirit Del stood for as a U.S. Representative and \nstill stands for today.\n  So I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Del for this great honor. \nHe has done so much for the Fifth District, for the State of Ohio, and \nfor our Nation. I have the highest regard for the example Del has set \nas a leader and public servant. My wife Fran and I cherish his \nfriendship, and we wish him and his wife Rosemary and their children \nBob and Rose Ellen and their families all the best in their future.\n  Del Latta is a great man. I said that he has worked tirelessly for \nhis constituents, and it is always fun to watch him do that. But there \nhas been one thing for me that has been even more fun, and that is to \nwatch Del Latta with his grandchildren and to hear Del Latta talk about \nhis grandchildren because this is a man who is also a great family man; \nhe has never lost sight of the importance of family.\n  So, Del Latta, congratulations. You are a man who has served our \ncountry well. You are a great family man. You are a good friend. We \nappreciate all you have done for our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S16093]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16092-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16092-S16093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DELBERT LATTA\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise \nto report to my colleagues in the Senate the death of a former Member \nof this body, U.S. Senator Paul Simon from Illinois. Senator Simon died \nearlier today. He was 75 years old. This comes as a great shock to all \nof us who knew and loved Paul Simon.\n  Earlier today, I had written him a get well note and sent him some \nflowers. It was announced a couple of days ago that he was going into \nthe hospital for heart bypass surgery and also to have a leaky heart \nvalve replaced. Apparently something happened during the surgery--I \ndon't know what--but Senator Simon, unfortunately, passed away, and we \nall send our love and our prayers to his wife Patty, his children, his \ngrandchildren, and to all his colleagues at Southern Illinois \nUniversity where he will be missed greatly.\n  Senator Simon's first wife, Jeanne, died a few years ago. I also had \nthe privilege of knowing her. May God rest her soul as well.\n  Senator Simon was a nationally known figure, primarily from his \nhaving been a candidate for the Presidency in 1988. In Illinois, he was \ntruly a giant for many decades--three or four decades or more. He \nserved both in the State house of representatives and the Illinois \nState Senate, as well as in the U.S. Congress and then later in the \nU.S. Senate. He is thought to be the only person from Illinois to have \nserved in both houses of the Illinois Legislature and then in both \nHouses of Congress.\n  He was also in the late sixties and early seventies the Lieutenant \nGovernor from Illinois. On his last reelection race for the U.S. \nSenate, he won by over a million votes, with 65 percent. I believe he \nhad the highest plurality of anybody running that year.\n  He was an extraordinary figure, extremely popular, and extremely well \nrespected, especially for his character and integrity. Many people may \nhave disagreed with Senator Simon's policy positions on a variety of \nissues, but no one ever questioned his ethics and integrity. In fact, \nthose who served with him in the Senate, I am sure, remember his famous \nbow ties. Those bow ties almost became a symbol of ethics and integrity \nin the State of Illinois because of Senator Simon. He was a remarkable \nman.\n  He started in the early 1950s--maybe before that; maybe in the late \nforties--as a newspaper editor in southern Illinois. He was about 19 \nyears of age when he was asked to take over a troubled newspaper in \nTroy, IL, in Madison County. He actually revived the newspaper by going \nafter a corrupt gambling cabal in Madison County. He ultimately put \ntogether a string of some 13 newspapers that he sold in the 1960s, and \nthen went from journalism into politics and government service; he \nnever looked back.\n  He had numerous legislative accomplishments in the U.S. Senate, \nincluding the Direct Student Loan Program, the job training partnership \namendments, and many other initiatives across a wide spectrum of \nissues. Of course, he was very accomplished in the Illinois Legislature \nas well.\n  Some people think they have done a lot when they have read a book. \nSenator Simon probably wrote as many books as most people have read. He \nis the author of at least 21 books, and maybe more than that. He had 55 \nhonorary degrees. As I mentioned, he was a candidate for President in \n1988.\n  One of the most astonishing things about Paul Simon was that his \nethics and integrity were not just an act. I think a lot of the \nprofessional politicians maybe didn't always appreciate him in Chicago, \nfor example. They maybe thought his bow tie and his constant efforts to \nmaintain the highest standards in Illinois and the Federal Government \nwere an act. But you could see after he retired from the Senate when he \nwas offered, reportedly by foreign governments, to become a high paying \nlobbyist--I think one foreign government offered him over $600,000 a \nyear to become their lobbyist, and he was offered a variety of \nlucrative positions. He turned all that down so he could return to \nMakanda, IL, down in the southern part of the State where he came from \nso he could teach at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale and be \na professor. He turned down higher paying professorships elsewhere in \nthe country. He wanted to come back home and be at Southern Illinois \nUniversity.\n  He put together a wonderful public policy institute with some others \nthere, including Mike Lawrence, who was the press secretary to our \nformer Gov. Jim Edgar in Illinois.\n  I was in the area down by SIU this past summer. I had dinner with \nMike Lawrence and he was telling me how hard it was to keep up with \nPaul Simon. Even at his age, he was keeping a remarkable schedule. So \nit came as a great surprise to hear of his passing today. It is a great \nloss. We will all miss him.\n  He was nothing but kind to me. Even though I was a member of the \nopposite party, Senator Simon last called me when I announced I would \nbe retiring from the Senate. He was always courteous and kind in \noffering to help everyone he could.\n  I remembered from long ago reading a column that was written about \nPaul Simon, which I thought was a fabulous testament to this wonderful \nman. The column was written in the Chicago Tribune on February 28, \n1997. It was by R. Bruce Dold, entitled ``In Praise of a Decent Former \nPolitician.'' This column is written by a journalist who had covered \nSenator Simon for many years, including following him around on his \nelection campaigns and seeing his interaction with people all over the \nState of Illinois. This reporter wrote about how he was amazed that \nSenator Simon would come into a small town and say hi to everybody, and \nhe would actually know the names of their children and how their \ngrandfather was doing.\n  Senator Simon had a genuine affection for people. He was a tireless \nworker. He held over 600 town meetings in his two terms in the Senate, \nwhich is a very tough pace to keep up with for any of us in the Senate. \nHe was a remarkable man.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this commentary written by R. Bruce Dold \nbe printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I conclude by saying that Senator Paul Simon was a \ncredit to the State of Illinois and a credit to the Senate, and we will \nmiss him. God rest his soul and may God bless his widow and family.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Feb. 28, 1997]\n\n                 In Praise of a Decent Former Politician\n\n                           (By R. Bruce Dold)\n\n       One of my best lessons in southern Illinois politics came \n     with Paul Simon's 1984 campaign for the U.S. Senate, the one \n     where he dusted Sen. Charles Percy and made amends for his \n     one big political loss, the 1972 bid for governor.\n       Simon planned to hit about 13 towns in one day, moving from \n     Vandalia to Cairo and over to Carbondale, with a brief stop \n     at his Makanda home to show off his Lincoln book collection \n     to the handful of reporters with him. He'd be meandering over \n     a few hundred miles, which normally would require a \n     helicopter. For Simon, all it required was Joe Bob Pierce.\n       Joe Bob is something of a Renaissance man--an electric \n     power lineman with a Baptist divinity school degree who can \n     drive like a bat out of hell, that last talent being the one \n     Simon required that day.\n       So the trip went like this. We would drive to the Franklin \n     county Courthouse public square, and Simon would give a \n     little speech, and then he would do the real campaigning. \n     This amounted to greeting each person in the crowd by her \n     first name and inquiring about her children and her frail \n     grandfather, and then moving on to the next soul with a \n     hearty ``nice to see you.''\n       Then we would pile into Joe Bob's car and he would hit \n     triple digit m.p.h. on Rt. 142 until we barreled into the \n     parking lot of the Saline Valley Conservancy District, where \n     Simon would do it all over again.\n       And I realized by the second stop that he actually knew all \n     of these people, and the ages of their kids, and the health \n     status of their grandfathers.\n       Simon wasn't supposed to win that election but he did, in \n     part because he swept most of Southern Illinois.\n       He's back home now after ending an impressive career in \n     politics. He's believed to be the only person who ever served \n     in the Illinois and U.S. House and Senate.\n       On paper, his career makes no sense. Before politics, he \n     was a newspaper editor who shook things up in a part of \n     Illinois that liked things calm. He was too liberal for his \n     congressional district, too liberal for this state, too \n     liberal for Congress. He was a bigger-government advocate in \n     a little-government era. Didn't matter. People thought he\n\n[[Page S16094]]\n\n     cared about them. He won his last Senate race by almost 1 \n     million votes.\n       A few Washington types, and a few well-known Chicago \n     politicians, still believe it was an act, that Simon was just \n     another pol who had perfected a gee-whiz persona and the \n     public got snookered into buying it. And while I always liked \n     Paul Simon, I was also suspicious enough of politics in \n     general to keep alive the prospect that they might be right.\n       OK, now that he's retired, it's safe to say that they are \n     wrong.\n       When Simon left the Senate and there was no electoral \n     advantage to being pure, he still did the right thing.\n       He turned down offers to lobby in Washington--one offer was \n     for $600,000 a year to work for foreign governments. I'm \n     taking his word on this--there's that suspicion rising again. \n     But in the years I've known him he hasn't given me reason not \n     to take his word.\n       He also turned down several teaching offers at better-known \n     schools around the country to take a job running the new \n     Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in \n     Carbondale, near his home.\n       Nobody needs to hold a tag day for him, since he's drawing \n     $120,000 a year from SIU. But they offered him $140,000 and \n     he requested a $20,000 cut so he wouldn't be paid more than \n     the chancellor. That's the kind of gesture that makes the \n     political cynics snicker, and makes the rest of the world \n     think Paul Simon is a very decent guy.\n       Now that Simon's back home and doesn't have to be concerned \n     about his own elections, he could be more of a political \n     broker in this state.\n       He proved he could transfer his credibility and popularity \n     last year when Richard Durbin was a relatively unknown \n     central Illinois congressman making his introductions to \n     Chicagoans at the same time he was asking them to send him to \n     the Senate. Nobody up here knew Richard Durbin from Richard \n     Burton. But Simon's endorsement, repeated on television \n     commercials, was gold. It gave Durbin instant credibility and \n     carried him to the election.\n       So Simon could throw his weight around. He intends not to. \n     Other than supporting Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun's re-election \n     bid, he's planning to lay low in politics.\n       He could be a big factor in the Democratic primary for \n     governor next year. Lots of people want to run. But it looks \n     like Simon won't play the game. He told me this week he's \n     been approached by several potential candidates, but doesn't \n     plan to endorse anybody. He's happy teaching his government \n     and non-fiction writing courses and doesn't want to taint his \n     new institute with the smell of partisan politics.\n       ``I anticipate I will be less involved in party activities \n     than I was before,'' he said. ``I have to be reaching out to \n     both political parties.''\n       For a political writer in Chicago, saying something kind \n     about a politician is akin to volunteering to put a kick-me \n     sign on your back. But here goes: the people were right all \n     along, Paul Simon really is a very decent guy.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we have all just heard the sad news about \nour former colleague, Senator Simon, from the Senator from Illinois. \nThere will be opportunities in the future for more formal comments from \nmany Members of the Senate, but I thought this afternoon I would make a \nfew brief comments about our colleague Paul Simon.\n  I had the opportunity to serve in the Senate with Paul, but I also \nhad the opportunity for a few years to serve in the House of \nRepresentatives with Paul. What a treat it was to serve in both bodies \nwith Paul. Shortly after I came to the House, I discovered that when \nPaul Simon came to the well of the House of Representatives, he was \nsomeone to come into the House Chamber and listen to because no matter \nwhat the topic, we could count on the fact that he was going to give a \nthoughtful speech. You might agree with him, you might not agree with \nhim, but you could bet that this man of great integrity had thought \nthrough what he was going to say. You can bet that he truly believed \nwhat he was saying.\n  Members would listen to Paul Simon, whether it was in the House or \nSenate. Paul Simon was a man of great integrity. When he spoke, it was \nclear he was a man of great moral clarity in his comments and thoughts. \nThere was great precision to those thoughts.\n  We all know that Paul Simon was first, in his career, maybe first and \nforemost, a writer. He started, as my colleague from Illinois has just \nsaid, at a newspaper. Some have labeled him as a crusading newspaper \neditor. That is how he got his start. He continued to write throughout \nhis career, writing his columns back to his home State and writing \nbooks.\n  I was back home in Ohio at the house of my daughter and son-in-law \nthis past weekend and I happened to look down and there was what I took \nto be one of Paul's newest books. I picked it up and read a few pages. \nThere was Paul again, being very provocative, being very thoughtful. He \nmade me think. That was Paul.\n  One of the books Paul wrote many, many years ago continues to be \ncited today. Anybody who reads a biography of Abraham Lincoln will find \nthe work of Paul Simon in that book because, you see, Paul Simon wrote \nthe definitive book about Abraham Lincoln's time in the Illinois \nLegislature. So whatever definitive biography you read of Abraham \nLincoln, it will cite Paul Simon's book for that period of Abraham \nLincoln's life.\n  Paul Simon was asked once why he wrote the book. He said he had \ndiscovered there just hadn't been a good book written on that period of \nAbraham Lincoln's life, so Paul Simon wrote it. He did the research, \ndug the information out, and wrote the book. It is still the definitive \nbook.\n  Paul Simon was, more than anything else, a teacher. You could see \nthat in his speeches on the Senate floor and the House floor before \nthat. You could see that, really, in his columns, his writings. So I \nthink it is fitting that at the end of his career, as Senator \nFitzgerald said, he went home. He went home to southern Illinois. He \ncreated this great institute at southern Illinois, his home community. \nHe brought in great speakers, talked about big topics, great topics \nthat we have to deal with in our country. He headed that up, put it \ntogether, and dealt with those issues.\n  He ended his life as a teacher, what he really was throughout his \nentire career, beginning as a newspaper man: Paul Simon the teacher. So \nas he taught us in the Senate, as he taught us in the House of \nRepresentatives, he ended his life as a teacher to young people in his \nhome of Carbondale, in southern Illinois. I think that is clearly the \nway Paul Simon wanted it. I think it is fitting that is how he ended \nhis life.\n  This is a sad day for the Senate. It is a sad day, certainly, for \nIllinois, and for his country. But we can take joy in this very good \nman's life and what he has done for our country and what he ended his \nlife doing for our young people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Improved Nutrition and \n     Physical Activity Act'' or the ``IMPACT Act''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress makes the following findings:\n       [(1) An estimated 61 percent of adults and 13 percent of \n     children and adolescents in the Nation are overweight or \n     obese.\n\n[[Page S16095]]\n\n       [(2) The prevalence of obesity and being overweight is \n     increasing among all age groups. There are twice the number \n     of overweight children and 3 times the number of overweight \n     adolescents as there were 29 years ago.\n       [(3) An estimated 300,000 deaths a year are associated with \n     being overweight or obese.\n       [(4) Obesity and being overweight are associated with an \n     increased risk for heart disease (the leading cause of \n     death), cancer (the second leading cause of death), diabetes \n     (the 6th leading cause of death), and musculoskeletal \n     disorders.\n       [(5) Individuals who are obese have a 50 to 100 percent \n     increased risk of premature death.\n       [(6) The Healthy People 2010 goals identify obesity and \n     being overweight as one of the Nation's leading health \n     problems and include objectives of increasing the proportion \n     of adults who are at a healthy weight, reducing the \n     proportion of adults who are obese, and reducing the \n     proportion of children and adolescents who are overweight or \n     obese.\n       [(7) Another goal of Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate \n     health disparities among different segments of the \n     population. Obesity is a health problem that \n     disproportionally impacts medically underserved populations.\n       [(8) The United States Surgeon General's report ``A Call To \n     Action'' lists the treatment and prevention of obesity as a \n     top national priority.\n       [(9) The estimated direct and indirect annual cost of \n     obesity in the United States is $117,000,000,000 (exceeding \n     the cost of tobacco-related illnesses) and appears to be \n     rising dramatically. This cost can potentially escalate \n     markedly as obesity rates continue to rise and the medical \n     complications of obesity are emerging at even younger ages. \n     Therefore, the total disease burden will most likely \n     increase, as well as the attendant health-related costs.\n       [(10) Weight control programs should promote a healthy \n     lifestyle including regular physical activity and healthy \n     eating, as consistently discussed and identified in a variety \n     of public and private consensus documents, including ``A Call \n     To Action'' and other documents prepared by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services and other agencies.\n       [(11) Eating preferences and habits are established in \n     childhood.\n       [(12) Poor eating habits are a risk factor for the \n     development of eating disorders and obesity.\n       [(13) Simply urging overweight individuals to be thin has \n     not reduced the prevalence of obesity and may result in other \n     problems including body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and \n     eating disorders.\n       [(14) Effective interventions for promoting healthy eating \n     behaviors should promote healthy lifestyle and not \n     inadvertently promote unhealthy weight management techniques.\n       [(15) Binge Eating is associated with obesity, heart \n     disease, gall bladder disease, and diabetes.\n       [(16) Anorexia Nervosa, an eating disorder from which 0.5 \n     to 3.7 percent of American women will suffer in their \n     lifetime, is associated with serious health consequences \n     including heart failure, kidney failure, osteoporosis, and \n     death. In fact, Anorexia Nervosa has the highest mortality \n     rate of all psychiatric disorders, placing a young woman with \n     Anorexia at 18 times the risk of death of other women her \n     age.\n       [(17) Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa usually appears \n     in adolescence.\n       [(18) Bulimia Nervosa, an eating disorder from which an \n     estimated 1.1 to 4.2 percent of American women will suffer in \n     their lifetime, is associated with cardiac, gastrointestinal, \n     and dental problems, including irregular heartbeats, gastric \n     ruptures, peptic ulcers, and tooth decay.\n       [(19) On the 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 7.5 percent \n     of high school girls reported recent use of laxatives or \n     vomiting to control their weight.\n       [(20) Binge Eating Disorder is characterized by frequent \n     episodes of uncontrolled overeating, with an estimated 2 to 5 \n     percent of Americans experiencing this disorder in a 6-month \n     period.\n       [(21) Eating disorders are commonly associated with \n     substantial psychological problems, including depression, \n     substance abuse, and suicide.\n       [(22) Eating disorders of all types are more common in \n     women than men.\n\n                       [TITLE I--TRAINING GRANTS\n\n     [SEC. 101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Improved Nutrition and \n     Physical Activity Act'' or the ``IMPACT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) An estimated 61 percent of adults and 13 percent of \n     children and adolescents in the Nation are overweight or \n     obese.\n       (2) The prevalence of obesity and being overweight is \n     increasing among all age groups. There are twice the number \n     of overweight children and 3 times the number of overweight \n     adolescents as there were 29 years ago.\n       (3) An estimated 300,000 deaths a year are associated with \n     being overweight or obese.\n       (4) Obesity and being overweight are associated with an \n     increased risk for heart disease (the leading cause of \n     death), cancer (the second leading cause of death), diabetes \n     (the 6th leading cause of death), and musculoskeletal \n     disorders.\n       (5) Individuals who are obese have a 50 to 100 percent \n     increased risk of premature death.\n       (6) The Healthy People 2010 goals identify obesity and \n     being overweight as one of the Nation's leading health \n     problems and include objectives of increasing the proportion \n     of adults who are at a healthy weight, reducing the \n     proportion of adults who are obese, and reducing the \n     proportion of children and adolescents who are overweight or \n     obese.\n       (7) Another goal of Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate \n     health disparities among different segments of the \n     population. Obesity is a health problem that \n     disproportionally impacts medically underserved populations.\n       (8) The United States Surgeon General's report ``A Call To \n     Action'' lists the treatment and prevention of obesity as a \n     top national priority.\n       (9) The estimated direct and indirect annual cost of \n     obesity in the United States is $117,000,000,000 (exceeding \n     the cost of tobacco-related illnesses) and appears to be \n     rising dramatically. This cost can potentially escalate \n     markedly as obesity rates continue to rise and the medical \n     complications of obesity are emerging at even younger ages. \n     Therefore, the total disease burden will most likely \n     increase, as well as the attendant health-related costs.\n       (10) Weight control programs should promote a healthy \n     lifestyle including regular physical activity and healthy \n     eating, as consistently discussed and identified in a variety \n     of public and private consensus documents, including ``A Call \n     To Action'' and other documents prepared by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services and other agencies.\n       (11) Eating preferences and habits are established in \n     childhood.\n       (12) Poor eating habits are a risk factor for the \n     development of eating disorders and obesity.\n       (13) Simply urging overweight individuals to be thin has \n     not reduced the prevalence of obesity and may result in other \n     problems including body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and \n     eating disorders.\n       (14) Effective interventions for promoting healthy eating \n     behaviors should promote healthy lifestyle and not \n     inadvertently promote unhealthy weight management techniques.\n       (15) Binge Eating is associated with obesity, heart \n     disease, gall bladder disease, and diabetes.\n       (16) Anorexia Nervosa, an eating disorder from which 0.5 to \n     3.7 percent of American women will suffer in their lifetime, \n     is associated with serious health consequences including \n     heart failure, kidney failure, osteoporosis, and death.

Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished majority leader, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist. \nFrom time to time, Congress is confronted with a public health crisis \nof such magnitude that we have no choice but to act. For a number of \nreasons, including the changing physical environment, eating and \nphysical activity habits, obesity has now emerged as a serious new \npublic health threat. More than 65 percent of American adults and 15 \npercent of children are obese or overweight. These figures double the \nlevels during the 1980s for adults and triple the levels for children. \nObesity now contributes to an estimated 300,000 deaths annually. We \nalso know that obesity contributes to diabetes, high blood pressure, \nhigh cholesterol, cancers and heart disease. The economic impact also \nis alarming. The Surgeon General reports that obesity costs the Nation \nover $117 billion directly and indirectly. These tends will continue if \nwe do not develop a comprehensive strategy to prevent and treat this \ncondition.\n  I commend Senator Frist and others for introducing the Improved \nNutrition and Physical Activity Act to begin to tackle this challenge. \nSenator Frist as a physician certainly understands the impact of rising \nobesity rates. I commend his leadership on this issue. I believe that \nhe and I agree that this IMPACT bill is an important step forward, but \nthat more may need to be done to prevent and treat obesity. In view of \nthe continuing and growing public health threat, I wonder if my friend \nand colleague would agree with me now that the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee, as the committee of jurisdiction in this policy \narea, should devote further attention to this problem next year. I \nwonder whether he, as a fellow member of that HELP Committee, would \nagree with me now to urge chairman and ranking member of that committee \nto hold a hearing early in the next session of this Congress for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. As he knows, I \nbelieve this issue of obesity is one of the largest unaddressed public \nhealth issues we face today, and I am pleased by the action we are \ntaking today. I agree that it is critical that we continue to direct \nour attention to this issue, and it is my hope that the HELP Committee \nwill continue to examine the issue, including by holding a hearing next \nyear.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the attention of the majority leader to this \nsubject. I commend his work and congratulate him on passage of this \nbill. I look forward to sending a joint letter to the HELP Committee, \nrequesting a hearing, and I look forward to working with the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and others to build on this important start in combating \nharmful obesity.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1172), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this bill we just passed does exactly as \nstated. It establishes grants to address health services for nutrition, \nfor increased physical activity, and for obesity prevention.\n  It is late in the day, and a little bit later we will bring this \nsession to a close. I am delighted personally, as a physician and as a \nSenator, that this body came forward to pass this important piece of \nlegislation. I draw the attention of my colleagues to last week's \nedition of Newsweek magazine. It features a special section on the top \n10 health stories of 2003. Weighing in as No. 1 in the Newsweek story \nin the judgment of its editor is the obesity epidemic in America. That \ncomes before depression, it comes before cancer, and it comes before \neven the SARS virus.\n\n  The magazine reports that more than 65 percent of Americans are \noverweight or obese and rates of obesity-related illnesses are \nskyrocketing. Fifteen percent of America's children are seriously \noverweight, triple the number in 1970. It is an epidemic that is \ngetting worse day by day, week by week, month by month, and year by \nyear.\n  As a physician and as a Senator, this particular issue is one about \nwhich I care passionately. I have spoken to this issue frequently in \nthe Senate and I return tonight to do so for a few moments. I applaud \nthe media outlets because they have done a very good job in \nhighlighting and spotlighting this new epidemic. They are taking this \nobesity threat seriously and helping to communicate that around the \nUnited States of America.\n  The message is simple, that obesity, which is growing day by day, is \ndebilitating. It is effectively debilitating millions of Americans. \nIndeed, it has reached epidemic proportions in all ages but in \nparticular in children.\n  Historically, obesity was considered just another lifestyle choice. \nIt was a tolerable consequence of eating food, eating good food, and \neating lots of food. It was a consequence of driving instead of \nwalking. But now we know obesity literally causes heart disease. Heart \ndisease is the No. 1 killer in Americans. Now we know that obesity \ncauses diabetes, causes cancer, contributes to stroke. Indeed, a \nwhopping 300,000 deaths a year can be linked directly to fat. And it is \nspreading. It is spreading in children. The percentage of kids age 6 to \n19 who are overweight has not just doubled, not just tripled but almost \nquadrupled since the 1960s.\n  Nationwide, type 2 diabetes, which is the kind associated with being \noverweight, being obese, has skyrocketed. The Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention estimates that one in three Americans born \ntoday--they studied the year 2000--will develop diabetes in their \nlifetime. It is the type of diabetes that can be prevented and it can \nbe treated.\n  With African-American children and you look at Hispanic children, \nthat number jumps to nearly half; one out of two African American and \nHispanic babies born this year or last year will develop diabetes. As \nadults, we know it is hard to battle being overweight. But imagine, for \na 10-year-old child, the challenge to both prevent and to treat this \nepidemic.\n  Diabetes leads to a whole host of chronic illnesses. It is the \nleading cause of amputations in our society today. It is the leading \ncause of blindness in our society today. It is the\n\n[[Page S16100]]\n\nleading cause of heart disease and kidney disease in our society today.\n  With regard to children, teachers can tell the story. Teachers have \nthe opportunity to see children in classrooms on a regular basis. They \nsay they see kids out of breath simply walking up the stairs in school. \nThey tell us about kids who, when they get outside of the school and go \nto the schoolyard, are out of breath or, they come back exhausted from \na simple field trip.\n\n  Activities that we associate with exercise such as kick ball, jumping \nrope, climbing trees, for many kids today these are grueling exercises, \ngrueling activities that are to be avoided at all cost because of their \nfeeling of overexertion and being out of breath. Twenty-five percent of \nour Nation's children say they do not participate in any vigorous \nactivity. That is one in four. Obesity is robbing them not only of \nenjoying the normal traditional childhood pastimes but it also is \nliterally robbing them of their childhood years. By that I mean that \nobesity is associated with the early onset of puberty among girls. \nAccording to a study from the University of North Carolina, 48 percent \nof African-American girls begin puberty by age 8, over a quarter by age \n7.\n  Indeed, this is a national health crisis. It is harming our children \nin ways we can readily observe. It is also harming our children in ways \nwe do not so readily observe that will not become apparent until later \nin life. Yes, you observe the obesity but you do not see the side \neffects of the obesity until much later. Those side effects, as I \nmentioned before, are heart disease, amputation, blindness, a \ndebilitating disease that condemns them to more illness, condemns them \nto a shorter life.\n  Again, this is a new phenomena. If we look at the history of medicine \nin this country, back a few hundred years, we are going along like this \nand in the 1960s or 1970s we have hit epidemic proportions. The reason \nI talk about it in the Senate and the reason why the bill just passed, \nthe IMPACT Act, is so important is because this trend can be reversed. \nIf we reverse it, we also reverse heart disease, lung disease, stroke, \nvarious types of cancer. That is what this body should be about. That \nis what this body is about and we demonstrated it by passing this so-\ncalled IMPACT Act that looks at nutrition, looks at physical activity, \nthat focuses on young people. We are taking action; we are offering \nsolutions. We cannot solve it all with this particular bill, but we \nshow we are addressing identified problems; we are reversing problems \nthat are apparent in our society.\n  In this session, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions unanimously approved the IMPACT Act, which we just passed in \nthe Senate, the Improved Nutrition and Physical Activity Act. It was \nintroduced earlier this year by myself with Senators Bingaman, Dodd, \nand others. This IMPACT Act uses a multifaceted approach that \nemphasizes youth education to jump-start healthy habits early. It funds \ndemonstration projects to find innovative ways, creative ways, to \nimprove eating and exercise. In addition--and this is critically \nimportant--it includes rigorous evaluation so we can learn what is \nbest.\n  We see many different proposals. We cannot turn on television without \nseeing the latest fad, the latest diet or the latest cure. It is a huge \nindustry. What we in the Government can do and should be doing is \nevaluating what works best in terms of what we implement through this \nprogram. This bill does not attempt to control what Americans eat or \nwhat Americans do not eat. This bill does not outlaw bad foods. It does \nnot attempt to replicate in any way that $1 billion diet and fitness \nindustry. It does have a modest pricetag and that reflects the \nappropriate role of the Federal Government.\n  Working with the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Judd Gregg, \nand Senator Dodd, Senator Bingaman, and others, I am delighted--I am \ndelighted--that we have, as authors, as sponsors, just seen this bill \npass by unanimous consent.\n  I do hope the House of Representatives will join us early next year \nin sending this legislation to the President of the United States for \nhis signature.\n  Again, this is not ``the'' solution. There is no single solution to \nthis growing epidemic of obesity, but there are solutions. This \nepidemic can be reversed, and the start is awareness and then action. \nThat is why, indeed, I am speaking at this fairly late hour on this \nparticular issue, because we have just demonstrated, through action, \nthat this body will work toward solutions, and to also state the \nimportance of the awareness, especially awareness among children. And \nthat is where this IMPACT bill will have a direct impact.\n  We know the consequences of obesity. We can and we should keep our \nkids safe by helping to keep them fit. Tonight, in this body, we \ndemonstrated the start.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think it is fitting that the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois is in the chair. I know Senator \nFrist either has or intends to say something about the tragic news we \njust received this afternoon.\n  I had the privilege, the honor, of working with Paul Simon for 12 \nyears. He brought a decency, a sense of humor, to his life and to his \nwork that I think has never been matched. True to his roots as an \ninvestigative journalist, he had a clear eye for injustice and an \nuntiring devotion to using power to improve the lives of Americans.\n  At the same time, he recognized that in order to maintain citizens' \nsupport for Government, we needed to preserve their faith in the \npolitical process.\n  Paul Simon was among the more vocal and effective advocates of \ncampaign finance reform, and his leadership helped clear the way for \nthe McCain-Feingold bill, passed 5 years after his departure.\n  Even after his retirement, Paul Simon remained committed to raising \ncitizens' understanding of and faith in Government and politics through \nhis writings and his work to begin Southern Illinois University's \nPublic Policy Institute.\n  Anyone who knew or worked with Paul will miss his probing intellect, \nhis self-deprecating wit, his integrity, and his leadership. I will \nnever forget one of the last days that Senator Simon served, all of us \nsurprised him during a vote by coming to the floor wearing bow ties. I \nwill never forget the look on his face. We tried to replicate Paul \nSimon's look, but we could never replicate his soul, his character, his \npersonality, his drive, his intellect, his prodigious writing as the \nauthor of, I know, more than a dozen books.\n  Paul Simon was a friend. Paul Simon was a giant on whom we depended \nfor the guidance, the leadership, and the courage that this Senate has \ncome to expect of people as capable as he was when he served. We will \nmiss him dearly.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute and respect to \nSenator Paul Simon who, as we know, died earlier today following \nsurgery at the age of 75. On behalf of the Senate, I do extend my \ndeepest condolences to the Simon family. He was a wonderful man, a \nwonderful Senator, always thoughtful, always plain spoken, and a man of \nimpeccable integrity.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Senator Simon was the chief \nDemocratic sponsor of the balanced budget amendment. In 1990, his \nmargin of victory over the challenger was the highest of any contested \ncandidate in the Nation for Senator or Governor.\n  He authored 15 books. He received 39 honorary degrees. It was just a \nfew\n\n[[Page S16101]]\n\nweeks ago that he came by my office, as he went by many Senators' \noffices, not stopping, not resting at all, but arguing for, making the \ncase for a wonderfully innovative program that helps expand and express \nthe understanding of Americans, of college students, of people just out \nof college for events around the world, to give people the opportunity \nto serve overseas for a period of time and then to come back and share \nthat knowledge and experience.\n  The fact that he came by the office--and it seems like yesterday; it \nwas several weeks ago now--and he had his flip charts. One by one, in \nthat sort of scholarly, serious, academic way, expressing the truth, \nwhat he knew would work in a creative and innovative way impressed me. \nIndeed, it should be the goal of all of us, once we leave this body, to \ncontinue the process, participating as actively as he demonstrated \nseveral weeks ago.\n  He was a champion of the people and, indeed, a credit to the United \nStates of America. To his family, to his friends, to his loved ones, \nour condolences go out to them over the coming days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16101-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE FIRST ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIC EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There is a great, possibly prophetic, story from the end \nof the Constitutional Convention in 1789. For weeks, delegates to the \nconvention had labored in the Philadelphia heat to draft a \nConstitution. Every day, crowds waited outside Independence Hall for \nany news of their progress. Finally, a draft was agreed upon. As \nBenjamin Franklin emerged from the hall, a woman asked, ``Dr Franklin, \nwhat have you given us: A monarchy? Or a republic?'' Franklin famously \nreplied, ``A republic--if you can keep it.''\n  Some of our founders would, no doubt, be surprised that we have \nindeed managed to keep this republic they dared to imagine and create \nmore than 200 years ago.\n  What has enabled the United States to become the world's oldest \nsurviving democracy is more than luck. It is more, even, than divine \nprovidence. It is also the result of deliberate work and effort by \ngenerations of Americans to understand and protect the principles on \nwhich our nation was founded, and to pass those lessons on, \nundiminished, to future generations.\n  That is the heart of what we mean by ``civic education.''\n  I know the majority leader shares my belief that Congress has an \nimportant role to play in ensuring that civic education in America \nremains strong and vital and that it reaches all Americans. For that \nreason, it was an honor for both of us, along with many of our \ncolleagues, to attend the First Annual Congressional Conference on \nCivic Education from September 20th to the 22nd of this year, in \nWashington, D.C.\n  The conference brought together education and civic leaders and \nothers from all 50 States and the District of Columbia and gave them an \nopportunity to compare notes about what is happening in their States to \nstrengthen civic education. Each State team also adopted a State action \nplan, which they will implement before the Second Annual Conference, \nwhich will be held in December 2004, also in Washington. I have the \nSouth Dakota State action plan, which I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16101-2", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           Civic Education Plan for the State of South Dakota\n\n       Members of the South Dakota delegation, who attended the \n     First Annual Conference On Civic Education in Washington D.C. \n     in September 2003, have devised a plan for analyzing and \n     improving civic education in the state. The South Dakota \n     delegation comprised of Glenna Fouberg. President of the \n     South Dakota State Board of Education, Representative Gerry \n     Lange, Jack Lyons, Chair of the South Dakota Humanities \n     Council, Bob Sutton, Executive Director of the South Dakota \n     Community Foundation, and Senator Drue Vitter have planned a \n     conference entitled ``Dialogue On Civic Education in South \n     Dakota.'' This event will take place in the capital building \n     in Pierre on November 10, 2003.\n       A variety of state educators and state administrators have \n     been invited to attend the conference that will focus on a \n     historic overview of civic education, the current status of \n     civic education, state certification requirements and teacher \n     preparation, and successful programs. Members of the S.D. \n     delegation will act as panelists for the event. Plenty of \n     time will be allowed for observations and questions from \n     those attending the conference.\n       The S.D. delegation has tentative plans for a follow-up \n     conference to be held in the state in either the spring or \n     summer. This event probably would be held in the Eastern part \n     of the state.\n       The South Dakota delegation hopes to convey to its \n     conference attendees the enthusiasm that they encountered at \n     the Washington conference for improving and revitalizing \n     civic education in the nation and the state.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I was very pleased to join the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Daschle, and our leadership colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives in hosting Congress's first Civic Education \nconference.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate, I want to recognize and thank the \ncosponsors of the first conference, the Alliance for Democracy and its \nmembers: the Center for Civic Education, the Center on the Congress at \nIndiana University and the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n  It is my understanding that there will be a total of five \nCongressional Conferences on Civic Education. These conferences will \nenable us to give civic education and civic participation the \nsustained, national attention they deserve but have not always gotten.\n  It is our hope to explore, at these annual conferences, the critical \nrole civic education plays in promoting civic participation--which is \nreally the lifeblood of any democracy.\n  We also want to find new and better ways to work with schools and \nwith education leaders to create first-rate citizenship education \nprograms in our nation's schools. I know this is an interest that the \nSenator from South Dakota shares.\n  I think this first conference provided an excellent start on that \ngoal. I ask unanimous consent to have the State action plan for my \nState of Tennessee printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16101-3", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16101-S16102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            Civic Education Plan for the State of Tennessee\n\n       ``Civic education should be a central purpose of education \n     essential to the well-being of representative democracy.''\n       ``Civic education should be seen as a core subject.

I share the Majority Leader's belief that schools are \ncritical in this effort. We must do a better job of educating our \nchildren to be the productive and involved citizens that our democracy, \nour country, needs.\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator from South Dakota is correct. There are other \nimportant partners as well.\n  Democracy isn't something that just happens to us. It's something \neach of us must actively create. Citizenship gives us rights, but it \nalso gives us responsibilities. Each of us has a responsibility to \nunderstand the great principles on which our great country was\n\n[[Page S16102]]\n\nfounded. Each of us has a responsibility to participate in the process \nof self-government.\n  It is an essential balance: rights and responsibilities. When we \nneglect either side of that equation, our democracy is in trouble.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I agree with the Senator from Tennessee. It's not enough \nfor the principles of our democracy to be known by only a few. That's \nnot American democracy. In order to have a strong, vibrant democracy, \neveryone has to participate. Everyone has to know the history and the \nrules. We all need to learn not just names and dates, but the process \nof democracy. We also need to develop new and better ways to keep \nadults informed and involved in the civic life of their communities and \nof our nation.\n  Our nation faces grave, new challenges today. The very real threat of \nterrorism is forcing us to examine the balance between liberty and \nsecurity. How do ``we the people'' respond to terrorism? How do ``we \nthe people'' operate in an increasingly global world? In a world in \nwhich we are inundated with information of all kinds, how do we assure \nthat people get the information they need to make informed decisions \nabout our democracy and our future? These are the kinds of questions \nthat future Congressional Conferences on Civic Education can explore.\n  Mr. FRIST. My friend is correct. The challenges and questions our \nnation faces today are different than those faced by our founders. But \nthey are, in many ways, just as profound.\n  The great principles of democracy are what unify us as a people and \nbind us together as a nation. They are what gives us the strength to \nface the challenges of a complex world as one people. And, as my friend \nnoted, they are what has made it possible for us to preserve the \nmiracle of Philadelphia and keep our republic for more than two \ncenturies.\n  I look forward to working with the distinguished democratic leader \nand with our colleagues in the House leadership to prepare for next \nyear's conference. I also look forward to working with my fellow \nTennesseans to see that our State produces an outstanding State action \nplan before that conference.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Conference Statement and join the majority leader in encouraging \nall of our colleagues to lend their support to this Congressionally-\nsponsored effort to dramatically improve civic education and civic \nparticipation in America.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Conference Statement--First Annual Congressional Conference on Civic \n                               Education\n\n       The participants at the First Annual Congressional \n     Conference on Civic Education acknowledge that there is an \n     urgent need to address the low level of civic engagement in \n     America. We recognize that:\n       Civic knowledge and engagement are essential to maintaining \n     our representative democracy. While many institutions help to \n     develop Americans' civic knowledge, skills, and dispositions, \n     schools must have the capacity to prepare students for \n     engaged citizenship. Civic education should be a central \n     purpose of education essential to the well-being of \n     representative democracy.\n       Civic education should be seen as a core subject. Well-\n     defined state standards and curricular requirements are \n     necessary to ensure that civic education is taught \n     effectively at each grade level from kindergarten through \n     12th grade. Strengthening the civic mission of schools must \n     be a shared responsibility of the public and private sectors \n     at the community, local, state, and national levels.\n       Policies that support quality teacher education and \n     professional development are important to ensure effective \n     classroom instruction and raise student achievement.\n       Well-designed classroom programs that foster an \n     understanding of fundamental constitutional principles \n     through methods such as service learning, discussion of \n     current events, or simulations of democratic processes and \n     procedures are essential to civic education.\n       In recognition of these findings, we resolve to take action \n     to reaffirm the historic civic mission of our schools.\n       Adopted by the Delegates to the First Congressional \n     Conference on Civic Education, September 22, 2003, in \n     Washington, D.C.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16102-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16102-S16103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced \nthe Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On November 11, 2003, a religious fundamentalist was arrested as a \nsuspect in an alleged plot to bomb abortion clinics and gay bars \nthroughout the eastern United States. On the day of his arrest, the \nsuspect had purchased gasoline cans, flares, propane tanks and starter \nfluids, in addition to pistols and silencers. Thankfully, the suspect \nwas arrested before he was able to commit multiple crimes of hate.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss legislation \nto reform the rules governing class litigation. In October of this \nyear, the majority leader sought to proceed to the Class Action \nFairness Act, S. 1751.\n  I joined forty of my colleagues in opposing the motion to proceed. I \nsaid at the time that while I supported some reform of class action \nprocedures, I could not support S. 1751 in its current form. I also \nexpressed concern about whether there would be any meaningful \nopportunity for interested Senators to negotiate changes to the bill in \na bipartisan fashion.\n  Subsequent to the vote in October, I joined with three of my \ncolleagues in sending a letter to the majority leader on November 14, \n2003. In that letter, we reiterated our interest in class action reform \nand we outlined several areas where we believed revisions to S. 1751 \nwere in order.\n  In November, Senators Landrieu, Schumer and I entered into \ndiscussions with Senators Frist, Hatch, Grassley, Kohl, and Carper. \nThose discussions have resulted in a compromise agreed to by our eight \noffices that I believe significantly improves upon S. 1751. I also ask \nunanimous consent that a summary of the compromise produced by my \noffice be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. Lastly, Mr. President, I want to point out that in my view \nthis is a delicate compromise, which addresses the shortcomings of \ncurrent class action practice while at the same time protecting the \nright of citizens to join with fellow citizens to seek the redress of \ngrievances in the courts of our Nation. As I and my colleagues said in \nour letter of November 14th, it is ``critical'' that this agreement \n``be honored as the bill moves forward--both in and beyond the \nSenate.''\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\nSummary of Changes to S. 1751 as Agreed to by Senators Frist, Grassley, \n            Hatch, Kohl, Carper, Dodd, Landrieu, and Schumer\n\n     The Compromise Improves Coupon Settlement Procedures\n       S. 1751 would have continued to allow coupon settlements \n     even though only a small percentage of coupons are actually \n     redeemed by class members in many cases.\n       The compromise proposal requires that attorneys fees be \n     based either on (a) the proportionate value of coupons \n     actually redeemed by class members or (b) the hours actually \n     billed in prosecuting the class action. The compromise \n     proposal also adds a provision permitting federal courts to \n     require that settlement agreements provide for charitable \n     distribution of unclaimed coupon values.\n     The Compromise Eliminates the So-Called Bounty Prohibition in \n         S. 1751\n       S. 1751 would have prevented civil rights and consumer \n     plaintiffs from being compensated for the particular \n     hardships they endure as a result of initiating and pursuing \n     litigation.\n       The compromise deletes the so-called ``bounty provision'' \n     in S. 1751, thereby allowing plaintiffs to receive special \n     relief for enduring special hardships as class members.\n     The Compromise Eliminates the potential for Notification \n         Burden and Confusion\n       S. 1751 would have created a complicated set of \n     unnecessarily burdensome notice requirements for notice to \n     potential class members. The compromise eliminates this \n     unnecessary burden and preserves current federal law related \n     to class notification.\n     The Compromise Provides for Greater Judicial Discretion\n       S. 1751 included several factors to be considered by \n     district courts in deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction \n     over class action\n\n[[Page S16103]]\n\n     in which between one-third and two-thirds of the proposed \n     class members and all primary defendants are citizens of the \n     same state.\n       The compromise provides for broader discretion by \n     authorizing federal courts to consider any ``distinct'' nexus \n     between (a) the forum where the action was brought and (b) \n     the class members, the alleged harm, or the defendants. The \n     proposal also limits a court's authority to base federal \n     jurisdiction on the existence of similar class actions filed \n     in other states by disallowing consideration of other cases \n     that are more than three years old.\n     The Compromise Expands the Local Class Action Exception\n       S. 1751 established an exception to prevent removal of a \n     class action to federal court when 2/3 of the plaintiffs are \n     from the state where the action was brought and the ``primary \n     defendants'' are also from that state (the Feinstein \n     formula). The compromise retains the Feinstein formula and \n     creates a second exception that allows cases to remain in \n     state court if: (1) more than 2/3 of class members are \n     citizens of the forum state; (2) there is at least one in-\n     state defendant from whom significant relief is sought and \n     who contributed significantly to the alleged harm; (3) the \n     principal injuries happened within the state where the action \n     was filed; and (4) no other class action asserting the same \n     or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants \n     on behalf of the same or other persons has been filed during \n     the preceding three years.\n     The Compromise Creates a Bright Line for Determining Class \n         Composition\n       S. 1751 was silent on when class composition could be \n     measured and arguably would have allowed class composition to \n     be challenged at any time during the life of the case. The \n     compromise clarifies that citizenship of proposed class \n     members is to be determined on the date plaintiffs filed \n     the original complaint, or if there is no federal \n     jurisdiction over the first complaint, when plaintiffs \n     serve an amended complaint or other paper indicating the \n     existence of federal jurisdiction.\n     The Compromise Eliminates the ``Merry-Go-Round'' Problem\n       S. 1751 would have required federal courts to dismiss class \n     actions if the court determined that the case did not meet \n     Rule 23 requirements. The compromise eliminates the dismissal \n     requirement, giving federal courts discretion to handle Rule \n     23-ineligible cases appropriately. Potentially meritorious \n     suits will thus not be automatically dismissed simply because \n     they fail to comply with the class certification requirements \n     of Rule 23.\n     The Compromise Improve Treatment of Mass Actions\n       S. 1751 would have treated all mass actions involving over \n     100 claimants as if they were class actions. The compromise \n     makes several changes to treat mass actions more like \n     individual cases than like class actions when appropriate.\n       The compromise changes the jurisdictional amount \n     requirement. Federal jurisdiction shall only exist over those \n     persons whose claims satisfy the normal diversity \n     jurisdictional amount requirement for individual actions \n     under current law (presently $75,000).\n       The compromise expands the ``single sudden accident'' \n     exception so that federal jurisdiction shall not exist over \n     mass actions in which all claims arise from any ``event or \n     occurrence'' that happened in the state where the action was \n     filed and that allegedly resulted in injuries in that state \n     or in a contiguous state. The proposal also added a provision \n     clarifying that there is no federal jurisdiction under the \n     mass action provision for claims that have been consolidated \n     solely for pretrial purposes.\n     The Compromise Eliminates the Potential for Abusive Plaintiff \n         Class Removals\n       S. 1751 would have changed current law by allowing any \n     plaintiff class member to remove a case to federal court even \n     if all other class members wanted the case to remain in state \n     court. The compromise retains current law--allowing \n     individual plaintiffs to opt out of class actions, but not \n     allowing them to force entire classes into federal court.\n     The Compromise Eliminates the Potential for Abusive Appeals \n         of Remand Orders\n       S. 1751 would have allowed defendants to seek unlimited \n     appellate review of federal court orders remanding cases to \n     state courts. If a defendant requested an appeal, the federal \n     courts would have been required to hear the appeal and the \n     appeals could have taken months or even years to complete.\n       The compromise makes two improvements: (1) grants the \n     federal courts discretion to refuse to hear an appeal if the \n     appeal is not in the interest of justice; (2) Establishes \n     tight deadlines for completion of any appeals so that no case \n     can be delayed more than 77 days, unless all parties agree to \n     a longer period.\n     The Compromise Preserves the Rulemaking Authority of Supreme \n         Court and Judicial Conference\n       The compromise clarifies that nothing in the bill restricts \n     the authority of the Judicial Conference and Supreme Court to \n     implement new rules relating to class actions.\n     The Compromise is Not Retroactive\n       Unlike the House Bill, the compromise will not \n     retroactively change the rules governing jurisdiction over \n     class actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16103-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16103-S16104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Tribute to Specialist Aaron J. Sissel\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow \nIowan and a great patriot, Iowa National Guard Specialist Aaron J. \n``George'' Sissel. Specialist Sissel gave his life in service to his \ncountry on November 29, 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom when \nthe convoy in which he was traveling came under enemy fire. This brave \nyoung man was only 22 years old at the time of his death.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate, my fellow Iowans, and all \nAmericans to join me today in paying tribute to Specialist Sissel for \nhis dedication to the cause of freedom and for his sacrifice in defense \nof the liberties we all so dearly prize. He selflessly served his \nNation, sacrificing his life for the great principles that underpin \nboth our way of life and the hopes and dreams of all humankind--the \nprinciples of liberty, justice, and equality. In a statement released \nfollowing his death, Specialist Sissel's family offered the following \nwords about their son and brother: ``Aaron 'George' died doing what he \nloved and believed in. We are very proud of him.''\n  We can all be very proud of men like Specialist Sissel. Our Nation's \nhistory is distinguished by the presence of extraordinary men and women \nwilling to risk their lives in defense of our country, but also by \nfamilies who sacrifice those they love for the sake of the great \nprinciples of American life. While we share the pride felt by \nSpecialist Sissel's family, we also share their grief. My deepest \nsympathy goes out to the members of Specialist Sissel's family, to his \nfriends, and to all those who have been touched by his untimely \npassing. May his mother, Jo, his father and stepmother, Kirk and Cindy, \nhis sister, Shanna, and his fiancee, Kari Prellwitz, be comforted with \nthe knowledge that they are in the thoughts and prayers of many \nAmericans, and that they have the eternal gratitude of an entire \nnation.\n  Specialist Sissel did not die in vain; rather, he died in defense of \nthe Nation he loved and the principles in which he believed. Indeed, \nSpecialist Aaron J. ``George'' Sissel has entered the ranks of our \nNation's greatest patriots, and his courage, his dedication, and his \nsacrifice are all testaments to his status as a true American hero.\n\n\n                    SP4 David J. Goldberg, U.S. Army\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my heart is heavy. Utah has once again \ngiven one of her sons to the cause of liberty.\n  Any loss of our fine young men or women is a tragedy. However, I \nbelieve this is particularly so with the loss of SP4 David J. Goldberg. \nHe was a fine young man, loved dearly by his parents and wife. Though \nof a young age, he had already accepted the responsibilities of a man \nand had volunteered to serve his Nation during a time of war. This \nsense of responsibility, especially to his fellow soldiers, was one of \nthe defining characteristics of his life. I have learned from the many \nwho knew him and loved him that the specialist was always there for his \nfellow soldiers, frequently volunteering for extra assignments when \nothers were not available. He will be greatly missed.\n  And so, another name has been added to Utah's List of Honor: SP4 \nDavid J. Goldberg. He joins an illustrious list that includes CPT \nNathan S. Dalley, West Point graduate and a member of the Army's 1st \nArmored Division, SSG James W. Cawley, U.S. Marine Corps Reserve; SSG \nNino D. Livaudais of the Army's Ranger Regiment; Randall S. Rehn, of \nthe Army's 3rd Infantry Division; SGT Mason D. Whetstone of the U.S. \nArmy and former Special Forces soldier Brett Thorpe.\n  Their names and the service they performed is something that I shall \nnever forget. I shall always honor them and their families.\n\n\n                    cpt nathan s. dalley, u.s. army\n\n  Mr. President, on November 17, God called home one of our best and \nbrightest, CPT Nathan S. Dalley. At the young age of 27, Captain Dalley \nentered the hallowed list of those sons and daughters of Utah who have \ngiven their lives for their country.\n  Captain Dalley epitomized what a soldier should be: a born leader, \nmindful of his responsibilities, and eager to help and encourage \nothers. He was exceptional in many ways, yet a decent man that treated \neveryone with respect. You see, I had the honor of\n\n[[Page S16104]]\n\nknowing Captain Dalley. I was proud to nominate him to the United \nStates Naval Academy; however, he decided to pursue his career in \npublic service with the Army and attended West Point. It should also be \nnoted that he was also accepted to the Air Force Academy; remarkable \nachievements by any standard.\n  While preparing these remarks, I went through my files and found \nthese words from this young man's Advanced Placement History teacher, \nwho wrote a nomination recommendation:\n\n       As impressive as [Nathan Dalley's] academic qualities are, \n     I find his personal qualities to be even more impressive . . \n     . His kindness and friendliness to everyone set him apart in \n     the classroom, and in the larger school setting. In my class \n     he was a remarkably effective cooperative learner and peer \n     tutor. Nate understands that his contributions to the \n     community as a whole are as important as his personal \n     academic success, and I have every confidence that he will be \n     successful in his future pursuits.\n\n  Captain Dalley not only met these high expectations, but exceeded \nthem.\n  To his mother, his sisters and his fiancee, I would like to say that, \nalthough I have no words to minimize your grief, I hope there is some \ncomfort in knowing that all who knew your son respected him and knew \nhim to be a good friend.\n  I will never forget Nathan Dalley or the others from Utah's list of \nhonor. Their sacrifice will make a difference, their will be freedom in \nIraq, and those who would destroy liberty will be brought to justice. \nSo today we add CPT Nathan S. Dalley to this illustrious list that \nincludes SSG James W. Cawley, United States Marine Corps Reserve; SSG \nNino D. Livaudais of the Army's Ranger Regiment; Randall S. Rehn, of \nthe Army's 3rd Infantry Division; SGT Mason D. Whetstone of the United \nStates Army; SP4 David J. Goldberg of the Utah-based 395th Finance \nBattalion, Army Reserve and former Special Forces soldier Brett Thorpe.\n  We will honor them always and stand fast behind their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16104-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16104-S16107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PATENT CHALLENGE PROVISIONS OF THE MEDICARE REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments about the \nhistoric Medicare legislation that President Bush signed into law \nyesterday.\n  I will center my remarks today on the provisions of the bill that \namend the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of \n1984. I am a coauthor of the 1984 law and it is of particular interest \nto me. This law, often referred to as the Waxman-Hatch Act or Hatch \nWaxman, is of great importance to my fellow Utahns and the rest of the \nAmerican public as it saves an estimated $8 to $10 billion for \nconsumers each year.\n  Over the past 2 years, the Senate has spent considerable time and \neffort debating refinements to the 1984 law designed to close some \nloopholes that emerged and were exploited. While I would have preferred \na more comprehensive reexamination of the statute with the goal of \nassessing how the law might be changed to facilitate new biomedical \nresearch and how best to disseminate the fruits of this research to the \npublic in a quick and fair fashion, the amendments made to Hatch-Waxman \nmade under the leadership of Senators Gregg, Schumer, McCain, Kennedy, \nCollins, and Edwards are very significant.\n  It has been my position for some time that once the Congress adopts \nand the President signs, as he did yesterday, Medicare reform \nlegislation that includes a prescription drug benefit, pressure will \ngrow on Congress and the Food and Drug Administration to find new ways \nto bring new biotechnology products to the public when the patents \nexpire. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will be compelled \nto look for ways to economize on the purchase of drugs and it seems \nlikely to me that the Department of Health and Human Services will have \nto explore regulatory measures that can produce saving. The \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs, Dr. Mark McClellan, has indicated a \nwillingness to examine this issue. Few, if any, of my colleagues in \nCongress have to date joined in the discussion surrounding whether and, \nif so, how to create a fast track approval system for biologic \nproducts, but I believe the bill signed into law yesterday will \nencourage this debate. I welcome this debate and recognize that very \nimportant public health matters are at its heart. As well, retaining \nAmerica's worldwide leadership in biomedical research is at stake \nwhenever we consider legislation that affects pharmaceutical related \nintellectual property.\n  We must proceed carefully but we must proceed. Critical to the \nsuccess of this debate is a need to observe the principle of balance \ncontained in the original 1984 law so that both research based firms \nand generic firms receive new incentives that will allow them to \ncontinue to produce and distribute the products that the American \npublic deserves.\n  As more and more biological products come to the market, the \npressures on the Federal Government, State governments, private \ninsurers, and private citizens to pay for these products will result in \nconsiderable pressure to create a fast track FDA approval system for \noff-patent biological products. Such a mechanism was not discussed in \nthe 1984 negotiations that resulted in Hatch-Waxman largely because the \nbiotechnology was still in its infancy. This is not the case today. \nFew, if any, of my colleagues in Congress have to date joined the \ndiscussion surrounding creating a fast track approval for off-patent \nfollow-on biologic products, but I believe the new law signed yesterday \nwill encourage this debate.\n  As part of an appraisal of the laws relating to the development and \napproval of pharmaceutical products, I would also hope that my \ncolleagues and the public will examine the full complement of \nincentives that Senator Lieberman and I have included in our bi-\npartisan bioterrorism bill, S. 666. These incentives, which include \nday-to-day patent term restoration and a harmonization of the marketing \nexclusivity period to the 10-year term employed by the EU and Japan, \nwill be helpful for the development of countermeasures to bioterrorist \nattacks and they should also be carefully considered with respect to \ndeveloping new vaccines, diagnostics, and preventive and therapeutic \nagents for a host of other diseases and conditions.\n  With respect to the patent challenge provisions of the Medicare bill, \nI want especially to commend the efforts of Senator Gregg, Chairman of \nthe HELP Committee and the Majority Leader, Senator Frist, for working \nso hard to improve this legislation. There can be no doubt that the \nbill the President signed yesterday is a big improvement compared with \nthe McCain-Schumer bill of last year, S. 812, that passed the Senate.\n  I must also commend my colleagues in the House including, Commerce \nCommittee Chairman Billy Tauzin, Commerce Committee Ranking Democrat \nJohn Dingell, and my colleagues from the House Judiciary Committee, \nChairman Jim Sensenbrenner and Ranking Democrat John Conyers, and \nIntellectual Property Subcommittee Chairman Lamar Smith for their help \nin vastly improving the Gregg-Schumer-Kennedy amendments that passed \nthe Senate by a 94-1 vote this summer.\n  As the sole dissenter in the Senate, I am pleased the conferees were \nable to work in a bipartisan, bicameral spirit to correct the \nconstitutional flaw in the Senate-passed bill. I commend the Department \nof Justice for its work that helped dislodge the unconstitutional \n``actual controversy'' language from the declaratory judgment provision \nof the bill.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees decided to reject the provision \nof the Senate bill that would have resulted in the so-called parking of \nexclusivity in cases in which a generic challenger could show that the \npatents held by a pioneer drug firm were not infringed or were invalid. \nIn order to give an incentive for vigorous patent challenges, the 1984 \nlaw granted a 180-day head start over other generic drug firms when the \npioneer firm's patents failed or were simply not infringed. As I will \nexplain in some detail, I think there may be a way to improve this \nlanguage further and to save consumers a considerable sum of money in \nthe process.\n  The 180-day marketing exclusivity rules were first enacted as part of \nthe Waxman-Hatch Act. The policy behind these provisions is to benefit \nthe public by creating an atmosphere that ensure vigorous challenges of \nthe patents held by innovator drug firms.\n  The intent of this section of the 1984 law was to award the 180-day \nhead start\n\n[[Page S16105]]\n\nto the first successful challenger of a pioneer firm's patents. \nUnfortunately, we drafters of the statute employed language that has \nbeen interpreted by the courts to grant the 180-days of exclusivity to \nthe first generic drug applicant to file an application with the FDA \nthat challenges the patents.\n  I must say that in most cases the first filer and first successful \napplicant was the same applicant. But I believe that the line of court \ndecisions that include the Mova and Granutec cases has resulted in the \nestablishment of a first filer regime that is not without unintended \nconsequences and perverse incentives. The mismatch between the rights \naccorded to the first applicants and first successful challenger \ncontributed to an atmosphere in which anticompetitive agreements were \nentered into between certain pioneer and generic drug firms.\n  I am pleased that the Medicare reform bill signed into law yesterday \ncontained Senator Leahy's Drug Competition Act, which is designed to \nincrease enforcement of longstanding provisions of antitrust law that \nprevent anti-consumer agreements. The 2002 FTC study, ``Generic Drug \nEntry Prior to Patent Expiration,'' catalogs the agency's actions in \nthis arena including such cases as those involving Hoescht and Andryx \nand Abbott and Geneva.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate language prevailed on Senator \nLeahy's Drug Competition Act so that potentially anticompetitive \nagreements between research-based and generic drug firms will be \nreported to both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \nCommission. I worked extensively with Senator Leahy on his bill in the \n107th Congress and took the lead, with his cosponsor, Senator Grassley, \nin convincing the House conferees of the wisdom of the Senate's dual \nreporting requirement.\n  So, the conferees made a number of important improvements to \nprovisions of the legislation affecting challenges to drug patents. At \nour August 1, 2003, Judiciary Committee hearing, both the FDA and FTC \nexpressed reservations about some elements of the Senate bill's rules \npertaining to the 180-day marketing provision. The Administration, \ncorrectly in my view, took exception to the provisions in the Senate \nbill that would have allowed a sue now/use the exclusivity later--and \nperhaps years later at that--policy on marketing exclusivity.\n  At the August 1st hearing, Mr. Robert Armitage, General Counsel of \nthe Eli Lilly Company, presented compelling testimony on the matter of \n``parking'' or delaying, the use of the 180-day exclusivity until the \nbasic patents expire. The question confronting policymakers centered on \nthe wisdom of retaining the Gregg-Schumer-Kennedy provision that would \nhave encouraged very early lawsuits by those with, for examples, \nnoninfringing formulations of the pioneer product, in order to gain the \npotentially very lucrative 180-days of exclusivity down the road.\n  I welcome and expect that day will come when Congress will reexamine \nthe whole rationale and operation of the 180-day marketing exclusivity \nprovisions. The day will come when the Congress will be forced to \nconfront the incongruity in the statute, pointed out by my friend and \nskilled patent-challenging lawyer and philanthropist, Al Engelberg, is \nawarding 180 days both for a successful invalidity challenge and an \nnon-infringement action. The former, a finding of invalidity, accrues \nto all generic firms while the latter benefits only the specific non-\ninfringer. This is a distinction with a difference in a sector of the \neconomy where a whole cottage industry has grown up fueled in large \npart by non-infringement suits to non-basic patents. It is less than \nclear that the public benefits as much as it can or should under the \npresent system which is left largely in place by the new bill language. \nThis issues deserves further discussion.\n  Nevertheless, I am pleased that the Senate language that allowed \nlong-term parking of exclusivity was modified in an important way by \nthe conferees. I want to commend the FDA and especially the Chief \nCounsel for Food and Drugs, Mr. Dan Troy, and the soon-to-be \nbetrothed Associate Commissioner for Legislative Affairs, Mr. Amit \nSachdev, for their contributions in this area.\n\n  Having now commended the administration for helping to improve \nmaterially the Senate version of the 180-day provisions, I must also \nunfortunately report to my colleagues in the Senate and to the American \npublic that we have not accomplished as much as possible with respect \nto the 180-day provisions.\n  First off, I continue to believe that it is both unfair and ill-\nadvised to retain the bill language that does not reward a non-first-\nfiler to gain the 180-days marketing exclusivity in the case, which \nwill admittedly be rare, in which the subsequent filer prevails on a \npatent invalidity challenge. I am told that conferee staff first \nthought that the provision as drafted, and now signed into law, would \nresult in a subsequent filer's successful invalidity challenge \nforfeiting the first filer's 180 days of marketing exclusivity. \nAlthough the successful challenger does not get the 180-day head start, \nat least under this reading, the subsequent successful challenger is \nnot penalized with respect to market entry. Upon further scrutiny of \nthe statutory language, it is my understanding that in such \ncircumstances the language may actually work to grant the 180-days of \nmarketing exclusivity to the first filer, so that the successful \nsubsequent challenger not only does not get the 180-day benefit, but \nactually receives a 180-day penalty for invalidating the patent.\n  If this is the correct way to read the statute, the law should be \nchanged.\n  I am told that the staff of any conferee nor the FDA strongly \ndefended this policy. Unfortunately, nor was there agreement to change \nthe language to at least clarify that the subsequent challenger's \nsuccess was at least a forfeiture event or, preferable from my \nperspective, would result in the granting of the 180-days to the \nsuccessful challenger in a patent invalidity challenge rather than \nbenefitting the fastest paper shuffler.\n  This is bad policy.\n  Finally, I must unfortunately report to my colleagues that the new \nstatute retains the Gregg-Schumer-Kennedy provision that may cost the \nFederal government, according to the Congressional Budget Office, $700 \nmillion over the next 10 years. Moreover, it is my understanding that \nthe total cost of this provision to consumers over the next 10 years \ncould exceed $3 billion.\n  At issue are the sections of the bill that essentially give the first \nfiler an exclusive right to the potential 180-day marketing exclusivity \nuntil its case is decided at the appellate court level. The question \narises of what happens if a subsequent filer is not sued by the pioneer \nfirm and is ready, willing and able to go to market but for waiting for \nthe disposition of the first filer's challenge in the appellate court? \nIf the first filer prevails in the appellate court, it will receive the \n180-days of exclusive marketing even though one or more subsequent \nfilers were ready, willing, and able to go to the market long before \nthe first filer's challenge was resolved.\n  I would also note the FTC study documents that when the first filer \nwins in the district court, they almost always prevail on appeal. The \nFTC opposed reinstating the earlier policy of the appellate court \ntrigger because it believes that, on average, consumers will lose out \nwhile generic firms get an extra measure of certainty.\n  In any event, subsequent to the Judiciary Committee hearing in August \nand throughout the fall as the conference committee met, I was involved \nin participating and facilitating discussions designed to craft \nlanguage to close this new loophole sanctioned by the Gregg-Schumer-\nKennedy language as well as to make a few other clarifications to the \nparking language. Specifically, I preferred statutory language that \nwould automatically convert unsuccessful Paragraph IV invalidity/\nnoninfringement challenges to standard Paragraph III--``the patents \nexpire on''--applications. FDA believes it can accomplish this by rule \nor guideline, but the courts have not been kind to FDA rulemaking with \nrespect to Hatch-Waxman in recent years.\n  While I am mindful that the forces behind the first filer system of \nchallenge have won the day in this legislation, I think in the \ncircumstance when the subsequent challenger has not been sued, and may \nhave even been issued a covenant not to be sued by the pioneer firm, \nthat the first filer should at least forfeit its 180 days if it is not \nprepared to go to market in the 75-day grace period the new provision \ncreates. This is\n\n[[Page S16106]]\n\ngood for the consumer and sound policy since the rationale behind the \n180-day provision is to create an incentive for challenges to the \npioneer's patents, not to create an entitlement to the first applicant \nto file a patent challenge with the FDA in the Parklawn Building. It \nseems to me that the first time that a blockbuster product is kept off \nthe market, perhaps for over a year, due to the application of this new \nlaw and there is a second generic ready, able and willing to go to \nmarket, there will be a great public clamor, as there should be.\n  At one point, I thought I was close to agreeing to language with \nSenator Kennedy and others to close this new loophole. Unfortunately, \nwe did not reach agreement and since this was a part of the legislation \nin which the Senate and House language was virtually identical, it is \nunderstandable the conferees concentrated their efforts on those many \nprovisions in which there were substantial differences. On the very \nlast days before the conference report was completed, Senator Schumer \nand I also came close to closing this newly created loophole, but time \nran out on this effort.\n\n  Let me just say I am mindful that the politics and financial \ninterests with respect to this issue among those in both the research-\nbased firms and generic drug companies are a very sensitive matter. I \nalso recognize it will be exceedingly difficult to reopen these \nprovisions now that the President has signed the bill into law. \nNevertheless, I think we got this aspect wrong and we should try to fix \nit. I pledge to continue to work with Senator Gregg, McCain, Schumer, \nKennedy as well as Representatives Tauzin, Dingell, Sensenbrenner, \nSmith, and Conyers and other interested members of Congress and other \naffected parties to fix this problem before consumers have to pay for \nthis ill-advised policy.\n  In the interest of moving this issue along in a constructive fashion, \nI have developed a discussion draft that emerged out of my discussions \nwith Senator Kennedy and others that addresses these issues. Frankly, \nmuch of this draft reflects refinements to a draft that Senator Kennedy \nprepared in part as a response to a draft prepared largely by several \nprivate sector parties earlier this year that I submitted to the \nMedicare conferees for their consideration. It is my understanding that \nthe administration does not oppose this language but, unfortunately, \nneither did it support this approach due, in some measure, to the fact \nthat it was not anxious to open new issues in the already complex \nMedicare conference.\n  Although they both opposed the underlying Medicare reform bill, I \ncommend my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Schumer for their interest \nin improving this particular aspect of the legislation.\n  In closing, let me say again that Senators Gregg, Kennedy, Schumer, \nMcCain, and Frist have worked hard to improve the patent challenge \nprovisions of current law and all deserve our thanks.\n  I am very proud of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act, which has done so much to help consumers have access \nto more affordable medications.\n  The underpinning of this great consumer measure is a very complex, \nlegal framework. Any changes to the law must be carefully scrutinized \nto assure they achieve their intended effect.\n  I plan to monitor very carefully the implementation of the first, \nsubstantial Waxman-Hatch amendments in almost two decades and intend to \nwork with my colleagues to make certain they achieve their intended \npurpose.\n  I welcome the views of any interested parties who wish to comment on \nthis discussion draft, as well as other implementation issues that the \nCongress should consider.\n  At the same time, I think there are broader issues here it behooves \nthe Congress to consider. These include the issue of follow-on \nbiologics as well as whether the law today contains the appropriate \nincentives, including intellectual property incentives, for \npharmaceutical research and development in light of the fact that \nscience appears to be moving away from an era of large patient \npopulation, small-molecule medicine to small patient-population, large \nbiological molecule therapies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the draft be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 812\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to report the success of a \nbipartisan effort in which Senators, Members of the House, their key \nstaff aides and a broad variety of religious and human rights groups \nhave engaged.\n  This effort has produced a greatly strengthened Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act which has passed the House, and which it \nis my honor to bring to the Senate floor. I am pleased to note that my \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, has \njoined me in cosponsoring this important legislation. The act will \ngreatly strengthen America's hand in combating the slavery issue and \nthe women's issue of our time--the annual trafficking of as many as 2 \nmillion women and children into sex and slave bondage. As such, this \nact will give needed tools to President Bush, and to all future \nPresidents, to take on the world's trafficking mafias and to protect \nthe traffickers' victims. It will thus also greatly facilitate the \npledge made by President Bush in his United Nations speech of September \n23 to make the war against trafficking a major commitment of his \nadministration.\n  But I am pleased and deeply honored to bring this bill before my \ncolleagues for yet another reason--one that I know will resonate with \nevery Member of this body. Both in spirit and substance, the measure \nnow before the Senate captures the hopes and the ideals of Paul and \nSheila Wellstone, without whose passion and commitment no U.S. anti-\ntrafficking initiative against worldwide sex and slave trafficking \nwould have been possible. It is one of my greatest sources of \nsatisfaction and fulfillment as a member of this body to have worked \nwith Paul and with Sheila to sponsor the Trafficking Victims Protection \nAct of 2000. In doing so, I and others were regularly inspired by these \ntwo friends to go the extra mile for the bill. After our first Foreign \nRelations Committee hearing on the bill, Paul remarked that the victims \nwho testified on behalf of the bill had produced his most moving \nexperience as a Senator. This says much about the man Paul was, and \nabout the manner in which his and Sheila's priorities were always \ndirected on behalf of abused, vulnerable, and powerless victims.\n  We honor Paul and Shelia today by taking up this bill. As pleased as \nthey would be by that gesture, it would be a much more meaningful \ntribute if we are able to pass the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act, for there are a number of vital, strengthening \nprovisions in the act that will greatly improve the fight against \ntrafficking.\n  First, the Director of the State Department Office to Combat and \nMonitor Trafficking in Persons has been raised to ambassadorial rank. \nThis step will elevate the status of the office precisely as it will \nbefit its present incumbent. John Miller, a former House Member known \nto many of us, is an able, respected, committed, and moral man who is \nnow the Federal Government's chief antislavery and antitrafficking \nofficial. He has served as head of the TIP Office with great \neffectiveness and skill, and I am confident that, as Ambassador Miller, \nhe will continue to do so.\n  Next, the reauthorization act resolves one of the original act's \ngreatest operational failings by ensuring that ``Tier II'' \ndesignations--given to counties that neither satisfy the act's high \nstandards for anti-trafficking performance nor clearly merit the act's \nautomatic sanctions--will not become an overbroad catchill category. \nUnder the act, countries on the cusp of Tier III designations will be \nplaced in a Tier II Special Watch List category and their performance \nin eliminating trafficking will be subject to special scrutiny, and the \nissuance of a special February 1 progress report and designation \nevaluation. Thus, the Special Watch List category will maintain strong \npressure on countries that may ``almost but not quite'' merit a \nsanctions-bearing Tier III designation, and will permit clear \ndifferentiation between those countries and others placed on Tier II \nbecause they have not met the very high standards required for Tier I \ndesignations.\n  Three points should be made in connection with the act's Special \nWatch List category. First, countries otherwise meriting Tier III \ndesignation but placed on the Tier II Special Watch List because they \nhave made section (e)(3)(A)(iii)(III) ``commitments . . . to take \nadditional future steps over the next year'' should only avoid Tier III \ndesignation under extraordinary circumstances, and only where they are \nengaged in implementing important and curative steps likely to be \nrapidly completed. Next, the provisions of section (e)(3)(A)(iii)(II) \nthat authorize Special Watch List treatment of countries that have \nfailed to engage in increased efforts to limit trafficking, prosecute \ntraffickers and protect trafficking victims should not be construed to \nautomatically bar Tier II designations when such efforts have not been \nmade. Finally, to address a matter of legitimate concern to the State \nDepartment, the act's mandate that special Feburary 1 reports are to be \nissued for all Special Watch List countries needs to be understood in \nterms of our intention that only countries on the Tier II-Tier III cusp \nare to be the subjects of full and complete reports. Finally, as an \noverall matter, it should be made clear that failure to be placed on \nthe Tier II Special Watch List will not bar a country from being placed \non Tier II in the following year.\n  A third major category of change established by the act involves the \nestablishment of additional ``minimum standards'' criteria for \ndetermining appropriate tier designations. First, the reauthorization \nmakes clear that countries may not escape more severe tier designations \nif they fail to keep meaningful records of what they have done to \ninvestigate, prosecute, convict and otherwise monitor their performance \nin the war against trafficking. Next, the reauthorization establishes \nan ``appreciable progress'' standard evaluating a country's \nperformance--a standard not intended to exculpate countries still \nsignificantly complicit in trafficking activities, but to ensure that \ncountries failing to make measurable progress on a year-to-year basis \nwill be negatively affected. In other words, the reauthorization \nestablishes a bottom-line ``performance standard'' to supplement the \noriginal act's ``effort standards.'' Next, and critically, the \nreauthorization adds a standard based\n\n[[Page S16108]]\n\non the percentage of noncitizen trafficking victims. This provision was \nadded to permit the Trafficking Office to employ critical and needed \nstandards to evaluate the antitrafficking performance of countries that \nhave legitimized prostitution. Simply put, this provision both allows \nand mandates the Trafficking Office to cut through dubious claims by \nlegalizing countries that they are providing meaningful protections to \ntheir so-called ``sex workers.''\n  A final point with regard to the act's minimum standards criteria for \ndetermining countries' tier status: It is the clear intent of the \nCongress, and there should be no mistake about this, that compliance \nwith one or a few of the criteria does not, must not, lead to automatic \ndesignation as a Tier I country. Likewise, compliance with one or a few \nof the criteria shall not, must not, in and of inself shield countries \nfrom Tier III designation. The designation process is intended to be \none of judgment and balance; and is not formulaic except to the intent \nof creating a presumption that Tier I status should only be granted to \ncountries that comply with all of the minimum standards criteria. \nCountries that deliberately and grossly violate ``only some'' of the \nact's minimum standards criteria may be designated as Tier III \ncountries if this be the judgment of the Trafficking Office--a judgment \nthat should be exercised where there are gross and flagrant failures to \ncomply with other minimum standards criteria. And, as noted, compliance \nwith most of the statute's minimum standards criteria, combined with \neven modes noncompliance with a remaining few, is not intended to \nproduce automatic Tier I designations.\n\n  Finally, a few words are in order regarding the Senior Policy \nOperating Group created by this spring's Omnibus Appropriations Act, \nwhich today's reauthorization bill both incorporates and strengthens. \nWhile what I am about to say should be clear from the act's language, \nand will be made explicit in the omnibus appropriations bill which the \nSenate was unfortunately not able to enact today. While the omnibus \nbill will take care of some of the issues related to the Senior Policy \nOperating Group with explicit statutory language, I nonetheless believe \nit important to make Congress's unmistakable intention clear in today's \nfloor statement.\n  First, it should be clear that Congress established the Senior Policy \nOperating Group as the body it intended to coordinate all of the \nGovernment's antitrafficing grants, policies and grant policies. The \nSenior Policy Operating Group is comprised of senior political \nappointees of each of the agencies with trafficking policy \nresponsibilities, and is thus perfectly structured to perform a vital \nfunction of monitoring government-wide policy consistency. As presently \nconstituted, the Senior Policy Operating Group is made up of such \nmembers as TIP Office Director John Miller, Deputy HHS Secretary Claude \nAllen, Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy Dan Bryant, \nAssistant AID Administrator for Eastern Europe and Russia Kent Hill. \nThe committee meets on a regular basis and has produced an \nextraordinary consensus, government-wide grant policy directive. Thus, \nthe Senior Policy Operating Group, including its chairman, John Miller, \ncan and must perform the function intended for it by Congress: to be \nthe sole and accountable body responsible for coordinating Federal \nanti-trafficking policies, grants and grant policies. Having said this, \nit should be noted that the coordinating responsibilities of the Senior \nPolicy Operating Group are not intended to supercede the decisionmaking \nauthority of the constituent members of the Task Force to Monitor and \nCombat Trafficking in Persons, to whom operating group members continue \nto report.\n  Finally, as should be clear from the language of the act, but as is \nalso worth unmistakably establishing, Congress did not intend that the \ndesignation of grants and/or policies as being for ``public health'' or \nlike purposes should in any way remove such policies or grants from \nSenior Policy Operating Group coordinating jurisdiction when those \npolicies or grants deal with the activities of traffickers, brothel \nowners, pimps or the women and children from whose activities they \nprofit. It is vital for the Federal Government to make consistent and \notherwise harmonize its activities to stop the spread of communicable \ndisease and AIDS and its activities designed to prosecute traffickers \nand eliminate trafficking. Both are vital objectives, and as recent \nletters form the Moscow Duma have clearly shown, such harmonization is \nimperatively pressing. Some persons may believe that forming \npartnerships with traffickers, pimps, and brothel owners in order to \nensure use of clean needles and condoms, and doing so in a manner which \nlegitimizes the abusers and enslavers of women and children and shields \nthem from prosecution, is the way to go. They are wrong. Others may \nbelieve that public health measurers to protect prostitutes from AIDS \nalways stand in the way of prosecuting the traffickers, pimps and \nbrothel owners who exploit them. They too are wrong. What Congress \nintends is that a Senior Policy Operating Group comprised of political \nappointees of all involved agencies is the body responsible for \nharmonizing the above objectives into a single set of government-wide \npolicies.\n  All this said, I reiterate my belief that the memory and spirit of \nPaul and Sheila Wellstone are alive in the bill before us, as are the \nspirits of such activists as the great English Parliamentarian and \nevangelist William Wilberforce, and the abolitionist leaders of my home \nState of Kansas who led the 19th century war against the chattel \nenslavement of African men and women. If we do it right, the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act will be seen by generations to come \nto have met the high standards of William Wilberforce and the Free \nKansas activists. If we do it right, we will have created a true \nmonument to the memory of Paul and Sheila Wellstone. This act makes \nthis possible. I urge my colleagues to pass it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16108-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to provide an \ninitial report on the budgetary effect of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2004, \notherwise referred to as the omnibus appropriation bill.\n  While I will share scoring on these individual bills compared to each \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation during later debate, allow me to \nsummarize where this bill stands relative to the 2004 budget resolution \nas it applies in the Senate.\n  Combined with the other six appropriation bills already enacted for \n2004 as well as the 2004 Iraq supplemental, this conference report \nwould set total non-emergency discretionary funding for 2004 at \n$791.023 billion in budget authority and $862.889 billion in outlays. \nBecause it does not include sufficient offsets to pay for the \nadditional spending included within, this conference report exceeds the \ndiscretionary allocations and caps provided by the budget resolution \n($784.675 billion in budget authority and $861.084 billion in outlays) \nby $6.348 in budget authority and $1,805 billion in outlays. Therefore, \nBudget Act points of order (under sections 302(f) and 311) and a budget \nresolution (section 405(b)) point of order apply against the bill. \nOther budget resolution points of order apply as well, but they are of \na more incidental nature.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nbudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n2004 APPROPRIATIONS INCLUDING H.R. 2673, THE CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS\n           ACT, 2004--SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                     [Fiscal year 2004, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget\n                                                 authority     Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscretionary.................................      791,023      862,889\nBudget Resolution allocation/cap..............      784,675      861,084\n                                               -------------------------\n      Difference..............................        6,348        1,805\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Totals adjusted for consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\nPrepared by SBC Majority Staff, 12/9/2003.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16108-2", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16108-S16109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n AMENDMENT TO S. 671, THE MISCELLANEOUS TRADE & TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS \n                              ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I seek recognition to discuss an \namendment to S. 671, the Miscellaneous Trade\n\n[[Page S16109]]\n\nand Technical Corrections Act of 2003. My amendment will strengthen our \ndomestic dress shirt manufacturers and the pima cotton growers. My \namendment is a technical correction that levels the playing field by \ncorrecting an anomaly in our trade laws that has unfairly advantaged \nforeign producers and sent hundreds of jobs offshore.\n  The amendment reduces duties levied on cotton shirting fabric, fabric \nthat is not made in the United States. Currently, U.S. law recognized \nthis lack of fabric availability and granted special favorable trade \nconcessions to manufacturers in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, the \nAndean region, and Africa. The U.S. has allowed shirts to enter this \ncountry duty-free from so many other countries, while we have failed to \nreduce tariffs on those manufacturers that stayed in the U.S. and were \nforced to compete on these uneven terms. My amendment will correct this \ninequity.\n  This amendment also recognizes the need to creatively promote the \nU.S. shirting manufacturing and textiles sectors, and does so through \nthe creation of a Cotton Competitiveness grant program, which is funded \nthrough a portion of previously collected duties.\n  Our country has experienced an enormous loss of jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector. It is critical that our domestic manufactures be \nable to compete on a level playing field. In the case of the domestic \ndress shirting industry, the problem is our own government imposing a \ntariff of up to 11 percent upon the import of fabric made from U.S. \npima cotton. My amendment is a concrete step that this Congress can \ntake to reduce the hemorrhage of U.S. manufacturing jobs.\n  One group of beneficiaries of this amendment is a Gitman Brothers \nfactory in Ashland, PA.

Mr. President, today I seek recognition to discuss an \namendment to S. 671, the Miscellaneous Trade\n\n[[Page S16109]]\n\nand Technical Corrections Act of 2003. My amendment will strengthen our \ndomestic dress shirt manufacturers and the pima cotton growers. My \namendment is a technical correction that levels the playing field by \ncorrecting an anomaly in our trade laws that has unfairly advantaged \nforeign producers and sent hundreds of jobs offshore.\n  The amendment reduces duties levied on cotton shirting fabric, fabric \nthat is not made in the United States. Currently, U.S. law recognized \nthis lack of fabric availability and granted special favorable trade \nconcessions to manufacturers in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, the \nAndean region, and Africa. The U.S. has allowed shirts to enter this \ncountry duty-free from so many other countries, while we have failed to \nreduce tariffs on those manufacturers that stayed in the U.S. and were \nforced to compete on these uneven terms. My amendment will correct this \ninequity.\n  This amendment also recognizes the need to creatively promote the \nU.S. shirting manufacturing and textiles sectors, and does so through \nthe creation of a Cotton Competitiveness grant program, which is funded \nthrough a portion of previously collected duties.\n  Our country has experienced an enormous loss of jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector. It is critical that our domestic manufactures be \nable to compete on a level playing field. In the case of the domestic \ndress shirting industry, the problem is our own government imposing a \ntariff of up to 11 percent upon the import of fabric made from U.S. \npima cotton. My amendment is a concrete step that this Congress can \ntake to reduce the hemorrhage of U.S. manufacturing jobs.\n  One group of beneficiaries of this amendment is a Gitman Brothers \nfactory in Ashland, PA. The Ashland Shirt and Pajama factory was built \nin 1948 and employs 265 workers. This factory in the Lehigh Valley \nturns out world class shirts with such labels as Burberry and Saks \nFifth Avenue that are shipped across the U.S. These workers and their \nfamilies deserve trade laws that do not chase their jobs offshore. This \namendment enjoys the support of the domestic shirting industry, UNITE, \nand the pima cotton associations.\n  I offer this legislation on behalf of the men and women of the Gitman \nfactory in Ashland, the domestic dress shirting industry, and the pima \ncotton growers, so that for them free trade will indeed be fair trade \nas well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16109-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SEPTEMBER 11TH VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND EXTENSION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am saddened that the Senate has been \nunable to reach agreement to extend the pending deadline of the \nSeptember 11 Victim Compensation Fund to allow for more time for the \nmany still grieving victims who have been unable to bring themselves to \nendure the painful process of filing claims.\n  On September 9, Senators Durbin, Schumer, Dodd, Lieberman, Clinton, \nCorzine, and Lautenberg joined with me to introduce S. 1602, the \nSeptember 11th Victim Compensation Fund Extension Act of 2003. \nUnfortunately, this bill continues to be bottlenecked in the Judiciary \nCommittee and blocked from Senate passage by anonymous Republican holds \non the Senate floor. Every Democratic Senator has agreed to pass our \nlegislation by unanimous consent, but one or more members of the \nmajority are still objecting to its passage in the Senate.\n  Senator Daschle, Senator Lautenberg and I have reached out to our \nRepublican colleagues to try to achieve a compromise to extend this \narbitrary deadline. We have expressed our willingness to do so for a \nperiod of time less than one year, but unfortunately the opponents of \nthis bill have refused to meet us partway. Moreover, they have been \nunable to explain why it is necessary to force these families to \nconfront this pain during an already stressful time--the holiday \nseason.\n  Along with Senator Daschle, Congressman Gephardt and others, I worked \nhard to create the Victims Fund in the wake of the September 11 \nattacks. We insisted that it be included in the legislation to bail out \nthe airlines passed in the wake of the most devastating terrorist \nattacks on American soil. The authorized deadline of December 22, 2003, \nfor applications to the Victims Fund is rapidly approaching, but it has \nbecome apparent that many families need more time before they can take \nthat step. Thus, far only a minority of families have applied to the \nFund for compensation, according to the Department of Justice.\n  Ken Feinberg, the Special Master of the Fund, has been doing his best \nto get victims families to understand their rights and I commend him \nand others for their efforts to reach out to the victims and their \nfamilies.\n  Victims support groups have told me that to this day, they are still \nreceiving calls from individuals who understand that the deadline is \napproaching but cannot face the emotional pain of preparing a claim. In \na survey conducted recently by victims' organizations, 87 percent of \nthe 356 victims who responded expressed support for extending the \nDecember 22 deadline by 1 year. Mr. Feinberg has also commented that \nmany victims remain too paralyzed by their grief to confront the \nlogistical burden and emotional pain of filing a death claim.\n  In light of this painful reality, I believe it would have been \nappropriate to extend the deadline for filing applications to the \nVictims Fund. This extension would have given grieving families \nadditional time to mourn those who were lost and to overcome the \nemotional challenges of filing paperwork with the Victims Fund. Every \nsingle September 11 victims support group that I have spoken with \nagreed that a modest extension would provide some relief during these \ndark days for victims' families as they endure the grieving process. \nThere is simply no reason not to grant these families a little bit of \nrelief by extending the deadline. I am disappointed and saddened that \nanonymous Republican holds will result in unnecessarily closing off the \nSeptember 11 Victim Fund before each victim had a sufficient chance to \nconsider their options.\n  With the holiday season upon us, victims did not need this arbitrary \ndeadline confronting them. This was something that the Senate could and \nshould have accomplished for the still grieving victims of September \n11. It is an unnecessary shame that we have not done so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16109-2", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16109-S16110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 FREEDOM TO TRAVEL TO CUBA ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express deep \nfrustration with the way congressional leaders have thwarted the will \nof the majority of Members on Cuba.\n  Last month, the Senate approved an amendment to the Transportation-\nTreasury appropriations bill that would suspend enforcement of the Cuba \ntravel restrictions. We passed this amendment 59 to 36--a 23-vote \nmargin. In September, the House approved the same amendment 227 to \n188--a 39-vote margin.\n  So, both Chambers of Congress approved the same amendment to suspend \nenforcement of the Cuba travel ban and to allow travel by Americans to \nCuba. These votes reflected the sentiments of the overwhelming majority \nof Americans who support ending the utterly ineffectual travel ban.\n  Opinion leaders, too, in newspapers all across the country, in papers \nbig and small, applauded the Senate and House votes. Orlando, Chicago, \nNew York, Winston-Salem, Tuscaloosa, and San Diego. Papers from every \ncorner of the country commended Congress for its efforts and called for \nan end to the absurd travel ban.\n  Then, the Senate Foreign Relations approved by a 13-to-5 margin a \nbill--S. 950, the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act of 2003--that would \npermanently repeal the Cuba travel ban. Senator Enzi and I, along with \n31 other colleagues--fully one-third of the Senate, from both sides of \nthe aisle and representing every region of this country--introduced \nthis legislation because we felt the time had come to end this \npointless ban on American liberty. As its vote demonstrates, the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee agrees.\n  Given these votes, and given the popular support for our efforts to \nend the travel ban, one would think the conferees of the \nTransportation-Treasury appropriations bill would not be able to strip \nout our amendment. When the Senate and House have approved the\n\n[[Page S16110]]\n\nsame amendment, there ought to be nothing for conferees to reconcile.\n  But here we are with an omnibus bill that does not include our \namendment to suspend enforcement of the Cuba travel ban. How did this \nhappen?\n  It wasn't the conferees. Thirteen of the 16 Senate conferees were \nsupportive of our amendment. The conferees would not have stripped out \nthe amendment.\n  But the congressional leadership would. And they did, before even \nsubmitting the bill to the conference committee for consideration. They \npointed to a phony veto threat--not made by the President--to justify a \nblatantly political move calculated to improve their standing with a \nsmall number of constituents in Florida.\n  This, despite a recent poll by the Miami Herald and St. Petersburg \nTimes that found that most Florida voters favor lifting the ban on \ntravel to Cuba--by better than a 2-to-1 margin.\n  Is this democracy in action? Is this the example we are setting for \nthe rest of the world? Is this the example of participatory government \nthat we hold to the Cuban dissidents as the beacon of freedom and \nliberty?\n  If this ugly episode were the only consequence of this \nadministration's obsession with retaining the failed Cuba travel ban, \nthat would be bad enough.\n  But it is not the only consequence. Far worse, the administration's \npandering to its south Florida allies is undermining U.S. efforts to \nfight terrorism.\n  The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC, is \ncharged with enforcing sanctions against foreign countries, terrorist \nnetworks, international narcotics traffickers, and those involved in \nproliferating weapons of mass destruction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16110-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                      WILLIAM JOHNSON'S RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize William \nJohnson's retirement after 33 years of teaching in the Brandywine \nSchool District. His dedication has won him the respect of two \ngenerations of faculty and students alike, along with the gratitude of \nmany in our State. He has been, and remains, a trusted friend.\n  Mr. Johnson has spent much of his life in public service. He served \nhonorably in the United States Army for 6 years, from 1965-1971. His \nteaching career at Hanby Middle School in Wilmington, Delaware, where \nhe has taught Earth and Space Science for 23 years comes to an end this \nmonth. He will be sorely missed there.\n  Mr. Johnson received his bachelor's degree in Education from Delaware \nState University and his Master's in Education from Antioch University. \nHe has also taken advanced studies classes at the University of \nPennsylvania and has completed all the classes needed for a doctorate \ndegree with California Coast University. He will be dedicating much of \nhis time after his retirement to working on his dissertation in Earth \nand Space Science.\n  Having taught at Hanby since 1980, there are many attributes that \nmake Mr. Johnson a great teacher. He has an unparalleled commitment to \nhis craft. He stays after school on a regular basis to work on \nexperiments with his students, teaches remedial classes with the same \nexpectations as every other class, and ensures his students have a lot \nof hands on experience in the classroom. In 1997, Mr. Johnson led a \ngroup of six students in an inventor's club as they tried to come up \nwith inventions for the Duracell Battery Company. With his leadership \nand guidance, the students came up with several creations, including a \ncurb sensor to help cars detect curbs behind them, a laser device that \ntakes atmospheric and meteorological measurements, and a computer \nprogram that analyzes satellites and orbits around the earth. These \ninventions are extraordinary for middle school students.\n  In addition, in October of 1998, Mr. Johnson was honored and \ncertified by then-Vice President Al Gore as a teacher of the Global \nLearning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program. Some 500 \npeople were honored with the certification, which enables the teachers \nto teach students how to view environmental images and read globe data \nin hopes of determining the effects of global warming.\n  Mr. Johnson is a member of the Delaware Teachers of Science, National \nScience Teachers' Association, American Federation of Teachers and the \nSatellites Educators' Association. Over the years, Mr. Johnson has \nreceived many awards and honors including Who's Who Teacher of the \nYear, FAME Teacher of the Year, as well as Hanby's Teacher of the Year \ncandidate. He also serves as a representative for the United Negro \nCollege Fund--UNCF--in the Brandywine School District, coordinating \ndonations from teachers and administrators. The fund goes to support \nvarious black colleges across the nation.\n  Mr. Johnson is married to the former M. Patricia Durnell. The two \nwere married in West Chester, PA in August, 1981, and now reside in \nChadds Ford, PA. His hobbies and interests include reading, jogging, \ncollecting baseball cards and jazz albums, baseball, golf, and alto \nsaxophone.\n  Mr. Johnson is forever the consummate professional. He works hard at \nhis job, works hard for his students, and never desires the spotlight \nor recognition for all his contributions. Through his tireless efforts, \nhe has made a profound difference in the lives of thousands of students \nand enhanced the quality of life for an entire state. Upon his \nretirement, he will leave behind a legacy of commitment to public \nservice for the generations that will follow. On behalf of each student \nwhose life Mr. Johnson has touched, let me express our heartfelt \ngratitude. We congratulate him on a truly remarkable and distinguished \ncareer, and we wish him and his family only the very best in all that \nlies ahead for each of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16110-2", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16110-S16111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA ROTC\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize the \noutstanding work of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadets at the \nUniversity of Virginia who participated in a 24-hour vigil on September \n15-16, 2003 in honor of National POW/MIA Remembrance Day. The POW/MIA \nVigil specifically honors those men and women who defended our nation \nand never returned with a 24-hour, tri-service honor ceremony.\n  The ROTC cadets at the University of Virginia started their POW/MIA \nvigils in 2000 when Air Force cadet Elizabeth McGraw served as Arnold \nAir Society Deputy Commander. Subsequent vigils were commanded by Cadet \nChristopher Tulip in 2001, Cadet Tara Graul in 2002, and Cadet Jeremy \nPorto in 2003.\n  This year's Vigil planning committee included Cadets James Hayne, \nJoshua Becker, Alina Sullivan, Dan Barton, and Nic Skirpan. U.S. Air \nForce Colonel John C. Vrba, commander of AFROTC Detachment 890 at \nVirginia, supervised the ceremony, which began with a solemn precision \ndrill performance by members of the AFROTC Drill Team: Cadets Suzanne \nHahl, Jacklyn Noveras, Brandon Bert, Timothy Farwell, and James Hayne. \nAir Force and Army Cadets, and Navy Midshipmen from the three ROTC \ndetachments then marched in solemn 15 minute ``honor shifts'' guarding \nthe American flag which was displayed prominently on the back wall of \nthe University of Virginia's Amphitheater.\n  One of the MIAs that these young Cadets honored was U.S. Army Captain \nHumbert Roque ``Rocky'' Versace, a 1959 graduate of the U.S. Military \nAcademy at West Point. On July 8, 2002, I had the distinct honor of \nbeing present at the White House for the posthumous awarding of the \nMedal of Honor by President George W. Bush for Rocky's conspicuous \ngallantry at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty \nwhile a captive of the Viet Cong from October 29, 1965, until he was \nexecuted on or about September 26, 1965. His captors took his life \nafter they had given up trying to break Rocky's indomitable will to \nresist interrogation and indoctrination, his unshakable faith in God, \nand his steadfast trust in his country and his fellow prisoners.\n  When I visited the White House last year for Captain Versace's Medal \nof Honor ceremony, I was among many of Captain Versace's West Point \nclassmates and family members. One of those classmates was John Gurr, \nwho\n\n[[Page S16111]]\n\nworked tirelessly to get approval for the creation of the Captain Rocky \nVersace Memorial Plaza and Vietnam Veterans Memorial in the Captain's \nboyhood neighborhood in the Del Ray section of Alexandria.\n  At the conclusion of this year's POW/MIA Vigil, Mr. Gurr made a \npowerful speech to the UVA ROTC cadets on the great history of honor by \nVietnam POWs, which produced five Medal of Honor recipients, and made \nRocky Versace the only Army POW to receive the Medal of Honor for his \nheroism while in captivity during the Vietnam War.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to enter John Gurr's inspiring words as an \nextension of my remarks:\n\n       I am indeed grateful for this opportunity to speak for my \n     comrades in arms and I would thank you for this opportunity \n     were it not axiomatic in the military profession that you \n     never thank a soldier for doing his duty. You can commend him \n     or her, and I herewith commend wholeheartedly the ROTC cadet \n     corps of the University of Virginia for the vigil you have \n     mounted in memory of our nation's POWs and MIAs. It was your \n     duty to do so, and you did it well. I will share with you up \n     front that I came to this amphitheater last night at around \n     0200 to witness your vigil for myself. I stood in the deep \n     background for over a half an hour and watched your \n     sentinels, and I thought about what message I will carry to \n     you today.\n       Here it is in a nutshell, young men and women: the heroic \n     legacies of our fighting men and women, most certainly \n     including those men who suffered so terribly yet endured with \n     honor in the torture chambers of the Vietnamese communist \n     forces, the heroic legacies of those predecessors are soon to \n     pass to you. Be ready, because they are sacred. Duty, Honor, \n     Country. Duty--be professionally ready, do your duty well; do \n     something extra. Honor--guard and cherish your personal \n     honor. Country--stand ready to ever defend this great \n     democracy, which is a unique bastion in a dangerous world.\n       A bit of background on the POW situation as it developed \n     and ended in Vietnam. There were 771 Americans captured or \n     interned in the Vietnam War, far, far fewer than in any of \n     our major interventions since World War I. 113 of them--\n     almost 15%--died in captivity. The vast majority of POWs were \n     officers, most of them aviators shot down in the north, and \n     the vast majority of them were held in North Vietnam. There \n     were some 19 such prison camps, where a rough total of some \n     550 men were held. In the north, brutal tortures were the \n     rule, and the death rate was about 5%.\n       In the much smaller and equally scattered prison camps in \n     South Vietnam and Laos, hunger and disease and brutality were \n     common, but torture was much less systematic. Even so, the \n     death rate in the southern camps was about 20%--four times \n     higher than in the north where food and medical care and the \n     support of fellow prisoners made the chances of survival \n     better.\n       As to the purpose of torture in the northern camps, let me \n     quote from Vice Admiral James Bond Stockdale, who suffered \n     7\\1/2\\ years in captivity there and was the ranking man in \n     the camps. I quote from his ``Afterword'' in the famed book \n     Honor Bound which details the experiences of American POWs in \n     Southeast Asia:\n       ``I was the only wing commander in that long war to lead \n     prisoner resistance and therefore the natural target for \n     Major Bui--`The Cat'--Commissar of the North Vietnamese \n     prison camps. The business of the Commissar was extortion. He \n     had to continually intimidate--to break--a number of POWs so \n     that he had Americans at the ready to parade before press \n     conferences for foreign `dignitaries' (often Americans from \n     the anti-war movement) and to exploit for propaganda \n     statements favorable to the communist agenda. Our job was to \n     hold out as long as we could, to make it difficult for The \n     Cat to exploit us. To do this, he hired experienced `torture \n     guards' who in 40 minutes or so, with bars and ropes, could \n     reduce a self-respecting American officer to a sobbing \n     wreck.''\n       Admiral Stockdale and his fellow prisoners in the north \n     early decided that their goal was to resist as best they \n     could and return to the U.S. with honor. I say again, ``with \n     honor.'' Thus the title of the book from which I quote, \n     ``Honor Bound.'' The American POWs were ``Honor Bound.'' \n     Under circumstances that will draw a tear if you understand. \n     Admiral Stockdale was awarded the Congressional Medal of \n     Honor upon his return. Duty well done, Admiral! Well done!\n       As to the prisoners in South Vietnam, I will speak with an \n     indirect credibility of the experience of a West Point \n     classmate of mine, Captain ``Rocky'' Versace. I will speak \n     with a passion because ``Rocky'' was a friend of mine, and \n     he, too, won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his \n     resistance and leadership as a prisoner of war. A difference \n     is that Versace was executed for his stubborn, and often even \n     argumentative and aggressive resistance to the communist \n     effort to break him for propaganda purposes. The Medal of \n     Honor was presented posthumously, to ``Rocky's'' family in \n     the White House on July 8, 2002, in the presence of 250 \n     people which included 89 of his West Point classmates. As we \n     said to ourselves at the time, ``We came for you `Rocky.' We \n     were late, but we came.'' ``Rocky'' Versace's story is one of \n     a young man of exceptional physical endurance and truly \n     extraordinary mental toughness. He was deeply religious, and \n     he had come to love and admire the South Vietnamese people \n     for whom and alongside whom he had fought for almost 18 \n     months before he was severely wounded in battle and captured \n     in October 1963. For the first five months of his captivity \n     in the Delta of South Vietnam he was held in a small camp \n     with only two other American prisoners. Successive teams of \n     Viet Cong indoctrinators sought to break ``Rocky,'' to get \n     him to make statements rejecting the South Vietnamese effort \n     to resist a communist takeover, and they tried to get him to \n     make recordings or quick movies opposing America's \n     intervention on behalf of the South Vietnamese forces. Fluent \n     in Vietnamese and French, he argued so credibly with his \n     indoctrinators that they had to switch to English because \n     they began to notice that the enlisted communist guards were \n     starting to nod their heads in agreement with some of \n     ``Rocky's'' rebuttals. ``Rocky's'' fellow prisoners heard him \n     say in one of the indoctrination sessions ``You can make me \n     come here, and you can make me listen, but frankly I don't \n     believe a word you say and you can go to hell.'' On another \n     occasion they heard him say ``I know that if I am true to \n     myself and to my God, that something better awaits in the \n     hereafter. So you might as well kill me now.''\n       ``Rocky'' attempted escape four times and was captured, \n     beaten and leg-ironed in a stifling bamboo cage after each \n     such unsuccessful attempt. Only three weeks after his capture \n     and on his first attempt, he had to drag himself through the \n     jungle on his belly because he had taken three rounds in his \n     right leg in the battle in which he'd been captured, and he \n     could not walk. As a captain and the ranking man in his POW \n     camp, he sought to encourage his somewhat separated fellow \n     prisoners by singing ``God Bless America'' and other popular \n     or patriotic songs, frequently inserting a stray word or two \n     to communicate with his men. ``Rocky'' set the example, and \n     he took the heat off his fellow prisoners.\n       After five months, ``Rocky'' was deemed to be an \n     incorrigible propaganda prospect, and he was taken from the \n     camp and held in isolation. That's where he was held for the \n     last 18 months of his 23-month captivity. Alone, emaciated by \n     hunger and disease, his head swollen and yellow from \n     jaundice. There were occasional reports during that time from \n     villagers who said that ``Rocky'' was frequently led or \n     dragged through their villages as a sad example of what the \n     American fighting man looked like. Even so, they said that \n     ``Rocky'' sometimes interrupted the propaganda diatribes in \n     the village centers, refuting and embarrassing his captors in \n     his fluent Vietnamese. He was beaten, and one report said \n     that, as he went down, he smiled. ``Rocky'' Versace was a \n     winner.\n       He was executed in September 1965, ending not only his life \n     but his imminent plan to leave the Army and return to South \n     Vietnam as a Maryknoll missionary. He had been accepted to \n     become a priest-candidate at the Maryknoll Order in \n     Tarrytown, NY. But he never made it there.\n       Thus ended the life of a decent man, a courageous and \n     unbreakable soldier, and now the only Army man to get the \n     Medal of Honor for conduct as a POW during the Vietnam War.\n       And now let's turn to you. What you've just heard is a part \n     of your legacy. You must not let it down. Last night there \n     was just one old soldier sitting there in the back of this \n     amphitheater, watching you, watching your vigil, and \n     witnessing the changing of the guard. In a few short months \n     or years, your turn will come to bear the mantle of Duty, \n     Honor, Country. And there will be a ghostly phalanx of old \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who will always, I \n     repeat ``always,'' be watching you. You cannot fall short of \n     the standard that has been set.\n       I appreciate this opportunity to speak for my past and \n     present comrades, we commend you for doing your duty so well, \n     and my last words to you are:\n       Be ready. Be ready.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend John Gurr and the ROTC cadets \nat the University of Virginia for their dedicated service to our Nation \nand for their work to honor those like Captain Rocky Versace who paid \nthe ultimate sacrifice in defense of America and its ideals. I wish \nthem Godspeed as they stand strong for freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16111-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16111-S16112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                The PASSING OF MEYER ``MIKE'' STEINBERG\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on December 4, 2003, an \noutstanding example of the American Dream ended with the passing of \nMeyer ``Mike'' Steinberg. Mike was a young 84 with a personal vitality \nand clarity of mind that many far younger people would envy. He was \nrecently stricken with lung cancer even though he had given up smoking \nmore than 30 years ago. He was an individual admired and beloved by \nthose who had the good fortune to know him in his lifetime. This past\n\n[[Page S16112]]\n\nSunday, December 7, Park Avenue Synagogue in New York was filled with \n1,000 people who wanted to share the grief of his passing with his \nfamily who loved him so deeply that eight of his grandchildren, \nincluding an 11-year-old, wanted to share their innermost thoughts of \naffection and sadness with everyone gathered there.\n  Mike's life, his grit and determination, his business successes, and \nhis devotion to family are the stuff of which books are often written. \nIn every definition of the American Dream, Mike Steinberg would emerge \nas an ideal example. From the humblest beginnings, having to end his \nformal education at the age of 15, he went on, ultimately, to the role \nof a real estate magnate. He developed, owned, and managed properties \nfrom New York to Texas to California.\n  He was someone I was proud to know. He had a rare ability to attract \nadmiration and respect from all who had contact with him and he will \nlong be remembered as someone who proved that business success, \ndevotion to family, pride in his heritage, and regard for others are \nstill goals to be cherished in these days of disposable relationships.\n  We grieve his passing but we honor his being and I ask to have \nprinted in the Record an item I placed in the New York Times on \nDecember 6 commemorating his extraordinary life.\n  The material follows.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 6, 2003]\n\n                       Steinberg, Meyer ``Mike''.\n\n       Steinberg--Meyer ``Mike''.

His success in the business world was outstanding, \n     but it never interfered with his role as the family \n     patriarch. The risks that he took in his business life were \n     always motivated by his desire to protect his family's \n     security. His love of family extended as well to \n     philanthropy.

Mr. President, with a heavy sense of sadness \ntoday, we mark the passing of former Congressman Joe Skeen from New \nMexico.\n  On Sunday night, Joe Skeen lost his valiant battle with Parkinson's \ndisease. Joe's passing is very hard for me to accept even though he had \nbeen ill for so long. We have lost a great friend to New Mexico. Joe \nfit his district like a hand in a glove, and that fact will define his \nlegacy as a public servant and a man of the people. My heart goes out \nto Mary and the Skeen family. In visiting with them, I know their \nsadness and sense of loss is severe.\n  I had the highest honor of serving the State of New Mexico with this \namazing man for more than 20 years. Joe was first elected to the House \nof Representatives in 1980 as a write-in candidate. He is only the \nthird man in the history of this country to achieve this feat.\n  As great an accomplishment as this was, history will show that it was \namong the least of his great achievements. As I am sure you can \nimagine, the litany of successes that Joe has had in his work for New \nMexico is much too long to go into here today. Suffice it to say that \nNew Mexico is infinitely better for having had Joe Skeen representing \nus in Congress; this country is better for having had Joe participate \nin making decisions that affect the entire Nation.\n  Joe was the first to tell you that he had not done it on his own, \nhowever. He had a partner in his great adventure who walked beside him \nevery step of the way. Mary, his wife of 57 years, was a calming \ninfluence in the storm that is the life of a Congressman. She made it \npossible for Joe to continue to be a ranching Representative, running \nthe family ranch while Joe served in Washington.\n  Since Joe Skeen retired from Congress in 2002, I have missed working \nwith him on behalf of New Mexico. We were partners in so many projects \nfor more than three decades. I am from our State's largest city, \nAlbuquerque, and Joe was a rancher from one of the many rural parts of \nour State. Our different backgrounds did not prevent us from working \ntogether; rather, I would characterize them as allowing us to form an \neven better partnership on behalf of New Mexico.\n  We first got to know each other in 1960 when I was fresh out of law \nschool and Joe was an up and coming member of our party. A decade \nlater, in 1970, we teamed up together to run for Governor and \nLieutenant Governor respectively. And, again in 1980, when Joe Skeen \nwas first elected to Congress, we had the opportunity once again to \nwork side-by-side. More than anything, Joe and I were able to use our \nrespective positions on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees \nto help New Mexico. He was always a good, solid and dependable man, and \nalways a champion for his district. He certainly left huge shoes for \nthose who follow him.\n  Today, my wife Nancy and I mourn. Joe is at rest, and our prayers are \nnow with Mary, who has been such a force behind Joe and all his \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16112-2", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16112-S16113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n[[Page S16113]]\n\n                        AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wanted to amplify the remarks I \nmade a few weeks ago when we approved a bill to create a museum of \nAfrican American History as part of the Smithsonian Institution, on or \nnear the National Mall.\n  As I said at the time, the passage of this measure is an enormous \ntribute to the work of Congressman John Lewis.\n  Mr. Lewis came to Congress as a representative from Atlanta in 1987. \nThe next year he began his fight to create a museum that would tell the \nstory of the African people in the United States of America.\n  It is a complex story, and a compelling one.\n  Of course there is the horror of slavery--one of the greatest stains \non our Nation's soul. That story must be told--we cannot flinch from \nthe truth, no matter how painful it might be.\n  But we must not allow it to blind us to the rest of the story . . . \nto the enormous contributions that people of African descent have made \nin the United States.\n  This very Capitol in which we now stand, a magnificent building that \nis a symbol of freedom around the world, was built with the labor of \nslaves.\n  African Americans fought to keep our Nation free . . . even when \ntheir own freedom was not fully realized.\n  And the ideas and talent of African Americans have enriched all of \nour lives.\n  From the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison to our great composer Duke \nEllington, from the inventor and city planner Benjamin Banneker to the \nbrilliant jurist Thurgood Marshall, from Jesse Owens to Jackie \nRobinson, our Nation has been inspired and enlightened by our African \nAmerican citizens.\n  I regret that black people in this country have had to struggle so \nhard to win equality and be treated the same as everybody else. I wish \nthat struggle had not been necessary.\n  Yet, that struggle has had an enormous impact on our Nation. The \nwords and actions of men like Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lewis \nhave uplifted us all.\n  Forty years ago, I lived in Washington and attended school here. I \nwill never forget the great March on Washington of August 28, 1963.\n  Coming from Nevada, I was stunned by the sight of thousands of buses \nstreaming into the city and the hundreds of thousands of people who \nmarched peacefully for their cause. That event touched me in a profound \nway.\n  We all remember Martin Luther King's ``I Have A Dream'' speech from \nthat day. It is rightly regarded as one of the greatest speeches of the \n20th Century.\n  But John Lewis also spoke at the March on Washington--the only \nspeaker from that great event who is still alive today.\n  And I will never forget what he said--that African Americans must \nfree themselves not only from political slavery, but also from economic \nslavery.\n  In the years since then, we have made tremendous progress. The legal \nrights of African Americans have been secured. But until economic \nequality and justice are achieved, the fight will not be won.\n  John Lewis has never stopped fighting for freedom and justice. That's \nwhy he recognizes the importance of a museum that will tell the story \nof the African American experience.\n  This museum was first proposed in 1915 by African Americans who had \nfought in the Civil War.\n  When Mr. Lewis arrived in Congress, he adopted the cause as his own.\n  Each year since 1988, he has fought to create this museum. This year \nis the first time his bill has passed both the House and the Senate.\n  The bill has now gone to President Bush, and I hope he will sign it \nas soon as possible so we can begin the next phase of the journey--\nraising private contributions to match the Federal funds for the Museum \nof African American History.\n  I salute John Lewis for his good work. Not just the creation of this \nimportant museum, but the work of his entire life--the struggle for \nfreedom, equality and justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16113-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE BRIDGEWATER JUNIOR LEAGUE ALL-STARS\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

I am both proud and grateful that we have \nthe kind of fighting force exemplified by Sergeant Major Albert serving \nin the Persian Gulf.\n  Our Nation extends its heartfelt condolences to his mother, brothers, \nand sisters. We extend our appreciation for sharing this outstanding \nsoldier with us, and we offer our prayers and support. You may be \njustifiably proud of his contributions which extend above and beyond \nthe normal call of duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16113-3", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16113-S16114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OREGON VETERAN HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I rise to honor an Oregon \nveteran who has gone above and beyond the call of duty in service to \nher country and to her State. Blanche Osborn Bross was born on July 21, \n1916, and has lived in Oregon since the age of 8.\n  In 1943, Blanche heeded the call to duty by joining the Women's Air \nForce Service Pilots, WASP, an experimental program developed to \ncompensate for the lack of men available for pilot training; when \nAmerican men were critically needed for combat duty during World War \nII, important piloting jobs across the country were left vacant. WASPs \nlike Blanche spent countless hours training to assume piloting jobs, \ndeliver planes from factories to their domestic bases, tow targets for \ngunnery practice, and train cadet pilots.\n  More than 25,000 women applied for the prestigious WASP program, and \nwhile 1,830 were chosen for training, a select 1,074 women graduated \nfrom the rigorous program. After graduating, Blanche became one of 17 \nwomen sent to Columbus, OH, to learn to fly four-engine aircraft. In \nOhio, Blanche became a pilot of the legendary B-17 ``Flying Fortress,'' \nferrying the enormous aircraft between bases. Fortunately, at 5 feet, 8 \ninches tall, Blanche was just tall enough to reach the rudder pedals.\n  After her first assignment in Ohio, Blanche was sent to Fort Myers, \nFL, to assist in gunnery training. As a pilot, she took gunners up in \nthe air where\n\n[[Page S16114]]\n\nthey fired at targets towed by a B-25. Many of the gunners had been in \nmale-dominated combat and were shocked to greet women pilots in the \ncockpit. One soldier even exclaimed, ``I have to write home about \nthis!''\n  After spending close to a year at Fort Myers, Blanche and three other \nWASPs were transferred to the Las Vegas gunnery school where they were \nused in the engineering squadron to test repaired aircraft. The program \ngenerated significant publicity during the war, and Blanche was \nfeatured in a famous picture of female pilots walking off of the \n``Pistol Packin' Mama,'' a B-17 bomber. The photograph has since been \nused in advertisements for clothing lines, fashion magazines, and \nhistorical chronicles.\n  Blanche lived to fly, and is quick to point out she always felt \naccepted by the men in the military. On December 20, 1944, however, a \nbill sent before Congress that would have allowed women to enter the \nAir Force did not pass, and the WASP program was dismantled. After \nbeing deactivated from the WASPs, Blanche joined the American Red Cross \nand was sent to Kunming, China where, although she did not fly planes, \nshe was heavily involved in operating clubs for service members \nstationed overseas.\n  Following her tour in China, Blanche returned to the U.S. to begin a \nfamily. In 1957, she married William H. Bross with whom she had a son, \nCharles. Together, they moved to Portland, OR, where she developed a \nseaplane flying base. Later in life, Blanche received a commercial \npilot license and flew construction crews to work sites.\n  For many years, one distinct honor alluded Blanche and the other \nfemale pilots. The WASPs had retained their civilian status while \nflying aircraft in World War II, and therefore, were not considered \n``veterans'' after the war. At long last in 1977, Blanche and other \nfemale pilots were finally recognized for their invaluable service to \ntheir country when the WASPs were finally designated as veterans.\n  Today, Blanche resides with her husband in Bend, OR, where she plays \ngolf on a regular basis, and continues to enjoy the outdoors. When \nasked what one thing she would want others to know about her, she \nreplied simply, ``I want people to know I'm proud to be an Oregonian \nand proud to have served this country.''\n  For her selfless service to others, and to the United States in times \nof war, I salute Blanche Osborn Bross as an Oregon Veteran \nHero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16114-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                 IN REMEMBRANCE OF JOHN PATRICK HUNTER\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, I pay tribute to John \nPatrick Hunter, a respected journalist and a dear friend.\n  After growing up in Depression-era West Virginia, witnessing the \naftermath of Hiroshima, and the paranoia of the McCarthy era, John \nPatrick used his opposition to war and fierce defense of civil \nliberties to fuel his passion for journalism. For nearly half a \ncentury, John Patrick served as a reporter and editor for the Capital \nTimes in Madison, WI. He challenged politicians and policies, but at \nthe same time made many friends and established lasting bonds along the \nway.\n  After serving in the Navy during World War II, John Patrick attended \nthe University of Wisconsin on the GI Bill and earned his degree. He \njoined the Capital Times in 1951 and that is where he stayed until his \nretirement in 1995.\n  John Patrick will forever be remembered for his work during the \nturbulent McCarthy era. Many were silenced by McCarthyism but John \nPatrick took action. For his July 4 assignment in 1951, John Patrick \nasked people to sign a petition he had put together using only the \nDeclaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. One hundred twelve \nrefused out of fear of what might happen to them, 20 called John \nPatrick a communist, and only one signed. After the story broke \nnationally, President Harry Truman heralded John Patrick's efforts.\n  And as far as my own personal good fortune in knowing John Patrick, \nhe asked me tough question for over 20 years. When I would give him a \nfeisty answer, he would grin and I always felt buoyed by the unofficial \nbut potent encouragement of Wisconsin's glorious progressive legacy.\n  My condolences go out to John Patrick's wife Merry and his entire \nfamily. His unparalleled contributions to Wisconsin journalism will \nnever be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16114-2", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO MASTER SERGEANT DENNIS TAKESHITA\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

After 37 years of exemplary commitment and dedicated service in \ndefense of our great Nation and 30 years in the Air National Guard, \nMaster Sergeant Takeshita retired on October 3, 2003.\n  Master Sergeant Takeshita's career experiences have been extensive. \nHe received a commission into the Air Force Reserves in 1966 and served \non active duty until 1972.

HARRINGTON, USA\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to BG Edward \nM. Harrington, upon his retirement from the United States Army after \nmore than three decades of distinguished service to our Nation.\n  Ed Harrington's military career can truly be described as an American \nsuccess story. A son of Massachusetts, he grew up in the coastal town \nof Marshfield, where his family's roots extend back three generations. \nAfter graduating from Marshfield High School, he attended Northeastern \nUniversity in Boston, earning a degree in Business Administration. \nBefore the ink was dry on his diploma, Ed received his draft notice and \nsoon donned the battle dress of an infantryman. It wasn't long until \nhis superior recognized his leadership potential, and he was selected \nfor Officer Candidate School. This marked the beginning of what turned \nout to be an exemplary career as an officer who rose to the pinnacle of \nthe complex world of acquisition management.\n  As a lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps, he received orders for \nVietnam where he was assigned to the First Cavalry Division. After \nservice in Vietnam, he returned stateside and assumed command of the \n259th Field Service Company at Fort Bragg. Then, with family in tow, he \nheaded for Germany, serving in various Signal Command positions.\n  After being promoted to captain, Ed returned to Massachusetts to \nbecome a professor of military science at Worcester Polytechnic \nInstitute and Fitchburg State College.\n  In the mid-1980s, Ed's expertise in defense acquisition management \nprompted his selection for the challenging position of production \nmanager for the M1A1 Abrams Tank at the Tank-Automotive and Armaments \nCommand in Warren, Michigan. There, he met the technical challenge of \nupgrading the tank's armor plating improving survivability and \npersonnel protection. Years later, he would return to that organization \nas the Deputy for System Acquisition, a position in which he exercised \nmilestone decision authority for more than 200 Army programs, including \nthe\n\n[[Page S16115]]\n\nPaladin artillery system and the High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled \nVehicle, better known as the HUMVEE.\n  Following high-level logistics assignments overseas and stateside, he \nassumed the first of three command assignments that would culminate in \nhis selection for flag officer and his ascension to the top of the \nDefense Contract Management Agency.\n  In the mid-1990s, as commander of the defense contract management \noffice in Syracuse, he oversaw the performance of contracts associated \nwith a number of large systems, including the Seawolf Submarine, the C-\n17 aircraft, and the Javelin anti-tank missile system. A few years \nlater, Ed returned to his home State, serving as the director of \nDefense Contract Management Command's eastern district headquartered in \nBoston. There, with a dispersed workforce of 6,000 and more than 20 \nfield offices, he and his staff managed nearly all the defense \ncontracts performed in the eastern United States.\n  Since assuming leadership of the Defense Contract Management Agency, \nDCMA, in February 2001, Brigadier General Harrington has refashioned \nand expanded DoD's acquisition-management mission, and in so doing, has \naffirmed DCMA's standing as one of DoD's premiere combat support \nagencies. Today, DCMA carries out its responsibilities around the globe \nat sites as diverse as a circuit board manufacturer in Silicon Valley \nto a combat theater in the Middle East.\n  Ed Harrington's compassion and distinct style of leadership were \ndramatically brought to the fore following the tragic events of \nSeptember 11, 2001, in which one of his DCMA colleagues, Herb Homer of \nMilford, MA, perished while on official travel aboard United Airlines \nFlight 175 that crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center. \nWith compassion and grace, Ed went above and beyond his duty to comfort \nand console the Homer family, and assist Herb's widow, Karen, in \ndealing with the administrative complexities following the death of her \nhusband. Thanks to the efforts of Ed Harrington, the memory of Herb \nHomer and the recognition of his sacrifice will long endure as an \ninspiration to thousands throughout the DoD acquisition community.\n  Whether he was on a muddy ridge as an infantryman, at the front of a \ncollege lecture hall, on a contractor's plant floor, or at the side of \na grieving family, BG Edward M. Harrington served his country with \nvalor, loyalty, and integrity. On the occasion of his retirement from \nthe United States Army, I offer thanks and congratulations to one of \nNew England's finest, and wish him and his wife, Jane, well in their \nfuture pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16115-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING RUSSELL C.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life \nand legacy of Julie Ellis LeMoult, an extraordinary young woman from \nBethesda, MD.\n  This past spring, Julie Ellis LeMoult, loyal, compassionate, \nunderstanding and forgiving friend passed away far too early at the age \nof 28. Her death has dimmed the light of all who knew her: her husband, \nChris LeMoult; her parents, Bruce and Donna Ellis; her sisters, Sheri \nDeLorenzo, Andrea Lynch and Christiane Ellis, and her many, many \nfriends in Bethesda and all across the country.\n  Julie is irreplaceable. She dedicated her short life to maintaining \nand exalting humankind by paying tribute to each person's individual \ngifts. Above all, Julie was always selfless and strived to draw on and \ndraw out the best in everyone she met.\n  The third of four children and the daughter of an entrepreneur who \ncatered to kings, queens, presidents, diplomats, charitable causes and \nprivate social functions, Julie was raised in Bethesda, MD and attend \nGeorgetown Visitation Preparatory School.\n  In December 1996, Julie graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University where \nshe received a business degree in 3\\1/2\\ years while playing lacrosse. \nShe excelled in her academics through fortitude and perseverance, \novercoming a childhood struggle with dyslexia. Her self-esteem remained \nintact because of her athletic abilities, providing her swimming, \ndiving, basketball, softball and lacrosse teams with the highest \nexcellence of leadership and sportsmanship. Julie's stride and form as \na runner exhibited her most memorable style of athletic grace.\n  In 1997, Julie worked for Hambrecht and Quist in San Francisco before \nreturning to Maryland to join Discovery Communications where she was an \ninvaluable member of its corporate affairs and communications \ndepartment.\n  As an adult, Julie became a knowledgeable resource for many people \nexperiencing panic and anxiety disorders and was able to recommend The \nRoss Center of Washington, DC, and the Midwest Center for Anxiety, \nStress and Depression to those who sought her counsel.\n  Julie Katherine Ellis married Christopher M. LeMoult of Cape Code, \nMA, in September 2001. She delivered their baby boy, Logan Donnelly, in \nApril 2003. Her life as a mother allowed her to be with her son for \nonly 8 hours before unknown complications took her life.\n  In addition to her beautiful smile and peaceful nature, Julie's \ngreatest legacies are her son Logan and her ability to open up her \nheart unconditionally to family, friends, acquaintances and strangers \nalike in the hope of making their lives better while expecting nothing \nin return.\n  The sorrow over Julie's loss is accompanied by the abundance of joy \nthat exists in the memories her family and friends share, her life that \nthey celebrate and her love that will live on. At Thanksgiving and \nalways, Julie's parents, sisters, husband, son, family, friends and \ncolleagues are grateful for the brilliance of her life. Julie Ellis \nLeMoult will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16115-3", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16115-S16116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONTRATULATIONS TO JUDITH SPOONER\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, today I recognize Patricia Buckley \nMoss for her outstanding contributions to the advancement of art and \neducation in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  Ms. Moss was born and raised in New York City, where she attended the \nWashington Irving High School for the Fine Arts. After developing her \nartistic talents in high school, Ms. Moss received a scholarship to the \nprestigious Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New \nYork. While at Cooper Union, she studied fine arts and graphic design \nfor 4 years.\n  In 1964, Ms. Moss and her family relocated to Waynesboro, VA. Living \nin the stunning Shenandoah Valley gave Ms. Moss the opportunity to \nexperience and appreciate the natural beauty of the outdoors, which has \nplayed a prominent role in her art ever since. Over the past 40 years, \nshe has created a unique style that is well known by collectors across \nthe globe. Her artistic work eventually led to the creation of the P. \nBuckley Moss Museum, which opened in Waynesboro, VA, in 1989. This \nwell-known museum in the Shenandoah Valley was created to ``permanently \nrecord and illuminate the Moss phenomenon through educational \nexhibitions, lectures, permanent collections and archival files.''\n  During her illustrious artistic career, Ms. Moss has exhibited \ntremendous dedication to many charitable endeavors. In particular, she \nhas remained committed to various children's charities, with a primary \nfocus on special education programs. In 1986, the P. Buckley Moss \nSociety was created by a group of her most dedicated collectors to \nfacilitate the management of her various charitable activities. This \nsociety has grown to over 20,000 members worldwide and uses fundraisers \nto provide for charitable projects. Among its projects in 1995, the \nSociety created the P. Buckley Moss Foundation for Children's \nEducation; the mission of this educational foundation is to ``promote \nthe integration of the arts into all educational programs, with a \nspecial focus on programs for children who learn differently.''\n  Patricia Buckley Moss is an excellent role model for aspiring young \nartists throughout our country. She has left an indelible mark on her \ncommunity not only through her art, but also through her charitable \nwork, which has touched the lives of so many, specifically those who \nare learning impaired. I commend her for her service and wish her \ncontinued success in her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16116-4", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n           CONGRATULATING AG PRODUCER OF THE YEAR KIRK CORDES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I wish the honor to life of a \nremarkable North Carolinian.\n  Jay Jenkins was one of North Carolina's finest. He was a member of a \nlarge and distinguished family descended from 18th century Scottish \nmissionaries, and he left his own mark on our State and the South. With \nhis passing, we have lost a great humanitarian.\n  Jay's long career spanned his early years as a political reporter and \nlater as a leader at the University of North Carolina.\n  Many in North Carolina believe he was the best political reporter the \nState has ever known. He was always the one with the scoop. He had the \nbest contacts and knew how to work them. He was a mentor to many, \nincluding Charles Kuralt, whose own distinguished career took him to \nCBS News, David Cooper, retired editorial page editor of the Akron, OH, \nBeacon-Journal, James Batten, the late president of the Knight-Ridder \nPublishing Co., Joe Doster, retired publisher of the Winston-Salem \nJournal and Eugene Roberts, retired managing editor of The New York \nTimes. His competitors admired him at the same time they were wondering \nhow he always managed to get the story.\n  The qualities that made him such a good reporter were his \nstraightforwardness and his integrity. He was concerned about writing \nwhat was really happening. He looked for pretension in politicians and \navoided those personalities. His emphasis was the common man. He cared \nabout North Carolina providing programs that truly met the needs of \nchildren.\n  Jay counted among his close friends former Senator Jesse Helms, whom \nhe met when both were students in the late 1930s at what was then Wake \nForest College. He also was a close friend to former Governor and \nSenator Terry Sanford.\n  His reporting also led to several journalism awards, including the \nNational Sidney Hillman Award for investigative articles in the News & \nObserver exposing activities of the Klu Klux Klan in North Carolina. In \n1991, Jay Jenkins was inducted into the North Carolina Journalism Hall \nof Fame.\n  Jay later joined UNC system President Bill Friday as a senior \nassistant. During his tenure with the university system, he expanded \nthe concept of public relations to be more than just reporting about \nthe students. Most importantly, he originated and founded the \ntelevision news show, North Carolina People, hosted by President \nFriday. This show is still running and remains popular in North \nCarolina. He was also was highly respected in the legislature, where he \nrepresented the university with distinction.\n  ``I remember him as the best of his generation,'' President Friday \nsaid of Jay. ``He was a man of real integrity, honesty and plain raw \ncourage. His motivation was always what was best for North Carolina.''\n  Jay was an accomplished outdoorsman and athlete who played \nsemiprofessional baseball. He was a devoted follower of the Atlanta \nBraves and his beloved Wake Forest Demon Deacons.\n  A veteran of World War II, Jay served our country with distinction in \nthe Army Air Corps in the Pacific Theater for 30 months.\n  Jay was a true North Carolina treasure. We will miss him \ndearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16117-2", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CRAIG WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Craig has been a tireless advocate \nagainst the incineration of these deadly weapons and has done a \nremarkable job educating and mobilizing the local communities \nsurrounding these disposal sites across the country.\n  I congratulate Craig for receiving this honor, and I thank him for \nhis tireless advocacy on behalf of a cleaner environment and protection \nof all those living and working near chemical weapons storage \nfacilities. I look forward to working with Craig on future projects. I \nthank the Senate for allowing me to pay tribute to this dedicated \nKentuckian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16117-3", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16117-4", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, two treaties, and a withdrawal which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16117-5", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ANNUAL REPORT OF THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD FOR THE FISCAL YEAR \n                    ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2002--PM 58\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Railroad Retirement \nBoard presented for forwarding to you for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2002, consistent with the provisions of section 7(b)(6) \nof the Railroad Retirement Act and section 12(1) of the Railroad \nUnemployment Insurance Act.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \na voter-verified permanent record or hardcopy under title III of such \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, today I rise to \nintroduce the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act.\n  In 2000, Florida grabbed the national spotlight as an unfortunate \nexample of an electoral process gone awry. The question of who would \nassume our Nation's highest office became contingent on such things as \nwhether a chad was bulging or hanging. In the aftermath of that \ndebacle, Americans demand that Congress improve the accuracy and \nintegrity of our electoral process. Congress responded with the Help \nAmerica Vote Act (HAVA), which we passed in 2002.\n  HAVA aimed to modernize our electoral system and there have been some \npositive developments. Under the law, States have replaced punch card \nand lever voting systems with modern computer voting machines. \nModernization, however, has failed to overcome all the pitfalls seen in \nrecent elections. In 2002, Floridians were subject to another failure \nof our electoral process when a software error failed to court \napproximately 100,000 votes.\n  As it now stands, computer-voting systems--including the popular \ntouch screen models--are not mandated to include a paper record \nverifying voter intent. In the absence of a paper trail, confirming the \naccuracy of a computer voting machine is very difficult, sometimes even \nimpossible. Further, voting irregularities, security intrusions and \nelectronic errors can go unnoticed. We have a duty to our democracy to \ncontinue to address challenges that threaten to undermine the security \nand reliability of our electoral system.\n  The Voter Confidence & Increased Accessibility Act renews our \ncommitment to fulfilling that obligation. It will take us one step \ncloser to our ultimate goal: ensuring that every vote really counts. \nThis legislation responds to a set of challenges presented by computer \nvoting systems. It would require all voting systems produce a \nverifiable paper record. States would also be given assistance in \nmeeting this standard through funds dedicated to HAVA.\n  The Voter Confidence & Increased Accessibility Act also stipulates \nseveral other provisions to ensure that every vote really counts. It \nwould prohibit the use of unreported software and wireless \ncommunication devices in all voting systems. It would also restrict \nelectronic communications from voting machines, permitting outgoing \ntransmissions of vote totals only.\n  The legislation specifies that voting systems must comply with these \nstandards in time for the November 2004 general election. In the event \nthat a locality is unable to get their computer voting systems \ncompliant by this deadline, they are authorized to use a paper system \nas an interim measure. The Federal Government would be authorized to \npay the cost of these paper systems for the November 2004 election.\n  The Voter Confidence & Increased Accessibility Act also requires that \nindividuals with disabilities must be accommodated with electronic \nvoting systems by January 1, 2006, a year earlier than mandated by \nHAVA. While a paper record of a disabled persons vote is not expressly \nrequired, voting systems for disabled persons must include a means for \nvoter verification. In the event a jurisdiction cannot meet this \nstandard, disabled voters must be given the option to utilize a \ntemporary paper system, with the assistance of an aide of their \nchoosing.\n  Finally, the legislation would require the Election Assistance \nCommission to conduct unannounced recounts in .5 percent of domestic \njurisdictions and .5 percent of overseas jurisdictions. This way, \nCongress and America's voters can be assured that the election \nequipment is operating properly, and votes are really being counted.\n  Creating these new standards will help ensure that our elections \naccurately reflect the intent of the voting public, and put into place \nan election system in which Americans can have full confidence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 1986. A bill to amend the help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \nvoter verification and improved security for voting systems under title \nIII of the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Protecting \nAmerican Democracy Act of 2003, legislation that is vital to ensuring \nthat the voting systems used in our Federal elections are as secure as \npossible while also ensuring that each and every voter in our Nation \nhas an equal opportunity to verify his or her vote before that vote is \ncast and permanently recorded. At its core, this legislation will \nensure that every vote is properly counted, ensuring the integrity of \neach vote, which is at the heart of our democracy.\n  In recent months, there has been discussion about the increasing use \nof electronic voting systems such as direct recording electronic \nsystems (DREs), the first completely computerized voting systems. \nComputerized voting systems can have many advantages. As the \nCongressional Research\n\n[[Page S16123]]\n\nService has reported, they are arguably the most user-friendly and \nversatile of any current voting system. Among many features, such \nvoting machines can be easily programmed to display ballots in \ndifferent languages and can be made fully accessible for persons with \ndisabilities, including the visually impaired. They can also prevent \novervotes and spoilage of ballots due to extraneous marks since no \ndocument ballot is involved. In addition, fully computerized systems \nhave the ability to notify voters of undervotes. Presently, no other \nkind of voting system possesses so many features. For this reason, it \nis expected that within the next two years, with funding authorized \nunder the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (``HAVA''), state and local \njurisdictions across the country will begin purchasing fully \ncomputerized systems.\n  One of the disadvantages of these electronic voting systems, however, \nis that they do not give voters an opportunity to verify their votes--\nto confirm that the voting machinery is registering the vote that the \nvoter intended to cast--before the vote is cast and permanently \nrecorded. In addition, electronic voting systems raise other concerns \nbecause of the ability of the software in the voting system to be \ncompromised, or worse, maliciously attacked, by someone who may want to \nalter the voting results. Indeed, a number of recent studies, including \nthe July 2001 study by Caltech/MIT, the July 2003 study by Johns \nHopkins and Rice universities, the September 2003 study by the Science \nApplications International Corporation, requested by the Governor of \nMaryland, and the two November 2003 studies conducted by Compuware \nCorporation and InfoSENTRY, requested by the Ohio Secretary of State, \npointed to significant and disturbing security risks in electronic \nvoting systems and related administrative procedures and processes.\n  That is why in addition to ensuring that voters have an opportunity \nto verify their vote, it is vital that we improve the security of \nvoting system technology, and that means not only the kind of software \nthat is used but also how, for example, that software is designed, \nstored, disseminated, updated, field tested, and used in an actual \nelection. This is a developing consensus among computer security \nexperts that not only is the security of electronic voting systems \nwholly inadequate, but that the security policies and procedures that \nState and local election officials, voting system vendors, and others \nuse are non-existent, inadequate, or, if they exist, are not followed, \nwhich is the same as having no policy at all.\n  Our Nation is the greatest Nation on earth and it is the leading \ndemocracy in the world. Central to that democracy is ability of \nAmericans to have confidence in the voting system used to register and \nrecord their votes. This is a fundamental standard that must be met. I \nhave concerns, however, that our Nation is falling short of that \nstandard.\n  That is why I am today introducing the ``Protecting American \nDemocracy Act of 2003,'' which amends by adding a voter verification \nrequirement for voting systems to give each voter an opportunity to \nverify his or her vote at the time the vote is cast. Voters will be \ngiven an opportunity to correct any error made by the voting system \nbefore the permanent voting record is preserved.\n  While requiring that all election jurisdictions give voters the \nability to verify their votes, this legislation also gives States and \nlocal jurisdictions the flexibility to employ the most appropriate, \naccurate, and secure voter verification technologies, which may include \nvoter-verifiable paper ballots, votemeters, modular voting \narchitecture, and/or encrypted votes, for their State or jurisdiction \nin a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. Any voter verification \nmethod used must ensure that voters with disabilities and other \naffected voters have the ability to cast their vote in private, and \nlanguage minorities must have equal access in verifying their vote. \nThis is important if we are to ensure that all Americans--including the \nmore than 20 million voters who are visually impaired, the more than 40 \nmillion Americans who lack basic literacy skills, and millions of \nlanguage minorities--will be able to exercise their constitutional \nright to vote.\n  To address critical security issues, the ``Protecting American \nDemocracy Act of 2003'' also amends HAVA by adding a security \nrequirement for voting systems to ensure that voting systems are as \nsecure as possible. Specifically, voting systems must adhere to the \nsecurity requirements for Federal computer systems as required under \ncurrent law or, alternatively, more stringent requirements adopted by \nthe Election Assistance Commission. Currently no such requirement \nexists. I believe that, at minimum, the systems used by the people of \nthe United States to exercise their constitutional right to vote, the \nhallmark of our democracy, should be at least as secure as the computer \nsystems used by the Federal Government.\n  The security requirements must also provide that no voting system \nshall contain any wireless device, which reduces the risk that hackers \nwill be able to attack any electronic voting system. In addition, all \nsoftware and hardware used in any electronic voting system must be \ncertified by laboratories accredited by the Commission as meeting all \nsecurity requirements.\n  The Act also requires the Election Assistance Commission to report to \nCongress within 6 months of enactment regarding a proposed security \nreview and certification process for all voting systems. Within 3 \nmonths of enactment, the Government Accounting Office, unless the \nCommission has already completed the following report, must issue a \nreport to Congress on the operational and management systems that \nshould be employed to safeguard the security of voting systems, \ntogether with a schedule for how quickly each such measure should be \nimplemented.\n  Lastly, immediately upon enactment, the National Institute of \nStandards and technology (NIST) must provide security consultation \nservices to State and local jurisdiction. Two million dollars in Fiscal \nYears 2004 through 2006 are authorized to be appropriated to assist \nNIST in providing these security consultation services.\n  I cannot think of a more significant risk to our democracy than for \nAmericans to lack complete confidence in the voting systems used to \ncast and count their votes in Federal elections. For all those who \nbelieve that in a democracy, there is no more important task than \nassuring the sanctity of votes, this should be an easy step to take to \nassure it. For this reason, I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to implement the obligations of the United States \nunder the Protocol Additional to the Agreement between the United \nStates of America and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the \nApplication of Safeguards in the United States of America, known as \n``the Additional Protocol'' signed by the United States on June 12, \n1998; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, at the request of the administration, I am \npleased to introduce the Additional Protocol Implementation Act of \n2003. This important legislation is needed to implement the provisions \nof the Protocol to the Agreement of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, IAEA, Regarding Safeguards in the United States.\n  The United States signed the Additional Protocol in Vienna on June \n12, 1998. President Bush submitted the Additional Protocol to the \nSenate on May 9, 2002. The State Department sent the implementing \nlegislation to us on November 19, 2003, and asked that it be considered \nin conjunction with the Senate's advice and consent on the Protocol. \nThe adoption of this agreement is an important step in demonstrating \nU.S. leadership in the fight against the spread of nuclear weapons. The \nAdditional Protocol will provide the United States and the IAEA with \nanother tool as we attempt to secure broader inspection rights in non-\nnuclear-weapon states that are parties to the Treaty on the \nNonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT.\n  When the Committee on Foreign Relations reported out the NPT in 1968, \nit noted that ``the treaty's fundamental purpose is to slow the spread \nof nuclear weapons by prohibiting the nuclear weapon states which are \nparty to the treaty from transferring nuclear weapons to others, and by \nbarring the non-nuclear weapon countries from receiving, manufacturing, \nor otherwise acquiring nuclear weapons.'' Since the Senate ratified the \nNPT, we have seen 188 states join the United States in approving the \ntreaty. But recently we also have seen a disturbing increase in the \nglobal availability of nuclear materials and reprocessing and \nenrichment technology. To ensure that these materials and technologies \nare devoted only to peaceful purposes, the IAEA must have the power to \nconduct intrusive inspections at almost any location in a non-nuclear-\nweapon state to verify state parties' commitments under the NPT.\n  The world community has learned that existing safeguard arrangements \nin non-nuclear-weapon states do not provide the IAEA with a complete \nand accurate picture of possible nuclear weapons-related activities. It \nis critical that the IAEA have the ability to expand the scope of its \nactivities in states that pose a potential proliferation threat. At \nthis point, the only means at the IAEA's disposal, beyond existing \nsafeguards arrangements, is the Model Additional Protocol.\n  The United States, as a declared nuclear-weapon state party to the \nNPT, may exclude the application of IAEA safeguards on its nuclear \nactivities. Under the negotiated Additional Protocol, the United States \nalso has the right to exclude activities and sites of direct national \nsecurity significance in accordance with its National Security \nexclusion. This provision is crucial to U.S. acceptance of the \nAdditional Protocol and provides a basis for the protection of U.S. \nnuclear weapons-related activities, sites, and materials as a declared \nnuclear power.\n  The Additional Protocol does not contain any new arms control or \ndisarmament obligations for the United States. While there are \nincreased rights granted to the IAEA for the conduct of inspections in \nthe United States, the administration has assured the committee that \nthe likelihood of an inspection occurring in the United States is very \nlow. Nevertheless, should an inspection under the Additional Protocol \nbe potentially harmful to U.S. national security interests, the United \nStates has the right, through the National Security Exclusion, to \nprevent such an inspection.\n  The Committee on Foreign Relations will hold hearings early next year \nto consider the Additional Protocol. I am confident the Committee will \ndraft a resolution of ratification that will enjoy the support of the \nsenate. Ratification of this treaty and passage of its implementing \nlegislation would be an important demonstration of the U.S. commitment \nto vigorous and expansive authority for the IAEA in non-nuclear-weapon \nstates.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation today as a statement of \nthe Committee's strong support for aggressive verification capabilities \nin the global fight against the spread of weapons of mass destruction. \nI look forward to working closely with my friend, Senator Hatch, \nChairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, to construct legislation \nthat protects U.S. national security interests, while strengthening the \nability of the IAEA to discover illegal nuclear weapons activities.\n  the package I send to the desk today contains a letter from the \nDepartment of State, the administration's implementing legislation, and \na section-by-section analysis, all submitted by the administration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the referenced letter and analysis be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n                                United States Department of State,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, United States \n         Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the President, I am pleased \n     to submit for consideration the Administration's recommended \n     text for legislation to implement the Protocol Additional to \n     the Agreement Between the United States of America and the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency for Application of \n     Safeguards in the United States of America (U.S.-IAEA \n     Additional Protocol). The U.S.-IAEA Additional Protocol, \n     signed in Vienna on June 12, 1998, is a bilateral treaty that \n     supplements and amends the Agency verification arrangements \n     under the existing Agreement Between the United States of \n     America and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the \n     Application of Safeguards in the United States of America of \n     November 18, 1977 (the ``Voluntary Offer''), which entered \n     into force on December 9, 1980.\n       The U.S.-IAEA Additional Protocol contains a number of \n     provisions that require implementing legislation to give them \n     effect within the United States. These include:\n       Declarations of U.S. civil nuclear activities and related \n     industry;\n       Restrictions on disclosure of information; and\n       International inspections of locations in the United \n     States.\n       The President, in his letter of transmission dated May 9, \n     2002, stated that the U.S.-IAEA ``Additional Protocol is in \n     the best interests of the United States. Our acceptance of \n     this agreement will sustain our longstanding record of \n     voluntary acceptance of nuclear safeguards and greatly \n     strengthen our ability to promote universal adoption of the\n\n[[Page S16125]]\n\n     Model Protocol, a central goal of my nuclear nonproliferation \n     policy. Widespread acceptance of the Protocol will contribute \n     significantly to our nonproliferation objectives as well as \n     strengthen U.S., allied and international security.'' We urge \n     the Senate to give early and favorable consideration to the \n     Protocol and the recommended implementing legislation.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this proposal and its \n     enactment, is in accord with the President's program.\n       We hope this information and the enclosed recommended \n     legislation and sectional analysis are helpful. Please let us \n     know if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Paul V. Kelly,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n     Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\nSection-by-Section Analysis of the Proposed Additional Protocol to the \n       U.S.-IAEA Safeguards Agreement Implementation Act of 2003\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       The Protocol Additional to the Agreement between the United \n     States of America and the International Atomic Energy Agency \n     (IAEA) for the Application of Safeguards in the United States \n     of America (the Additional Protocol) contains a number of \n     provisions that require legislation to give them effect \n     within the United States. These include provisions on the \n     submission to the United States Government of civil nuclear \n     and nuclear-related information by entities identified in \n     Article 2 of the Additional Protocol, and on civil and \n     criminal penalties for failure of such entities to keep or \n     provide such information. The proposed legislation also sets \n     forth procedures for inspections, or ``complementary \n     access,'' by the IAEA at U.S. locations under the Additional \n     Protocol.\n       The proposed Additional Protocol to the U.S.-IAEA \n     Safeguards Agreement Implementation Act (the Act) contains \n     five miscellaneous sections and six titles. The five \n     miscellaneous sections concern the short title of the Act, \n     the table of contents, Congressional findings, definitions, \n     and a severability clause. Title I provides specific \n     authority for the President to implement and carry out the \n     Act and the Additional Protocol through directing the \n     issuance of necessary regulations. Title II authorizes \n     complementary access at U.S. locations consistent with the \n     Act, and establishes the terms upon which such access may \n     take place. For example, it addresses the notice that must be \n     given to the owner or operator of the inspected location, and \n     the procedures to be followed for seeking access--including \n     obtaining an administrative search warrant where necessary. \n     Title III restricts disclosure of certain information \n     provided pursuant to the Act or the Additional Protocol. \n     Title IV makes it illegal for entities willfully to fail to \n     report information required by regulations pursuant to the \n     Act, and Title V provides for criminal and civil penalties \n     for such violations. Finally, Title VI authorizes \n     appropriation of funds for the Agencies required to carry out \n     responsibilities under the Act.\n\n\n                         miscellaneous sections\n\n       The first part of the Act contains five miscellaneous \n     sections: the short title of the Act, the table of contents, \n     Congressional findings, definitions, and a severability \n     clause. The first two sections are standard provisions. The \n     third section contains seven Congressional findings, which \n     recognize the threat posed by nuclear proliferation, the \n     importance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the \n     urgency of strengthening its safeguards system, and the need \n     to implement the U.S.-IAEA Additional Protocol as a means of \n     encouraging other NPT State Parties to accept stricter \n     verification measures. The fourth section provides \n     definitions of key terms as they are used in the Act. In many \n     instances, the same definitions appear in the Additional \n     Protocol, and are therefore cross-referenced. Finally, the \n     fifth section provides that, if any provision of the Act is \n     held invalid, the remainder of the Act shall remain in force. \n     The Administration believes that the Additional Protocol and \n     the Act are fully consistent with the U.S. Constitution, but \n     has included this section as a matter of prudence.\n\n\n                         title i--authorization\n\n       Title I authorizes the President to implement and carry out \n     the provisions of the Act and the Additional Protocol. This \n     is to be accomplished through an Executive Order designating \n     Agencies to promulgate regulations requiring, inter alia, \n     submission to the United States Government of information \n     specified under Article 2 of the Additional Protocol. This \n     information is necessary for the United States to fulfill its \n     Treaty obligation to provide the IAEA with a broad \n     declaration of its civil nuclear and nuclear-related \n     activities. While the Agencies most likely to issue or amend \n     such regulations are identified in Section 101(a) of the Act, \n     this list is not exclusive.\n\n\n                     title ii--complementary access\n\n       Title II sets forth the terms under which complementary \n     access may occur in the United States. Section 201 of the Act \n     makes clear that the IAEA may not conduct complementary \n     access in the United States without the authorization, in \n     accordance with the Act, of the United States Government. It \n     further directs that certain U.S. agencies may not \n     participate in complementary access. These agencies, \n     including the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration, are excluded \n     because their employees may detect violations of regulatory \n     schemes wholly unrelated to the Additional Protocol. Section \n     201 further requires the number of U.S. representatives be \n     kept to a minimum.\n       Section 202 addresses procedures for complementary access. \n     For example, Section 202(b) sets forth the requirement for \n     the United States Government to provide ``actual written \n     notice'' of a complementary access request, as soon as \n     possible, to the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge \n     of the location to be inspected. The notice must contain all \n     appropriate information provided by the IAEA concerning the \n     purpose of the access request, the basis for selection of the \n     location, the activities it intends to carry out, the time \n     and duration of the access, and the identities of inspectors. \n     In addition, Section 202(c) requires IAEA and U.S. personnel \n     participating in the complementary access to show their \n     credentials prior to gaining entry to the inspected location.\n       Section 202(d)(1) states the general rule that IAEA \n     inspectors may conduct all activities specified under Article \n     6 of the Additional Protocol for the type of location being \n     inspected. However, there are several exceptions to this \n     rule. First, a warrant issued authorizing complementary \n     access at a location may restrict the activities that \n     inspectors may conduct. Second, as indicated in 202(d)(1), \n     the United States Government has certain rights under the \n     Additional Protocol to limit such access. In addition to its \n     right under Article 1(b) of the\n       Protocol to deny IAEA access to activities with direct \n     national security significance or to location or information \n     associated with such activities, the United States may manage \n     access in connection with such activities, locations or \n     information. These rights are unilateral and absolute; they \n     are not subject to challenge by or negotiation with the IAEA. \n     Furthermore, Article 7 of the Additional Protocol provides \n     for managed access, under arrangements with the IAEA, to \n     prevent the dissemination of proliferation sensitive \n     information, to meet safety or physical protection \n     requirements, or to protect proprietary or commercially \n     sensitive information. Third, Section 202(d)(2) lists a \n     series of items that are specifically excluded from IAEA \n     access. This third set of exceptions, which are mainly \n     directed at protecting commercial information, may not \n     however be enforced if the Additional Protocol requires such \n     disclosure. Section 202(e) requires that all persons \n     participating in complementary access, including U.S. \n     representatives, observe all environmental, health, safety \n     and security regulations applicable for the inspected \n     location.\n       Section 203 provides the legal framework for IAEA \n     inspectors to gain complementary access to U.S. locations \n     under the Additional Protocol. Section 203(a) sets forth \n     three grounds for such access: warrantless access, where the \n     Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution does not require a \n     warrant; consent to the access by the owner/operator of the \n     location; or, where necessary, obtaining an administrative \n     search warrant. Section 203(a)(2) makes clear that the \n     legislation is intended to impose no warrant requirement \n     beyond that which is required by the Fourth Amendment. Where \n     such a warrant requirement exists, Section 203(a)(1) directs \n     the United States Government first to seek consent to access \n     from the location's owner or operator. The remainder of \n     Section 203 addresses the requirements for obtaining an \n     administrative search warrant, and what such a warrant should \n     contain. Section 203(b)(1) states that the United States \n     Government shall provide to the judge all appropriate \n     information it has received from the IAEA regarding its basis \n     for selecting a particular location for complementary access. \n     A ``judge of the United States'' is defined by the Act to \n     mean a judge or magistrate judge of a district court of the \n     United States. In addition, Section 203(b)(2) requires the \n     United States to submit to the judge a more detailed \n     affidavit showing, among other things, that the Additional \n     Protocol is in force in the United States, applicable to the \n     location to be inspected, and that the complementary access \n     requested is consistent with the provisions of the Additional \n     Protocol, including Article 4 regarding the purpose of the \n     access, and Article 6 regarding its scope. The affidavit must \n     also indicate the anticipated time and duration of the \n     inspection.\n       Finally, the affidavit must show that the location to be \n     inspected was selected by the IAEA either (i) because there \n     is probable cause, on the basis of specific evidence, to \n     believe that information required to be reported regarding a \n     location pursuant to regulations promulgated under the Act is \n     incorrect or incomplete, and that the location to be accessed \n     contains evidence regarding that violation; or (ii) pursuant \n     to a reasonable general administrative plan developed by the \n     IAEA based upon specific neutral criteria. Selection based on \n     either of these approaches would meet U.S. Constitutional \n     requirements for issuance of a warrant. Section 203 directs \n     that a judge, upon receiving the affidavit, shall promptly \n     issue an administrative search warrant authorizing the \n     requested complementary access. The warrant is to specify the \n     same information as the affidavit, and shall, if known, also \n     include the identities of the IAEA complementary access\n\n[[Page S16126]]\n\n     team and accompanying U.S. representatives.\n\n\n               title III--confidentiality of information\n\n       Title III of the proposed implementing legislation \n     restricts the disclosure of information provided to the \n     United States Government, or to its contractor personnel, \n     pursuant to the Act or the Additional Protocol. For example, \n     Section 301(a) exempts from the Freedom of Information Act \n     (FOIA) disclosure information obtained by the United States \n     Government in implementing the provisions of the Additional \n     Protocol. Thus, information reported to the Government by \n     entities covered by Article 2 of the Additional Protocol, as \n     required by regulation, is not subject to release under the \n     FOIA.\n\n\n                        title iv--recordkeeping\n\n       Title IV of the proposed implementing legislation prohibits \n     the willful failure of any person to maintain records or \n     submit reports to the United States Government as required by \n     regulations issued under Section 101 of the Act. The \n     prohibitions of Title IV are necessary to implement the \n     Additional Protocol, as the United States is dependent on \n     such reporting to meet its Treaty obligations. A person is \n     defined by the Act very broadly to ensure that all possible \n     entities within the United States are covered.\n\n\n                          title v--enforcement\n\n       Title V of the proposed implementing legislation provides \n     for both civil and criminal penalties for failure to meet the \n     recordkeeping and reporting requirements of Title IV. \n     Violators shall be subject to imprisonment for not more than \n     five years, criminal fines, and civil penalties up to $25,000 \n     per violation. While the Agency issuing the applicable \n     regulations is responsible for their enforcement, an entity \n     subject to civil penalty under this Title may seek judicial \n     review. Title V also provides United States district courts \n     with jurisdiction to specifically enforce Agency orders, \n     either by restraining or compelling action so as to avoid a \n     violation of Title IV.\n\n\n                    title vi--authorization of funds\n\n       Title VI of the proposed legislation authorizes the \n     appropriation of such sums as necessary to carry out the \n     purpose of the Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Daschle (for Mr. Kerry (for himself and Mr. Kennedy)):\n  S. 1991. A bill to require the reimbursement of members of the Armed \nForces or their family members for the costs of protective body armor \npurchased by or on behalf of members of the Armed Forces; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record).\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is the responsibility of the \nmilitary departments to ``organize, train, and equip,'' the armed \nforces of the United States. Yet, reports indicate that nearly a \nquarter of the 130,000 U.S. troops in Iraq still wait for the latest \n``Interceptor'' body armor, which is a Kevlar vest with ``small-arms \nprotective inserts''--boron carbide ceramic plates--that protect \ncritical organs from weapons fired by assault rifles like the Ak-47s \nfavored by Iraqi insurgents.\n  While the Congress has taken measures to provide the latest personal \nprotective gear to all U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, over the \nlast several months we have heard alarming reports of family members \nscurrying to buy bullet-proof vests to send to their loved ones in \nIraq. Military families are patriotic and selfless. Their devotion is \nno less than that of those serving in harm's way. They have more than \nenough to worry about, let alone whether or not they can find and buy \nthe gear that might save their child's life. This is the responsibility \nof the Department of Defense, plain and simple. There is no excuse for \ntheir failure.\n  On November 19, 2003, acting-Secretary of the Army Les Brownlee \nadmitted to Congress that the administration failed to provide basic \nequipment, like body armor, to all of our forces in Iraq because, as he \nput it, ``Events since the end of major combat operations in Iraq have \ndiffered from our expectations and have combined to cause problems.'' \nThe Washington Post reported recently that, ``Going into the war in \nIraq, the Army decided to outfit only dismounted combat soldiers with \nthe plated vests, which cost about $1,500 each. But when Iraqi \ninsurgents began ambushing convoys and killing clerks as well as combat \ntroops, controversy erupted.'' I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of this article be included in the Record.\n  Stories abound of family members, fathers and mothers, wives, and \nothers paying for personal body armor out of their own pockets and \nshipping the much needed equipment to Iraq. Consider the case of Mimi \nMcCreary of Victorville, CA, whose son Olaf received his bullet-proof \nvest not from his reserve unit, but from his colleagues on the Clinton, \nSC, police department. Or consider the 120 members of the National \nGuard from Marin County, CA, who were unsure of when their body armor \nwould be made available. Instead of letting their neighbors go off to \nwar, the men and women of law enforcement in Marin County donated more \nthan 60 vests so that they would have ``at least some protection.'' Or \nconsider Army Specialist Richard Murphy of Sciota, PA, whose parents, \nSusan and Joe Werfelman, purchased the ceramic plates missing from \ntheir son's vest. According to Murphy's step-father, he ``called us \nfrantically three or four times on this . . . We said, ``If the Army is \nnot going to protect him, we've got to do it.''\n  We owe Mr. and Mrs. Werfelman and Mrs. McCreary and every other \nmilitary family an incredible debt of gratitude. They raised children \nwho believe in this country and are risking all in service to it. The \nlast thing we should ask of them now is to take money out of their own \npockets to buy the gear their kids should have had in the first place. \nBut that's exactly what poor planning has led to.\n\n  The legislation I introduce today with Senator Kennedy requires the \nDepartment of Defense to reimburse family members who paid money out of \ntheir own pockets to provide the personal body armor that the \ngovernment failed to provide our troops. Lives and blood will always be \nthe cost of war. But it is a dereliction of duty to send anyone into \nharm's way without basic protective gear, and it is disgusting for \nfamily members to have to take this burden of outfitting their loved \nones for war. This grateful Nation must make right by those family \nmembers and reimburse their expenses in providing these materials to \ntheir sons and daughters, husbands and wives. Let families send \npictures and letters from home. The Department of Defense should \nprovide the gear.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 4, 2003]\n\n                     Body Armor Saves Lives in Iraq\n\n                   (By Vernon Loeb and Theola Labbe)\n\n       Baghdad.--Pfc. Gregory Stovall felt the explosion on his \n     face. He was standing in the turret of a Humvee, manning a \n     machine gun, when the roadside bomb went off. At the time, he \n     was guarding a convoy of trucks making a mail run. In an \n     instant, Stovall's face was perforated by shrapnel, the index \n     finger on his right hand was gone, and the middle finger was \n     hanging by a tendon. But the 22-year-old from Brooklyn \n     remembers instinctively reaching for his chest and stomach--\n     ``to make sure everything was there,'' he said. It was, \n     encased in a Kevlar vest reinforced by boron carbide ceramic \n     plates that are so hard they can stop AK-47 rounds traveling \n     2,750 feet per second. Thus, on the morning of Nov. 4, \n     Stovall became the latest in a long line of soldiers serving \n     in Iraq to be saved by the U.S. military's new Interceptor \n     body armor.\n       This high-tech ``system''--the Kevlar vest and ``small-arms \n     protective inserts,'' which the troops call SAPI plates--is \n     dramatically reducing the kind of torso injuries that have \n     killed soldiers on the battlefield in wars past.\n       Soldiers will not patrol without the armor--if they can get \n     it. But as of now, there is not enough to go around. Going \n     into the war in Iraq, the Army decided to outfit only \n     dismounted combat soldiers with the plated vests, which cost \n     about $1,500 each. But when Iraqi insurgents began ambushing \n     convoys and killing clerks as well as combat troops, \n     controversy erupted.\n       Last month, Rep. Ted Strickland (D-Ohio) and 102 other \n     House members wrote to Rep. Duncan Hunger ( R-Calif.), \n     chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to demand \n     hearings on why the Pentagon had been unable to provide all \n     U.S. service members in Iraq with the latest body armor. In \n     the letter, the lawmakers cited reports that soldiers' \n     parents had been purchasing body armor with ceramic plates \n     and sending it to their children in Iraq.\n       The demand came after Gen. John Abizaid, head of the U.S. \n     Central Command and commander of all military forces in Iraq, \n     told a House Appropriations subcommittee in September that he \n     could not ``answer for the record why we started this war \n     with protective vests that were in short supply.''\n       With the armor, ``it's the difference between being hit \n     with a fist or with a knife,'' said Ben Gonzalez, chief of \n     the emergency room at the 28th Combat Support Hospital in \n     Baghdad, the largest U.S. Army hospital in the country, which \n     treats the majority of wounded soldiers.\n       Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington \n     University, began investigating the Army's decision not to \n     equip all troops deploying to Iraq with Interceptor body \n     armor after learning that one of his students, reservist \n     Richard Murphy, was in the\n\n[[Page S16127]]\n\n     country with a Vietnam-era flak jacket. ``There's been an \n     overwhelming effort to get the military every possible \n     resource,'' Turley said. ``To have such an item denied to \n     troops in Iraq was a terrible oversight.'' Since he began \n     publicizing the lack of body armor, Turley said, he has been \n     deluged with e-mails from people offering to donate body \n     armor to U.S. troops.\n       Joe Werfelman, the father of Turley's student, said he was \n     dismayed to learn that his son had been sent to Iraq in May \n     without ceramic plates. ``He called us frantically three or \n     four times on this,'' Werfelman said in an interview. ``We \n     said, `If the Army is not going to protect him, we've got to \n     do it.' '' So Werfelman, of Scotia, Pa., found a New Jersey \n     company that had the ceramic plates in stock, plunked down \n     $660 for two plates and a carrying case, and sent them to his \n     son. ``As far as I know, he's still using the ones that we \n     got him'' he said. ``Some units have the new plates and some \n     units don't.''\n       At a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Nov. \n     19, Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), the committee's chairman, \n     told Acting Army Secretary Les Brownlee that the shortage of \n     body armor in Iraq was ``totally unacceptable.'' ``Now, where \n     was the error--and I say it's an error made in planning--to \n     send those troops to forward-deployed regions, and the \n     conflict in Iraq, without adequate numbers of body armor?'' \n     Warner asked. ``Events since the end of major combat \n     operations in Iraq have differed from our expectations and \n     have combined to cause problems,'' Brownlee said. Before \n     approving the administration's $87 billion supplemental bill \n     for Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress added hundreds of millions \n     of dollars for more body armor, armored Humvees, and other \n     systems to protect soldiers from roadside bombs and ambushes.\n       Now, three manufacturers are working overtime to produce \n     the 80,000 vests and 160,000 plates required to outfit \n     everyone in Iraq by the end of the year. Assembly lines are \n     producing 25,000 sets a month.\n       Commanders say the vests are changing the way soldiers \n     think and act in combat. ``I will tell you that the \n     soldiers--to include this one--experience some degree of \n     feeling a little indestructible, particularly in light of the \n     fact that we have seen the equipment work,'' said Lt Col. \n     Henry Arnold, a battalion commander and combat veteran in \n     the 101st Airborne Division in northern Iraq. ``It's a \n     security blanket,'' Stovall said from his hospital bed, \n     awaiting a medevac flight to Germany with his hand \n     bandaged. ``If only they had a glove, I might have my \n     finger, but I'm thankful that I'm here.''\n       The product of a five-year military research effort aimed \n     at reducing the weight and cost of the plates while \n     increasing their strength, the body armor made its combat \n     debut last year in Afghanistan and was credited with saving \n     more than a dozen lives during Operation Anaconda. The \n     camouflage Kevlar vest, which alone can stop rounds from a \n     9mm handgun, weighs 8.4 pounds, while each of the plates \n     weighs 4 pounds. At 16.4 pounds, Interceptor body armor is a \n     third lighter than the 25-pound flak jacket from the Vietnam \n     era, but it provides far more protection.\n       Consider the case of Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 505th \n     Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division. \n     During a foot patrol in Fallujah in late September, an Iraqi \n     insurgent suddenly emerged from an alleyway and fired an AK-\n     47 at Spec. John Fox from point-blank range. Fox was hit in \n     the stomach as he returned fire, and the blast knocked him \n     off his feet. The bullet hit the middle of three ammunition \n     magazines hanging from the front of his Kevlar vet, igniting \n     tracer rounds and setting off a smoke grenade. A thick gray \n     plume poured from his vest where he lay. His squad mates, \n     having shot and killed the gunman, rushed to his side. ``Am I \n     bleeding? Am I bleeding?'' they recalled Fox asking. They \n     checked and discovered he was unharmed. His body armor had \n     protected him not only from the AK-47 round by also from his \n     own exploding munitions. ``Fox must have been only 10, 15 \n     meters from this guy,'' recalled St. Roger Vasquez. ``And \n     this thing stopped the bullet.''\n       A month later, two of those who had rushed to Fox's side, \n     Spec. Sean Bargmann and Spec. Joseph Rodriguez, were on a \n     mounted patrol in Fallujah, sitting atop a Humvee, when a \n     powerful roadside bomb exploded just feet away. ``It felt \n     like somebody took a Louisville Slugger to my head,'' \n     Bargmann said. Weeks after the attack, he and Rodriguez still \n     bore the outlines of their armor: The tops of their head, \n     protected by their Kevlar helmets, and their torsos, \n     protected by their body armor, were unscathed. But Bargmann \n     had a deep cut right below the helmet line, and Rodriguez had \n     three scars running down his right cheek and a scar above his \n     left eye.\n       This often happens with body armor: Lives are saved, but \n     faces, arms and legs are punctured and scarred. Doctors are \n     treating serious wound to the extremities that are creating \n     large numbers of amputees--soldiers who in earlier wars never \n     would have made it off the battlefield. Gonzalez, the doctor \n     at the 28th Combat Support Hospital, is not complaining about \n     the number of amputations. ``The survival rate has increased \n     significantly,'' he said. ``In the past, you'd see head and \n     chest and abdominal injuries. They would die even before they \n     got to me.''\n       Sgt.

The volume of \n     AK fire was unreal, from the roofs, in front of your, and \n     behind you.'' Two of 10 soldiers on the patrol were killed; \n     four were wounded. During the battle, Frisbee felt something \n     hit the back of his Kelvar vest but kept on fighting. When \n     the smoke finally cleared, he pulled out the back plate to \n     see what had happened and found a bullet hole. It has been, \n     as he had thought, just a matter of time. He had been hit--\n     and saved by boron carbide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 1992. A bill to amend the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, \nand Modernization Act of 2003 to eliminate privatization of the \nmedicare program, to improve the medicare prescription drug benefit, to \nrepeal health savings accounts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Bob Graham I am \nintroducing the ``Defense of Medicare and Real Prescription Drug \nBenefit Act.'' Congressman John Dingell is introducing companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The more senior citizens learn about the legislation President Bush \nhas just signed, the more concerned they are. It's a sweetheart deal \nfor big insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies and a raw deal \nfor senior citizens. It's not really a prescription drug bill. It's an \nanti-Medicare bill.\n  Our legislation will reverse these destructive policies. Our \nlegislation will protect and preserve Medicare--not turn senior \ncitizens over to the un-tender mercies of HMOs and insurance companies. \nIt will provide prescription drug benefit for senior citizens, without \ncoverage gaps or hidden loopholes. It will protect senior citizens with \ngood retirement coverage from a former employer, and it will protect \nthe poorest of the poor on Medicaid. It will reduce prescription drug \ncosts, by allowing safe importation of drugs from Canada and government \nnegotiations with drug companies for discounts. And it will repeal the \nprogram of Health Savings Accounts that help the healthy, wealthy and \ninsurance companies who have contributed heavily to the Republican \nParty, while harming every family that needs comprehensive, affordable \nhealth insurance.\n  The legislation the President signed is designed to destroy Medicare \nand turn senior citizens over to the un-tender mercies of HMOs. Our \nlegislation will protect Medicare.\n  The legislation the President signed provides a skimpy, inadequate, \nand unreliable drug benefit. Our legislation provides comprehensive \ndrug coverage and assures that senior citizens can get it everywhere in \nthe country without having to join an HMO or other private plan.\n  The legislation the President signed denies senior citizens the right \nto get safe drugs at lower prices from Canada and prohibits the \ngovernment from negotiating with drug companies to get a good deal for \nsenior citizens. This legislation eliminates those special interest, \nanti-senior provisions.\n  The legislation the President signed allows unfettered Heath Savings \nAccounts. These accounts are a bonanza for the healthy, the wealthy, \nand for favored insurance companies, but they are a disaster for \nordinary citizens who need comprehensive coverage and can't afford to \nput thousands of dollars aside to meet medical needs that insurance is \nsupposed to cover. This legislation repeals this unwise policy.\n  Senior citizens want prescription drug coverage under Medicare, and \nthey deserve it. Instead, the President and the Republican Party used \ntheir control of Congress to attack Medicare itself and force senior \ncitizens into HMOs and other private insurance plans. They want to \nprivatize Medicare, and if they get away with it, they'll try to \nprivatize Social Security too.\n  Their legislation raises Medicare payments to HMOs so that Medicare \ncan't compete. They use the elderly's own Medicare money to undermine \nthe Medicare program they depend on. According to estimates of the \nMedicare Actuary, Medicare already pays 16 percent too much for every \nsenior citizen\n\n[[Page S16128]]\n\nwho joins an HMO or other private insurance plan, because these \nprograms attract the healthiest elderly. IN addition, the Republican \nlegislation raises the base payment to 109 percent of what it costs \nMedicare to care for an average senior citizen, without even taking \ninto account the health selection bonus the HMOs receive. The total \noverpayment is 25 percent--a whopping $2,000 per senior citizen. And to \ntop it all off, the legislation establishes a $12 billion slush fund \nfor the new PPO program established by the bill. This isn't \ncompetition, its corporate welfare--and senior citizens and the \nMedicare program are the losers.\n  Their legislation also creates a vast social experiment--called the \n``premium support'' program--using millions of senior citizens as \nguinea pigs. The sole purpose of the experiment is to raise Medicare \npremiums so that senior citizens have to give up their Medicare and \njoin an HMO.\n  Our legislation eliminates these indefensible overpayments and \nrestores parity to the competition between conventional Medicare and \nprivate sector alternatives. It repeals the premium support program, so \nthat senior citizens will have choice, not coercion, when they decide \nwhether they prefer conventional Medicare or an HMO.\n  The assistance with prescription drug costs their program provides is \nactually very little. Overall, it covers less than 25 percent of the \ndrug expenses faced by the elderly. Senior citizens with $1,000 in drug \nexpenses would pay 86 percent of the cost out of their own pockets. \nThose with $5,000 in drug expenses would pay 78 percent. When senior \ncitizens' drug costs exceed $2,250, they get no benefits at all until \ntheir costs reach $5,100, even though they have to continue to pay \npremiums. And senior citizens won't necessarily have access to the \ndrugs their doctor's prescribe, if they aren't on the formularies of \nthe private insurance companies that will administer the benefit. A bus \nticket to Canada would do more to reduce drug costs for senior citizens \nthan this bill.\n  Our legislation fills the gaps in the Medicare benefit, so that it \ntruly meets the needs of the elderly and is comparable to the \nassistance provided under most private insurance plans and that is \navailable to every member of Congress. It assures that the formularies \noffered by the insurance companies administering the program are not \nmanipulated by the companies to exclude the drugs senior citizens need \nmost.\n  Nine million senior citizens--almost one of every four--will actually \nbe worse off in their drug coverage under the Bush program than they \nare today. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, \nalmost 3 million senior citizens with good retiree drug coverage \nthrough a former employer will lose it as the result of this bill. Six \nmillion senior citizens and the disabled who have both Medicare and \nMedicaid--the poorest of the poor--will actually pay more and have \nreduced access to the drugs they need. The Bush plan establishes a \ncruel and demeaning assets test, so that millions of senior citizens \nwith very low incomes are disqualified from the special assistance they \nneed, simply because they have managed to save a little bit for a rainy \nday, or because they have a car that's worth too much or a burial fund, \nor personal property like jewelry or furniture.\n\n  Our legislation addresses these problems. It ends the discriminatory \ntreatment of senior citizens with private retirement coverage, so that \nemployers do not have an incentive to drop this coverage. It restores \nbenefits to dual eligibles--senior citizens with coverage under both \nMedicare and Medicaid--so that they will not be made worse off by the \nnew program. It eliminates the assets test.\n  The Republican bill does nothing about escalating drug prices. \nRepublicans even had the nerve to include a specific prohibition on any \nrole by the Federal government in any negotiation on drug prices. The \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that drug prices will \nactually increase as the result of this bill. No wonder drug company \nstocks are soaring and senior citizens are concerned. Our legislation \nwill allow reimportation of drugs from Canada--where drug prices are \nmuch lower--with stringent controls to assure that any imported drugs \nmeet FDA standards. It will allow the Federal government to negotiate \nthe best possible price for prescription drugs, so that senior citizens \nand the Medicare program are no longer victimized by exorbitant prices \nthat have little relationship to costs or value.\n  It's not just seniors who are very concerned. Younger Americans will \nbe hurt too. A separate booby trap in the Republican program includes \ntax breaks for the healthy and wealthy to buy private policies with \nvery high deductibles that will undermine health insurance for those \nwho are not elderly. These tax breaks, called health savings accounts, \nencourage people to buy high deductible policies and put money aside in \na tax-free savings account. Because the healthy people don't contribute \nto the cost of regular insurance, premiums skyrocket for people who \ncan't afford thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs before their \ninsurance kicks in. The Urban Institute and the American Academy of \nActuaries have estimated that premiums for regular insurance policies \ncould increase 60 percent or more. Our bill repeals this unjustified \nand destructive policy.\n  The President's signing of the Republican legislation yesterday was \nthe beginning of this fight, not the end. We will never rest until we \nhave protected Medicare and provided senior citizens a prescription \ndrug benefit that truly meets their needs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the ``Defense of Medicare \nand Real Prescription Drug Benefit Act'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the Summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Summary: Provisions of the Defense of Medicare and Real Medicare \n                     Prescription Drug Benefit Act\n\n                      Title 1: Defense of Medicare\n\n  Repeals the premium support demonstration.\n  Requires risk adjustment between private sector plans and Medicare. \nMedicare will pay private sector plans an amount reflecting Medicare's \ncost for covering an individual, rather than paying HMOs a large markup \nas a result of failing to adjust for the better health of senior \ncitizens who join HMOs.\n  Repeals PPO slush fund.\n  Pays all private sector plans an amount equivalent to average \nMedicare costs, rather than paying an average of 109 percent of \nMedicare costs, as provided under the current legislation. Phased in \nover 5 years.\n  Repeals Medicare spending cap.\n\n   Title II: Establishment of Real Medicare Prescription Drug benefit\n\n  Elminates coverage gap in 2006-2008, beneficiaries will pay 75 \npercent coinsurance in the coverage gap. In 2009-2011, they will pay 50 \npercent. In 2012 and subsequent years, they will pay the same 25 \npercent copayment as under the initial coverage limit.\n  Eliminates discriminatory treatment of employer plans.\n  Allows Medicaid wrap-around for dual eligibles.\n  Eliminates assets test.\n  Requires two stand-alone prescription drug plans to avoid federal \nfallback.\n  Secretary defines classes and categories under any formula.\n  Repeals prohibition on Medigap coverage of prescription drugs. \nModifies current Medigap policies covering drugs to wrap-around new \nbenefit.\n  Phases out elimination of state ``clawback.''\n\n            Title III: Reduction in Prescription Drug Prices\n\n  Allows reimportation from Canada with certification and inspection of \nCanadian exporters to assure safety of drugs.\n  Repeals prohibition on government negotiating directly with drug \ncompanies for best prices and gives authority for such negotiations.\n\n               Title VI: Repeals Health Savings Accounts\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1993. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide a \nhighway safety improvement program that includes incentives ot States \nto enact primary safety belt laws; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n[[Page S16129]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with my \ndistinguished colleague from New York, Senator Clinton, the National \nHighway Safety Act of 2003. It would be our intention in the course of \nthe deliberations next year on the reauthorization or, as we call it, \nthe successive piece of legislation to TEA-21, that this bill, which we \nintroduce today, would be incorporated as an amendment.\n  As the Congress prepares to consider legislation next year to enact a \nnew 6-year surface transportation law to succeed TEA-21, our foremost \nresponsibility, in my judgment and in the judgment of many, and in the \njudgment of the President of the United States, must be to improve \nhighway safety for the driving public. Simply by increasing the number \nof Americans who will buckle up is the most effective step that can be \ntaken to save the their lives and the lives of others. That is the \nsingle most important step.\n  I am privileged to serve on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee that has now completed its markup of the TEA-21 \nreauthorization bill. The bill addresses, as it should, highway safety \nmeasures, such as how to build safer roads, how to do use new \ntechnologies to improve safety. But, statistics show that the greatest \nmeasure of safety, again, to drivers, passengers, and possibly third \nparties not connected with the vehicle, is through the use of a \nseatbelt. It is remarkable, the lives that have been saved through the \nuse of this simple device. I have, through my career in the Senate--I \nsay with modesty--been associated with, and indeed I think in the \nforefront of, trying to move forward on seatbelt legislation. I will \nnot belabor what this humble Senator has done working with others \nthrough the years, but we are very proud today that America has about a \n79 percent use rate of seatbelts. That has been translated into the \nsaving of tens of thousands of lives and injuries in automobile \naccidents.\n  Those are the facts. Are we just going to have a standstill, or are \nwe going to move forward? Senator Clinton and I think we should move \nforward with this somewhat new approach. I will address the technical \naspects as we go along.\n  We have debated the benefits of seatbelt use on many occasions in \nthis body, and elsewhere across America. And whether it is in the town \nforums we conduct, town meetings, or here on the floor of the Senate, \nthere is always that individual who comes back: Don't tell me what I \nhave to do. What does it matter to you, John Warner--or to any other \ncolleague with whom I am privileged to serve--what does it matter to \nyou whether I buckle up?\n  Well, let's take a look. No one disputes that the absence of a \nseatbelt causes more serious loss of life and injury and, to some \nextent, crashes. The statistics show that with the impact associated \nwith the crash, to the extent the driver can maintain, as best he can \ncontrol of the vehicle in those fatal microseconds, often fatal, \nperhaps the severity of the crash, and perhaps the loss of life can be \nreduced by the use of a safety belt--simply said.\n  Accidents involving unbelted drivers result in a significant cost to \nthe wallet, out of your pocket. Many people are rushed from the \naccident scene to various emergency facilities. All of that has the \ninitial cost of the law enforcement that responds, the rescue squads \nthat respond, and eventually the emergency room or whatever medical \nfacility you might have the good fortune to be taken to, to hopefully \nsave you your life. That isn't free. There is a cost. Maybe it is a \nhidden cost in the budgets of the towns and the communities and the \nStates, but there is definitely a cost. Regrettably, a number of \npersons who suffer those types of injuries are uninsured. Again, the \ncost often devolves down on the good old hard-working taxpayers; in \nmost instances, the taxpayers who buckle up.\n  This also is rather interesting and fascinating. When an accident \nhappens, regrettably, on our roads and highways across this great \nNation, we try to refrain from rubbernecking. Nevertheless, chances are \nthat we take a glance. More often than not, the accident with the \ncombined slowdown of those passing the accident causes significant \ncongestion for some considerable portion of time. Either the lane in \nwhich we are traveling moves very slowly because of the accident or, \nindeed, we come to a standstill, as often is the case when a lane is \nclosed to clear an accident. That standstill frequently is necessitated \nbecause of the severity of the injuries experienced in that accident. \nIt takes the response team longer in their carefully trained steps to \nextricate the injured person, to give the initial treatment, and then \nto carefully transport that individual, if necessary, to a medical \nfacility. That takes time. That road is backed up.\n  That is lost time for your mission on the road, be it for business, \nfamily, or pleasure. That is lost time and productivity. Behind you \noften are trucks and other vehicles involved in commerce. That is lost \ntime and delay due to the seriousness occasioned by injuries and \naccidents where there has been the lack of use of seatbelts. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  The legislation Senator Clinton and I are introducing today will take \nan important step forward for the States to adopt either a primary \nsafety belt law, or take steps of their own devising to meet a 90 \npercent seat belt use rate--not the Warner-Clinton bill or the \nlegislative measure put forth by the administration upon which Senator \nClinton and I draw for concepts of certain portions. The States can \ndecide for themselves how they achieve a 90-percent goal of the use of \nseatbelts in their respective States. That is the purpose of this \nlegislation--to move every State to a 90-percent use rate for safety \nbelts.\n  In a letter dated November 12, 2003, to Chairman Inhofe of the \nCommittee on the Environment and Public Works, on which I am privileged \nto serve, Secretary Mineta states:\n\n       President Bush and I believe that increasing safety belt \n     usage rates is the single most effective means to decrease \n     highway fatalities and injuries.\n\n  That is explicit and clear. The Secretary goes on to say:\n\n       The surest way for a State to increase safety belt usage is \n     through the passage of a primary safety belt law.\n\n  I have had this debate with Governors, former Governors, even in this \nChamber with former Governors. I think they would tell you that a \nprimary safety belt law is a tough piece of State legislation to pass \nsolely on its own. Frankly, it needs the impetus of Uncle Sam, the \nimpetus of the Congress of the United States to move that process in \nthe States forward, so the local politicians can shake their fist \nsaying, it is Washington that has done it again--more regulation, more \ndirection--you know the arguments. But I think quietly in the hearts of \nthose State legislatures is the thought that we will improve safety in \nmy State. We will improve the chance of survivability on the roads in \nmy State. So that is why we are here today. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text of Secretary Mineta's letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. As provided in our legislation, the Warner-Clinton bill, \nStates can increase seatbelt use either by enacting, as I said, a \nprimary seatbelt law--everybody knows what a primary seatbelt law is \nand how it works. It means a law enforcement officer can literally stop \na vehicle if they observe that the individual is not wearing his or her \nseatbelt. It is as simple as that. But a State, if they decide not to \nenact a primary safety belt law, can, by implementing their own \nstrategies, whatever they may be--and there is a lot of innovation out \nin the States--that would result in a 90-percent safety belt use rate. \nSo that is a challenge to the States.\n\n  The current national belt use, as I said, is 79 percent. But many \nStates--those that have the primary law are sometimes at 90, or even \nabove 90, but those that do not have the primary seatbelt law are down \nsometimes in the 60 percentile. It is the weight of the primary States \nthat carries the percentile and brings it up to 79 from those States \nthat don't have an effective law. States with their primary safety belt \nlaw have the greatest success for drivers wearing seatbelts.\n  On an average, States with the primary seatbelt law have a 10 to 15 \npercent higher seatbelt use compared to those with a secondary system. \nThis demonstrates that secondary seatbelt\n\n[[Page S16130]]\n\nlaws are far more limited in their effectiveness than a primary law.\n  Essentially, the secondary laws say that if a law enforcement officer \nhas cause other than a perceived or actual seatbelt violation--namely, \nthe driver didn't have it buckled--if they have cause to stop that car, \nfor example, for a speeding offense or a reckless driving offense or \nindeed an accident and they observed there has been no use of the \nseatbelt, then in the course of proceeding to enforce the several laws \nof the State as regards speeding or reckless driving, or whatever the \ncase may be, they can add a second penalty to address the absence of \nthe use of the seatbelt in that State.\n  Drivers are gamblers. They say: Oh, well, don't worry, I will not \nbuckle up. State law doesn't require it. Unless they stop me--and they \nare not going to stop me today. It is that gambling attitude that, more \noften than not, will cause an accident. Then it is too late.\n  So we come forward today to build on our national programs. We are \nbuilding on what we did in TEA-21. I was privileged to be on the \ncommittee. I was chairman of the subcommittee 6 years ago. I worked \nwith Senator Chafee, who was chairman of the full committee, and we \ndrove hard to make progress with the seatbelt laws, and we did it. We \nbasically put aside a very considerable sum of money to encourage \nStates--again, using their own devices--to increase uses. As a direct \nconsequence of what we did in TEA-21, there has been an 11 percent \nincrease in these 6 years in the use of seatbelts.\n  Sadly, traffic deaths in 2002 rose to the highest level in over a \ndecade. It is astonishing. Of the nearly 43,000 people killed on our \nhighways, over half were not wearing their seatbelts. That is according \nto the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. And 9,200 of \nthese deaths might have been prevented if the safety belt had been \nused.\n  Those are alarming statistics. Automobile crashes are the leading \ncause of death for Americans age 2 to 34. Stop to think of that: age 2, \nthat means a child; that means a parent neglected to buckle up a child. \nAutomobile crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans age 2 \nto 34. That is our Nation's youth. Do we have a higher calling in the \nCongress of the United States than to do everything we can to foster \nthe dreams and ambitions and the productivity of our Nation's youth? I \nthink not. And this is one of the ways.\n  Last year, 6 out of 10 children who died in car crashes did not have \nthe belt on--6 out of 10; that is over half. I plead with colleagues to \njoin with me, join with the President who has taken this initiative.\n  My primary responsibility in the Senate--and this is one of the \nreasons I got interested in this subject--is the welfare of the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces. I say to colleagues, again, the statistics \nare tragic. Traffic fatalities are the leading non-combat cause of \ndeath for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. They are in that \nhigh-risk age category, 18 to 35.\n  Someone even took a look at the statistics, the total of the \nfatalities last year, and said that represents in deaths approximately \nthe size of the average U.S. Army battalion. That is several companies \nand maybe a reinforced element. Just think, that is the magnitude in \none category of those who serve our United States, the men and women in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  I cannot think of any reason why we all cannot join behind this \neffort. That alone is a driving impetus for this Senator.\n  The time is long overdue for a national policy to strengthen seatbelt \nuse rates. I said a national policy, and that is what this bill \nrepresents, either through States enacting a primary seatbelt law or \ngiving far greater attention to public awareness programs that result \nin more drivers and passengers wearing safety belts. Our goal is 90 \npercent--90 percent.\n  I have been privileged to serve on this committee 17 years, and I, \ntogether with many others, notably my dear friend and late chairman, \nSenator Chafee, addressed this issue. Our committee is rich in the \nhistory of focusing revenue from the highway trust fund on effective \nsafety programs. It goes back through many chairmen and members of the \ncommittee.\n  With jurisdiction over the largest share of the highway trust fund, \nour committee has had the vision to tackle important national safety \nproblems. Regrettably, I report to you that the recent markup of the \ncommittee on the proposed successor to the TEA-21 legislation, which we \nwill take up next year, does provide more funding to help build safer \nroads--that is a step forward--but it does not have, in my judgment, \nthat provision which represents a step up from what we did in TEA-21, \nthat provision that would represent a recognition for the President's \ninitiative. He has taken a decidedly strong initiative to increase the \nuse of seatbelts. It is absent from the bill, and that is why, I say \nrespectfully to Chairman Inhofe and others on that committee, we need a \nprovision to strengthen and to move forward the position of the \nCongress on the issue of increased use of safety belts. That is the \npurpose of this legislation.\n  It is just unfortunate, but those with reckless intent quickly \ndisregard responsible behavior and drive unbelted at excessive speeds \nand many times with the use of alcohol. So no increased dollars for \nimproved road engineering, which is in this bill, can defy in many \ninstances and the type of personal conduct that results in reckless \nbehavior. It is as simple as that.\n  Our automobiles now come equipped with crash avoidance technologies \nand are more crashworthy than ever before, but these advances are only \npart of the solution.\n  In repeated testimony before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, from the administration, our States, safety groups, and the \nhighway insurance industry, we are told that three main causes of \ntraffic deaths and injuries are unbelted drivers, speed, and alcohol.\n  The formula we have devised in this legislation does have a reduction \nin the amount a State receives under this proposed bill that we will \nconsider next year when they fail to achieve the 90 percent safety belt \nuse rate. It is as simple as that. But the formula is patterned \ndirectly after the law that is on the books now with respect to the .08 \nlegal blood alcohol content level.\n  The net effect of this legislation is simply to recognize we are \nasking that the same type of sanction policy with regard to one of the \nthree major causes of death--alcohol--be equated to a second cause of \ndeath and injury, and that is absence of the use of seatbelts, bringing \ninto parallel two of the three principal causes of death and injury on \ntoday's highways.\n  The administration put forward an innovative safety belt program, as \nI said, under the leadership of the President that was a major \ncomponent of their new core transportation program, the Highway Safety \nImprovement Program. Regrettably, this recommendation is not included \nin the bill that will come before my committee next year as a \nconsequence of the markup seeking reauthorization of TEA-21.\n  The proposed reauthorization bill also does not include the current \nprogram, the Safety Belt Incentive Grant program, that we even had in \nthe previous highway bill, of which I was primarily one of the authors. \nNot only are we not going forward, but in a sense we are stepping \nbackwards. I just cannot understand how we can, as a body, not observe \nour responsibility to do what we can to provide the necessary incentive \nto the States to take these steps.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1993\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

James Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: With almost 43,000 people dying every \n     year on our nation's highway, it is imperative that we do \n     everything in our power to promote a safer transportation \n     system. The Bush Administration's proposal to reauthorize \n     surface transportation programs, the Safe, Accountable, \n     Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003 \n     (SAFETEA), offers several bold and innovative approaches to \n     address this crisis.\n       President Bush and I believe that increasing safety belt \n     usage rates is the single most effective means to decrease \n     highway fatalities and injuries. As a result, SAFETEA's new \n     core highway safety program provides States with powerful \n     funding incentives to increase the percentage of Americans \n     who buckle up every time they get in an automobile. Every \n     percentage point increase in the national safety belt usage \n     rate saves hundreds of lives and millions of dollars in lost \n     productivity.\n       Empirical evidence shows that the surest way for a State to \n     increase safety belt usage is through the passage of a \n     primary safety belt law. States with primary belt laws have \n     safety belt usage rates that are on average eight percentage \n     points higher than States with secondary laws. Recognizing \n     that States may have other innovative methods to achieve \n     higher rates of belt use, SAFETEA also rewards States that \n     achieve 90% safety belt usage rates even if a primary safety \n     belt law is not enacted. I urge you to consider these \n     approaches as your Committee marks up reauthorization \n     legislation.\n       While safety belts are obviously critical to reducing \n     highway fatalities, so too is a data\n\n[[Page S16133]]\n\n     driven approach to providing safety. Every State faces its \n     own unique safety challenges, and every State must be given \n     broad funding flexibility to solve those challenges. This is \n     a central theme of SAFETEA, which aims to provide States the \n     ability to use scarce resources to meet their own highest \n     priority needs. Such flexibility is essential for States to \n     maximize their resources, including the funds available under \n     a new core highway safety program.\n       I look forward to working with you on these critically \n     important safety issues as development of a surface \n     transportation reauthorization bill progresses.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Norman Y. Mineta.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first congratulate my colleague \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner, for the very fine statement he just made \na moment ago about the bill that he and Senator Clinton are introducing \nwith regard to the primary seatbelt law. This is something I have been \ninterested in for some time. I congratulate them for their very fine \nbill and Senator Warner's very fine statement. He is absolutely \ncorrect. If we are serious about saving lives on our highways in this \ncountry, there really is nothing more important that we can do than to \nget our fellow citizens to buckle up.\n  We have made great progress in this area, but the fact that many of \nour States do not have a primary seatbelt law on the books costs us \nthousands and thousands of lives each year. As my colleague from \nVirginia so eloquently stated in this Chamber a few minutes ago, all \nthe experts--everyone who knows anything about highway safety--will \ntell you that the most important thing that we could do and the easiest \nthing we could do would be to have every State of the Union tomorrow, \ninstantly, have a primary seatbelt safety law.\n  That simply means if law enforcement, instead of having to wait for \nanother type of violation before they could cite someone for not \nwearing a seatbelt could cite someone directly for not using a \nseatbelt, the use of seatbelts would dramatically increase in this \ncountry. That is what has happened in every single State that has had \nthese laws enacted. Seatbelt use dramatically goes up almost overnight.\n  We know there is an inverse relationship between the use of seatbelts \nand auto fatalities. Thousands and thousands of Americans' lives would \nbe saved every single year. I wanted to come to the floor this \nafternoon after I listened to my colleague's speech in my office. I \nwanted to thank him. He has been a real leader in the area of highway \nsafety and this is certainly one more example of his leadership.\n  When we take up the highway safety bill next year, there are a number \nof highway safety initiatives on which I have been working. I intend to \nbring them to the floor and talk about them and offer them as \namendments, offer them as initiatives. Frankly, there is nothing as \nimportant as what my colleague from Virginia has suggested.\n  I hope the Senate will take this very seriously. This is a great \nopportunity we will have to save thousands and thousands of lives every \nyear. So I salute my colleague from Virginia.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1994. A bill to amend part D of title XVIII of the Social security \nAct to strike the language that prohibits the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services from negotiating prices for prescription drugs furnished \nunder the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nthat will fix one of the fundamental flaws in the new Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. The ``Efficiency in Government Health Care \nSpending Act'' will remove language included in the new benefit that \nprohibits the Medicare program from negotiating prescription drug \nprices with manufacturers. The new Medicare prescription drug benefit \ndoes far too little to bring down the prices of prescription drugs. In \nfact, it actually takes away one of the best tools the Medicare program \ncould use in bringing down prescription drug prices by denying the \ngovernment the ability to negotiate price discounts on behalf of \nMedicare beneficiaries. My bill will allow the Federal Government to \ntake advantage of the purchasing power of the Medicare program \nMedicare, saving millions of taxpayers' dollars while reducing the \ncosts of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1994\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Efficiency in Government \n     Health Care Spending Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Prohibiting the Federal Government from negotiating \n     prescription drug prices with manufacturers fails to take \n     advantage of the purchasing power of the Medicare program.\n       (2) Negotiating prescription drug prices can reduce the \n     costs of prescription drugs for both the Medicare program and \n     taxpayers.\n       (3) A 2002 study by the inspector general of the Department \n     of Health and Human Services found that--\n       (A) both the Medicare program and the beneficiaries of the \n     Medicare program continually pay too much for medical \n     equipment and medical supplies; and\n       (B) if the Medicare program paid the same prices for 16 \n     health care supplies as the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     which directly negotiates prices with manufacturers, pays for \n     those supplies, the Federal Government could save \n     $958,000,000 each year.\n\n     SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF PROHIBITION OF NEGOTIATION OF PRICES.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Noninterference Provision.--\n       (1) In general.--Subsection (i) of section 1860D-11 of the \n     Social Security Act, as added by section 101 of the Medicare \n     Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of \n     2003, is repealed.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Subsection (j) of section 1860D-\n     11 of the Social Security Act, as added by section 101 of the \n     Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization \n     Act of 2003, is redesignated as subsection (i).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of section \n     101 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1995. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nthat will remove the multi-billion dollar ``stabilization fund'' from \nthe new Medicare prescription drug benefit. This stabilization fund is \nin essence a slush fund that gives billions of dollars to private \ninsurance companies. This is not an efficient use of taxpayers' \ndollars. In fact, it's not clear why it's even necessary. If private \nmanaged care plans are successful in bring costs down, as backers of \nthe new Medicare bill expect, and if seniors supposedly want to choose \nprivate plans, as backers of the new Medicare bill believe, then why \nshould American taxpayers pay private companies more money to get more \npeople to enroll in them?\n  We should not be subsidizing private health insurance companies in \nthe name of Medicare reform. It is fiscally irresponsible, in a time of \nrecord deficits, to use taxpayers' dollars as a giveaway to private \ninsurance companies. By removing this multi-billion slush fund, my bill \nwill save the American taxpayers billions of dollars. Many analysts \npredict that the new Medicare prescription drug benefit will surpass \nthe $400 billion budgeted for it. We need to look carefully at how we \nspend Medicare dollars, so that we can ensure that the program remains \nsolvent for future generations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n  There being no objectin, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1995\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF MA REGIONAL PLAN STABILIZATION FUND.\n\n       (a) Purpose of Section.--The purpose of this section is to \n     reduce the Federal budget deficit and to more efficiently use \n     taxpayer dollars in health care spending.\n       (b) Repeal of MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund.--Section \n     1858 of the Social Security Act, as added by section 221(c) \n     of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003, is amended--\n\n[[Page S16134]]\n\n       (1) by striking subsection (e);\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (f), (g), and (h) as \n     subsections (e), (f), and (g), respectively; and\n       (3) in subsection (e), as so redesignated, by striking \n     ``subject to subsection (e),''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1851(i)(2) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-21(i)(2)), as amended by \n     section 221(d)(5) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, \n     Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, is amended by \n     striking``1858(h)'' and inserting ``1858(g)''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n     Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization \n     Act of 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1996. A bill to enhance and provide to the Oglada Sioux Tribe and \nAngostura Irrigation Project certain benefits of the Pick-Sloan \nMissouri River basin program; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Oglala Sioux \nTribe Angostura Irrigation Project Rehabilitation and Development Act. \nI have worked with the leadership of the Oglala Sioux Tribe to develop \nthis legislation, which is intended to benefit the Lakota people by \nrestoring critical water resources and promoting economic development \non the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.\n  The Angostura Unit of the Bureau of Reclamation was first authorized \nby Congress under the Water Conservation and Utilization Act of 1939, \nand later continued under the Flood Control Act of 1944, otherwise \nknown as the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Project. The program \nconsisted primarily of building the six mainstem dams on the Missouri \nRiver, to be operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, along with \nseveral Bureau-operated irrigation and water development projects. The \nAngostura Unit was designed to provide irrigation to 12,218 acres of \nfarm and ranch land in the Angostura Irrigation District, as well as \nflood control, fish, and wildlife benefits.\n  Tribes in South Dakota existed long before the creation of the Bureau \nof Reclamation or the implementation of the water development projects \nin South Dakota today. Tribes therefore have a vested interest in the \noperation of these projects. While the projects have been helpful in \nmeeting their authorized goals, they also contribute to adverse \neconomic and environmental conditions on tribal reservations. In \nparticular, the Missouri River reservoirs managed by the Corps led to \nthe taking of thousands of acres of fertile river land from Indian \ntribes, and with that taking, the tribes lost valuable natural \nresources.\n  Federal agencies were directed through subsequent acts to provide for \nthe rehabilitation of the lost fish and wildlife habitat and to \ngenerally improve conditions on the reservations, but results were slow \nin coming, and often never materialized. Legislation was enacted \nseveral years ago to finally address some of these issues, but much \nmore remains to be done before South Dakota's tribes realize the \nbenefits that Bureau of Reclamation and Corps projects have provided \nother parts of the state.\n  In addition to the irrigation benefits the Angostura Unit provides to \nranchers and agricultural producers in the area, a substantial \nrecreation industry has developed around the reservoir, including \nboating and fishing. However, members of the Oglala Sioux on the Pine \nRidge Indian Reservation have not seen equal economic benefits from the \nAngostura Unit as those experienced from the recreation and irrigation \nin Fall River County. The Cheyenne River forms the northern boundary of \nthe reservation, which is just 20 miles downstream from the reservoir, \nand is an important natural resource for the tribe. The river is \nessential to the survival of riparian vegetation, traditional medicinal \nplants, fish, and wildlife habitat. The impoundment of water in the \nreservoir has curbed the Cheyenne River's natural flow, and water \nquality is reduced. This, coupled with the worst drought the region has \nseen in a decade, severely affects water resources on the reservation.\n  The Oglala Sioux Tribe's leadership has long had a desire to address \nthese problems, and this legislation is an important manifestation of \ntheir effort. During revision of the Angostura Unit's water management \nplan in 2002, the Bureau of Reclamation considered a variety of \nalternatives for future operations, but the tribe felt their concerns \nabout the economic and environmental effects the reservoir has on the \nreservation were not adequately addressed. One alternative considered \nby the Bureau of Reclamation during this review would return natural \nflows to the Cheyenne River, and would provide more water downstream \nfor the tribe and would improve reservation conditions. The Bureau took \na different approach, however--one that calls for improved irrigation \noperations and a more efficient distribution of water resources in the \nirrigation district. These improvements would help free up additional \nwater resources and hopefully lead to improved conditions on the \nCheyenne River that would benefit the tribe.\n  The Angostura Irrigation Project Rehabilitation and Development Act \nwould authorize the efficiency improvements proposed by the Bureau of \nReclamation, benefitting both existing water users and the tribe. The \nlegislation also would authorize the creation of a trust fund to \ncompensate the tribe for the economic impacts and lost natural \nresources caused by the operation of the Angostura Unit. This trust \nfund will be used by the tribe to promote economic development, improve \ninfrastructure, and enhance the education, health, and general welfare \nof the Oglala Lakota people. This dual track will both help ensure \ncontinued and efficient operation of the Angostura Unit and the \nAngostura Irrigation District, while helping to mitigate the problems \nfacing the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and providing the tribe with the natural \nand financial resources it needs to plan for the future and improve the \nquality of life for all tribal members.\n  This legislation is just one small, yet important, step toward \nensuring that U.S. natural resource policies are fair to American \nIndians, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1996\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reinstate the safeguard measures imposed on \nimports of certain steel products, as in effect on December 4, 2003; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week, the Bush administration--in what \nhas become its normal pattern--ignored the pleas of thousands of \nhardworking Americans. It lifted the steel tariffs it had promised the \nU.S. steel industry and imposed on foreign imports back in March of \n2002.\n  Despite its earlier pledge to stand by America's steelworkers, the \nWhite House, in typical fashion, decided to turn its back on our \nhighest valued workers and most vulnerable retirees. In a fit of pique \nand hard-hearted hubris, the White House decided to lift U.S. tariffs \non foreign steel imports 15\n\n[[Page S16136]]\n\nmonths ahead of time, instead of letting the tariffs stay in place \nuntil March 2005, as is permitted by U.S. law.\n  Why? Why would the White House betray America's steel industry--the \nbackbone of America's industrial base--particularly during this time of \nwar? Of national emergency? No. Because the President feared \nretaliation from America's trading partners, he quivered at the threat \nthat they would retaliate against U.S. exports if he did not lift the \n201 tariffs. He cowered in the face of exactly those nations whose \nsteel exports to the United States have driven 42 U.S. steel companies \nto their knees and into bankruptcy. His resolve collapsed in the face \nof retaliatory threats from America's most virulent competitors, whose \nillegal trade against the United States has already cost nearly 50,000 \nsteelworkers their jobs.\n  America's foreign trade opponents gambled that this President lacked \nthe resolve to stand up to them and to the WTO. Do you know? They were \nright. They were sadly correct.\n  But this President, George W. Bush, did not need to cave like a \n``weak willy'' in the face of belligerent foreign bullies. Instead, he \ncould have invoked Article XXI of the GATT, a viable trade tool that \nhas been legitimately and successfully employed by the United States in \nthe past to exempt itself from the GATT, now the WTO, in a time of war \nor national emergency. The President on July 31, 2003, formally \nproclaimed our Nation to be in a continued state of emergency. As a \nresult of the President's own misguided and ill-advised actions, we \nremain engaged militarily in Iraq.\n  On July 31, 2003, President Bush formally declared that, in \naccordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, he was \n``continuing for one year the national emergency with respect to \nIraq.'' We also continue to face an ongoing war against terrorism, both \nhere at home and abroad.\n  So, President Bush had--and has--ample authority to invoke a \nprovision of GATT 1994, negotiated by the United States and available \nto all WTO Members, that would permit him to exempt protections for the \nU.S. steel industry from retaliation by foreign countries.\n  But this President has so far lacked the foresight or the fortitude \nto take that step. Confronted with real threats of economic retaliation \nby determined competitors, the President folds like a house of cards \nastride the San Andreas fault.\n  That is why, today, I am introducing a bill that will do what the \nPresident refused to do. It will reinstate the 201 relief and reimpose \nthe 201 tariffs against foreign steel imports. Under my bill, the 201 \ntariffs will be put back in place to stop foreign import surges, just \nas they did before the President so ill-advisedly lifted the tariffs \nlast Thursday. And the tariffs will remain in place through March 5, \n2005.\n  This administration should not have been bullied into abandoning the \nU.S. steel industry. Our steel industry is key to the national economic \nsecurity of our Nation. Without steel, we cannot guarantee America's \nnational security. Without steel, we could not have rebuilt after \nSeptember 11. And I am not the only one who thinks that steel is \nintegral to America's economic and national security. Just a few days \nbefore that fateful September day, on August 26, 2001, President Bush \ntold America's steelworkers: ``If you're worried about the security of \nthe country and you become over reliant upon foreign sources of steel, \nit can easily affect the capacity of our military to be well supplied. \nSteel is an important jobs issue; it is also an important national \nsecurity issue.''\n  With an annual take deficit of almost $500 billion, Americans have a \nright to expect that international trade rules with work for them; not \nagainst them. They also have a right to know that the United States can \nrespond as it must to the type of trade crises that have been suffered \nby America's steel industry for years.\n  There was absolutely no reason to lift the steel 201 tariffs. They \nare fully consistent with both U.S. law and our international \nagreements--regardless of the view of the WTO. The purpose of 201 \nrelief is to give the domestic industry time to adjust to import \ncompetition. Our valiant steel industry is doing just that by pursuing \nunprecedented restructuring and new investment. Since the 201 tariffs \nwere imposed, flat-rolled steel producers alone have invested more than \n$3 billion to enhance their productivity.\n  Critics of the 201 relief have been proved wrong on every significant \nfact concerning that relief. They said that once the tariffs were \nimposed, steel prices would go through the roof. Yet, prices have risen \nonly modestly, and much less than abroad. The critics claimed that U.S. \nsteel companies would do nothing to improve their competitiveness. But \nour Nation is witnessing the most dramatic restructuring in the \nindustry's history. The critics also claimed that the tariffs would be \nbad for the U.S. economy, but the non-partisan U.S. International Trade \nCommission, ITC, recently found that the potential costs are \nminuscule--only about 2 percent of what Americans spend each month at \nMcDonald's--and not even a drop in the bucket compared to the value we \ngain by restoring a critical U.S. industry to long-term \ncompetitiveness.\n  Other nations' actions in this Section 201 dispute have been truly \ndisgraceful. The European Union originally threatened to retaliate \nagainst the United States immediately upon the President's application \nof the safeguard measures in March 2002. In the end, it hesitated. But \nits threat was sufficient to extort from the administration nearly \nunlimited exclusions from the tariffs to benefit foreign producers.\n  Acquiescing to this type of bullying jeopardizes the future of the \nU.S. steel industry, and it undermines the integrity of, and support \nfor, the entire international trading system. Americans cannot be \nexpected to support a system that works against them, rather than for \nthem.\n  By lifting the tariffs, the administration is allowing Brazil, the \nEuropean Union, Japan, and other nations, once again, to flood the U.S. \nmarket with imports. The Bush administration could have stood up for \nAmerica's steelworkers like those at Weirton, WV, and Wheeling-\nPittsburgh Steel in West Virginia, and demanded that other countries \nrespect the legitimate rights of the United States in the world trading \nsystem. But this administration chose to back down, to lose face, to \nsit back and watch, once more, while thousands of additional U.S. steel \njobs are destroyed by wave after wave of foreign imports.\n  The administration does not seem to care if the U.S. steel industry \nis destroyed at a time of war and in the midst of a national emergency. \nPresident Bush did not even care enough to personally inform the U.S. \nsteel industry, its workers, and their families of his decision to lift \nthe tariffs. No!! Instead, he sent a trade negotiator, Mr. Zoellick, to \ndo his dirty work. Ambassador Zoellick had the audacity to tell us that \nthe tariffs are ``no longer necessary.'' No longer necessary. And why \ndid he say that they are no longer necessary? They are no longer \nnecessary because, he said, ``these safeguard measures have achieved \ntheir purpose.''\n  The only purpose that I can see in this decision to shut the tariff \nprogram down is to succumb to threats and demands from abroad. The only \neffect will be the loss of more steel manufacturing jobs here at home.\n  On October 27, 2000, Mr. Dick Cheney--do you know him? He is now Vice \nPresident of the United States--just a few days before the elections he \ncame to Weirton, WV, to campaign for the Bush-Cheney ticket. During \nthat visit, Mr. Cheney forcefully pledged to help America's \nsteelworkers. He said, ``We will never lie to you. If our trading \npartners violate our trading laws, we will respond swiftly and \nfirmly.''\n  Promise made, promise broken. Unfortunately, like so many commitments \nthis administration has made, its pledge to help America's steel \nindustry got off to a headline-grabbing start, but has now been \ndiscarded, out of the glare of the campaign spotlight.\n  So now, only 3 years after Mr. Cheney's campaign-season vow of \nhonesty to America's steelworkers, this White House has taken an axe to \nthe 201 tariffs and betrayed the trust of thousands of American \nfamilies whose paychecks depend on the U.S. steel industry.\n  Mr. President, the Bush White House has absolutely failed the working \nfamilies across this country. This White House has traded the best \ninterests of the American people for the big special interests of \ncorporate campaign contributors. It is no surprise that the Bush \nAdministration would turn its back on steelworkers.\n\n[[Page S16137]]\n\n  When the Bush-Cheney ticket needed West Virginia's votes in 2000, it \npledged to help our steel industry. At first, it appeared as though the \nadministration would follow through on that promise. The White House \napplied the steel tariffs, for which West Virginia was thankful and for \nwhich I and other Senators congratulated, commended and thanked the \nadministration. But then the President exempted import after import \nfrom those tariffs. Now the President has eliminated the tariffs \ncompletely.\n  The Bush White House may have forgotten the promise made to the steel \nindustry in West Virginia, but thousands of West Virginians and other \nsteelworkers across the Nation will not forget. The recognize a fair-\nweather friend when they seen one.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1998. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to preserve \nthe essential air service program; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the bipartisan \nEssential Air Service Preservation Act of 2003. I am pleased to have my \ncolleague Senator Snowe as the principal cosponsor of the bill. Senator \nSnowe has been a long-time champion of commercial air service in rural \nareas, and I appreciate her continued leadership on this important \nlegislation. Senators Shumer, Leahy, Clinton, Ben Nelson, Lincoln, \nHagel, Jeffords, Domenici, and Harkin, are also cosponsors of the bill.\n  Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to \nensure that communities that had commercial air service before airline \nderegulation could continue to receive scheduled service. Without EAS, \nmany rural communities would have no commercial air service at all.\n  Our bill is very simple. It preserves Congress's intent in the \nEssential Air Service program by repealing a provision in the FAA \nreauthorization bill that would for the first time require communities \nto pay for their commercial air service.\n  Congress has already barred the Department of Transportation from \nimplementing any cost sharing requirements on Essential Air Service \ncommunities for one year. This bill would now make the ban permanent. I \nbelieve that implementing any mandatory cost sharing is the first step \nin the total elimination of scheduled air service for many rural \ncommunities.\n  It is indeed a sad commentary on this Congress that my colleagues and \nI have to introduce this bill at all. Time and again Congress has gone \non record opposing mandatory cost sharing for EAS communities, yet it \nkeeps coming back.\n  In June, during consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill, \nSenator Inhofe and I, with 13 bipartisan cosponsors, offered an \namendment that struck out a provision in that bill imposing mandatory \ncost sharing on some EAS communities.\n  I was pleased the full Senate agreed and voted to eliminate mandatory \ncost sharing from the FAA reauthorization bill. In parallel, the full \nHouse of Representatives adopted a similar amendment to the FAA bill. \nThus, the bills that were sent to conference required no cost sharing \nfor EAS communities.\n  Most students of government would tell you that when a majority of \nboth houses of Congress have voted against a particular measure, the \nconferees couldn't arbitrarily put it back in. Well, they did. In \nanother example of this Congress's secret back room dealing, the \nconferees excluded the minority members, flagrantly ignored the will of \nthe majority in the House and the Senate, and restored the very cost-\nsharing language both houses one month before had voted to reject. I \nbelieve adding this extraneous and objectionable provision was an \negregious violation of the conference process.\n  When cost sharing showed up in the FAA conference report, Congress, \nwith bipartisan support, stopped the Department of Transportation from \nimplementing the measure for one year by barring the use of 2004 \nappropriations for that purpose. The bill we are introducing today \npermanently repeals the mandatory cost-sharing requirements that the \nconferees reinserted into the FAA reauthorization bill after both the \nHouse and Senate had voted not to include them. I hope both houses of \nCongress will again do the right thing by passing our bill.\n  All across America, small communities face ever-increasing hurdles to \npromoting their economic growth and development. Today, many rural \nareas lack access to interstate or even four-lane highways, railroads \nor broadband telecommunications. Business development in rural areas \nfrequently hinges on the availability of scheduled air service. For \nsmall communities, commercial air service provides a critical link to \nthe national and international transportation system.\n  The Essential Air Service Program currently ensures commercial air \nservice to over 100 communities in 34 states. EAS supports an \nadditional 33 communities in Alaska. Because of increasing costs and \nthe current financial turndown in the aviation industry, particularly \namong commuter airlines, about 28 additional communities have been \nforced into the EAS program since the terrorist attacks in 2001.\n  In my State of New Mexico, five cities currently rely on EAS for \ntheir commercial air service. The communities are Clovis, Hobbs, \nCarlsbad, Alamogordo and my hometown of Silver City. In each case \ncommercial service is provided to Albuquerque, the State's business \ncenter and largest city.\n  I believe this ill-conceived proposal requiring cities to pay to \ncontinue to have commercial air service could not come at a worse time \nfor small communities already facing depressed economies and declining \ntax revenues.\n  As I understand it, the mandatory cost-sharing requirements in the \nFAA reauthorization bill could affect communities in as many as 22 \nstates. Based an analyses by my staff, the individual cities that may \nbe affected are as follows:\n\n       Alabama--Muscle Shoals; Arizona--Prescott, Kingman; \n     Arkansas--Hot Springs, Harrison, Jonesboro; Colorado--Pueblo; \n     Georgia--Athens; Iowa--Fort Dodge, Burlington; Kansas--\n     Salina; Kentucky--Owensboro; Maine--Augusta, Rockland; \n     Michigan--Iron Mt.; Mississippi--Laurel; Nebraska--Norfolk; \n     New Hampshire--Lebanon; New Mexico--Hobbs, Alamogordo, \n     Clovis; New York--Saranac Lake, Watertown, Jamestown, \n     Plattsburgh; Oklahoma--Ponca City, Enid; Pennsylvania--\n     Johnstown, Oil City, Bradford, Altoona; South Dakota--\n     Brookings, Watertown; Tennessee--Jackson; Texas--Victoria; \n     Vermont--Rutland; Washington--Moses Lake.\n\n  As I see it, the choice here is clear: If we do not preserve the \nEssential Air Service Program today, we could soon see the end of all \ncommercial air service in rural areas. The EAS program provides vital \nresources that help link rural communities to the national and global \naviation system. Our bill will preserve the essential air service \nprogram and help ensure affordable, reliable, and safe air service \nremains available in rural America. Congress is already on record \nopposing mandatory cost sharing. I hope all Senators will once again \njoin us in opposing this attack on rural America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1998\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Essential Air Service \n     Preservation Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF EAS LOCAL PARTICIPATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 417 of title 49, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking section 41747, and \n     such title shall be applied as if such section 41747 had not \n     been enacted.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The analysis for subchapter II \n     of chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking the item relating to section 41747.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Graham of Florida, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kohl, \n        Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n\n[[Page S16138]]\n\n  S. 1999. A bill to amend part D of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct, as added by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \nModernization Act of 2003, to provide for negotiation of fair prices \nfor medicare prescription drugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday, the President signed the \nMedicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. \nBut the name of that Act is completely misleading. In fact, the Act \nfundamentally damages the successful and popular Medicare program--a \nlong-term Republican goal. And this Act does more to ensure that drug \nprices remain high than it does to assist beneficiaries in paying for \ntheir drugs.\n  Why? Because drug companies want it that way. Republicans with \nfinancial ties to the industry are protecting drug company interests \nover the interests of seniors and people with disabilities.\n  America's seniors pay the highest drug prices in the world, even \nthough American taxpayers subsidize the research that produces many of \nthose drugs. The Medicare bill signed by the President squanders our \nchances of remedying that inequity. Not only does the bill effectively \nprohibit the reimportation of more affordable drugs from other \ncountries, it actually prohibits Medicare from using its tremendous \nbargaining power to ensure that beneficiaries pay lower prices and that \nour scant resources are most effectively used.\n  Today, Senate Democrats are siding with the seniors. We are \nintroducing legislation that would repeal the provision barring \nMedicare from negotiating for lower prices. The Medicare Prescription \nDrug Price Reduction Act would give Medicare the authority to negotiate \nwith drug companies to obtain the lowest possible prices for seniors \nand people with disabilities. House Democrats introduced a companion \nbill yesterday. Together, we will fight for the goal of giving Medicare \nbeneficiaries the drug benefit and lower prices they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 2003. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to promote \nhigher quality health care and better health by strengthening health \ninformation, information infrastructure, and the use of health \ninformation by providers and patients; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill that \nseeks to begin a dialogue on one of the most important yet neglected \naspects of our health care system--health care quality. this is an \nenormous issue that affects every single one of us who has ever needed \nmedical care, and it affects all taxpayers because quality care has \nsuch potential to avoid waste and save millions of dollars in health \ncare costs. I have raised many of these ideas as amendments in other \ncontexts, such as the Medicare debate on S. 1, and the debate over S. \n720, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2003. I intend \nto continue working with my colleagues on improving these ideas and \nproposing additional concepts. But with this bill today, I seek to put \nforward a package of ideas, provoke conversation, and present this as a \nfirst step in making quality a focus of my health care efforts next \nyear. My goal with these efforts is to both improve quality and \noutcomes, and reduce costs by encouraging care that is more effective.\n  There is no reason why we cannot achieve this. We have the most \nadvanced medical system in human history--the finest medical \ninstitutions, the newest treatments, the best trained health care \nprofessionals. But in spite of the best intentions of clinicians and \npatients, our health care system is plagued with underuse, overuse, and \nmisuse. currently, only about 50 percent of care that is known to be \neffective is provided, and the care given is supported by solid \nscientific evidence, and the pace of dissemination of new evidence is \npainfully slow. It may take up to 17 years for treatments found to be \neffective to become common practice.\n  Much of the overuse or misuse of health services stems from the \nfragmentation of our system. In a recent study in Santa Barbara, CA, 20 \npercent of lab tests and x-rays were conducted solely because previous \nresults were unavailable. One in seven hospitalizations occurs because \ninformation is unavailable, and a shocking percentage of the time, \nphysicians do not find patient information that had previously been \nrecorded in a paper-based medical record.\n  Despite all of our Nation's medical advances, health quality is \nbecoming even more endangered in some respects. Nursing care which is \noften shown to be a decisive factor for hospital patient outcomes, its \nin grave shortage, and a majority of U.S. physicians surveyed by the \nCommonwealth Fund perceive their ability to provide quality care as \nhaving worsened over the last 5 years.\n  Additionally, even as the quality of health care we purchase lags, \nour spending on inadequate and wasteful care is spiraling out of \ncontrol. Premiums increased 13 percent last year, and health care costs \nare increasing at nearly 10 times the rate of inflation. To make \nmatters worse, the public health system is straining to meet the \nchallenges of bioterrorism or emerging infections, the number of \nuninsured Americans is rising, clinicians are leaving practice, and the \nolder adult population is set to double by 2040.\n  The reason is not because doctors aren't trying hard enough, or \nhospitals are at fault. That we're able to get good health care at all \nis testament to the genius and heroism of doctors and nurses who \ndeliver care, despite all the obstacles, despite every effort of the \nsystem to hinder them.\n\n  But what our medical system requires of providers is a little like \nasking pilots to routinely land planes without any information from the \ncontrol tower. The best of them can do it--they could land a plane with \none arm around their backs missing key information and confirmations, \nbut why force them to do it? Why deny them critical information when it \ncould be easily available? There is no plausible reason for denying \nneeded information, especially when life and death are at stake.\n  That's unfortunately exactly what our health care system says to \ndoctors, nurses, and hospitals. Physicians for example spend four years \nin medical school, and then several years more in their residency \ntraining, cramming medical information into their heads. Then we expect \nthem to look at a patient taking four different drugs, with a heart \ncondition, and immediately remember any drug-drug interactions that \ncould occur. We ask them to do it without looking up any reference \nmaterials. We ask them to do it in the few minutes that they have with \neach patient given the ever-shorter visits, and ever-increasing patient \nand paperwork load. Moreover, in their free time, they are expected to \nkeep up with all the new journal articles and learn about every new \ndrug.\n  Yet hand-held computers can now allow the doctor to pull up up-to-\ndate information immediately, right at the bedside, if he or she has \nany question. And NIH spends billions of dollars in research to \ngenerate that information. Shouldn't that investment reap results for \nthe patient as quickly as possible? This bill seeks to provide the \ndirection that would support such technology and make it widely \navailable to physicians.\n  Right now, doctors, nurses, and hospitals are holding the health care \nsystem up, preventing utter collapse by sheer, heroic, force of will. \nInstead of the clinicians supporting the system, we should build a \nsystem that supports clinicians instead.\n  The premise of this legislation is that information, in the hands of \nthe right people at the right time, drives quality and value. We need \nto empower patients and health care providers to make the right \nchoices. And to do that, health care decisionsmakers--providers, \npayers, and patients--need to have access to the right information, \nwhere and when it is needed, securely and privately.\n  This legislation seeks to: 1. Generate information about health \nquality through increased research, increased public reporting along \nkey quality measures, and standardization of those measures to assure \ncomparability and usability of reported information; 2. Ensure that \npayers, providers and patients get information in a usable form so they \ncan make effective decisions; and 3. Reduce barriers to the development \nof an IT infrastructure that is so critical to achieving those first 2 \ngoals.\n  Eighty percent of the care delivered today is not backed by sound \nclinical\n\n[[Page S16139]]\n\nresearch. That is why we need to do more research, and see if the care \nwe provide today has sound justification in science. But even where we \nknow what to do, we don't always do it because the information is \ninsufficiently disseminated and utilized. Studies have shown some \nprocedures being performed even when they have not met accepted \ncriteria for appropriateness: In one study, of all the non-emergent, \nnoncancerous hysterectomies performed, only 30 percent had been \nproperly worked up and met the full medical criteria for necessity. In \nanother study, about one-fourth of coronary angiographies and upper \ngastrointestinal endoscopies did not meet standards of medical \nappropriateness.\n\n  On the flip side, in situations where the benefits of an intervention \nare clear, many patients do not receive the indicated care: Very few \nhospitalized patients at-risk for pneumococcal pneumonia who had not \nbeen previously vaccinated end up being vaccinated during their \nhospital stay. Routine peak flow measurements are conducted in only 28 \npercent of pediatric patients with asthma. And only one-half of \ndiabetics receive an annual eye exam.\n  We know what good health care means in these areas, but we don't \npractice it, in part because that information may not be readily \navailable, and regardless, there is no incentive for quality. We are \nsuggesting--track the outcomes, share that information with patients, \nproviders, and insurers, and ultimately, pay for performance.\n  This bill will help us become better purchasers of care, and help us \ntake the first steps toward aligning the incentives so that higher \nquality is rewarded. I ask unanimous consent that the attached article \nfrom last week's New York Times be printed in the Record showing how \nour current reimbursement system is gravely misaligned. Under the \ncurrent system, higher quality can be penalized, while worse care can \nironically be more profitable.\n  Today, by introducing these ideas for the purpose of seeking feedback \nfrom my colleagues and experts in the field, I am taking the first step \ntoward improving our health care system for everyone and saving money. \nI invite interested colleagues to join me in partnership on this \nimportant venture and look forward to taking strong, positive action \nnext year to improve health quality for all Americans.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 5, 2003]\n\n     Hospitals Say They're Penalized by Medicare for Improving Care\n\n                           (By Reed Abelson)\n\n       Salt Lake City.--By better educating doctors about the most \n     effective pneumonia treatments, Intermountain Health Care, a \n     network of 21 hospitals in Utah and Idaho, say it saves at \n     least 70 lives a year. By giving the right drugs at discharge \n     time to more people with congestive heart failure, \n     Intermountain saves another 300 lives annually and prevents \n     almost 600 additional hospital stays.\n       But under Medicare, none of these good deeds go unpunished.\n       Intermountain says its initiatives have cost it millions of \n     dollars in lost hospital admissions and lower Medicare \n     reimbursements. In the mid-90's, for example, it made an \n     average profit of 9 percent treating pneumonia patients; now, \n     delivering better care, it loses an average of several \n     hundred dollars on each case.\n       ``The health care system is perverse,'' said a frustrated \n     Dr. Brent C. James, who leads Intermountain's efforts to \n     improve quality. ``The payments are perverse. It pays us to \n     harm patients, and it punishes us when we don't.''\n       Intermountain's doctors and executives are in a swelling \n     vanguard of critics who say that Medicare's payment system is \n     fundamentally flawed.\n       Medicare, the nation's largest purchaser of health care, \n     pays hospitals and doctors a fixed sum to treat a specific \n     diagnosis or perform a given procedure, regardless of the \n     quality of care they provide. Those who work to improve care \n     are not paid extra, and poor care is frequently rewarded, \n     because it creates the need for more procedures and services.\n       The Medicare legislation that President Bush is expected to \n     sign on Monday calls for studies and a few pilot programs on \n     quality improvement, but experts say that it does little to \n     reverse financial disincentives to improving care.\n       ``Right now, Medicare's payment system is at best neutral \n     and, in some cases, negative, in terms of quality--we think \n     that is an untenable situation,'' said Glenn M. Hackbarth, \n     the chairman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an \n     independent panel of economists, health care executives and \n     doctors that advises Congress on such issues as access to \n     care, quality and what to pay health care providers.\n       In a letter published in the current edition of Health \n     Affairs, a scholarly journal, more than a dozen health care \n     experts, including several former top Medicare officials, \n     urged the program to take the lead in overhauling payment \n     systems so that they reward good care.\n       ``Despite a few initial successes, the inertia of the \n     health system could easily overwhelm nascent efforts to raise \n     average performance levels out of mediocrity,'' they wrote. \n     ``Decisive change will occur only when Medicare, with the \n     full support of the administration and Congress, creates \n     financial incentives that promote pursuit of improved \n     quality.''\n       Medicare's top official is quick to agree that the payment \n     system needs to be fixed. ``It's one of the fundamental \n     problems Medicare faces,'' said Thomas A. Scully, who as the \n     administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services has encouraged better care by such steps as \n     publicizing data about the quality of nursing home and home-\n     health care and by experimenting with programs to reward \n     hospitals for their efforts.\n       But the steps taken so far have been small, and many \n     experts say that rather than paying for more studies, \n     Congress should start making significant changes to the way \n     doctors and hospitals are paid.\n       ``They're splashing at the shallow end of the pool,'' said \n     Dr. Arnold Milstein, a consultant for Mercer Human Resource \n     Consulting and the medical director for the Pacific Business \n     Group on Health, an association of large California \n     employers. He would like to see as much as 20 percent of what \n     Medicare pays doctors and hospitals linked to the quality of \n     the care they provide and their efficiency in delivering \n     treatment.\n       Two decades ago, Medicare led a revolution in health care. \n     By setting fixed payments for various kinds of treatment--a \n     coronary bypass surgery or curing a pneumonia or replacing a \n     hip--rather than simply reimbursing doctors and hospitals for \n     whatever it cost to deliver the care, it encouraged shorter \n     hospital stays and less-expensive treatments.\n       But today, many health care executives say, Medicare's \n     payment system hinders attempts to improve care. Dr. James, \n     the Intermountain executive, said that he wrestled with the \n     situation every day.\n       By making sure its doctors prescribe the most effective \n     antibiotic for pneumonia patients, for example, and thereby \n     avoiding complications, Intermountain forgoes roughly $1 \n     million a year in Medicare payments, he estimated. When a \n     pneumonia patient deteriorates so badly that the patient \n     needs a ventilator, Intermountain collects about $19,000, \n     compared with $5,000 for a typical pneumonia case. And while \n     it makes money treating the sicker patient, Dr. James said, \n     it loses money caring for the healthier one.\n       Nor is Intermountain rewarded for sparing someone a stay in \n     the hospital--and for sparing Medicare the bill. Shirley \n     Monson, 74, of Ephraim, Utah, said that she expected to be \n     hospitalized when she developed pneumonia last year. \n     Instead, Sanpete Valley Hospital, part of Intermountain, \n     sent Mrs. Monson home with antibiotics, and she recovered \n     over the next two weeks. Such visits produce just token \n     payments for hospitals.\n       In addition to losing revenue each time it avoids an \n     unnecessary hospital stay, Intermountain is penalized for \n     treating only the sickest patients, Dr. James said. \n     Medicare's payments for pneumonia are based on a rough \n     estimate of the cost of an average case and assume a hospital \n     will see a range of patients, some less sick--and therefore \n     less expensive to treat--than others. But because \n     Intermountain now admits only the sickest patients, its \n     reimbursements fall short of its costs, Dr. James said, \n     resulting in an average loss this year of a few hundred \n     dollars a case.\n       Similarly, averting hospital stays for congestive heart \n     patients by prescribing the right medicines costs \n     Intermountain nearly $4 million a year in potential revenues, \n     according to Dr. James. And every adverse drug reaction \n     Intermountain avoids deprives it of the revenue from treating \n     the case.\n       ``We are really rewarded for episodic care and maximizing \n     the care delivered in each episode,'' said Dr. Charles W. \n     Sorenson Jr., Intermountain's chief operating officer.\n       Like the visit majority of the nation's hospitals, \n     Intermountain is a nonprofit organization, and executives \n     here say financial penalties do not damp their desire to \n     provide the highest quality care, which they see as their \n     central mission. But Intermountain, which operates health \n     plans and outpatient clinics in addition to its hospitals, \n     says it beds to keep hospital beds filled and make money \n     where it can to subsidize unprofitable services and pay for \n     charity care.\n       Outside of Medicare, Intermountain often benefits from its \n     quality initiatives, executives said, because it gets to \n     pocket much of the savings they produce. For example, \n     Intermountain has generated about $2 million annually in \n     savings by reducing the number of deliveries that women \n     choose to induce before 39 weeks of pregnancy--and thereby \n     reducing the risk of complications to the mother or baby. \n     According to Dr. James, almost all that money has been spent \n     on other kinds of care.\n       Hospital executives elsewhere say that they, too, have come \n     up against the cold reality of the Medicare payment system. \n     Partners HealthCare, the Boston system that includes \n     Massachusetts General and Brigham\n\n[[Page S16140]]\n\n     and Women's Hospitals, has taken steps to reduce the number \n     of unnecessary diagnostic tests it conducts at outpatient \n     radiology centers, though executives know that smarter care \n     will cut into their revenues.\n       ``That's where you're smack up against the perverseness of \n     the system,'' said Dr. James J. Mongan, chief executive of \n     Partners.\n       Medicare's payment policies have stymied efforts in the \n     private sector to improve care, as well.\n       For example, the Leapfrog Group, a national organization of \n     large employers concerned about health issues, has tried to \n     encourage more hospitals to employ intensivists--specialists \n     who oversee the care provided in intensive-care units. Though \n     studies show that such doctors significantly improve care, \n     Medicare does not pay for them, and employers and insurers \n     are having difficulty persuading some hospitals to take on \n     the added expense.\n       ``It's going to be very hard to compete with the incentives \n     and disincentives in Medicare,'' said Suzanne Delbanco, the \n     group's executive director.\n       Others argue that hospitals and doctors should not be paid \n     extra for doing what they should be doing in the first place.\n       Helen Darling, the executive director of the National \n     Business Group on Health, a national employer group, said \n     Medicare instead should take a firmer stance in demanding \n     quality. The program had a significant effect, she noted, \n     when it said that only hospitals meeting a minimum set of \n     standards could be reimbursed by Medicare for heart \n     transplants.\n       ``The payment system drove quality,'' Ms. Darling said.\n       Medicare itself is taking some other tentative steps, \n     including an experiment that pays certain hospitals an extra \n     2 percent for delivering the highest-quality care, as \n     measured, for example, by administering antibiotics to \n     pneumonia patients quickly and giving heart attack patients \n     aspirin. But some hospital industry executives question \n     whether that is enough money to offset the costs of improving \n     care.\n       ``It can only be a motivator if you really have an \n     incentive,'' said Carmela Coyle, an executive with the \n     American Hospital Association, who noted that hospitals on \n     average are paid only 98 cents for each dollar of Medicare \n     services they provide.\n       Mr. Scully, the Medicare administrator, defends the \n     experiment, saying that the agency's goal is to determine if \n     it is using the right measures to reward quality. ``If this \n     works, we'll do a bigger demonstration,'' he said.\n       But many policy analysts and employer groups want Medicare \n     to do more. ``Today, Medicare needs to step out front,'' said \n     Peter V. Lee, chief executive of the Pacific Business Group \n     on Health, who argues that how hospitals and doctors are paid \n     is a critical component of motivating them to improve care. \n     ``There needs to be money at play.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16140-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 279--RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF \nSPORTSMEN TO AMERICAN SOCIETY, SUPPORTING THE TRADITIONS AND VALUES OF \n SPORTSMEN, AND RECOGNIZING THE MANY ECONOMIC BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH \n                      OUTDOOR SPORTING ACTIVITIES\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S.

The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \ncertainly will not--I just wish to indicate to the majority leader how \npleased I am that at long last we have been able to get to this point. \nThis has been a very difficult negotiation involving many Members. I \nthink it is very important that we ultimately accomplish the passage of \nthis legislation. This obviously does not bring us to a point where we \nwill finalize the bill, but I think it sets us up in a way that will \nallow the completion of our work shortly after we return. That is the \nmessage we need to send on a bipartisan basis, and I appreciate the \nmajority leader's leadership in getting us to this point. I will work \nwith him as we coordinate the amendment time and debate, but I hope we \ncan do this soon after we return. I expect we will complete our work at \nsome point shortly after that. I thank him, and I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in the weeks leading up to the Thanksgiving \nholiday, and in the time since then, we have been trying to reach an \nagreement with respect to pension funding rules. As many of my \ncolleagues are aware, the temporary pension discount rate relief we \nenacted in 2001 expires at the end of this year. There is virtually \nunanimous agreement that we need to replace the outdated 30 year \ntreasury bill rate with a long-term corporate bond rate. However, \nabsent some action by the House and the Senate, the statutory rate that \npension plans must use to calculate their assets and liabilities will \nsnap-back to the old 30-year rate. This will result in companies with \npension plans having to assume that they will be making large \ncontributions to their plans in the year to come.\n  Equally important, in my view, has been an effort to provide relief \nfrom the deficit reduction contribution, DRC, requirements that certain \nplans are now facing. Under the current pension funding rules, \ncompanies that offer defined benefit pension plans are required to make \nadditional contributions to those plans when they are less than 90 \npercent funded. A pension plan's funding level is determined by \ncomparing the plan's current assets to its promised benefits and then \ncalculating whether the two will match up by the time the benefits \npromised are due.\n  The recent drop in the stock market, low interest rates, and generous \npension benefits agreed to in better times have caused many defined \nbenefit pension plans to fall well beneath this 90 percent threshold. \nAs a result, many companies are being required to make substantial \nadditional contributions at the time they can least afford them. The \nFinance Committee-reported bill, which I support, included 3 years of \nDRC relief.\n  Despite our best efforts, it is clear that we will not be able to \nreach an agreement before the end of the year. We have, however, \nentered into a unanimous consent agreement that gives us a plan for \naddressing this issue when we return early next year. It is my belief \nthat this issue can be wrapped up with one or two days of debate and \nthat a conference agreement should follow shortly thereafter.\n  Replacing the current 30-year Treasury rate with a long-term \ncorporate bond rate is a critically important issue, not only to the \ncompanies themselves but their employees as well. Equally important, \nhowever, is the broader pension bill upon which Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus have worked so hard. Resolution of this more immediate \nissue is but a precursor to consideration of the larger pension reform \nbill. And even this is but a prelude to an effort to take a broader \nlook at our nation's pension funding rules with an eye toward making \nmore systematic reforms. I look forward to a spirited debate next year \nas we take the first step in this broader undertaking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16150-3", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16150-S16151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I stand today in strong support of D. \nMichael Fisher, who has been nominated to serve for the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit. Let me speak briefly about his \nbackground and the reasons I endorse his confirmation.\n  Attorney General Fisher has extensive legislative experience, having \nserved for 22 years in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. He has also \npracticed in civil litigation for close to 20 years. Parenthetically, I \nwould note my understanding that Attorney General Fisher's first law \noffice was across the hall from my law office in Pittsburgh--the 9th \nfloor of the Frick Building--in 1970. Since 1997, Attorney General \nFisher has served as Pennsylvania Attorney General and he has been a \ngreat leader. He coauthored Pennsylvania's Megan's Law; he supported \nthe passage of a State DNA postconviction statute; and he helped \nnegotiate the landmark national tobacco settlement.\n  Attorney General Fisher's nomination is widely supported. His \nendorsers include Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell, the \nbipartisan 19-member Pennsylvania delegation to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Pennsylvania State legislators, the Pennsylvania \nDistrict Attorneys Association, and the Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers \nAssociation. He is also fully endorsed by serving attorneys general \nfrom across the country. The former attorney general of Tennessee, \nCharles W. Burson, who also served as legal counsel for former Vice \nPresident Gore, has written in support of Attorney General Fisher's \nnomination: ``While [Attorney General Fisher] and I may differ on \nparticular issues, I am certain that as a Federal Appellate Judge, he \nwill deliberately, and with an even hand, apply the law to the facts \nand render sound judgments.''\n  I cannot recall seeing such a range of support for a judicial nominee \nas Attorney General Fisher enjoys. It is truly impressive and speaks \nwell of him.\n  I will support Attorney General Fisher's confirmation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am troubled today that the Senate is \nproceeding to a vote on the nomination of D. Michael Fisher to a \nlifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit, when there is an open verdict against him in a Federal civil \nrights case. While Mr. Fisher has considerable bipartisan support, it \nis unfortunate that the committee vote, and now the Senate vote, on his \nnomination could not have at least waited for the district court judge \nin the pending civil rights case to rule on Mr. Fisher's motion \nchallenging the jury verdict against him.\n  Over the course of this year in the Judiciary Committee, we have seen \na number of firsts. At the first nominations hearing of the year, for \nthe first time ever, Republicans unilaterally scheduled three \ncontroversial circuit court nominees at one hearing contrary to a long-\nestablished agreement and practices of the committee. Then we saw \nRepublicans declare that the longstanding committee rules protecting \nthe rights of the minority would be broken when Rule IV was violated. A \nrule that was adopted 25 years ago--in order to balance the need to \nprotect the minority members of the committee with the desire of the \nmajority to proceed--was unilaterally reinterpreted to override the \nrights of the minority for the first time in our history. For the first \ntime ever, this year, Republicans insisted on proceeding on nominations \nthat the committee had previously voted upon and rejected after full \nand fair hearings and debate. Of course that followed the first ever \nresubmission by a President of the names of defeated nominees for \nappointment to those same judgeships.\n  Several other practices were reversed from when a Democratic \nPresident was making nominations in light of the Republican affiliation \nof the current President. This committee has proceeded on nominations \nthat did not have the approval of both home-State Senators. Moreover, \nthis committee altered its prior practice and overrode the objections \nof home-State Senators to vote on the nominations of Carolyn Kuhl in \nspite of the opposition of both home-State Senators. Then, in \nconnection with a nomination to the circuit court from Michigan, this \ncommittee for the first time proceeded with a hearing in spite of the \nopposition of both home-State Senators.\n  The hearing on the nomination of Michael Fisher to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit was also unprecedented. Never before to \nmy knowledge has a President nominated to a lifetime position on a \nFederal circuit court or this committee held a hearing on a judicial \nnominee with an outstanding jury verdict naming him as personally \nliable for civil rights violations. In February 2003, a Federal jury in \nthe U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania found \nthat Mr. Fisher and other high level officials of the Pennsylvania \nOffice of the Attorney General violated the civil rights of two \nplaintiffs, former narcotics agents with the Bureau of Narcotics \nInvestigation, BNI, in Philadelphia. Never before in the history of \nFederal judicial nominees of which I am aware, has a nominee ever come \nbefore this committee with an outstanding judgment against him for so \nserious a claim.\n  The jury verdict is so recent that the trial transcript was only \ndelivered to the parties within the last several weeks, and so complex \nthat even Mr. Fisher and his lawyers asked for extensions of time in \norder to complete their post-trial motions. Just 6 weeks ago, Mr. \nFisher and the other defendants filed their brief in support of their \nmotion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial. Soon, the \nFederal district court trial judge will review the verdict against Mr. \nFisher and make a decision on Mr. Fisher's motion. If the jury verdict \nis sustained by the district court judge, an appeal would lie to the \nvery court to which Mr. Fisher has been nominated. Mr. Fisher has \nindicated that he intends to pursue all appellate options if the \nverdict is not reversed. These, too, appear to be unique circumstances.\n  Accordingly, this is a most unusual vote today. As the administration \nand Republican majority have abandoned traditional practices and \nstandards, we are being confronted with more and more difficulties. The \nfew judicial nominations on which the Senate has withheld a final vote \nthis year have each presented extraordinary circumstances or nominees \nwith extreme positions. During the years in which President Clinton was \nin the White House, Republicans attempted a number of filibusters and, \nwhen they were in the majority, successfully prevented votes on more \nthan 60 judicial nominees, including a number of nominees to the \nFederal courts in Pennsylvania.\n  At Mr. Fisher's hearing, I indicated that I had not yet reached a \ndetermination about his nomination but was troubled by the jury \nverdict. I have now reviewed the trial transcript and materials from \nthe civil rights case. Mr. Fisher has been found liable by a jury for \nviolating the constitutional rights of his employees. Mr. Fisher \ntestified at trial that he had knowledge of and approved of the actions \nfound by the jury to be retaliatory. The jury found that he acted \nmaliciously or wantonly and awarded the plaintiffs punitive damages. We \nshould all be concerned about his ability to protect the constitutional \nrights of plaintiffs who may enter his courtroom. The trial court \njudgment is a significant piece of information in order for us to\n\n[[Page S16153]]\n\nevaluate Mr. Fisher's qualifications to a lifetime appointment on the \nfederal bench. In all due respect to my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, I do not think that the courts or the American people gain \nby rushing the nomination through.\n  In addition to the pending civil rights judgment against him, I am \nconcerned about other aspects of Mr. Fisher's record. He authored \nPennsylvania's death penalty legislation as a State representative and \nhas opposed placing a moratorium on the death penalty in Pennsylvania. \nHe reiterated at his hearing and in response to my written questions \nthat he does not believe that there is racial discrimination in the \napplication of the death penalty in Pennsylvania or that innocent \npeople are being sentenced in capital cases, despite repeated evidence \nto the contrary. I would like to take this opportunity to urge Mr. \nFisher to take seriously the imposition of the death penalty and to do \nwhat he can to ensure that the death penalty is applied fairly.\n  Mr. Fisher has also indicated his opposition to gay rights and has \nadvocated against benefits for same-sex partners. Mr. Fisher, however, \nhas assured the committee that he would follow Supreme Court precedent \nrecognizing that gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to be \nfree from government intrusion into their private lives. I am hopeful \nthat Mr. Fisher will be a person of his word: that he will follow the \nlaw and not seek out opportunities to overturn precedent or decide \ncases in accord with his private beliefs rather than his obligations as \na judge. I also sincerely hope that Mr. Fisher will treat all those who \nappear before him with respect, and will not abuse the power and trust \nof his position.\n  The Senate has already confirmed two of President Bush's nominees to \nthe Third Circuit, including one controversial circuit court nominee \nfrom Pennsylvania who had broken his promise to the committee about his \nmembership in a discriminatory club. Yet, with Democratic support, the \nSenate has already confirmed 13 Federal district court nominees from \nPennsylvania and 19 district court nominees in the Third Circuit.\n  A look at the Federal judiciary in Pennsylvania indicates that \nPresident Bush's nominees have been treated fairly and far better than \nPresident Clinton's. This treatment is in sharp contrast to the way \nvacancies in Pennsylvania were kept vacant during Republican control of \nthe Senate when President Clinton was in the White House.\n  Despite the best efforts and diligence of the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure the confirmation of all of the \njudicial nominees from every part of his home state, there were 10 \nnominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies who never got a \nvote: Patrick Toole, John Bingler, Robert Freedberg, Lynette Norton, \nLegrome Davis, David Fineman, David Cercone, Harry Litman, Stephen \nLieberman, and Robert Cindrich to the Third Circuit. Despite how well-\nqualified these nominees were, they were never considered by the \nSenate, many waited more than a year for action.\n  Just last month, the Senate voted to confirm another nominee from \nPennsylvania whose record raised serious concerns the nomination of \nThomas Hardiman to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nPennsylvania. That nominee came to us with no judicial experience, a \nrelatively small amount of litigation experience and very low peer-\nreview ratings by both the American Bar Association and the local \nAllegheny County Bar Association. Far too many of this President's \njudicial nominees seem to have similarly troubling records. In fact, 26 \nof this President's judicial nominees have earned partial or majority \n``Not Qualified'' ratings from the ABA. Certainly, the citizens of \nPennsylvania deserve a well-qualified judiciary to hear their important \nlegal claims in federal court.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Fisher's record--particularly the outstanding \nFederal civil rights verdict against him--raises concerns, just as the \nrecord of far too many of President Bush's judicial nominees. Yet, I \nhave great respect for the senior Senator from Pennsylvania and \nappreciate his efforts to help shepherd the White House's nomination \nthrough the Senate. I have also heard from a number of other supporters \nof Mr. Fisher whose opinions I value that they believe him qualified to \nserve as a judge of the Third Circuit. He does have significant \nexperience as an attorney, formerly serving as an Assistant District \nAttorney, as an attorney in private practice for over 27 years, and in \nthe Pennsylvania General Assembly for 22 years. We are, again, treating \nthis President's judicial nominees far more fairly than Republicans \ntreated President Clinton's judicial nominees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16153-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16153-S16154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JAMES B. COMEY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today \nconfirmed James B. Comey as the Deputy Attorney General. James Comey \nbrings a wealth of experience and perspective as a line prosecutor, as \na manager in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of \nVirginia, and most recently as the U.S. attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. His record demonstrates that he is a leader, one \nwho can inspire others to accomplish great things, and one who can \noversee and manage an organization such as the Justice Department.\n  With the recent departure of Larry Thompson, who was a fine Deputy \nAttorney General, I am sure everyone shares my view that Mr. Comey has \nvery big shoes to fill. However, I am confident that he is the right \nperson for the job. His impressive background and past government \nservice make me confident that he will be a great asset to the \nDepartment of Justice, the Judiciary Committee, and the American \npeople.\n  The importance of the Deputy Attorney General within the Justice \nDepartment cannot be overstated. Over the years, the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral's Office has played a greater role in overseeing the \nDepartment's operations, implementing new policy initiatives, and \nensuring the effective enforcement of our criminal and civil laws.\n  A review of Mr. Comey's record establishes one simple fact--he is \nwell qualified to serve as the Deputy Attorney General. Since January \n2002, Mr. Comey has served as the U.S. attorney in the Southern \nDistrict of New York, an office that many consider to be the premier \nU.S. Attorney's Office in the country. In the Southern District of New \nYork, Mr. Comey has earned the respect of judges, defense counsel, and \nprosecutors for his professionalism, fairness and judgment. While \nserving as the U.S. attorney, Mr. Comey was responsible for leading his \noffice in some of the more significant terrorism and white collar \nprosecutions.\n  Prior to assuming the position as the U.S. attorney, Mr. Comey served \nfrom 1996 to 2001, as managing assistant U.S. attorney, in charge of \nthe Richmond Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia. From 1993 to 1996, Mr. Comey was an associate and \nlater a partner at the law firm of McGuire Woods in Richmond, VA. Early \nin his career, from 1987 to 1993, Mr. Comey served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the Southern District of New York.\n  As a Federal prosecutor, Mr. Comey investigated and prosecuted a wide \nvariety of cases, including firearms, narcotics, major frauds, violent \ncrime, public corruption, terrorism, and organized crime. In the \nEastern District of Virginia, he handled the Khobar Towers terrorist \nbombing case, arising out of the June 1996 attack of a U.S. military \nfacility in Saudi Arabia in which 19 airmen were killed.\n  Mr. Comey was educated at William & Mary, B.S. with honors 1982, \nchemistry and religion majors, and the University of Chicago Law \nSchool, J.D. 1985. After law school, he clerked for then-U.S. District \nJudge John Walker in Manhattan.\n  Let me take one moment to highlight perhaps Mr. Comey's most \nimportant accomplishment. While serving his country in a variety of \nprosecutorial positions, he has demonstrated that he is a dedicated \nfamily man. He and his lovely wife, Patrice, are raising five wonderful \nchildren, ranging in age from 15 to as young as 3 years old.\n  Mr. Comey is a dedicated public servant, and a talented and well-\nrespected prosecutor. He is uniquely qualified to lead as the Deputy \nAttorney General of the Justice Department.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we have been able \nto\n\n[[Page S16154]]\n\nmake what I consider real progress on the Executive Calendar. There is \nstill work to be done, but I think this represents a very important \ncompromise in the effort to try to find the bipartisan balance in these \nnominations that is key to success, regardless of the session or \nregardless of the Congress itself.\n  There are still many Democrats whose nominations are languishing \neither in the White House or in committee. It is troubling that we have \nhad the difficulty, in many cases, that has precluded greater progress \non those and other nominations over the course of the last several \nmonths. I hope, as we begin the second session of the Congress, we can \nexpedite many of these nominees. I certainly will redouble our efforts \nto work with the White House and to accommodate whatever concerns they \nmay have with regard to some nominations, and certainly with regard to \ntheir own list of nominees who ought to be considered in an expeditious \nway. So we will continue to work.\n  I hope the White House in particular recognizes the importance of \nreciprocity and the fact that the nominations must be a two-way street. \nDemocratic and Republican nominations deserve expeditious \nconsideration, and it would be a real opportunity to set that tone and \nto send that message as we consider the Executive Calendar again early \nnext year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to comment very briefly on the \nnominations. We have made real progress as we were able to clear the \ndegree of nominations that we did. There are several district judges I \nwould like to have cleared, but the understanding is that when we come \nback we will be able to address those very early on. That is the \nunderstanding we reached this afternoon. These judges are very \nimportant for us to address. We will be addressing those as soon as we \ncome back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16154-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16154-S16157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE FIRST SESSION OF THE 108TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about the 108th \nCongress because we are about to draw to a close once we complete some \nof the final paperwork. I think it is a good time for me to review just \na bit of what we have been able to accomplish and what has been really \na truly exceptional legislative session. People have worked very hard; \nthey have stayed very focused, and I believe anyone looking back will \nhave to say that over the last 11 months we really have been able to \nserve the American people well and, in many ways, capped by the \nhistoric enactment of the Medicare prescription drug bill just \nyesterday.\n  For the first time in the 40-year history of the Medicare Program, \nwith which I am very familiar because of my profession before coming to \nthe Senate, Medicare will offer prescription drug coverage, which is \nthe most powerful tool in American medicine today. That will be offered \nto America's 40 million seniors and individuals with disabilities \nthrough the Medicare Program. It is a monumental achievement that I can \nstand before this body today and say we have accomplished with the \nsigning of that Medicare bill yesterday.\n  America's seniors will also have, for the first time, the option \nunder Medicare of choosing a health care plan, or the type of coverage \nthat can best suit their individual needs. Everybody's individual needs \nare very different. We have moved Medicare in the direction that allows \nthis sort of flexibility, the individual attention, the responsiveness \nto individual needs. The seniors and the individuals on disability will \nnow have that choice. These are reforms. This is a modernization, a \nstrengthening and improving of Medicare, but they are indeed reforms.\n  That is why I say this is a monumental piece of legislation. It is \nthe most significant reform since the beginning of that program in \n1965. Although there was a lot of what I guess you could call \npartisanship expressed in the development of the bill, it was healthy \ndebate on both sides; and ultimately the bill was generated by the hard \nwork and dedication of both sides of the aisle.\n  I thank my fellow Senators, my colleagues, for their leadership and \npraise them for stepping forward and addressing an issue that so \ndirectly impacts the 40 million seniors and the almost 80 million baby \nboomers who will be coming through over the next 30 years.\n  It is that responsiveness, with action and with solutions, that \nindeed makes me proud as a Senator, and especially as majority leader \nof the Senate. It is an honor to be able to go back to the American \npeople and say we delivered. It is not perfect. Everybody knows it is \nnot perfect. But we delivered on what affects your lives in terms of \nyour needs and in a way that is reflective of the tremendous talent in \nthis body.\n  Back in January, we set an ambitious agenda. We said we needed to get \nthe economy back on track; we needed to lend the critical support of \nthis body to the war on terror; we needed to promote public health here \nas well as abroad. Most colleagues have heard me say that our mission \nunder the current leadership is to move America forward and in a way \nthat serves the cause of freedom and the cause of liberty. You can \nwrite it on a little card and carry it in your pocket. It is simple and \neasy to understand. That is what we collectively in this body set out \nto do--to expand freedom, to expand opportunity, to strengthen \nAmericans' security.\n  Eleven months later, in looking back, we have done just that. We have \nmade great strides on those goals, but it is sort of a halfway point. \nWe set goals and we are moving toward them aggressively. We did so by \nrespecting the longstanding Senate values of civility and trust--again, \nwith healthy debate but civility and trust.\n  By building strong and reliable and dependable relationships, each of \nus is going to be able to go home and visit with our constituents and \nwith the families, the people who elected us, and be proud of the \naccomplishments we have achieved over the last 11 months.\n  The year started out with us having to pass 12 of the 13 spending \nbills left undone by the previous Congress. We passed 11 of those bills \nin just the first 3 weeks. We also passed a budget to establish a \nblueprint of creating jobs, of investing in homeland security, of \ninvesting in education, of providing a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit and coverage, offering health insurance as well for America's \nchildren.\n  With that unfinished business of the last Congress complete, we \nturned our attention to the President's jobs and growth agenda. Indeed, \nworking with the President and under the President's leadership and his \nvision, we passed $350 billion in tax relief this year which is the \nthird largest tax relief package. The third largest tax cut in the \nhistory of this country this Congress passed. Everybody--all of my \ncolleagues, people listening now, people who will read the \nCongressional Record in the next several days--everybody who is paying \ntaxes pays less taxes today than they did 11 months ago.\n  It was across the board. Yes, it was capital gains; it was affecting \nthe marginal rates as well across the board. Mr. President, 136 million \nhard-working taxpaying Americans had their taxes cut. It did focus on \nfamilies as well. We increased the child tax credit from $600 per child \nto $1,000 per child. We accomplished that this year.\n  A lot of people don't realize those rebate checks were sent out \nimmediately and, as a result, this summer 25 million families received \nchecks from the U.S. Treasury of up to $400 per child, going from $600 \nto $1,000, and an additional check of $400. In total, we returned 13.7 \nbillion tax dollars to families all across the country. That was just \nthe start.\n  Under that Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, a family of 4 making $40,000 \nwill see their taxes reduced by $1,130 this year. Of the overall $350 \nbillion in tax cuts in fiscal relief, the bulk of it was moved forward, \nand nearly $200 billion, fully 60 percent, is provided this year and \nnext.\n  There have been critics of the tax cut. Some say $1,300 is not a lot \nof money you are returning; $1,300 is just not a lot; that is not going \nto make a big difference in somebody's life; and it wouldn't make a big \ndifference if the bureaucrats took it away again. Tell that to the \nfamilies working hard every day to raise children in this day and time, \nthose families who are working hard to pay those household expenses. \nThey are working hard just to have a little bit of money to take their \nfamily on vacation.\n  I can almost guarantee that the U.S. Treasury didn't get a flurry of \nchecks\n\n[[Page S16155]]\n\nin the mail from families who said: No, I don't need that check you \njust sent me; no, America's families can use it. And they did use it.\n  Small business owners, as well, got a major boost from the tax \npackage. Mr. President, 23 million small business owners who pay taxes \nat the individual rates saw their taxes lowered. We quadrupled the \nexpense deduction for small business investment. It had a huge impact. \nWe receive e-mails and letters every week about the impact this single \nissue, this expense deduction has for small business investment.\n  I think we all know small business owners are the engine of growth; \nthey are the heart of the American marketplace. Workers and consumers \ndepend on that small business sector to generate jobs, products, and \nservices. Small business innovators create as much as 60 percent to as \nhigh as 80 percent of new jobs nationwide, and they generate more \nthan 50 percent of the gross domestic product of this country. By \ncutting taxes and by encouraging investment, we are helping unleash a \ntremendous economic power in this country: the economic power of \nindividuals working together in their small businesses.\n\n  Taken together, this year's tax cut and the tax cuts of 2001 are \nproviding an astonishing $1.7 trillion in tax relief over the next \ndecade. We are beginning to see the results. We have already seen those \nresults. We are right now in the midst of a strong economic recovery. \nAgain, compared to 11 years ago, the jobs and growth package, the \nunleashing of the potential of small business and midsize and large \nbusiness, of unleashing that individual hard work and spirit, we have \nan economic recovery.\n  Consumers today have more money in their pockets. Consumers' \nsentiment rose in November to the highest level since May 2002, and \nbusinesses, as well, are optimistic about the direction of the country, \nand with good cause.\n  Economic growth--again, I am comparing it to 11 months ago--economic \ngrowth in the third quarter soared--and that is the best word, \n``soared''--at an incredible rate of 8.2 percent. That is the largest \nthird quarter increase since 1984, in just about 20 years.\n  There is more money in one's pockets; disposable income is up 7.2 \npercent for the third quarter, and consumer spending is up a whopping \n6.6 percent, the biggest third quarter growth since 1988. This \nNovember, sales of previously owned homes hit their third highest level \non record. The National Association of Realtors reports that previously \nowned home sales rose 3.6 percent to a record annual rate of nearly 7 \nmillion units in September. Meanwhile, housing starts are nearing a 17-\nyear high. I should repeat that. Housing starts are nearing a 17-year \nhigh.\n  The association credits the phenomenal growth in home sales to ``the \npowerful fundamentals that are driving housing markets: household \ngrowth, low interest rates, and an improving economy.''\n  This is great news for America's families and, incidentally, for \nAmerica's businesses. When a family buys a home, their purchase not \nonly benefits a community, it sets off a whole chain of purchases that \nhelp fuel the economy. They have to buy that living room furniture. \nThey have to buy those kitchen appliances. They have to buy new beds \nand new curtains. They buy that washer and dryer. All of this is \nreflected in these new housing starts. Many related industries benefit \nfrom one family's momentous and gratifying decision to do what all of \nus envision as the American dream, and that is to buy a home.\n  Not only is individual consumption up, but the business sector is \nshowing impressive signs of recovery. Nonresidential recovery is up 10 \npercent, business investment went up 11.1 percent in the third quarter, \nand productivity soared by 8.1 percent, its highest level in 20 years.\n  Businesses are rebuilding their inventories, and they are retooling \ntheir factories. And all of this economic activity ultimately leads to \njobs. Indeed, the labor market appears to be stabilizing, and the \neconomy is finally providing Americans with those much needed jobs.\n  Over the past 3 months, 286,000 new jobs came on line. In October \nalone, 126,000 jobs were added. Meanwhile, since the initial tax cut, \ninitial claims for unemployment insurance have gone down more than 10 \npercent, and if we look just at the week ending November 1, \nunemployment claims hit a 34-month low.\n  Finally, there is good news for individual State treasuries. Their \nbudget gap of nearly $20 billion at the beginning of the last fiscal \nyear has now declined to a budget gap of less than $3 billion--$20 \nbillion down to $3 billion for the beginning of this fiscal year. \nStates are just beginning to see revenue surprises in their estimates.\n  Whether it is consumers or whether it is businesses, all are \noptimistic about America's economic direction. Inflation is low, \ninterest rates are low, and American taxpayers have more of their hard-\nearned money to spend and to save as they choose. And they have more \nand more opportunities to secure the jobs they need.\n  This body will continue to champion fiscal policies that strengthen \nthe economy and create jobs. We will also continue to pursue fair and \nfree trade policies that increase consumer buying power, that stoke \nthat economic furnace. I can list all sorts of examples, such as the \nfree trade agreements we passed this year with Chile and Singapore. \nThese and other policies, indeed, are maximizing freedom, are expanding \nthe opportunity for every American--indeed, are moving America forward \nin a way that serves the cause of liberty.\n  That leads me to national security. Our mission to expand freedom and \nopportunity applies not just to our economy but to national security as \nwell. We know that freedom cannot find its fullest expression under a \nthreat of terror. Likewise, terror cannot spread where freedom reigns. \nThis is why this year America took the extraordinary action of toppling \nSaddam Hussein and his terrorist-sponsoring regime.\n  In 3 short weeks, men and women of the United States military, with \nthe support of 49 nations, swept into Baghdad, ending three decades of \nruthless rule and terror. In the months since, our soldiers have worked \ntirelessly. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as we enter this new \nholiday season. They have worked and continue to work under dangerous \nconditions.\n  They are working with that focus of helping the Iraqi people build a \ndemocracy. Our soldiers have rebuilt schools. They have rebuilt \nhospitals. They have rebuilt electrical grids, pipelines, and roads. \nThey are training the Iraqi police forces to patrol the streets and to \nhunt down terrorists. Every day our troops are helping the people of \nIraq and Afghanistan move forward, becoming free and open societies. To \nsupport their efforts, this body acted. We passed the President's $87 \nbillion war supplemental this year. We did so because we recognized \nthat investing in the future of Iraq and Afghanistan is an investment \nin our security.\n  September 11 taught us a really cruel lesson. We learned that we \ncannot wait in this country while storms gather. As the President said, \nthe Middle East region will either become a place of progress and peace \nor it will remain a source of violence and terror. I repeat that \nquotation: The Middle East region will either become a place of \nprogress and peace or it will remain a source of violence and terror.\n  This year, we in the Senate took bold action to support the war on \nterror because we are determined that progress and peace take root. The \nMiddle East is not the only region where we are working to bring \nstability. In this session, in this body, we passed the Burmese Freedom \nAct and the Clean Diamond Act to promote peace and freedom. We also \ntook the historic action of dedicating $15 billion to drive back, to \nfight, and to eventually eradicate the HIV/AIDS virus. That little \nvirus that I have talked a lot about on this floor did not exist, as \nfar as we knew, until the early 1980s, which is not that long ago. \nSince that period in time, that little virus has killed a million \npeople, killed 5 million people, killed 10 million people, killed 15 \nmillion people, killed 23 million people over the last 20 years.\n  As a physician, as one who participates in medical mission trips to \nAfrica--indeed, around the world, but predominantly to Africa--on a \nregular basis, I am especially gratified by this body demonstrating its \ncompassion on this issue. Millions of lives have been cut short by this \nscourge, and we responded. It is a new problem around\n\n[[Page S16156]]\n\nthe world and it is a problem that we, following the leadership of the \nPresident of the United States, are addressing with the full might and \npower and boldness of this body.\n  Countries have lost whole midsections and swaths of their population. \nIn my trip to parts of Africa, we took a Senate delegation into August \nand September of this year and we saw this whole midsection of a \npopulation where, yes, there are young people running around but they \nhave lost their parents and there are older people who are typically \ngrandparents but the whole midsection of a population has literally \nbeen wiped out. I have said it many times, and I will continue to say \nit because we need to make Americans aware, that to my mind HIV/AIDS is \nthe greatest moral, humanitarian, and public health challenge of the \nlast 100 years.\n\n  The good news is that this body has responded. By passing the global \nHIV/AIDS bill, we are helping to prevent 7 million new infections, \nprovide antiretroviral drugs for 2 million HIV-infected people, care \nfor 10 million HIV-infected people and AIDS orphans, and bring hope to \nmillions of people around the world. Our leadership serves as an \nexample for every government in the world today.\n  It is not just in Africa. Actually, the fastest growing rates are not \nin Africa. We see it in elements of the Caribbean and we see it in \nRussia. Just a few minutes ago, I had the opportunity to meet with the \nPremier of China, and we were talking about HIV/AIDS. It is really \nunprecedented. I cannot help but think that the President of the United \nStates, with the leadership in this body and the House of \nRepresentatives, has contributed to that global understanding, that \nglobal leadership, which will allow us eventually to reverse the tide \nof destruction of this virus.\n  Our work in passing this critical legislation does demonstrate that \nthe United States of America places a high value on life. We have \nresponded. We have a lot more to do in this regard, but we have \nresponded with that boldness. History will judge how we responded, and \nin this Congress we have responded in that bold fashion. We have taken \nthe necessary actions.\n  We have also addressed other sorts of life-related issues in this \nCongress. We have made the right choice to end that morally \nreprehensible practice of partial-birth abortion. This body and the \nHouse and various administrations have talked about outlawing this \nobjectionable--I would say abominable--procedure, but we delivered. \nThis body delivered and no longer, as I stand here, is that practice of \npartial-birth abortion legal. Eleven months ago, it was legal; it was \nperformed and unnecessary lives were taken. Today, it is against the \nlaw. We did it, I should say, with an overwhelming majority in this \nbody. We voted to end this immoral and medically unnecessary procedure \nand say yes to life.\n  This Senate can be proud of many strides taken in the 108th Congress \nto protect those most vulnerable among us. Again, I add that partial-\nbirth abortion really demonstrates that. In addition, there was other \nlegislation, such as Amber Alert. In January, we passed legislation to \nestablish the National Amber Alert. Law enforcement now--and they did \nnot have it at the beginning of this year--has another tool to work \nwith the public. Governments and law enforcement can now work together \nto be able to find missing children.\n  Another example: In June of this year, we passed legislation to \nprotect the victims of child abuse. We also voted to extend welfare \nreform to help lift families out of poverty. There was Medicare reform, \njobs and growth tax cuts, the Iraqi war supplemental, the global HIV/\nAIDS bill.\n  In January, we set our sights high, and I would argue that we \nexceeded expectation. We are moving America forward, and we will \ncontinue to do so in the coming months because there is a lot more to \ndo.\n  I go through this sort of partial discussion of what we have \naccomplished in terms of jobs and growth, health care, the value of \nlife issues, and global HIV/AIDS in part to reflect. It is important \nfor our colleagues because we have been working pretty hard, we have \nbeen going pretty much nonstop, especially over the last couple of \nmonths, and I do want to encourage our colleagues to look back and say \nthat, yes, we are making progress, but there is much to be done.\n  I do want to really just project out a little bit about where I think \nwe will be going in the next Congress as we come back in January.\n  We will build on the success of this year's appropriations process \nand we will tackle all 13 appropriations bills so that Government can \nperform its basic function to serve the people. Beyond appropriations, \nwe still must pass a comprehensive energy plan. We have been debating \nnational energy and national energy policy for 3 years. During the last \nCongress, we spent a total of 7 weeks debating energy on the Senate \nfloor. In this Congress we spent more time debating energy than any \nother bill. More time than any other bill we debated energy on this \nfloor. Yet despite all this time devoted to debate, there still remains \na small contingent, a minority in this body I should add, that \ncontinues to obstruct progress. While this small group insists on yet \nmore debate, national gas prices keep rising to even higher levels.\n  U.S. chemical companies are closing plants. They are laying off \nworkers. They are looking to expand production abroad because of high \nenergy prices. The United States is expected to import approximately $9 \nbillion more in chemicals than it exports this year. American consumers \nare getting hit with higher electric bills and small businesses are \nstruggling to contain costs, all because of rising energy prices.\n  So we have to pass an energy plan, and we will pass an energy plan \nwhen we return. Not only will the energy plan lower prices, it will \nsave jobs and it will create thousands more. It is estimated the energy \npackage will create half a million jobs. The Alaskan pipeline alone \nwill create at least 400,000. The hundreds of millions of dollars that \nwill be invested in research and development of new technologies will \nnot only benefit the environment but will create new jobs in \nengineering, math, chemistry, physics, and science. We simply cannot \nallow the obstruction of a few in the Senate to continue to harm the \ninterests of millions of Americans.\n  I do use that word ``obstruction,'' and indeed I use it purposely \nbecause we saw it used to an alarming degree in this Congress, no more \nso than, as we demonstrated on this floor to the American people, now \nseveral weeks ago, in the consideration of the President's judicial \nnominees. Here obstruction has become a tool to undermine the \ndemocratic process itself. It, too, is a new problem.\n  For the last 200 years we have never seen the filibuster used to stop \nand to obstruct and to deny Senators an up-or-down vote on Presidential \nnominees. A minority of Senators in this body today, this year, unlike \nin previous Congresses, is denying all 100 of us their constitutional \nduty--it is spelled out in the Constitution--to give advice and \nconsent.\n  We took that opportunity, now, several weeks ago, to make it plain to \nthe American people. Yes, we worked around the clock. We had the 40-\nhour debate. We held it in October on three of the President's judicial \nnominees, and after 40 hours of debate to fully consider the eminently \nqualified candidates for the bench, the minority refused to allow us \nthat very simple request--not approval of them all but simply an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  Yes, this is obstruction. It really can't be described as anything \nbut obstruction, and I would argue plain partisan obstruction. It is \nsomething we will continue to fight and we will not give up until we \ncan break that partisan obstruction which is new to this wonderful \ninstitution, and it is something we must take back to what has been \nboth the tradition and the culture of the last 200 years.\n\n  When we return in January we will continue to press for the fair \nconsideration of the President's judicial nominees. Again, the fair \nconsideration--advice and consent, a simple vote. People can vote \nagainst or they can vote for, but just allow us to vote. As we pointed \nout several weeks ago, the democratic process itself, as enshrined in \nthe United States Constitution, is at stake.\n  We will also continue, as we look forward, to press for policies that \nexpand and strengthen our economy. This session we did pass, as I \noutlined, smart,\n\n[[Page S16157]]\n\nprogrowth fiscal policy, and we are already beginning to see those \nresults. But there is still a lot more to do. We have to address, and \nwe will address in the next year, the frivolous lawsuits that we all \nknow are clogging our State courts. They are unnecessarily wasting our \ntaxpayer dollars, and that gets reflected in inhibiting, almost \nstraitjacketing businesses, especially small businesses. It \nstraightjackets that entrepreneurial spirit that we know bubbles \nunderneath here in the United States of America. It is that \nentrepreneurial spirit; it is that innovation and creativity that \ncreates jobs. Yet we have a tort system, mainly reflected in these \nfrivolous lawsuits, which keeps it contained, keeps it trapped.\n  In my own area of medicine, for the first time in a long period of \ntime this past summer we addressed the medical liability issues with a \nfreestanding bill. It is going to come back and it is going to keep \ncoming back until we solve this unnecessary problem which affects \naccess to care, to quality care, as we see trauma centers closing, as \nwe see obstetricians no longer delivering babies. Again, it is a \nproblem that can be reversed, and in this body we have a responsibility \nto reverse it. And we will. America is a country that values its \ncitizens and we will return fairness to the litigation process.\n  We will also work to return fairness to the tax system. We will press \nfor reforms to simplify the Tax Code. We will work to extend the tax \ncredits passed in the Jobs and Growth Act. The work opportunity tax \ncredit, for example, offers tax incentives to hire unemployed workers \nand welfare recipients. Not only is this smart, progrowth fiscal \npolicy, it also is compassionate social action.\n  Fairness and compassion also demand that we permanently repeal the \nFederal death tax, the estate tax. Americans who work hard their whole \nlives, who save and who invest, who start those small businesses which \nbecome that engine of economic growth, those individuals who contribute \nto America's economic vibrancy, simply should not be punished for their \nsuccess. That is what the death tax does. No son, no daughter should \nhave to sell that family home to pay the death tax collector. It makes \nno sense, it is unfair, and it discourages productive economic \nactivity. We will address it and ultimately we will win.\n  Compassion also demands that we turn our attention to fine-tuning the \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n1996. Since it was enacted 7 years ago, welfare reform has helped to \nlift millions and millions of families out of poverty. There are over \n3.5 million fewer people living in poverty now than in 1995, a year \nbefore welfare reform was passed. Welfare caseloads have declined to \none-half. When we return next year, we will look for ways to build on \nthis success so that more families can have a fair chance at the \nAmerican dream.\n\n  We will also address that important issue, and an issue, again, I \ntalk a lot about, and that is the problem of the uninsured. The \nincreasing number--again, you will see this body is beginning to \naddress those areas, those problems where the problem is getting worse \nover time, and the uninsured is just that area. It is an increasing \nnumber of uninsured, people without health insurance. Clearly, this \nproblem represents one of the most daunting policy challenges facing \nour Nation.\n  As a physician, I saw firsthand how the lack of insurance, the lack \nof coverage, puts forth the significant barriers to quality health \ncare, including such things as basic as preventive services. The lack \nof affordable health coverage is also one of the key factors \ncontributing to health care disparities among minorities among other \nmedically underserved populations. I asked my colleague the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Mr. Judd Gregg, to lead the Senate Republican task \nforce on this pressing issue, the uninsured. He will report back with a \nseries of recommendations for modification, for strengthening, for \nreform next year.\n  Next year we will also continue our efforts to improve America's \npublic educational system. We are committed to improving Head Start to \nmake sure that Head Start children enter school with the same tools and \nthe same skills as their economically advantaged peers. We are also \ncommitted to expanding access to college education for every American \nstudent who seeks it, and for special education students we will work \nto pass comprehensive legislation that protects their educational \nrights as well.\n  Education, as we all know, is the heart and soul of America's \nsuccess. Our abundance, civic life, and democracy demand and depend \ndirectly on a thriving and educated citizenry.\n  Education, the uninsured, tax policy, welfare reform, litigation \nreform, judicial nominees, energy, and appropriations are just some of \nthe challenging issues we will be addressing next year. I am confident \nthat next year, just as this year, we will be able to meet ambitious \ngoals.\n  In closing, each day that I have the opportunity to walk into this \ngreat institution, I am humbled. Indeed, I am inspired. I am humbled \nmostly by the great men and women who have come before and inspired by \ntheir example. In his 1862 address to Congress, President Lincoln told \nthe assembled legislators that ``America is the world's last best \nhope.'' Those words have never ever been truer than they are today. I \nam confident that we will face the challenges ahead with honor and with \ncourage for the simple reason that we are Americans.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16157-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16157-S16158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to take my wife Karyn \nto the Kennedy Center Honors, which is an annual tradition here. It is \nreally a remarkable evening--a 2-day event--where America celebrates \ncultural icons. Most of them have been recognized before. But in that \nspecial gathering and in that beautiful building, the Kennedy Center, \nit takes on a really special meaning I think for us in this body, in \nthe U.S. Congress, for those of us here in Washington, but indeed for \npeople around the world as they see it replayed just after, I think, \nDecember 26.\n  While I was there, I couldn't help but to reflect as I watched one of \ncountry music's greats, Loretta Lynn, receive her honor. An issue that \naffects the State of Tennessee but indeed which affects people \nthroughout the United States of America deals with intellectual \nproperty rights.\n  The State of Tennessee is known the world over for its vibrant \nmusical heritage. It is the home of the Grand Ole Opry and the Country \nMusic Hall of Fame. Indeed, Tennessee has produced some of the greatest \npopular pioneers of all time. Indeed, Tennessee has produced Elvis \nPresley, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, and the list goes on. \nThose who grew up in Nashville had that opportunity to go by on a \nregular basis and experience the music at the wonderful Ryman \nAuditorium, where the Grand Ole Opry was housed for so many years.\n\n  In the next few weeks, we will have the pleasure of hearing \nrenditions of many of these artists with their Christmas carols played \nover the airwaves all across this country and even all across this \nglobe, in shopping malls just about everywhere the holidays are \ncelebrated.\n  The music community that creates these opportunities and this joy is \nbeing threatened. In these closing minutes, I bring that to the \nattention of my colleagues. It is being threatened by those who love it \nso much, who appreciate it so much; that is, the millions of people who \nare downloading billions of illegal music files.\n  I have had the privilege of meeting diverse groups of leaders from \nthe music community on several occasions, but the focus has been to \ndiscuss the effects of piracy on the music industry. It is huge. It is \nfar reaching. It is the artist, it is the record companies, it is the \nperforming rights organizations, it is the publishers. The bottom line \nis clear: Piracy is greatly impacting the music community. The \nsituation is, indeed, growing worse. Online music piracy is out of \ncontrol.\n  Currently, every month, 2.6 billion music files are downloaded \nillegally\n\n[[Page S16158]]\n\nusing peer-to-peer networks. It is not unusual for albums to show up on \nthe Internet before they make it to the record stores. The music \nindustry is losing $4 billion a year to piracy, and that dollar figure \nis growing every day. Most alarming, there is an entire generation of \nyoung Americans who believe that downloading online music is \nacceptable, it is the norm, it is legal, like being your own personal \nDJ without ever having to buy a CD.\n  Piracy affects more than just the music industry. It affects that \nlarger element of intellectual property. It includes the movie \nindustry, it includes the software industry. Indeed, the numbers are \nstaggering. According to a report released by the International \nIntellectual Property Alliance, U.S. copyright industries--and that \nincludes music, movies, books, and software--contributed $535 billion \nto the U.S. economy in 2001. They collectively employ over 4.7 million \nworkers. They generate almost $900 billion in foreign sales, making \nintellectual property one of our largest exports.\n  Other countries often do not respect our copyright laws. They allow \nmass copying of music and other works. For example, it is estimated \nthat an astounding 92 percent of business software used in China is \npirated. In my travels to Asia several months ago, I directly stressed \nthe importance of protecting our copyright laws to the leaders of China \nand Taiwan and Korea, the countries I visited. Copyright pirating is \ncosting our economy billions. As leaders, we must educate the public \nthat illegally downloading music or copyrighted material is stealing, \nstraight and simple. Most people would never steal a CD from Wal-Mart, \nbut they do not think twice before burning a CD from illegally \ndownloaded music. People forget that an artist's song is just like a \nbaker's loaf of bread; it is their creation; it is their livelihood.\n  While the future of the music industry lies with the merging \ntechnology, the industry simply cannot survive if Internet piracy \nsteals its value any more than a shop owner can survive having their \ninventory stolen from under him or her every week or a restaurant owner \ncan afford in some way to serve meals for free.\n\n  Eventually, unabated piracy will dry up income. It drives away the \ncreative spirit. It drives away artists. It destroys the enterprise of \nmaking recorded music. Fewer artists, less music. It is that simple. \nLess music on our airwaves, on the Internet, in the public square, any \nplace you can think of where recorded music is played and enjoyed, \nincluding on your own Walkman when you jog or run. Piracy ends up \nhurting us all, music lovers and music creators alike.\n  I ask my colleagues to watch this issue closely. We can help educate \nthe public about both the illegality of piracy and its effect on our \neconomy and our creative culture. It is our responsibility to do so. \nAnd we can encourage consumers to download music from legitimate online \nfee services. There are several sites that are up and running, and I \nencourage the industry to continue to work hard to improve their online \nproducts to meet consumer demand. There is no better time to reflect on \nthe impact of American recorded music than during these holidays. When \nwe hear Bing Crosby's ``White Christmas'' or Duke Ellington's ``Jingle \nBells'' or Burl Ives's ``Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,'' we are \nhearing not just another American Christmas classic but a part of \nAmerica's creative legacy, the recorded music industry, one of our \ngreatest exports to the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/09/senate-section/article/S16158-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I \ntransmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State with respect to this Additional Protocol.\n  My Administration expects to forward to the Senate shortly analogous \nAdditional Protocols for Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Poland, and the Slovak Republic. Each of these Additional \nProtocols is the result of an understanding the United States reached \nwith the European Commission and six countries that will join the \nEuropean Union (EU) on May 1, 2004 (the Czech Republic, Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Poland, and the Slovak Republic), as well as with \nBulgaria and Romania, which are expected to join the EU in 2007.\n  The understanding is designed to preserve U.S. bilateral investment \ntreaties (BITs) with each of these countries after their accession to \nthe EU by establishing a framework acceptable to the European \nCommission for avoiding or remedying present and possible future \nincompatibilities between their BIT obligations and their future \nobligations of EU membership. It expresses the U.S. intent to amend the \nU.S. BITs, including the BIT with Romania, in order to eliminate \nincompatibilities between certain BIT obligations and EU law. It also \nestablishes a framework for addressing any future incompatibilities \nthat may arise as European Union authority in the area of investment \nexpands in the future, and endorses the principle of protecting \nexisting U.S. investments from any future EU measures that may restrict \nforeign investment in the EU.\n  The United States has long championed the benefits of an open \ninvestment climate, both at home and abroad. It is the policy of the \nUnited States to welcome market-driven foreign investment and to permit \ncapital to flow freely to seek its highest return. This Additional \nProtocol preserves the U.S. BIT with Romania, with which the United \nStates has an expanding relationship, and the protections it affords \nU.S. investors even after Romania joins the EU. Without it, the \nEuropean Commission would likely require Romania to terminate its U.S. \nBIT upon accession because of existing and possible future \nincompatibilities between our current BIT and EU law.\n  I recommend that the Senate consider this Additional Protocol as soon \nas possible, and give its advice and consent to ratification at an \nearly date.\n                                                      George W.

REVIEW OF STATE AGENCY BLINDNESS AND DISABILITY \n                   DETERMINATIONS.\n\n       Section 1633 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1383b) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e)(1) The Commissioner of Social Security shall review \n     determinations, made by State agencies pursuant to subsection \n     (a) in connection with applications for benefits under this \n     title on the basis of blindness or disability, that \n     individuals who have attained 18 years of age are blind or \n     disabled. Any review by the Commissioner of Social Security \n     of a State agency determination under this paragraph shall be \n     made before any action is taken to implement the \n     determination.\n       ``(2)(A) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Commissioner of \n     Social Security shall review--\n       ``(i) with respect to fiscal year 2004, at least 25 percent \n     of all determinations referred to in paragraph (1) that are \n     made in such year after the later of--\n       ``(I) March 31; and\n       ``(II) the date of enactment of this subsection; and\n       ``(ii) with respect to fiscal years after fiscal year 2004, \n     at least 50 percent of all such determinations that are made \n     in each such fiscal year.\n       ``(B) In conducting reviews pursuant to subparagraph (A), \n     the Commissioner of Social Security shall, to the extent \n     feasible, select for review those determinations which the \n     Commissioner of Social Security identifies as being the most \n     likely to be incorrect.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. \n743, the Social Security Protection Act of 2003.\n  The Social Security Protection Act of 2003 provides the Social \nSecurity Administration with important new tools to fight waste, fraud, \nand abuse. This bill would eliminate benefits to fugitive felons. It \nwould prohibit benefits to illegal workers. It would eliminate the \n``last day'' loophole in the Government Pension Offset. It would \nprovide additional oversight of representative payees. Finally, the \nbill would improve benefits for person with disabilities.\n  This bill passed the House of Representatives in April. The Senate \nCommittee on Finance approved the bill in September with a number of \nimportant changes.\n  In order to expedite passage of this legislation, Senator Baucus and \nI have worked closely with the chairman and the ranking member of the \nSocial Security Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee over \nthe past several weeks. The result of this work is reflected in the \nmanagers' amendment that has now been incorporated into this bill.\n  I have drafted an explanation of the amendment that has been agreed \nto by the chairman and the ranking member of the House Social Security \nSubcommittee, as well as by the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Finance Committee. I ask unanimous consent that the explanation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Explanation of the Manager's Amendment to H.R. 743, the ``Social \n Security Protection Act of 2003'' as Reported by the Senate Committee \n                       on Finance, Report 108-176\n\n     Section 107. Survey of use of payments by representative \n         payees\n       The Manager's amendment would limit the scope and cost of \n     the survey and change the organization designated to have the \n     responsibility for conducting the survey.\n       As a result of the Manager's amendment, the Commissioner of \n     Social Security, in consultation with the Inspector General \n     of the Social Security Administration (SSA), the General \n     Accounting Office, the Committee on Ways and Means of the \n     House of Representatives, and the Committee on Finance of the \n     Senate, shall conduct a one-time audit of a representative \n     sample of representative payees who are not subject to \n     triennial onsite review or other random review under SSA \n     policy or law, as amended by this bill. That is, the sample \n     shall include individual representative payees serving one or \n     several beneficiaries; individual ``high-volume'' payees \n     serving more than several but fewer than 15 beneficiaries; \n     individual ``high-volume'' payees serving more than several \n     but fewer than 15 beneficiaries; and non-fee-for-service \n     organizational payees who are serving fewer than 50 \n     beneficiaries. The cost of this audit will not be greater \n     than $8.5 million. The results of the audit should be \n     presented in a report to the Committee on Ways and Means of \n     the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of \n     the Senate.\n       The audit shall assess the extent to which representative \n     payees are not performing their duties as payees in \n     accordance with SSA standards for payee conduct. Such SSA \n     standards include, but are not limited to, whether the funds \n     are being used for the benefit of the beneficiary. To the \n     extent possible, the report shall identify which types of \n     payees have the highest risk of misuse of benefits, and \n     suggest ways to reduce those risks and better protect \n     beneficiaries.\n       In conducting the audit, the Commissioner shall take \n     special care to avoid excessive intrusiveness into family \n     affairs, including making appropriate adjustments to its \n     audit methodology. if some or all of the audit is contracted \n     out, such contractor shall be chosen with due regard for its \n     experience in conducting reviews of individuals and families, \n     as well as businesses and other organizations.\n       In the course of conducting the audit and preparing the \n     report, the Commissioner, or a designated contractor, may \n     make observations about the adequacy of payees' actions and \n     recommendations for change or further review. However, \n     determinations as to whether funds have been misused and/or \n     whether a payee should be changed must be made only by the \n     Commissioner. Further, those conducting the survey should not \n     provide advice, guidance or other feedback to payees that are \n     reviewed under this audit regarding their performance as \n     payees.\n       This provision authorizes and appropriates up to $8.5 \n     million under subsection 1110(a) of the Social Security Act \n     to carry out this audit. However, these funds are \n     appropriated in addition to any funds appropriated for this \n     subsection under any other law. There is no intention of \n     reducing the funds that would otherwise be available under \n     this subsection to carry out any other projects.\n       It is expected that the Commissioner will carry out a \n     survey that is statistically valid at reasonable levels of \n     confidence and precision. However, if the Commissioner \n     determines that such a survey can be prepared for less than \n     the amount appropriated, then the full $8.5 million should \n     not be used. The Commissioner has the authority to limit the \n     amount expended under this provision to that lesser amount. \n     The Committees expect the Commissioner to carefully assess \n     the design of the audit to ensure that it is being performed \n     as economically as possible, while still meeting the \n     objective of obtaining information that is of sufficient \n     statistical validity to assist in increasing the knowledge \n     and understanding of the representative payee program and \n     facilitating its possible improvement.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The report will be due to the Committee on Ways and Means \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance \n     of the Senate 18 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n     Section 203. Denial of Title II benefits to persons fleeing \n         prosecution, custody, or confinement, and to persons \n         violating probation or parole\n       The Manager's amendment would substitute the following \n     ``good cause'' exception for the original provision included \n     in the Committee-reported bill.\n       Press accounts, hearing testimony and other information \n     provided to the Committees have identified cases in which \n     benefit continuation may be justified due to extenuating \n     circumstances. In light of this, the provision gives the \n     Commissioner authority to pay Title II or Title XVI benefits \n     that were withheld, or would otherwise be withheld, if there \n     is good cause in the following circumstances:\n       First, the Commissioner shall apply the good cause \n     exception if a court of competent jurisdiction finds the \n     person is not guilty, charges are dismissed, a warrant for \n     arrest is vacated, or there are similar exonerating \n     circumstances found by the court.\n       Second, the Commissioner shall apply the good cause \n     exception if the individual establishes to the satisfaction \n     of the Commissioner that he or she was the victim of identity \n     fraud and the warrant was erroneously issued on such basis.\n       Third, the Commissioner may apply the good cause exception \n     if the criminal offense was non-violent and not drug-related, \n     and in the case of probation or parole violators, both the \n     violation and the underlying offense were non-violent and not \n     drug-related. However, in such cases, the Commissioner may \n     only establish good cause based on mitigating factors such \n     as the nature and severity of the crime, the length of \n     time that has passed since the warrant was issued, whether \n     other crimes have been committed in the interim, and the \n     beneficiary's mental capacity to resolve the issue.\n       This document (which is to accompany the Manager's \n     amendment) also seeks to clarify two issues with respect to \n     current law. First, section 1611(e)(5)(A)(ii) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 USC 1382(e)(5)(A)(ii)) requires a law \n     enforcement officer to notify the Commissioner that an SSI \n     recipient has information necessary for the officer to \n     conduct his official duties.\n       The Manager's amendment deletes this information \n     requirement in (A)(ii) to clarify that a law enforcement \n     officer only needs to notify the Commissioner of the \n     recipient's fugitive status (or parole / probation status), \n     and the officer's duty to locate or apprehend the recipient. \n     This change is not intended to have any effect on the \n     existing interpretation or application of section 1611 and is \n     consistent with current practices and procedures.\n       Second, several recent decisions by Administrative Law \n     Judges have noted that neither\n\n[[Page S16181]]\n\n     the current statute nor the current regulations define the \n     phrase ``fleeing to avoid prosecution.'' This report provides \n     the following clarification. If it is reasonable to conclude \n     that the individual knew or should have known that criminal \n     charges were pending, or has been made aware of such charges \n     by the SSA, then the individual should be considered \n     ``fleeing,'' whether or not law enforcement seeks arrest or \n     extradition.\n     Section 206. Penalty for corrupt or forcible interference \n         with administration of the Social Security Act\n       The Manager's amendment makes a technical correction to \n     address a drafting error.\n     Section 209. Authority for judicial orders of restitution\n       The Manager's amendment makes technical corrections and \n     eliminates the special restitution account created within the \n     Treasury Department. Funds collected through restitution \n     would instead be credited to the Social Security trust funds \n     or the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, as appropriate.\n     Section 210. Information for administration of provisions \n         related to non-covered employment\n       The Manager's amendment would strike this section.\n     Section 212. Prohibition of payment of Title II benefits to \n         persons not authorized to work in the United States\n       The Manager's amendment would make a technical correction \n     related to certain non-citizens and change the effective \n     date.\n       B-1 visa holders are generally aliens visiting the United \n     States temporarily for business on behalf of a foreign \n     employer. According to State Department regulations, the B-1 \n     visa holder conducts business as a continuation of his \n     foreign employment. D visa holders are generally alien flight \n     attendants who enter into an employment contract in the \n     United States with a U.S. airline and who only fly into and \n     out of the United States.\n       Although these categories of visa holders are not \n     technically authorized to work in the United States, such \n     persons are legally present in the United States while they \n     are working. Thus, they should not be subject to the benefit \n     prohibition.\n       The Manager's amendment would also change the effective \n     date to limit the application of this provision to persons \n     with Social Security numbers issued after January 1, 2004. \n     This change would provide the Social Security Administration \n     the opportunity to develop the recordkeeping system necessary \n     to enforce the provision.\n     Section 302. Temporary extension of attorney fee payment \n         system to Title XVI claims\n       The Manager's amendment re-designates Section 302 as \n     Section 304 and adopts the House-passed provision to extend \n     the current Title II attorney fee withholding process to \n     Title XVI for a period of five years.\n       The amendment would also cap the 6.3 percent assessment on \n     approved attorney representation fees at $75 (indexed for \n     inflation), as provided for Title II claims under Section 301 \n     of the bill.\n       With respect to the cap of $75 for Title II and Title XVI \n     claims, it should be noted that the cap applies on a per case \n     basis. (Concurrent cases shall be treated as a single case \n     for this purpose.) In a case multiple representatives, the \n     SAA should apply the assessment proportionately to each \n     representative issued a check and in no case should the \n     cumulative assessment exceed $75.\n       Finally, the amendment would amend the existing dedicated \n     account and installment payment provisions in Title XVI. \n     Under current law, dedicated accounts are required when an \n     individual receives past-due benefits equal to 6 times the \n     Federal Benefit Rate (FBR); installment payments are required \n     when past due benefits are to be 12 times the FBR. The \n     amendment clarifies that these triggering amounts would be \n     based on the amount of past-due benefits that remain after \n     attorney fees that the Social Security Administration paid \n     directly to the attorney out of past-due benefits are \n     deducted.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       Applies with respect to fees for representation that are \n     first required to be certified or paid on or after the date \n     the Commissioner submits to Congress a notice that she \n     has completed the actions necessary to fully implement the \n     demonstration project under Section 303.\n     Section 303. Nationwide demonstration project providing for \n         extension of fee withholding procedures to non-attorney \n         representatives\n       The Manager's amendments adds the following new section.\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       An individual applying for Title II or Title XVI benefits \n     may seek the assistance of another person. The person \n     assisting the applicant may not charge or receive a fee \n     unless the Social Security Administration (SSA) approves it. \n     If the person assisting the individual is an attorney and the \n     individual is awarded past-due benefits under Title II, the \n     SSA may deduct the attorney's fee from the individual's \n     benefits and pay the attorney directly--minus a fee to cover \n     the SSA's administrative costs.\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       This provision would authorize a nationwide demonstration \n     project to allow non-attorneys the option of fee withholding \n     under both Title II and Title XVI for a period of five years. \n     The SSA would charge a 6.3 percent assessment on approved \n     fees, subject to a $75 cap (indexed for inflation), as \n     applies to attorneys under section 206 and section 1631(d)(2) \n     of the Act.\n       Non-attorney representatives seeking direct payment of fees \n     under the demonstration project would need to meet at least \n     the following prerequisites: hold a bachelor's degree or \n     equivalent experience, pass an examination written and \n     administered by the Commissioner, secure professional \n     liability insurance or the equivalent, undergo a criminal \n     background check, and complete continuing education courses. \n     The provision would require the Commissioner to implement and \n     carry out the demonstration project no later than one year \n     after the date of enactment. The demonstration project would \n     terminate 5 years after being fully implemented.\n       The Commissioner may charge a reasonable fee to individuals \n     seeking approval for direct payments. Such fees should be \n     comparable to the fees charged to other professionals subject \n     to similar regulation.\n       The Commissioner should consult with relevant experts in \n     the area of disability policy and professional ethics \n     (including, but not limited to, experienced non-attorney and \n     attorney disability claimant representatives, disability \n     advocates, and organizations that develop and administer \n     examinations for the regulation of professionals) in \n     developing the exam and in determining whether other \n     prerequisites should be required.\n       The Commissioner would be required to submit interim \n     reports on the progress of the demonstration and a final \n     report after the conclusion of the demonstration.\n\n                           Reason for Change\n\n       The demonstration project authorized by this section would \n     allow the SSA to pay all qualified representatives directly \n     out of past-due benefits for Title II and Title XVI claims \n     and would enable Congress (in conjunction with the GAO study \n     required under Section 304) to assess whether such an \n     extension of fee withholding would increase access to \n     qualified professional representation.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       Applies with respect to fees for representation that are \n     first required to be certified or paid after the date the \n     Commissioner submits to Congress a notice that she has \n     completed the actions necessary to fully implement this \n     demonstration project. The interim reports would be due \n     annually, and the final report would be due 90 days after the \n     termination of the demonstration.\n     Section 304. GAO study of fee payment process for claimant \n         representatives\n       The Manager's amendment re-designates Section 302 as \n     Section 304 and modifies the GAO study.\n       The Committee-reported bill called for a study based upon \n     the potential results of extending fee withholding to Title \n     XVI and to non-attorneys. As modified by the Manager's \n     amendment, the study will now be based on the actual results \n     of such an extension as provided in Section 302 and Section \n     303 of the bill.\n       The GAO report would provide a comprehensive overview of \n     the appointment and payment of claimant representatives. It \n     would include a survey of all categories of representatives--\n     both attorneys and non-attorneys, as well as those who do and \n     do not elect fee withholding. It would compare claimant \n     outcomes by type of representatives. It would also compare \n     the costs and benefits of fee withholding from the \n     perspective of the Social Security Administration, claimants, \n     and representatives.\n       GAO would evaluate the interactions between fee \n     withholding, the windfall offset, and interim assistance \n     reimbursement. This evaluation would consider the effects of \n     such interactions on claimant outcomes, access to \n     representatives, and reimbursements to the Federal and State \n     governments.\n       Finally, GAO would make recommendations for any legislative \n     or administrative changes deemed appropriate. The report \n     would be due no later than 3 years after the implementation \n     date of Section 303.\n     Section 401. Application of demonstration authority sunset \n         date to new projects\n       The Manager's amendment would extend the demonstration \n     authority through December 18, 2005, rather than making it \n     permanent, and allow projects initiated by December 17, 2005 \n     to be completed thereafter.\n     Section 407. Reauthorization of appropriations for certain \n         work incentives programs\n       The Manager's amendment adds the following new section.\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Ticket to Work Act directs SSA to establish a \n     community-based program to provide benefit planning and \n     assistance to disabled beneficiaries. To establish this \n     program, SSA is required to award cooperative agreements (or \n     grants or contracts) to State or private entities. Services \n     include disseminating accurate information on work incentive \n     programs (the Ticket to Work, section 1619 programs, etc.) \n     and related issues to all disabled beneficiaries. In \n     fulfillment of this requirement, SSA has established the \n     Benefits Planning, Assistance, and Outreach (BPAO) program. \n     The Act also authorizes SSA to award grants to State \n     protection and advocacy (P) systems so that they can \n     provide protection and advocacy services to disabled \n     beneficiaries. Services include information and advice about \n     obtaining vocational rehabilitation and employment services \n     and advocacy or other services that a\n\n[[Page S16182]]\n\n     disabled beneficiary may need to secure, maintain, or regain \n     employment. SSA has established the Protection and Advocacy \n     to Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS) Program pursuant \n     to this authorization.\n       The Ticket to Work Act authorizes certain funding amounts \n     to be appropriated for these BPAO and PABSS programs for the \n     fiscal years 2000 through 2004.\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       This provision extends the authorization to appropriate \n     funding for these programs for another five fiscal years.\n\n                           Reason for Change\n\n       SSA cannot continue to fund the BPAO and PABSS programs \n     beyond fiscal year 2004 without an extension of \n     authorization. These programs provide essential vocational \n     rehabilitation and employment services for disabled \n     beneficiaries to secure, maintain, and regain employment and \n     reduce their dependency on cash benefit programs.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       Upon enactment.\n     Section 416. Coverage under divided retirement system for \n         public employees in Kentucky and Louisiana\n       The Manager's amendment would incorporate the House-passed \n     provision in place of the Committee's provision, and add the \n     State of Louisiana, as requested by its State Treasurer.\n     Section 418. 60-month period of employment requirement for \n         application of government pension offset exemption\n       The Manager's amendment would adopt the House-passed \n     provision with a revised effective date and transition rule. \n     This provision is effective with respect to individuals whose \n     last day of State or local government service occurs on or \n     after July 1, 2004. The Manager's amendment would adopt the \n     House-passed provision with a revised effective date and \n     transition rule. This provision is effective with respect to \n     individuals whose last day of State or local government \n     service occurs on or after July 1, 2004. The transition rule \n     allows State or local employees, who retire from government \n     employment within five years of enactment, to count previous \n     work within the same retirement system towards the 60-month \n     requirement. Such previous work must meet both of the \n     following criteria: (a) the work was covered under both \n     Social Security and the government pension system, and (b) \n     the work was performed prior to the date of enactment.\n       The Manager's amendment also consolidated existing \n     provisions of the Social Security Act in order to co-locate \n     the government pension offset provision with the provision on \n     which it is modeled, the dual entitlement rule for covered \n     workers.\n     Section 419. Disclosure to workers of effect of windfall \n         elimination provision and government pension offset \n         provision\n       The Manager's amendment re-designates Section 419 as \n     Section 420 and adds the following new section.\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       There are approximately 7.5 million workers who do not pay \n     taxes into the Social Security system. The majority of these \n     workers are State and local government employees. Many of \n     these government workers may eventually qualify for Social \n     Security as the result of other employment, or as the spouse \n     or survivor of a worker covered by Social Security. The \n     Government Pension Offset (GPO) and the Windfall Elimination \n     Provision (WEP) were enacted--in 1977 and 1983, \n     respectively--to provide more equitable treatment of covered \n     and non-covered workers.\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       This provision requires the Social Security Administration \n     to send a modified Social Security Statement to non-covered \n     employees that describes the potential maximum benefit \n     reductions that may result from the receipt of a Federal, \n     State, or local government pension based on employment that \n     is not subject to Social Security payroll taxes.\n       It also requires government employers to notify newly hired \n     non-covered employees of the potential maximum effect of non-\n     covered work on their Social Security benefits. The employer \n     shall obtain signed documentation of such notification from \n     the employee and transmit a copy to the pension paying \n     entity.\n\n                           Reason for Change\n\n       Organizations representing State and local employees report \n     their members are often unaware of the GPO and WEP provisions \n     until they apply for retirement benefits. The Committee \n     believes the Social Security Administration should utilize \n     the annual earnings statement mailed to every employee age 25 \n     and over to more explicitly inform State and local employees \n     about the GPO and WEP. It is important that these employees \n     also be informed about their options to become exempt from \n     these provisions by electing coverage under the Social \n     Security program.\n\n                             Efective Date\n\n       Government employers must provide notification of the \n     potential effect of non-covered work beginning with employees \n     hired on or after January 1, 2005. The Social Security \n     Administration must provide the modified Social Security \n     Statements beginning January 1, 2007.\n     Section 420A. Elimination of disincentives to return to work \n         for childhood disability beneficiaries\n       The Manager's amendment adds the following new section.\n\n                              Current Law\n\n       A Childhood Disability Beneficiary (CDB)--sometimes also \n     referred to as a Disabled Adult Child (DAC)--whose benefits \n     terminate because disability ceased can become re-entitled on \n     the parent's record only if he or she is disabled within the \n     7-year period following the month benefits terminate and is \n     not entitled to higher benefits on his or her own record.\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provisions would allow re-entitlement to childhood \n     disability benefits after the 7-year period if the \n     beneficiary's previous entitlement had terminated because \n     disability ceased due to the performance of Substantial \n     Gainful Activity (SGA) and the beneficiary is not entitled to \n     higher benefits on his or her own record. This provision \n     would not apply to beneficiaries whose previous entitlement \n     terminated based on medical improvement.\n\n                           Reason for Change\n\n       Prohibiting re-entitlement to childhood disability benefits \n     after the expiration of the 7-year period is a significant \n     disincentive to return-to-work for a CDB. Many CDBs find that \n     the benefits for which they qualify on their own work record \n     are less--often significantly less--than the benefits they \n     received as a CDB based on a parent's work history. The \n     permanent loss of benefits on the parent's record remains a \n     major disincentive for a CDB to attempt to return to work, \n     one not addressed by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives \n     Improvement Act of 1999. Although this provision is expected \n     to affect very few individuals, the change will make a \n     significant difference for those individuals in their efforts \n     to work to the fullest extent possible.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the first day of the seventh \n     month that begins after the date of enactment of this Act.\n     Section 426. Technical amendments to the Railroad Retirement \n         and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001\n       The Manager's amendment strikes subsections (e)(1) and \n     (e)(3).\n     Section 432. Modification of the dedicated account \n         requirements\n       The Manager's amendment strikes this section.\n     Section 434. Exclusion of Americorps and other volunteer \n         benefits for purposes of determining supplemental \n         security income eligibility and benefit amounts and \n         social Security disability insurance entitlement\n       The Manager's amendment strikes this section.\n     Section 439. Update of resource limit\n       The Manager's amendment strikes this section.\n     Section 440. Review of state agency blindness and disability \n         determinations\n       The Manager's amendment strikes this section.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 743, the Social Security Protection Act of 2003 as \nmodified. H.R. 743 is bipartisan legislation developed by Ways and \nMeans Social Security Subcommittee Chairman Shaw and Ranking Member \nMatsui. H.R. 743 passed the House by a vote of 396 to 28, and was \nreported by the Committee on Finance with unanimous support. In keeping \nwith the bipartisan tradition of the Senate Finance Committee and with \nthe bipartisan origins of this legislation, Senator Grassley and I have \nworked together to further refine this legislation for Senate \nconsideration.\n  H.R. 743 makes a number of important changes to the Social Security \nand Supplemental Security Income, SSI, programs. These changes will \naccomplish a number of important goals: they will enhance the financial \nsecurity of some of the most vulnerable beneficiaries of these \nprograms, increase protections to seniors from deceptive practices by \nindividuals in the private sector, reduce disincentives to employment \nfor disabled individuals, improve program integrity and thereby save \nmoney for the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and for \ntaxpayers, and make the Social Security program more equitable.\n  One of the most important results of this legislation will be to \nenhance the financial security of the almost 7 million Social Security \nand SSI beneficiaries who are not capable of managing their own \nfinancial affairs due to advanced age or disability. The Social \nSecurity Administration, SSA, currently appoints individuals or \norganizations to act as ``representative payees'' for such \nbeneficiaries. Most of these representative payees perform their roles \nconscientiously. However, some do not--indeed there have even been \ninstances of terrible abuse in this program.\n\n[[Page S16183]]\n\n  It is imperative that Congress take action to guard vulnerable \nseniors and disabled individuals from such abuse. This legislation \nincreases requirements for SSA to provide restitution to beneficiaries \nwhen representative payees defraud the beneficiaries of their benefits. \nThe legislation also tightens the qualifications for representative \npayees, increases oversight of the program, and imposes stricter \npenalties on those who violate their responsibilities. Finally, the \nlegislation provides--for the first time ever--that there will be a \none-time audit of a representative sample of representative payees to \nassess the extent to which representative payees are not using the \nbeneficiary's funds for the benefit of the beneficiary.\n  The legislation expands the protection to seniors and disabled \nindividuals by increasing the list of references to Social Security, \nMedicare and Medicaid which cannot be used by private-sector \nindividuals, companies and organizations to give a false impression of \nFederal endorsement. The legislation also protects seniors from those \nwho deceptively attempt to charge them for services that the seniors \ncould receive for free from SSA.\n  The legislation eliminates a disincentive to return to work for \nchildhood disability beneficiaries. The provision would make it easier \nto regain childhood disability benefits for disabled adult children who \nhad returned to work at one time. Additionally, H.R. 743 also includes \ntechnical amendments to improve the effectiveness of the Ticket to Work \nand Work Incentives Improvement Act, legislation passed in 1999 to help \nbeneficiaries with disabilities become employed and move toward self-\nsufficiency.\n  H.R. 743 improves program integrity by expanding the current \nprohibition against paying benefits to fugitive felons. As part of the \n1996 welfare reform law, Congress banned the payment of SSI benefits to \nthese individuals. However, under current law, fugitive felons can \nstill receive Social Security benefits under title II. This legislation \nprohibits the payment of title II Social Security benefits to fugitive \nfelons.\n  The bill also makes the Social Security program more equitable by \nincluding a provision to make an exemption to the Government Pension \nOffset more uniform. The Government Pension Offset, GPO, was enacted in \norder to equalize the treatment of workers in jobs not covered by \nSocial Security and workers in jobs covered by Social Security, with \nrespect to spousal and survivors benefits. The GPO reduces the Social \nSecurity spousal or survivors benefit by an amount equal to two-thirds \nof the Government pension. However, as a GAO report highlighted, State \nand local government workers are exempt from the GPO if their job on \ntheir last day of employment was covered by Social Security. In \ncontrast, Federal workers who switched from the Civil Service \nRetirement System, CSRS, a system that is not covered by Social \nSecurity, to the Federal Employee Retirement System, FERS, a system \nthat is covered by Social Security, must work for 5 years under FERS in \norder to be exempt from the GPO. H.R. 743 makes the exemption to the \nGovernment Pension Offset similar for State and local government \nworkers as for Federal Government workers.\n  I believe that each of the provisions of H.R. 743 deserve the support \nof the Senate. Moreover, in an attempt to expedite Congressional \npassage of this legislation, the changes that Senator Grassley and I \nwant to make to the bill as reported by the Finance Committee have \nalready been worked out with both the chairman and the ranking member \nof the Social Security Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee. Moreover, we have ``report language'' that has been agreed \nto by the chairman and the ranking member of the Social Security \nSubcommittee--as well as by the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Finance Committee which will be included in the Congressional \nRecord directly following the legislative language. This statement \nprovides details about each of the provisions of the legislation, as \nwell as the rationale behind each provision.\n  This legislation contains the types of improvements we can all agree \non, as demonstrated by the overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House, \nand the bipartisan, bicameral agreement of the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the committees of jurisdiction. I wholeheartedly urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to approve these sensible and important \nchanges.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Grassley \namendment at the desk be agreed to, the committee substitute, as \namended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2227) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 743), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                H.R. 743\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 743) entitled ``An Act to amend the Social Security Act \n     and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide additional \n     safeguards for Social Security and Supplemental Security \n     Income beneficiaries with representative payees, to enhance \n     program protections, and for other purposes.'', do pass with \n     the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Poison Control Center \n     Enhancement and Awareness Act Amendments of 2003''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Poison control centers are our Nation's primary defense \n     against injury and deaths from poisoning. Twenty-four hours a \n     day, the general public as well as health care practitioners \n     contact their local poison centers for help in diagnosing and \n     treating victims of poisoning and other toxic exposures.\n       (2) Poisoning is the third most common form of \n     unintentional death in the United States. In any given year, \n     there will be between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 poison \n     exposures. More than 50 percent of these exposures will \n     involve children under the age of 6 who are exposed to toxic \n     substances in their home. Poisoning accounts for 285,000 \n     hospitalizations, 1,200,000 days of acute hospital care, and \n     13,000 fatalities annually.\n       (3) Stabilizing the funding structure and increasing \n     accessibility to poison control centers will promote the \n     utilization of poison control centers, and reduce the \n     inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other \n     more costly health care services.\n       (4) The tragic events of September 11, 2001, and the \n     anthrax cases of October 2001, have dramatically changed our \n     Nation. During this time period, poison centers in many areas \n     of the country were answering thousands of additional calls \n     from concerned residents. Many poison centers were relied \n     upon as a source for accurate medical information about the \n     disease and the complications resulting from prophylactic \n     antibiotic therapy.\n       (5) The 2001 Presidential Task Force on Citizen \n     Preparedness in the War on Terrorism recommended that the \n     Poison Control Centers be used as a source of public \n     information and public education regarding potential \n     biological, chemical, and nuclear domestic terrorism.\n       (6) The increased demand placed upon poison centers to \n     provide emergency information in the event of a terrorist \n     event involving a biological, chemical, or nuclear toxin will \n     dramatically increase call volume.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \ntaking up and passing the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking, PACT, Act, \nS. 1177. I commend Chairman Hatch and Senator Kohl for introducing this \nlegislation and thank them for working with me, among others, to craft \nthe compromise language that we will consider today to crack down on \nthe growing problem of cigarette smuggling, both interstate and \ninternational, as well as to address the connection between cigarette \nsmuggling activities and terrorist funding. I am proud to join Senator \nHatch, Senator Kohl and others as a cosponsor of the underlying bill.\n  I also thank the National Association of Attorneys General and the \nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, for working with us and contributing to \nthe substitute language. I want to say a special thanks to Vermont \nAttorney General Bill Sorrell, who also serves as the current Chair of \nthe NAAG Tobacco Committee, for his valuable input on the problems with \ncigarette smuggling that States are facing and his support for this \ncompromise measure. I also want to thank the Vermont Grocers \nAssociation, the Vermont Retail Association, the Vermont Association of \nChiefs of Police, and the National Conference of State Legislatures for \ntheir support for this measure.\n  The movement of cigarettes from low-tax areas to high-tax areas in \norder to avoid the payment of taxes when the cigarettes are resold has \nbecome a public health problem in recent years. As State after State \nchooses to raise its tobacco excise taxes as a means of reducing \ntobacco use and as a source of revenue, many smokers have sought \ncheaper means by which to purchase cigarettes. Smokers can often \npurchase cigarettes and tobacco from remote sellers, Internet or mail \norder at substantial discounts due to avoidance of State taxes. These \nsellers, however, are evading their tax obligations because they \nneither collect nor pay the proper State and local excise taxes for \ncigarette and other tobacco product sales.\n  We have the ability to dramatically reduce smuggling without imposing \nundue burdens on manufacturers or law abiding citizens. By reducing \nsmuggling, we will also increase government revenues by minimizing tax \navoidance. My friend General Sorrell has told me that this has become a \nrapidly growing problem in Vermont as more and more tobacco product \nmanufacturers fail to collect and pay cigarette taxes. Criminals are \ngetting away with smuggling and not paying tobacco taxes because of \nweak punishments, products that are often poorly labeled, the lack of \ntax stamps and the inability of the current distribution system to \ntrack sales from State to State. These lapses point to a need for \nuniform rules governing group sales to individuals.\n  The PACT Act will give States the authority to collect millions of \ndollars in lost State tax revenue resulting from online and other \nremote sales of cigarette and smokeless tobacco. It also ensures that \nevery tobacco retailer, whether a brick-and-mortar or remote retailer \nof tobacco products, play by the same rules by equalizing the tax \nburdens.\n  Moreover, the PACT Act gives States the authority necessary to \nenforce the Jenkins Act, a law passed in 1949, which requires cigarette \nvendors to report interstate sales of cigarettes. This legislation \nenhances States' abilities to collect all excise taxes and verify the \ndeposit of all required escrow payments for cigarette and smokeless \ntobacco sales in interstate commerce, including internet sales. In \naddition, it provides Federal and State law enforcement with additional \nresources to enforce State tobacco excise tax laws.\n  Finally, at the request of the National Association of attorneys \ngeneral and many State attorneys general, we have added a new section \nto provide the States with authority to enforce the Imported Cigarette \nCompliance Act to crack down on international tobacco smuggling. This \nadditional authority should further reduce tax evasion and eliminate a \nlucrative funding source for terrorist organizations.\n  We must not turn a blind eye to the problem of illegal tobacco \nsmuggling. Those who smuggle cigarettes are criminals. I look forward \nto the Senate approving the bipartisan PACT Act today to close the \nloopholes that allow cigarette smuggling to continue. I urge the \nleaders of the House to follow our lead and pass this legislation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the proceeds of cigarette smuggling from low \ntax States has developed into a popular means of generating revenue for \norganized crime and even terrorist organizations. A recent \ninvestigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \nExplosives, BATFE, disrupted a smuggling scheme between North Carolina \nand Michigan, where the revenue generated was being funneled to \nHezbollah, a terrorist organization. It is evident that the \nconsequences of permitting this behavior to continue unchecked cannot \nbe underestimated.\n  To make matters worse, this problem is on the rise. According to the \nBATFE, 10 cigarette smuggling cases were initiated in 1998. That has \ngrown to approximately 160 in 2002.\n  Moreover, the sale of tobacco products over the Internet facilitates \nthe avoidance of State cigarette taxes, denying States the ability to \ncollect tax dollars they are owed--money the States need now more than \never.\n  The PACT Act take a commonsense approach to addressing these \nproblems. It increases penalties, provides more tools for enforcement, \nand closes loopholes in current law. These moderate, but important, \nchanges will further enable Federal, State, local, and tribal officials \nto crack down on tobacco smugglers and ensure that Internet tobacco \nsellers pay applicable taxes.\n  Despite being passed unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, some \nraised concerns over the legislation, particularly with respect to its \neffect on Indian Tribal sovereignty. After intensive negotiations with \nnumerous interested parties, including the Campaign for Tobacco Free \nKids, the National Association of Attorneys General, the Department of \nJustice and various tribal groups, we have been able to craft language \nthat will achieve the goals we set out to attain--to put an end to both \ncigarette trafficking and tobacco tax avoidance--while leaving the \nimportant principles of Indian Tribal sovereignty unaffected.\n  Tobacco companies and antitobacco groups, State law enforcement and \nFederal law enforcement, and Republicans and Democrats all agree that \nthis is an issue begging to be addressed. Today, we begin to provide \nthe relevant law enforcement authorities\n\n[[Page S16208]]\n\nwith the tools they need to put an end to these dangerous practices.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Hatch \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that the committee \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read the third time and passed; that the title amendment be \nagreed to; that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en \nbloc; and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
