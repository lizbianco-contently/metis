Under the previous order, the Senator from \nLouisiana, Mr. Breaux, will be recognized to deliver George \nWashington's Farewell Address.\n  Mr. BREAUX at the rostrum read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\n:To the people of the United States:\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\nadministration of the government the best exertions of which a very \nfallible judgment was capable. Not unconscious in the outset of the \ninferiority of my qualifications, experience, in my own eyes, perhaps \nstill more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to \ndiffidence of myself; and, every day, the increasing weight of years \nadmonishes me more and more that the shade of retirement is as \nnecessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any \ncircumstances have given peculiar value to my services, they were \ntemporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while choice and \nprudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not \nforbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\nwhether a common government can embrace so large a sphere? Let \nexperience solve it. To listen to mere speculation in such a case were \ncriminal. We are authorized to hope that a proper organization of the \nwhole, with the auxiliary agency of governments for the respective \nsubdivisions, will afford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well \nworth a fair and full experiment. With such powerful and obvious \nmotives to union, affecting all parts of our country, while experience \nshall not have demonstrated its impracticability, there will always be \nreason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may \nendeavor to weaken its bands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of \nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\nare subjected to the policy and will of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, \nlest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\nmany opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, to \npractice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to influence \nor awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small or weak \ntowards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the\n\n[[Page S1422]]\n\nhappy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors and dangers.\n     GEO. WASHINGTON.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1422-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1422-S1447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HEALTHY MOTHERS AND HEALTHY BABIES ACCESS TO CARE ACT OF 2003--MOTION \n                               TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to the consideration of \nS. 2061.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me welcome everybody back from the \nPresidents Day recess. I also thank Senator Breaux and congratulate him \non the delivery of George Washington's Farewell Address. He is the \n112th Senator to give the address. The first reading of George \nWashington's address actually occurred on February 22, 1862, during a \njoint session of Congress and was given by the Secretary of the Senate. \nBeginning in 1893, the Senate made the reading of the address an annual \ntradition. And since that time, each year, in an alternating fashion \nbetween the parties, George Washington's birthday is observed by the \nreading of the 7,641-word address. I commend Senator Breaux for his \ncontribution today.\n  Today the Senate will begin consideration of the motion to proceed to \nS. 2061, the OB/GYN medical liability bill. Chairman Gregg is here to \nmanage debate, and I encourage Senators to come to the floor to debate \nthis sorely needed women's health access issue.\n  Due to objections on the other side of the aisle, it was necessary to \nfile a cloture motion on this pending motion to proceed. That cloture \nvote on proceeding to the OB/GYN medical malpractice bill is scheduled \nfor tomorrow at 5 p.m. Therefore, there will be additional debate time \ntomorrow before the vote. However, I know many Members are interested \nin this bill and hopefully are prepared to speak today. We will have no \nrollcall votes today. The cloture vote will be the first vote tomorrow.\n  Over the next few minutes I would like to make a statement on the \nHealthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act.\n  Mr. President, our medical litigation system is failing the American \npublic. It is failing our communities, our hospitals, our doctors, and \nour families. Most importantly, it is failing our patients. Its purpose \nshould be to promote the common good and improve the health care of all \nAmericans through the fair and efficient resolution of meritorious \nmedical negligence claims. But instead of accomplishing this noble \ngoal, our litigation system is out of control. It is broken. It is \ncausing a health care crisis. Due to this broken system of medical \njustice, medical liability premiums are skyrocketing. The result: The \nsystem is in crisis.\n  The ultimate victims are the patients who see that their access to \ncare being threatened and in some cases their access to care is \ndisappearing altogether. In addition, this ailing system hurts our \nNation even more by directly and indirectly costing us billions of \ndollars. The situation is grave. It is being brought to the Senate \nfloor because it is grave, because the system is broken, and because \nthe crisis is getting worse by the day. Every day that we talk without \nacting is a day of continued decline.\n  We have all seen the headlines of the horror stories of hospitals \nclosing obstetric wards; of trauma centers having to shut their doors \nbecause of the liability crisis; of expectant mothers unable to find \nobstetricians, having to switch from obstetrician to obstetrician \nbecause their obstetrician is having to leave town or leave their \npractice; the stories of doctors dropping services of specialized care; \nthe stories of doctors having to move from a State where the liability \npremiums are so high that they can't afford it to other States where \neffective liability reform may have already taken place and they have \nlower premiums. The headlines go on and on and on. Almost daily there \nare fresh stories and new victims.\n  The problems are so severe that Time magazine, in its June 9 cover \narticle, devoted the article and the front page to this very problem. \nThe American Medical Association lists 19 States where access to \nquality care is in serious jeopardy right now. As a physician, as a \ndoctor, this crisis and the worsening of this crisis really strikes \nhome to me personally. When I go back home or travel around the country \nand talk to my physician colleagues, they tell me of personal stories \nthat are causing changes in the way they practice medicine. Many \ndoctors consider the current medical litigation system as the single \ngreatest threat to providing patients today with affordable, high-\nquality health care.\n  At first, the problem of skyrocketing medical liability costs \npresents doctors with uncomfortable choices. But in the end, it is the \npatients who are hurt. It is the patients who suffer. Skills of \nphysicians are redirected. They leave their practice. They are no \nlonger available to give care and patients receive less care. No longer \nis this a problem of an additional expense of doctors or for doctors \nall across the country; it is now an issue of health care for all.\n\n  What makes this situation so tragic is that highly qualified and \ncommitted doctors are literally being forced from their fields of \nmedicine, fields they have devoted their lives to, fields they cherish. \nWe are not talking about a few bad doctors who are leaving. Rather, we \nare talking about the very best men and women in the health care field \ntoday who have devoted their entire professional lives to healing \nothers. These good men and women don't want to drop these specialized \nservices such as trauma care, delivering babies, working in emergency \nrooms. They don't want to move from already underserved areas, either \nurban or rural. They don't want to stop seeing those expectant mothers. \nThey don't want to be unavailable if somebody comes to a trauma center \nor to an emergency room.\n  Tragically, and all too often, the current liability system leaves \nthem with no choice. The current system doesn't single out bad doctors \nor negligent acts or poor quality of medicine. Our medical litigation \nsystem has not made medical care in the United States safer or better. \nIn fact, in many cases it has made care just the opposite--less safe.\n  How? By discouraging doctors from sharing information that could \nprevent medical errors and by encouraging doctors to order unnecessary \nand costly tests that sometimes do more harm than good. The exploding \ncosts hit almost all doctors and hurt patients by driving up \nunnecessarily the cost of medical care of everyone who is listening to \nme right now. Your health care costs are higher because of these \nunnecessary and frivolous lawsuits. You are being affected. Our current \nmedical litigation system is the root cause of this crisis. It is an \ninefficient system that is full of perverse incentives. The current \nsystem hurts everyone seeking access to quality and affordable health \ncare, and it hurts the very negligently injured patients it is supposed \nto be helping.\n  The system encourages lawsuit abuse by rewarding trial lawyers who \nfile huge claims in friendly venues in search of the big payout. These \nlawyers often pocket up to 40 percent of any settlement or any payment \nthe injured patients receive. That is 40 cents on the dollar that the \ntrial lawyer pockets that does not get to that injured patient.\n  At the same time, many of the negligently injured patients--those who \ndeserve to be compensated--never receive any compensation at all \nbecause their legitimate claims are too small for that personal injury \nlawyer who is out there looking for his or her big payday.\n  (Mr. ROBERTS assumed the Chair.)\n  The system compensates a few at the expense of the many. The effects \nof these massive suits are staggering. Between 1995 and 2002, the \naverage claim payout for medical malpractice jumped 83 percent. Between \n1997 and 2002, the percentage of medical malpractice payments of a \nmillion dollars or more more than doubled.\n  The mere threat of huge jury awards forces many doctors and insurance \ncompanies to settle cases for large amounts, even if they are not \nguilty.\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\nThe current system encourages frivolous lawsuits, unnecessary lawsuits. \nMost of the cases filed in U.S. courts are without merit, with almost \ntwo-thirds being dropped or dismissed; that is, two out of three are \nbeing dropped or dismissed. Only 1 out of 20, or 5 percent of cases, \nactually go on to trial, and a staggering 80 percent of those cases are \nwon by the defendant. These numbers are clear evidence of the rampant \nabuse of the current system, and the system must be reformed.\n  It should be no surprise that this excessive litigation is forcing \nmalpractice premiums to rise dramatically. In 2002, physicians in many \nStates saw their premium rates rise by 30 percent or more. In some \nStates, for some specialties, malpractice insurance is rising by as \nmuch as 300 percent per year.\n  We debated this issue last July with a comprehensive bill, S. 11, the \nPatients First Act. That broad, comprehensive reform measure was \ndesigned to put our medical litigation system back to work for all \nAmericans. Bringing the bill forward in July was the first time that \nthe Senate had ever considered comprehensive medical litigation reform \nas its own freestanding bill. Unfortunately, the measure was never \nfully debated, as opponents of reform blocked it by filibustering the \nmotion to proceed.\n  Since that time, the horror stories have not stopped. In fact, they \nhave increased. Because this issue is so critical to the health of \nAmericans, and because this crisis continues to escalate, we will try \nonce again to address it on the floor of the Senate.\n  This time, instead of bringing up a broad, comprehensive bill and \nletting it suffer from the same political attacks as before, we have \nnarrowed our focus on one of the groups most severely hurt by the \ncrisis, obstetricians and gynecologists. More importantly, we want to \nfocus specifically on the health care needs of women and children and \nbabies. The underlying bill, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Access to \nCare Act of 2003, is narrowly tailored to focus on obstetricians, \ngynecologists, and other doctors who perform these services. In the \nmore narrow scope, the reform measures are almost identical to the ones \nin the more comprehensive bill, S. 11.\n  OB/GYNs, by the very nature of their work, are a higher risk \nspecialty group, so it is understandable that their liability premiums \nwould be somewhat higher than lower risk doctors. However, the amounts \nthat OB/GYNs are paying throughout the country for liability insurance \ntoday are staggering. For example, locally, in Virginia, OB/GYNs are \npaying up to $84,000 in medical liability premiums per year. At the \noutset, I will say all OB/GYNs have to have liability insurance. Today, \nall physicians have to buy medical liability malpractice insurance to \npractice. Locally, it is $84,000. In New York, they are paying up to \n$124,000 per year. In Pennsylvania, they are paying up to $153,000 per \nyear. In Florida, OB/GYNs are now paying up to an astonishing $250,000 \nin premiums each and every year to stay in the practice of delivering \nbabies. That is a quarter of a million dollars every year that \nobstetricians are paying in Florida.\n  I wish to stress once again that these are payments the doctors are \nmaking merely to purchase the liability insurance. Whether or not they \nhave ever had a case brought against them, whether or not there has \never been a medical error or mistake made at all, this is what many \nobstetricians are having to pay in these States. There is no added \nvalue in that $250,000 to health care. These payments are not helping \nthe patients live better lives or receive higher quality of health \ncare, and these amounts are not being paid just by a few bad doctors. \nThey are being paid by doctors who have never been sued, who are the \nbest in their profession, who have dedicated their lives to helping \nwomen and children.\n\n  Because of these skyrocketing premiums and the constant threat of \nlitigation, many obstetricians are leaving their practice because they \nsimply cannot afford it. Who can blame them? If an obstetrician \ndelivers 100 babies a year, and let's say just in Florida they are \npaying $250,000 for that opportunity to deliver babies, that is a tax \nof over $2,000 each time that obstetrician delivers a baby. If you are \na mother listening, or an expectant mother who is getting ready to go \nin the hospital, I am saying that there is an additional $2,000 tax \nthat the doctor is paying, which may well be passed on to you because \nsomebody has to pay it. That is money that doesn't add to the care of \nyour baby, or to the care of the delivery, or to the safety of the \ndelivery, or to health care itself.\n  Women living in rural areas have an additional problem. They are \nfinding now that there are too few doctors to deliver the babies in \nthese rural communities. By now, most of my colleagues have heard the \nhorror stories of women having to drive hours just to see an \nobstetrician, or in the course of a 9-month pregnancy, having two, \nthree, four, or five obstetricians because many doctors are having to \nleave either a region or the practice altogether. A June 9 Time \nmagazine article tells the tragic story of an expectant mother in rural \nArizona having to drive 2 hours on a desolate highway just to see a \ndoctor.\n  This should not happen in America. We should be encouraging \nphysicians to practice in rural, underserved areas, not chasing them \naway with the threat of frivolous lawsuits. It should be no surprise \nthat the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is one of \nthe strongest supporters of meaningful medical liability reform. Of \ncourse, they support this narrowly tailored bill. Their primary concern \nis women's access to affordable, quality health care. They are uniquely \nsituated to understand the threat the current system has placed on \nwomen's health and babies' health, and they are demanding action by \nCongress. They will not tolerate filibusters or blocking this issue. I \nurge my colleagues to listen to their unique concerns.\n  In a statement to the Senate Judiciary and HELP Committees last year, \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists very clearly \noutlined the problem facing women. They said:\n\n       An ailing civil justice system is severely jeopardizing \n     patient care for women and their newborns. Across the \n     country, liability insurance for obstetricians-gynecologists \n     has become prohibitively expensive. Premiums have tripled and \n     quadrupled practically overnight. In some areas, OB/GYNs can \n     no longer obtain liability insurance at all, as insurance \n     companies fold or abruptly stop insuring doctors.\n       When OB/GYNs cannot find or afford liability insurance, \n     they are forced to stop delivering babies, curtail surgical \n     services, or close their doors. The shortage of care affects \n     hospitals, public health clinics, and medical facilities in \n     rural areas, inner cities, and communities across the \n     country.\n\n  These are the words of the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, the ones on the front line in women's health care today.\n  The system is broken. The system is hurting women and babies today. \nThis was very clearly spelled to the Senate Judiciary and HELP \nCommittees last year.\n  I have a series of letters from doctors in Tennessee and, indeed, \nfrom around the country. At the appropriate time, I will enter several \nof these letters into the Record rather than take the time now because \nthere are Senators in the Chamber who wish to debate this particular \nissue. Let me simply say that as a physician, as majority leader, as a \nrepresentative of the people of the great State of Tennessee, I have \nletters from Paris, TN, from Athens, TN, Shelbyville, TN, from Memphis, \nTN, from obstetricians who are basically saying there is a crisis going \non and asking that we do something about it.\n  I do hope the opponents of reform at least acknowledge the severity \nand gravity of the problem and don't run from it once again. We must \nacknowledge the symptoms of the crisis before we start to address its \ncause. Unfortunately, these horror stories are truly just the tip of \nthe iceberg of the problems caused by our broken litigation system. The \nsystem costs our country directly and indirectly billions of dollars--\nwasted dollars, I would argue--each year. These costs are the sort of \ncosts that don't find their way into letters to us as elected officials \nor into newspaper articles, but they hurt the American people.\n  The fear of these outrageous lawsuits forces doctors, for example, to \npractice defensive medicine. Slowly, but surely, people are \nunderstanding what defensive medicine is. As a doctor, I know these \npressures all too well.\n  In order to avoid lawsuits--frivolous lawsuits--and to make sure they \nwould\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\nbe fully protected in the event they were called into question by an \nunnecessary or frivolous lawsuit, we find extra tests and procedures \nare ordered. They are unnecessary to the care of that particular \npatient or that particular patient's problem. It is a waste. Yet the \nsystem we have today incentivizes those unnecessary tests.\n  These extra steps add little, if anything, to the quality of health \ncare, but they add a lot to the bottom line of health care costs \nbecause hundreds of thousands of doctors actually order these \nunnecessary tests. The cost adds up.\n  We all hear of the $700 CAT scan or MRI scan for a routine headache \nthat an emergency physician orders simply out of practicing defensive \nmedicine. It is no surprise to me that surveys show 75 percent or more \nof doctors acknowledge practicing defensive medicine.\n  The exact number is hard to calculate, but reports have put the cost \nof defensive medicine at tens of billions of dollars per year. When you \nrealize that three out of four doctors frequently order tests or \nprocedures, these total dollar figures, indeed, are realistic. In fact, \na recent Government report estimated reasonable liability reform would \nsave the country health care costs of $70 billion to $126 billion per \nyear in defensive medicine expenditures.\n  In addition to these massive indirect costs, the Federal Government \nwould save over $14 billion directly over 10 years with comprehensive \nliability reform, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO \nattributes most of these savings to the Medicare and Medicaid programs \nwhich would experience lower health care costs. The Federal Government \nwould also realize savings from lower costs of health care benefits for \nFederal employees.\n  The current medical litigation system also impedes our ability to \nimprove patient safety. The threat of excessive litigation by \nunscrupulous lawyers discourages doctors from openly discussing medical \nerrors in ways that, if that discussion could take place, would \ndramatically improve health care delivery in this country.\n  These facts were outlined and well documented in the 1999 Institute \nof Medicine report ``To Err Is Human.'' That is why in addition to the \nreforms in this bill which hopefully we will be considering on the \nfloor of the Senate, most of us are strong supporters--or we should \nbe--of S. 720, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. This is \nvital legislation that will encourage a culture of safety and quality \nby providing for voluntary reporting of patient safety data without the \nfear of being sued.\n  Some of the opponents of the legislation we are debating today will \ntry to confuse the medical malpractice issue with patient safety. If \nyou listen closely, you will hear them say, in effect, that we need to \nmaintain our broken medical liability system in order to reduce medical \nmistakes. Do not be misled. This argument amounts to nothing more than \ndefending the status quo. In fact, as the IOM has said, and as we know \nfrom adopting voluntary reporting and learning systems in other \ncontexts, such as in general aviation--more lawsuits don't improve \nquality--they make matters worse.\n  Our health care system must put a greater emphasis on preventing \nmedical errors, not hiding or surpressing these errors due to fear of \nlawsuits. To create such a system, we must pass both patient safety \nlegislation and litigation reform. And I am committed to passing \npatient safety legislation too. It is now being blocked by at least one \nSenator on the other side of the aisle despite the fact that it has \npassed the HELP committee unanimously.\n  Fortunately, we know how to address the cause of the crisis because \nreform measures have already succeeded at the state level. The Healthy \nMothers, Healthy Babies Access to Care Act is based on these reforms. \nIt is a common sense measure that will restore balance to our broken \nlitigation system in the narrow area of OB/GYN services. It will \nprotect the right of the negligently injured patient to sue for just \ncompensation while curtailing lawsuit abuse. Though this bill has a \nnarrow scope, it is comprehensive reform with several critical \ncomponents. Let me briefly mention just a few key provisions.\n  The bill ensures that injured patients will receive a larger \npercentage of their award by limiting attorneys contingency fee to a \nreasonable sliding scale. For awards over $600,000, lawyers can keep 15 \npercent of any payment. Currently, lawyers in many states can take up \nto 40 percent of all awards and settlements, leaving the injured \npatient grossly undercompensated.\n  The bill places a statute of limitations of three years on bringing a \nsuit. This ensures that a suit will be brought in a timely manner and \nevidence preserved.\n  The bill controls excessive awards for noneconomic damages by placing \na $250,000 cap on these types of awards. Noneconomic damages are \nsubjective awards for pain and suffering that cannot be easily \nquantified. They contribute greatly to the personal injury lawyers' \nlawsuit abuse. Of note, the caps contained in this bill are \n``flexible'' and do not preempt state law. Thus, if a state has already \ndefined a different cap on noneconomic damages or subsequently passes a \ndifferent cap--whether higher or lower--that State designated cap \nprevails.\n  At the same time, the bill ensures that negligently injured patients \nwill receive full economic damages. Economic damages are the out-of-\npocket expenses that a victim might suffer due to a doctor's \nnegligence, such as hospital costs, doctor bills, long-term care, other \nmedical expenses, and lost wages. When a patient is negligently \ninjured, they deserve full economic recovery.\n  Experience at the State level clearly shows that comprehensive \nmedical liability reform works. The Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies \nAccess to Care Act is modeled after California's Medical Injury and \nCompensation Reform Act, or MICRA, which became law in the mid 70's. \nThanks to MICRA, California doctors and patients have been spared the \nmedical liability crisis that other states are facing. You simply don't \nhear the horror stories about OB/GYNs quitting their practice or women \nunable to find an obstetrician in California. This is true despite the \nfact that it is a big State with a high cost of living. In fact, since \nMICRA passed, total insurance premiums paid in California have risen by \nonly 167 percent while total insurance premiums paid for the rest for \nthe country have risen by 505 percent--more than three times as much.\n  Over the next day or two as we discuss this bill, opponents of reform \nwill likely go to great lengths to blame the current crisis on \ninsurance companies, the stock market, the bond market, doctors, \nhospitals and on and on. I fear we will hear this crisis blamed on just \nabout everyone and everything except for the true cause--the current \nlitigation system. The system is broken. This broken system is hurting \npatients and now is the time to fix it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Healthy Babies, Healthy Mothers \nAccess to Care Act. This narrowly tailored, commonsense reform of our \nbroken and inefficient medical litigation system will be a big step in \nimproving our health care system for all Americans. Passage of this \nmeasure will help ensure access to quality health care for women and \nbabies, protect negligently injured patients, and save our country \nbillions of dollars in health care costs every year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The highly competent clerk will now report the \nmotion to proceed.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 2061, a bill \n     to improve women's access to health care services and provide \n     improved medical care by reducing the excessive burden the \n     liability system places on the delivery of obstetrical and \n     gynecological services.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for up to 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens are printed in Today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire \nis recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Alaska in \ncongratulating Senator John Glenn on the honor he received.\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\n  I am rising today, however, to speak about the bill which is \nhopefully going to come before the Senate and on which the majority \nleader has been so eloquent, as he often is. Especially when there are \nissues concerning the care for other people, the majority leader has \ntruly established a record that is unique, certainly in the Senate, \nwith the hands-on experience of physically saving lives as a result of \nhis skills as a surgeon and a doctor. He has decided to bring to the \nSenate the issue of how we make sure women in this country have \nadequate access to doctors, especially during that period in their \nlives when they are delivering children.\n  I personally cannot think of anything more important to our culture \nthan babies. If we were to pick one event in the life of a citizen of \nthis country--or I suspect anywhere in the world--that really is an \nevent of great wonder and alters a person's view of the world and how \nthey work with the world, it is when one has a child. Certainly they \nwant to make sure their children are delivered in a safe way and with \nthe best medical help that can be obtained.\n  This is why this bill is so important, because trial lawyers do not \ndeliver babies. Doctors deliver babies. If we do not have enough good \ndoctors dealing with women who are about to deliver or who are becoming \npregnant or who believe they wish to have a child, and to deal with \nthem in a manner which allows women to have ready access so that they \ndo not have to drive miles in order to see their doctor or they do not \nhave to wait days in order to see a doctor because there are not any \navailable, if we do not have that structure in our society then we put \nat risk our ability as a society to have healthy children and to have \nmothers who are comfortable and feel safe about the experience of \nchildbirth. That is something that is serious.\n  Regrettably, that is where we have arrived as a society. Whether we \nlike it or not, we have arrived at a time where women in this country \nare at significant risk of not being able to see a baby doctor because \nthe baby doctors in this country are being driven out of the business \nby the cost of their errors and omissions insurance. That insurance has \nskyrocketed dramatically in the last few years as a result of lawsuits, \nand further in my statement I will get into some specific statistics \nthat will show why these lawsuits are occurring and what their impact \nhas been on the actual ability of doctors to practice, in a statistical \nterm.\n  All of us who work in this area of trying to address the concerns of \ngetting women decent access to doctors so they can have children safely \nhave heard stories and anecdotes which are so regrettably consistent in \nthe sadness of the tales that there has to be a great deal of truth to \nthem. It is also supported by the numbers and statistics.\n  Last week I had the chance to meet with four obstetricians in New \nHampshire. Two of them had to get out of the business of delivering \nbabies. It was the favorite part of their practice. They were OB/GYNs. \nThe cost of their insurance had increased so dramatically they could no \nlonger afford to go into the operating room and deliver a child. \nNeither of those two doctors had ever had a claim against them relative \nto the children they had delivered before they gave up the practice, \nand they delivered quite a few.\n\n  Two of the other doctors were still delivering babies, but they had \nsignificantly curtailed their practice or their practice had been \ndramatically impacted by the cost of their insurance. One doctor told \nus everything he earned in the first 5 months of his practice every \nyear went to pay his insurance premiums relative to a potential claim \nagainst him, and he never had a claim against him personally. There had \nnever been a claim. Yet his premiums had jumped over 100 percent in the \nlast 3 years. He was finding it very difficult to stay in the business \nof delivering children, but because he was the only doctor in that part \nof our State who was really doing that, he felt a social obligation to \ncontinue delivering babies, as well as the fact that he personally \nloved the practice of delivering babies. It was getting to a point \nwhere he was not sure how much longer he could do this.\n  Also at this meeting there were two doctors who should have been \nthere but were not because they had left the practice. They were two \ndoctors from northern New Hampshire, which is a rural part of our \nState. They are no longer practicing and delivering our children. As a \nresult, there is no doctor in northern New Hampshire today who delivers \nbabies. There is no OB/GYN because they have been driven out of the \npractice of medicine. Those two doctors have left the practice in that \narea. One moved to another State and the other simply dropped the \nbusiness of delivering babies.\n  The stories go on. They are real and they impact real people. In \norder to see a doctor, a woman in northern New Hampshire today who is \npregnant has to now drive from Colebrook, NH, probably down to Hanover, \nNH, or at least down to Littleton at the closest, which is a long \ndrive. It is a curvy road and in the winter it is a difficult drive. \nEven though people are comfortable driving in the winter in New England \nand in New Hampshire, we can get some serious snow and ice and it can \nbe very testy and sometimes one cannot even get through because the \nsnow cannot get removed in time or it is too heavy. So that woman is at \nrisk, and it is not just in New Hampshire.\n  This is a photograph of a woman from Arizona named Melinda Sallard. \nShe was forced to drive about 45 miles in order to deliver her child. \nIn the first 2 blocks, they drove by the hospital that was next door to \ntheir house, but there was no OB/GYN doctor there because they had \ngiven up the practice, so she had to drive 45 miles to the hospital. On \nthe way, she had the baby in Arizona. The baby's heartbeat had actually \nstopped while she delivered it in the car, and while her husband kept \ndriving to the hospital, she was able to start the baby's heartbeat \nagain and the baby survived. Now we see the photograph, but it was \nrisky and it was traumatic. She should have had a doctor in the \nhospital that was almost next door to her house, but she did not. She \ndid not because the doctors in that hospital had to give up the \npractice.\n  We have Dr. Schmitt, one of the best doctors in North Carolina, \naccording to the patients who saw him deliver babies, who loved the \npractice, but because the cost of his insurance went up so much as a \nresult of the potential of a suit, of which I understand he had never \nhad any, he had to give up the practice. This is a picture of the \ndoctor and I think just about the last child he delivered. The child is \nnot very happy about being the last child he delivered. He does not \nhave a smile on his face. He wanted the doctor to deliver other \nchildren. Dr. Schmitt had to give up the practice. He actually moved \nbecause he could not maintain the premiums that were driving up costs \nso extraordinarily.\n  What is causing this? Essentially, it is being caused by lawsuits, \nmany of them frivolous. In fact, there is a statistic that says only 4 \npercent of the lawsuits against OB/GYNs have a recovery. The rest are \nfrivolous--not all frivolous, maybe, but the majority are. The rest \ndon't lead to any recovery at all. But as a result of those 4 percent \nof lawsuits getting astronomical recoveries, the whole pool of coverage \ncosts for all baby doctors has increased so dramatically that they have \nbeen driven out of the business or they have been put in a position \nwhere they can no longer deliver children in a manner which is either \nfair or accessible for many women.\n  We are at serious risk of having this discipline so contracted that \nwe will end up rationing care in this area, which could be very serious \nand unfortunate for women. It is a function of the fact that our legal \nsystem has run amok relative to baby doctors and the women who need to \nsee those baby doctors. I have heard our candidates from the other side \nof the aisle, both of whom are Members of this body--I have heard \nSenator Kerry say: I have spent my career fighting against special \ninterests. I think he has said that almost every day, but that is a \ndirect quote from the newspaper where he said it in Boston. ``I spent \nmy career fighting against special interests.''\n  Where is he fighting for these women? Where is he when these women \nwant to see a OB/GYN and they can't? I suggest maybe he is fighting for \nthe special interests on the other side of the coin, those who are the \ntrial lawyers. For some reason the trial lawyers\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\nappear to have the ear of the majority--not the majority but of enough \nso we cannot even hear about this bill on the floor much less vote on \nit. We should at least be able to take up the bill. But, no, no, the \ntrial lawyers aren't going to let us take up this bill. We are not even \ngoing to be allowed to debate it on the floor and have votes on \namendments.\n  Maybe some who spent their career fighting special interests could \ncome down to this floor and explain that one to me. Explain to me why \nDr. Schmitt isn't practicing medicine anymore. There is somebody who \nneeds someone to fight for him. Explain to me why Mrs. Sallard had to \ndrive 45 miles and have her baby in the car. Explain to me why we don't \nhave a doctor in Colebrook, NH, who will deliver babies or see people \nwhen they want to have babies. Explain that to me if you want to talk \nabout fighting special interests or maybe come down and explain to me \nwhy trial lawyers are right. Then you say you fight against special \ninterests. There is an irony there.\n  I have heard Senator Edwards say: ``I want to make health care a \nbirthright for every single child born in this country.'' That is \nSenator Edwards in the Des Moines Register--``every single child born \nin this country.'' Senator, come down and explain to us how children \nare going to be born if their mother cannot see a doctor. What type of \nrisk is that child going to be at when they are born if the mother \ncannot see a doctor in Colebrook?\n  This bill is being held up because there are interests out there that \ndo not want to bring this issue to the floor of the Senate even for \ndebate. They just want to stiff-arm it on behalf of an interest in this \ncountry which believes that it should have the right to bring these \nsuits but has, as I said, 96 percent of them thrown out of court and in \nthe same manner throws out of the delivery room the doctors, throws out \nthe women to be on their own to look for a doctor miles away, at great \ninconvenience.\n\n  This is a battle of special interests. My special interest in this \none happens to be babies and mothers. Somebody else's special interest \nhappens to be the trial bar. I am happy to defend this special \ninterest, babies and mothers, on the Senate floor today. I would like \nto know why the other side is not willing to let us have this bill come \nforward.\n  Let's get into some specifics about the size of the problem. The next \nchart we have shows the cover of Newsweek, which ran a very good piece \non ``Lawsuit Hell, How Fear of Litigation is Paralyzing Our \nProfessionals.'' Right in the middle is a doctor. It could be a \nmidwife. Remember, midwives are as much affected by this as doctors. \nBut essentially it is those people you see when you most need them, and \nespecially if you are a woman and you want to have children. That \nperson's career is paralyzed, and as a result of their career being \nparalyzed, our ability to get adequate health care is paralyzed. It is \na good story. I recommend it to everybody.\n  I want to make the point this is about women and it is about women's \nright to access decent health care. So speaking on behalf of that \nspecial interest--I know Senator Kerry is fighting against special \ninterests, and he is probably fighting against this special interest, \nbut I want to put something on the record. I don't want to put it in \nthe Record because we will ruin the Record, but I want to mention that \nwe have 85,000 petitions. Eighty-five thousand women have signed \npetitions asking that we at least consider this bill, where we at least \nget a vote on whether or not their doctors can have some protection. \nEighty-five thousand women want to see a doctor, want to be safe when \nthey get into those child-bearing years. They want to have the \nopportunity to have safe medical care.\n  So we have brought those petitions here today. I am obviously not \ngoing to put them in the Record. I don't want the American taxpayer to \nhave the expense of printing this. But I want to make it clear this is \nabout real people, women who need health care, and especially need it \nwhen they are about to have children.\n  The extent of this crisis is significant. It is not limited to New \nHampshire, although New Hampshire has a very definite problem. The \nAmerican Medical Association has developed this chart which basically \ncolor-codes States on the effect of the medical liability crisis on the \navailability of doctors. There are a number of States in this country \nwhere it is getting to be critical, where you are in a crisis mode if \nyou want to see a doctor because you may not be able to see one. Those \nare the States in red.\n  If you recall, in West Virginia the doctors actually weren't \navailable for some time because of that issue. In Pennsylvania the same \nproblem arose. It arose in State after State, large States with large \npopulations: Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, and smaller \nStates, too, such as Wyoming. Every one of those red States is in \ncrisis. That means there is a real problem, that you may not be able to \nsee a doctor when you want to have a child or getting to see that \ndoctor will be difficult.\n  The yellow States are the ones moving toward crisis. This is not an \nabating problem; it is a growing problem. Only the white States, and \nthere are very few of them, have been able to get their acts together, \nand we will find out why in a few minutes when we start talking about \nwhat States have passed limitations on liability insurance, and that \nbeing the issue.\n\n  I want to take a specific look at a specific State which is in \ncrisis: New York. New York State--I just picked New York out \narbitrarily--is in crisis. This is for baby doctors. There are seven \ncounties in New York where there are no obstetricians, where, if you \nare an expectant mother and you want to go see a doctor, you cannot \nstay in the county you are in. Some of those counties have a fairly \nhigh delivery rate: 200 in this county, 289, 215, 322 children. This is \non an annual basis.\n  Then there are a number of other counties which only have one \nobstetrician, and some of those counties have even larger numbers of \ndelivery rates. So you are dealing with some people who are having to \ndrive a heck of a long way in order to see a doctor. And New York State \ncan get pretty cold and snowy, especially around Buffalo and Syracuse, \nwhere, as far as I can tell, it always snows except for in June and \nJuly. In any event, it can be hard to drive if you are an expectant \nmother. You can be under a lot of pressure to get to those doctors.\n  It is not that they can't practice in those counties; it is that they \ncannot afford to practice in those counties. Why can't they? This \nproblem is a uniquely rural problem in some ways. In order to pay that \ninsurance premium, which is so high and has gotten so extraordinarily \nhigh over the last few years--in order to pay that premium you \nbasically have to deliver a lot of babies.\n  If a doctor has a practice in a rural area, not generating a huge \namount of births, then you cannot work hard enough or deliver enough \nbirths to pay your premium. The doctor I mentioned from Laconia, NH--by \nour standards a fairly populous area of our State; not overly populated \nbut a fairly decent community--has to work 5 months to pay just his \ninsurance premium. If he were working in Colebrook, obviously, he would \nhave had to work all year to pay the insurance premium and then he \nwould not have earned enough to pay the premium. That is why we have no \nOB/GYN in Colebrook, NH. There are not enough babies being delivered. \nThe premiums have gone up so radically they cannot afford to continue \nto practice.\n  I am sure there are a lot of places in the Presiding Officer's State \nof Kansas which have the exact problem. I know parts of Kansas are \nreasonably rural. Those folks probably have to drive a long way to see \na doctor. Kansas is a big State compared to New Hampshire. It is flat, \nso it is an easy drive, but still it is a long drive.\n  Let's talk about some of the statistics so this is not just \nanecdotal: 72 percent of the OB/GYN doctors in Pennsylvania surveyed \nhave changed their practice to reduce their liability--that means they \nhave stopped delivering babies; 75 percent of the OB/GYN doctors in \nWest Virginia, as well; 71 percent in Kentucky. There are dramatic \ndrops in doctors willing to deliver babies or do any high-risk \nprocedures at all.\n  OB/GYN doctors in New Hampshire experienced a 100-percent increase in \npremiums within 3 years. That is a staggering number. As I mentioned \nearlier, only 4 percent of the lawsuits\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\nbrought relative to OB/GYN practices actually lead to recovery. That is \nstaggering because it shows there are a lot of frivolous lawsuits.\n  What is the way to resolve this? There are a lot of moving parts in \nthe health care question. I am not saying the only issue that affects \ncosts that the OB/GYN doctor incurs during their practice is the \nliability issue, the insurance issue, the issue driven by lawsuits \nwhich have no relationship to a doctor's practice because the doctor \nhas never been sued. There are other factors. There is technology, \nhospital associations, all sorts of factors. Obviously, the insurance \nindustry has gone through some significant adjustments, especially in \nthe rate of return on investments as a result. But we know the single \nmost significant factor by far is the increase in costs of the \ninsurance policy. That is the item that is most affecting the ability \nof the doctors to continue to practice.\n  We also know those States which have taken action in this area have \nactually been able to control the costs so the doctors are no longer \nfeeling pressure at that level. The best example is California. \nLiability reform occurred in California, with caps, in 1977. As a \nresult, in the California cost increase experience, premiums have gone \nup 182 percent compared with the rest of the United States, which has \ngone up 573 percent. The chart shows the difference. It reflects the \nfact that if you put in a responsible approach to premiums to liability \ninsurance, you can control the rate of growth of the cost and, as a \nresult, you can create more availability of doctors and more affordable \nhealth care.\n  This chart shows that reform works. The bottom line reflects \nobstetrics. The first two areas, Los Angeles and Denver, have in place \nlaws which limit recovery in the area of pain and suffering. Their \nbasic premium for a policy of $1 million/$3 million is $54,000 and \n$33,000. The next four jurisdictions do not have those laws: New York, \nLas Vegas, Chicago, and Miami. Premiums in Miami are almost four times \nhigher than Los Angeles, which would be a comparable city, and about \nseven times higher than Colorado; Chicago, two times higher; Las Vegas, \ntwo times higher; New York, 1\\1/2\\ times higher than Los Angeles; two \ntimes higher than Denver. That reflects the fact that if you put in \nresponsible reform in the area of liability insurance you can control \nthose premium costs.\n\n  What is responsible reform? It is reform that addresses the primary \nconcerns of a person who is injured but also addresses the fact that we \nhave a large number of frivolous lawsuits being brought and a large \nnumber of lawsuits leading to extraordinary recoveries, which costs are \nbeing passed on to all the OB/GYN baby doctors in this country. As a \nresult, baby doctors who have absolutely no history of malpractice are \nforced out of practice and mothers are not able to see their doctors \nand are being limited in access.\n  This bill tries to address that. First, it says right off the top \nthat a State has the right to make a decision on what the cap will be. \nWe have essentially addressed this issue of States rights. We put in a \ncap that if a State wants to go above it they can go above it; if they \nwant to go below it, they can go below. We also say there is no \nlimitation on recovery for medical costs.\n  There was a recent decision where, unfortunately, there was a severe \ninjury and the child would need medical care for years. The bill came \nto something like $18 million. That would be an award that could occur \nif that was the child's medical costs; that could be recovered--whether \n$18 million, $10 million, $5 million, even more, $20 million. \nHopefully, that will not happen too often but if it does the parents \nhave a right to that recovery.\n  As to lost compensation, if the mother is injured and there is a loss \nof compensation, if she has a job that she can no longer go back to or \nis limited in her ability to get a job, there is absolutely no limit as \nto what the recovery is relative to her compensation. If she is going \nto have a lifetime expectancy earning of $10 million, discounted to \nwhatever that is, she gets that recovery.\n  What we do not have in this bill, or what we try to cap because this \nis where the costs have gone out of control, this is what is driving \nthe premium rates, is a limit on pain and suffering, which is basically \nthe money that is thrown on top. Pain and suffering is what a jury \nfeels when they hear a sad story that they think deserves an extra \nbonus award. That is limited to $250,000 under this bill. That is a \nreasonable limit. Most States are at that number that have acted in \nthis area. But if a State wants to go above that area, it can step out \nof that and pass a higher amount.\n  The practical effect of this bill, should it pass, is that the 85,000 \nwomen who have written to us, the literally hundreds of thousands of \nwomen who are worried whether they will have a good doctor to see or \neven whether they will be able to see a doctor or whether they will \nhave to drive many, many miles to see a doctor, putting themselves at \nrisk, those women's concerns will be addressed to some degree because \nwe will make practicing medicine in the area of delivering babies \naffordable again. We can get a doctor back in Colebrook. A doctor will \nnot have to work 4 or 5 months of the year just to pay his or her \npremium. Doctors who love to deliver babies in Dover, NH, will be able \nto get back into the business of delivering babies because they will be \nable to afford the premium.\n\n  That is what this is all about. It is about giving women the \nopportunity to have access to good doctors who can deliver babies and \nhave those babies be healthy. Why we are not even going to be allowed \nto vote on going to this bill is beyond me, but that, I understand, is \na position the Democratic leadership has taken. It seems ironic in the \nface of Senator Edwards' statement, which I will read again, as the \npotential standard bearer of his party: ``I want to make health care a \nbirthright for every single child born in the country.''\n  It is going to be hard for children to be born if they cannot see \nbaby doctors. I do not understand why we cannot at least debate this \nissue on the Senate floor and have a vote on it. Senator Kerry would \nappear to want to do this because he wants to fight special interests. \nWell, I want to promote this special interest--which is children, \nmothers, expectant mothers, and doctors who deliver babies. So if the \nother side wishes to oppose those three constituencies, that is their \nchoice. But I think they need to explain to us why it is good for a \nmother, good for a baby, or good for a baby doctor that the practice of \nmedicine is being curtailed in this country in the very critical \ndiscipline of obstetrics.\n  Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Vermont wants the floor \nso I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nKansas, the Presiding Officer. And I thank my friend from New Hampshire \nfor his usual courtesy in allowing me to have the floor. I will talk \nabout the same issue.\n  I am really disappointed there seems to be politics being played in \nthis medical malpractice insurance debate. I feel a little bit like \nClaude Rains in ``Casablanca.'' I feel like saying: I am shocked--\nshocked--in an election year we may find politics being played on what \nwe all acknowledge is a serious matter.\n  What we have before us is a one-size-fits-all bill. It is a one-size-\nfits-all bill for a problem that varies greatly from State to State. \nThis bill would actually encroach on the rights of every State--my \nState of Vermont, the distinguished Presiding Officer's State of \nKansas, the State of New Hampshire, all others. It would yank away from \nour States legal rights and legal responsibilities they now have. And \nif history is any kind of a predictor, they would take those rights \naway forever. I think we have to show great care in the Senate when we \nwant to so trample the rights of our individual States.\n  The American public assumes the 100 Members of the U.S. Senate--if \nthey are going to do something to drastically change the lives of \npeople in all 50 States, if they are going to drastically step in and \nset aside the legislatures of the 50 States--would do it only after \ncareful consideration. But instead we have short-circuited our own \nprocedure. Usually, when we have a bill, as everybody knows from civics \n101, it is introduced, it is sent to the appropriate committees, \nhearings are held, debate is held in the committees,\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\namendments are voted on, and then it is sent to the floor--but people \nhave had a chance, both for and against the bill, to come in and \ntestify.\n\n  Certainly, the Governors of the various States would have a chance to \ncome in and say either we want you to just trample our rights and \ntrample our legislature, trample our own authority or we do not. In \nthis case, that did not happen. In this case, the bill was just written \nup in a couple lobbying shops down on K Street and brought up here for \npeople willing to introduce it at the request of those lobbyists. And \ninstead of letting States find solutions that are best for their \ncitizens, the Republican majority prefers this attempt to tally points \non some election year political scoreboard for what are powerful \nspecial interests, but they are going to do it at the public's expense.\n  Instead of looking at the big picture, the overly broad antitrust \nimmunity that the insurance companies get, or the fact that a lot of \ninsurance companies made a lot of poor calls in the stock market and \nlost a lot of money and are now saying, well, the doctors can pay \nhigher premiums to pay it back--instead of looking at ways to reduce \nmedical errors so there would be less suits--what they have said is \nthat we have to help these big insurance companies--not help the \nindividual States, not help the people involved. We will help the \ninsurance companies.\n  No matter they are unwilling to clamp down and ask for higher medical \nstandards, no matter they have lost billions playing the roulette \nwheels in the stock market, no matter they do not want to debate, it is \nan election year and their lobbyists came up and said we really want \nthis bill, so here it is.\n  Here is a bill that would take a chain saw to the legal rights of the \nAmerican people and to the prerogatives of each of the 50 States that \nwe take an oath to represent in the Senate. It has been tried before. \nIt did not work. This time the bill is limited to obstetrical and \ngynecological care. Actually, it is not just making sure the insurance \ncompanies are helped out. But what the majority says and what the \nlobbyists say is they want to limit the legal rights of the most \nvulnerable patients: mothers and infants. It is unfortunate because we \ndo have a health care system that is in crisis. We hear that so often \nthat the force of it tends to diminish, but that truth is one we have \nto confront. The crisis is one that has to be tackled and solved.\n  Dramatically rising medical malpractice insurance rates are forcing \nsome doctors to abandon their practices or to cross State lines where \nit might cost less. So many times, of course, these insurance rates \nhave gone up even though there have been no cases that would indicate \nwhy they have.\n  Patients who need care in high-risk specialties, such as obstetrics, \nand patients in areas that are already underserved, such as many rural \ncommunities in my State and the Presiding Officer's State, are too \noften left without adequate care.\n  What I find amazing is that here we are, the richest and most \npowerful Nation on Earth, and instead of simply being able to do what \nmost Democratic nations do--that we would assure access to quality \nhealth care for all our citizens--we are saying: No, we will allow our \ndoctors and our providers to be driven from their calling by the \nmanipulations of some of the insurance companies.\n  That is why I was hoping we would have a real debate, we would have \nreal hearings, to find out what is happening, that we would find out \nwhat happens when you give antitrust immunity to the insurance \ncompanies to set rates however they might want.\n  Different States, though, have different experiences with medical \nmalpractice insurance. Many of these States are not seeing rates \nskyrocket, but the State's insurance remains largely a State-regulated \nindustry. Are we going to say that even for those States that have much \nlower insurance rates, we are going to say, tough, no matter what you \nhave been doing, no matter what you did to make things work right, \ntough, because we are going to throw that all out. We are just going to \nwipe you off the books. We are going to wipe off your State control \nbecause we, the 100 Members of the Senate, understand it so much better \nthan you possibly could. We know so much better than your 50 Governors, \nyour 50 legislatures, and we know it so well we are able to do this \nwithout any hearings, without any discussions, without any work from \nthe outside?\n  We are able to do it because we are U.S. Senators. And we know that \nwhat was handed to us by the lobbyists when they drafted this bill must \nbe right because, after all, they come to our fundraisers.\n  I don't think it should be that way. I don't think that my own State \nof Vermont should be set aside when our Governor and our legislature \nare working to try to find the best solution for our small State.\n  I think of the one time we did have a hearing on this in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee--not this bill but a predecessor bill--when Linda \nMcDougall came here. It was pretty tragic. She told us that she had had \na double mastectomy because they made a mistake. She wasn't supposed to \nhave had any mastectomy, but somebody read the papers wrong and that is \nwhat happened.\n  If the Senate is able to pass this bill and get it signed into law, \nshe would still be allowed to recover, for what was gross negligence, a \ntotal of $250,000. That is about what Senators make in around a year \nand a half. Which do you think she would rather have? Would she rather \nhave her body back intact or the $250,000? Please.\n  Arbitrarily limiting injured patients' remedies under the law without \naddressing systemwide medical errors that result in patient harm and \ndeath is a recipe for failure. We should be asking what were the things \nthat went wrong; how did these things happen that such a terrible \nmistake was made?\n  We are fortunate in this Nation to have many highly qualified medical \nprofessionals. I think in my own little State of Vermont how fortunate \nwe are to have extremely good physicians. Unfortunately, sometimes even \ngood doctors make errors. If there is no pressure on the insurance \ncompanies, no pressure on the medical societies to keep the standards \nup, why should they go up? If the Senate, in its infinite wisdom, can \ntake a lobbyist bill and just pass it and stop them from having to \nworry, why should they worry?\n  We must do all we can to support the men and women who commit their \nprofessional lives to caring for others, but we must also ensure that \npatients have access to adequate remedies if they receive inadequate \ncare.\n  Let's understand, notwithstanding what the insurance companies' \nlobbyists tell us, high malpractice insurance premiums are not the \ndirect result of malpractice lawsuit verdicts. They are the result of \ninvestment decisions by the insurance companies and business models \ngeared toward ever increasing profits, as well as the cyclical \nhardening of the liability insurance market. In cases where insurers \nmade a bad investment and experienced the same disappointment from Wall \nStreet that many other Americans have, it should not be able to recoup \nits losses from the doctors it ensures. The insurance company should \nbear the burden of its own business model, just as every other business \nin this country ought to do.\n  A nationwide arbitrary capping--with no hearings--of awards available \nto victims, as the Republican majority has proposed, should not be the \nfirst and only solution turned to in a tough medical malpractice \ninsurance market.\n  I might ask my friends, does anybody think if we pass this bill, if \nwe override the legislatures of Texas or New Hampshire, Ohio, Vermont, \nor anywhere else, if we override all those legislatures and pass what \nthe lobbyists and the fundraisers have asked us to pass here--this \nbill, with no hearings, no committee work, just came from the pens of \nK Street, I suppose--does anybody think if we pass this pig in a poke \nthat these medical malpractice rates are going to come down? Come on. I \nhave a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you if you believe that.\n\n  We can pass this. We can help the insurance companies out of their \nbad investments. We can make sure that people who have been severely \ninjured through medical malpractice are unable to recover for it. We \ncan do all those things. But I guarantee you, the rates will not come \ndown. We have seen enough other times when we passed special interest \nlegislation supposedly\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\nto help consumers and it has helped businesses. It has not helped the \nconsumers.\n  What we ought to be doing is conducting thoughtful and collaborative \nconsideration in committee that might achieve a sensible solution that \nis fair to patients, that supports our medical professionals and their \nability to practice. I suggest one thing we might do is take away the \nblanket exemption from Federal antitrust laws that the insurance \nindustry has. Insurers have for years had this novel exemption that \nnobody else has enjoyed. The McCarran-Ferguson Act permits insurance \ncompanies to operate without being subject to most of the Federal \nantitrust laws. Do you think our Nation's physicians, our doctors and \ntheir patients, have benefited by allowing the insurance companies to \noperate without being subject to most of our antitrust laws? Of course, \nthey have not. They have not used this exemption from antitrust laws to \nbenefit the patients. They have not used it to benefit the doctors they \ninsure. They have used it to benefit themselves.\n  With this antitrust exemption, they can collude to set rates, \nresulting in higher premiums, certainly higher than real competition \nwould achieve. And because of the exemption, law enforcement officials \ncan't even investigate the collusion.\n  If we want to do something, let's get rid of the antitrust exemption \nthat let's them set doctors' premiums anywhere they want. Let's get rid \nof the antitrust exemption that allows them to recoup their losses in \nthe stock market--not losses for malpractice cases--by just charging \never higher premiums.\n  More than a year ago, I introduced the Medical Malpractice Insurance \nAntitrust Act, S. 352. Senators Reid, Kennedy, Durbin, Edwards, \nRockefeller, Feingold, Boxer, and Corzine cosponsored the legislation. \nIt would modify McCarran-Ferguson with respect to medical malpractice \ninsurance and then only for the most pernicious antitrust offenses: \nprice fixing, bid rigging, and market allocation. These are the \nanticompetitive things that affect premiums.\n  I can't imagine how anybody could object to a prohibition on \ninsurance carriers fixing prices or dividing territories. After all, \nall the other industries in our Nation have to abide by these laws or \nthey pay the consequences. So we will find out who really carries sway \nhere. Is it the insurance companies and their lobbyists or is there \nsome indication that the American people may still have a voice in the \nSenate?\n  Let's find out what happens when we bring up an amendment to remove \nthe antitrust exemption these insurance companies now have. This \nlegislation languished for a long time. We actually had hearings on \nthis. But the one that is written downtown comes straight to the floor.\n  If we are really serious about controlling rising medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums, we have to limit the broad exemption to Federal \nantitrust law and promote real competition in the insurance industry, \nand work at reducing medical errors across the health care system. This \npartisan bill doesn't do that.\n  This partisan bill is designed to be a talking point for fundraisers. \nIt is not designed to help doctors in rural, underserved areas to be \nable to pay their medical malpractice insurance. It doesn't help the \nwomen and children in this country who need these medical specialties. \nIt may help insurance companies and fundraisers, but it doesn't help \nanybody. If we are going to pass something, let's pass something real.\n  I see my good friend from Texas and my friend from Ohio on the floor. \nWhen I started speaking, there was nobody else seeking recognition. My \ngood friend, Senator Gregg, was kind enough to yield when I came here. \nI will be speaking more on this, but I will yield to whichever Senator \nwants the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act \nof 2003.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am happy the majority leader has seen \nfit to bring this important issue to the floor. I will have some \nspecific comments about the bill in just a moment.\n  I believe our civil justice system is badly broken insofar as it \nserves the interests of the few at the expense of the many. What I mean \nby that is our system of resolving civil disputes, whether they be \nmedical malpractice lawsuits, or automobile accident cases, or any \nother kind of ordinary bread-and-butter lawsuit you see decided in \ncourthouses across this country, in which citizens volunteer to give up \na substantial amount of their time, that this process takes too long \nand it is too expensive to serve the interests of justice. It \ndiscourages those who have meritorious claims from even bringing those \nclaims because they don't want to endure the time or expense. It too \noften benefits the very few at the expense of the rest of the public.\n  Particularly, the benefit is to a handful of lawyers. I must say, I \nam proud to be a lawyer. I practiced law a long time before I was a \njudge presiding over a trial court in San Antonio, TX, for 6 years and \nserving on the Texas Supreme Court for 7 years. I am proud to be a \nlawyer.\n  The problem is we have a handful of lawyers who are literally the \ntail wagging the dog on this and other reform issues that are so \nimportant to restoring public confidence in our civil justice system \nand making sure that rather than serving the interests of the few, the \ninterests of the general public are served by the way in which we \nhandle disputes like medical liability cases and other tort litigation.\n  We have in this country what some have called the ``sporting theory'' \nof justice. We have an adversary system, where each side retains a \nchampion and we go in and we have a clash between these adversaries in \ncourt, and the theory is--and in many respects it works well--the \nimpartial jury decides the facts and the judge applies the law, and \nthen we have a judgment in the dispute. It is a way of resolving our \ndisputes without violence, in a way that seems to satisfy the public \ngenerally. But the problem is in modern-day litigation--and nowhere is \nthis more prevalent than in the area of medical liability litigation--\nthe interest of the person who is harmed is not truly paramount in \nconsideration in terms of the way the system works. In fact, many \ntimes, it is the patient who may be injured or harmed who receives \nactually less money than the lawyer who brings the lawsuit.\n  As you know, many of these lawsuits are handled on a contingency fee \nbasis. In other words, the lawyer who brings the lawsuit will represent \na client in court--a patient in this instance--and say, well, if I \nrepresent you, then I will take 50 percent of everything you recover. \nIt won't cost you a penny if I don't recover anything, but if I do, I \nwill recover 50 cents off the top of every dollar you recover. Of \ncourse, there are other expenses associated with this kind of lawsuit, \nsuch as the hiring of expert witnesses, court costs, and the like.\n  Too often, what happens in these cases is the lawyer ends up the one \nwalking out of the courtroom with the most money, not the injured \nparty, not the person for whose benefit a lawsuit is brought. To me, \nthat simply turns our civil justice system on its ear. It calls into \nquestion whether this is a system of resolving disputes in a way that \nserves the interests of the public; or does it, as it appears too \noften, serve the interests of a handful of personal injury lawyers who \nmake their living bringing this kind of lawsuit.\n  There is another aspect of this as well. In our civil justice system, \nwe know almost anybody can file a lawsuit for virtually anything. If \nyou can get a lawyer to file a lawsuit, then you can sue someone for a \nsmall fee, whereby the clerk will serve the papers on the defendant, \nand typically the defendant will have to hire a lawyer to represent \nthem. At this point, there is no determination made that there is any \nmerit to that lawsuit. Well, what happens too often is the very nature \nof being able to file that lawsuit without any determination if there \nis any merit at all leads to a form of legalized extortion, because the \nperson who has been sued has no recourse but to hire someone to defend \nthem. Even if they end up winning the lawsuit, even if the lawsuit \nfiled is dismissed ultimately, there is no recourse for that defendant \nwho\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\nhas been wrongfully sued or sued in a frivolous lawsuit.\n  This, too, adds to the expense of ordinary litigation and makes very \nlittle sense to me or, I think, to a lot of people. I think the more \nthe public understands who it is who benefits from the current state of \nour civil justice system, our tort system, our medical liability \nsystem, the more the people will understand it is not them, not the \ninjured patients, not those whom the system is designed to benefit; it \nis for those who filed the lawsuits, the lawyers who represent those \nfolks. Unfortunately, because of the costs associated with just the \nexpense of litigation, we know too often those persons who are sued \nwill make what is known in the profession as a nuisance settlement. In \nother words, they will say, well, it is going to cost me tens of \nthousands of dollars just to defend myself against a frivolous lawsuit. \nRather than defend myself and win the lawsuit, but end up $100,000 out \nof pocket, or whatever the cost may be, I will pay you $5,000 or \n$10,000 to simply have it go away.\n  Unfortunately, you can see why the financial incentives tend to favor \nnuisance settlements of lawsuits which, unfortunately, have the \nunintended impact of encouraging further litigation and other lawsuits \neven when they are frivolous. We need to do something about it. I join \nthe senior Senator from New Hampshire who said we need some meaningful \nmedical liability reform. We need to make sure that it is not the \nlawyers who bring these lawsuits who benefit but, indeed, the public. \nNowhere is this a greater concern than when it comes to access to \nhealth care and medical liability lawsuits.\n\n  Last fall, I spoke in this Chamber, along with others, in support of \nbroad-based medical liability reform. Today I rise to speak in favor of \nthis narrow, but very important, bill that deals with women's access to \nphysicians who will deliver their babies, access which has been damaged \nterribly by the current dysfunctional way in which we resolve disputes \nabout medical liability.\n  The change we argued for last fall and this change as well would \ndrastically reduce the cost of health care by reducing frivolous claims \nand eliminating the need to pay extraordinary amounts of money for \nmedical liability insurance.\n  Unfortunately, we failed to pass meaningful reform. We have heard--I \nheard the Senator from Vermont mention this a moment ago--that the real \nculprit in all this is the insurance companies; it is not the lawyers \nwho benefit disproportionately from the status quo; we know it is not \nthe patients who do not benefit very often; and we know people who seek \naccess to health care are denied access to that health care because of \nthis dysfunctional system. The Senator said it is the insurance \ncompanies.\n  I take second chair to no one in saying that if, in fact, he can \npoint to abuses perpetrated by insurance companies or anyone else, we \ncertainly ought to take up that issue. But I believe the motivation is \nreally one to create a diversionary tactic, a smokescreen, if you will, \nto say it is not the lawyers, it is not us, Heaven forbid, it is not \nthe women who want their babies delivered, it is the insurance \ncompanies. We have heard this time and time again when, in fact, I \nbelieve the empirical evidence that has been produced in my State and \nother States shows that, in the end, insurance companies, which are \ntypically subject to strict State regulations, are having to play a \nlottery game, a sort of game of roulette. They don't know what the \nrules are because they change with every million-dollar, multimillion-\ndollar, tens-of-million-dollar judgments in lawsuits. So they charge an \ninsurance premium, just like we pay for homeowners insurance or \nrenter's insurance or any other kind of insurance, and ultimately that \ncost is passed on to the consumer. In this case, the consumer of that \ninsurance, the one who pays that premium, is the physician who wants to \npractice medicine, who wants to dedicate their life to the interests of \npeople who are sick and who need their help--in this case, mothers who \nneed access to good baby doctors so they know the baby they have \ncarried for all these months will be delivered safely and will be \nhealthy.\n  The good news I guess, if we can find any good news in this sordid \nsituation in which we find ourselves, where these lawyers who benefit \nfrom the status quo are the ones who are calling out the tune and \nhaving others dance to the tune they have called out, is that some of \nthe States are stepping up; they are not waiting on a solution from \nWashington, DC, and that is a good thing.\n  As someone who believes that local government and State government \ntends to be more responsive because it is closer to the people they \nserve, than for the Federal Government, I think it is good that the \nStates are stepping up, but this is not strictly a State problem.\n  When we consider how much money we appropriate each year--we just \npassed a $400 billion Medicare bill which is now estimated to cost more \nthan $100 billion more than that over 10 years--when you think about \nMedicare, when you think about Medicaid, when you think about S-CHIPS, \nthe Federal taxpayer--in other words, everyone who earns a wage in the \nUnited States--subsidizes this broken medical liability system because \nmuch of the costs associated with health care today are due to either \ncounting in what this rapidly increasing cost is in terms of \ndetermining what a fee for a service is or otherwise having to suffer \nthe consequences when doctors simply pull up stakes and move out of \ntheir State, leaving mothers, in this case, who want a doctor to \ndeliver their baby in the lurch.\n\n  In my own State, out of 254 counties, there are 154 counties in which \na pregnant woman cannot find a specialist to deliver her baby. A large \npart of that cause is because of the cost of medical liability \ninsurance which is simply priced out of the market, and physicians say \nI am going to retire early rather than subject my family and myself to \nputting at risk everything I have worked a lifetime to save and achieve \nor people who just simply have gotten tired of being in the crosshairs \ntheir whole life by a system that serves the interests of the few at \nthe expense of the many. I think Senator Gregg had a chart that showed \nwhat I mentioned a moment ago behind, that out of the 254 counties in \nTexas, 154 have no obstetrician/gynecologist, no specialist in \ndelivering babies. The yellow depicts those pregnant woman would have \nto drive to one of the white counties simply to find someone who will \ndeliver her baby, and sometimes they don't make it. Sometimes the baby \nis damaged because complications ensue because there is no doctor close \nby who is qualified to deliver that baby because of this broken medical \nliability system.\n  I think it was Senator Frist or perhaps Senator Gregg had a chart \nthat showed a chart of 19 States where there is a medical liability \ncrisis because of this civil justice system, a system that is supposed \nto be a just system but is truly an unjust system. It is simply broken.\n  Each of these red States, including, we can see, the State of Texas, \nis listed as a State in crisis. Nineteen of them are where patients are \nlosing access to baby doctors due to skyrocketing medical liability \ninsurance premiums and where pregnant women are forced to drive long \ndistances just to find a physician to deliver their baby.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, the good news, if there is any good news \nin all this, is that the States are not necessarily waiting on the \nFederal Government. In my own State, just this last year, the voters \npassed a constitutional amendment, proposition 12, which would provide \nsome of the relief that is sought to be delivered to the entire Nation \nin this particular bill. We have already seen some very beneficial \neffects of this constitutional amendment and the legislation that \nimplements it because we have seen medical liability insurance \ncompanies offer to reduce their premiums by 12 percent or 19 percent in \nanother case.\n  So we are beginning to see some real impact of the predictability and \nthe commonsense reforms that I believe are designed into this important \nbill. Because the American taxpayer pays to support the Medicaid \nsystem, pays to provide indigent health care, pays to provide other \ntypes of medical care, this is truly not just a State problem. This is \na national problem, and I know many of my colleagues, myself included, \nare concerned when we hear those dreaded words from the Federal\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\nGovernment: We are from the Federal Government and we are here to help. \nThose are some of the most dreaded words in the English language \nbecause, indeed, the States and local government, I believe, tend to be \nmuch more responsive. This is truly not just a statewide problem in my \nState or any State. This is a national crisis that calls out for a \nnational solution.\n  This is not something that affects only obstetricians or baby \ndoctors. Indeed, this affects the ability of hospitals to do business \nin rural parts of our country, rural parts of my State. Emergency \ndepartments lose staff and scale back critical services such as trauma \nunits. From 2002 to 2003, we saw a 56.2 percent average premium \nincrease faced by emergency room physicians and the hospitals in which \nthey practice. One-third of the Nation's hospitals saw 100 percent or \nmore increases in liability insurance premiums in 2002. We may think \nthis does not really concern me, this is the hospital owned by a \ncorporation, or this is a doctor's problem, somebody who drives a big \nshiny car, who makes a lot of money. But this is not about helping \ndoctors or helping the corporations that own hospitals. Many of them \nare owned by nonprofit associations and are charitable organizations \nthat keep their doors open because they believe in their mission. This \nis ultimately about access to health care.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues on the other side suggest that \nbecause of the booming number of uninsured in this country, estimated \nto be at any snapshot in time as many as 43 million people, we need \nuniversal, federally funded health care in this country. We know, \nbecause the Joint Economic Committee has told us so, that 3.9 million \nuninsured Americans would be able to receive health insurance if \nCongress were to pass commonsense medical liability reforms. Almost 4 \nmillion currently uninsured individuals would be able to receive health \ninsurance if Congress were to pass commonsense medical liability \nreforms.\n  This is not just an isolated matter. This does not just affect \ndoctors who are fortunate by virtue of their training and that \nexpertise to earn significant incomes. This is not just about big \nhospitals with shiny buildings owned by corporations. This ultimately \ncomes down to the individual who wants what we all want, and that is \naccess to good quality health care, but who simply cannot find it \nbecause they either cannot afford the health insurance or their \nemployer has been priced out of the market because of booming health \ninsurance premiums, in large part caused by this liability crisis or, \nas we have seen, simply the doctors who, rather than live in the \ncrosshairs of this broken system, decide to retire or to move away to \nsome other location.\n  I know there are others, such as Senator DeWine, who want to speak \nafter me, so I will conclude my remarks. But I plead to my colleagues \nto allow this matter to be debated. That is all we are talking about at \nthis point. All we are looking for is 60 Senators who will have the \ncourage to stand up to the trial bar, the personal injury trial \nlawyers, who insist that this matter not be debated on the Senate \nfloor. When so many pay the costs of that intransigence, I suggest that \nis just not fair and it is not just.\n  I encourage our colleagues to reexamine their conscience and ask \nwhether they are serving the best interests of their constituents, and \nin this specific instance so many women who need a doctor to deliver \ntheir baby. This country's future depends on those healthy babies being \ndelivered and becoming productive citizens, not harmed by an avoidable \nmedical complication because the mother, during her hour of need, and \nthe baby during its hour of need could not get the medical care they so \nrichly deserve and upon which America depends.\n  We must end the liability lottery where only a few patients and even \nmore trial lawyers receive astronomical awards. Even when there is no \naward in a frivolous lawsuit the costs simply run up what we all pay \nfor health insurance, those of us who can get it, and render many more \neven unable to get access to health insurance and thus access to health \ncare at all. We must pass meaningful medical liability reform that \nincludes real and lasting change and brings the lessons of Texas and \nother States that have been successful in passing statewide reform to \nthe entire Nation because, indeed, this is no longer just a State-by-\nState crisis, as we have seen with 19 States in an emergency situation. \nThis is a crisis that affects our entire Nation. It affects the quality \nof life that we enjoy and the promise that I believe we all wish to see \ndelivered to every American, and that is the ability to live out our \ndreams. Part of that means access to decent, good quality health care, \nsomething that is being impaired by our failure to act in this \ninstance.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. COCHRAN assumed the Chair.)\n\n\n                       POLITICAL CRISIS IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, at this very minute, there is an urgent \ncrisis in America's own backyard, a crisis on the island nation of \nHaiti. I have come this afternoon to talk about that. I have been on \nthe Senate floor many times in the past to talk about Haiti. I think I \nhave traveled to Haiti 13 times since I have been in the Senate. I have \ntalked before about the AIDS crisis there. I have talked about the \nhorrible dehumanizing poverty. I have talked about the lack of clean \nwater. I have talked about the food shortages. I have talked before \nabout the children who are sick with AIDS and other diseases such as \nmalaria and tuberculosis, children who have been orphaned when their \nparents die from AIDS, children who have little hope for a better \nfuture unless significant reforms are implemented and changes are made.\n  Today, I come to the Senate floor to talk about what everyone has \nseen in the news in the last several weeks, and that is something that \nis now dwarfing the poverty, the AIDS, and all the other problems, and \nthat is the current crisis, the violence that has erupted across this \nisland nation.\n  The chaotic and dangerous situation in Haiti right now is anything \nbut a surprise. The fact is that a crisis has been looming there since \nat least before Christmas. In January, in an opinion piece that I wrote \nfor the Miami Herald, I urged Haitian President Aristide to reach an \nagreement with the legitimate opposition groups, the political groups, \nto reach wholesale political change and reform. In that opinion piece, \nI urged him to pull back his own gangs of thugs and to tell them to \nstop their violence. I suggested then that President Aristide had \nwithin his own power the ability to avert further chaos and inevitable \ndisaster at the hands of insurgent groups by ending the political \nimpasse with the opposition and by creating a government that the \ninternational community could, in fact, support.\n\n  I am pleased that just this weekend President Aristide agreed to the \nproposal of the U.S. administration, our administration's proposal to \nend the political stalemate. It is imperative that the legitimate \npolitical opposition groups in Haiti now accept the terms of this \nagreement. As I speak this afternoon, these groups are considering this \nproposal. But I must say, time is of the essence. I believe our \nadministration's proposal, based on other Caribbean nations' earlier \nproposal, is a reasonable offer and one that has the greatest chance of \nbringing about an immediate end to the bloodshed.\n  Members of the Senate need to understand that, really, there are \nthree forces at play here. There is the Aristide government; there is \nthe legitimate political opposition in the country; and then there are \nthe thugs, and we can use no other term to describe them but the thugs \nwho are trying to overthrow the Government.\n  Let there be no mistake about it. These are not democrats, with a \nsmall ``d.'' They care not for democracy. When we talk about the \npolitical opposition we mean just that, the political opposition, the \nlegitimate political opposition in Haiti. It is not associated with \nthese thugs.\n  So we call upon them today, the political opposition, to agree to the \nproposal made by the U.S. Government. President Aristide has agreed to \nthis. We ask, and believe it is clearly in the best interests of Haiti, \nfor the political opposition to agree to it as well.\n  This agreement includes the setting up of a broad-based advisory \ncouncil to Aristide's government. It also includes the appointment of a \nnew Prime Minister. That is very significant. Further, it includes the \ndisarming of gangs\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\naligned with Aristide's Lavalas Family Party.\n  I urge the opposition groups to accept this because, quite candidly, \nthis proposal is the best hope for creating a coalition government that \ncan stop the violence and a coalition government that can be accepted \nby the international community and can be respected on the world stage.\n  The fact is, unless agreement is reached and unless the violence \nstops, there will be serious consequences for our hemisphere, for \nHaiti, and, yes, for the United States. We do not know what is going to \nhappen in Haiti, but as we think about what our response might be if in \nfact settlement cannot be reached or if in fact a settlement is reached \nand the violence continues, we need to keep in mind a few basic facts.\n  First, Haiti is in our neighborhood and what happens in our \nneighborhood affects the United States. Haiti is a nation that lies \nonly about 800 miles from our shores and is, therefore, less than a \n1\\1/2\\ hour flight from Miami.\n\n  Second, amazingly there are at least 20,000 U.S. citizens living in \nHaiti today. Let me repeat that. The official estimate is that there \nare at least 20,000 U.S. citizens living in Haiti today. These are \nmissionaries; these are doctors; these are nurses and other U.S. \ncitizens. No one knows for sure how many U.S. citizens are actually \ndown there. They are, so to speak, embedded all throughout the country.\n  The reality is that an awful lot of humanitarian workers are simply \nnot going to flee. They are not going to leave this Nation no matter \nwhat our advisories say. They are there simply to help the people of \nHaiti and they are going to stay. They are going to stay to help the \nchildren. They are going to stay to help the elderly. They are going to \nstay to help the sick. They are not going to abandon the people. \nTherefore, we have an obligation as a country to protect them and we \nneed to be concerned about them.\n  Furthermore, if the violence does not end, then we in the United \nStates will once again be seeing boats swollen with Haitians, risking \ntheir lives for the chance of a better life. Our Coast Guard will be \nout there having to stop them and we will be seeing them floating \ntoward Miami and the Florida shores.\n  No one knows what the future will hold. We have watched on the news. \nWe have read in the newspapers as these thugs, these rebels have taken \nover most of the main cities of Haiti--all of the main cities of Haiti, \nexcept Port-au-Prince. No one knows what will happen next. I said the \nhope is there will be agreement reached between the opposition, \nlegitimate political opposition and the Aristide government. But if we \nassume the violence will continue, if we assume these thugs, these \ninsurgents do what they say they are going to do and they move toward \nPort-au-Prince, no one can predict what will happen. But it is \ncertainly not out of the realm of possibility that there will be a \nbloodbath in Port-au-Prince.\n  There is no army. President Aristide, tragically--we have seen the \npolice corrupted. There is no real police force of which to speak. So \nwhat Aristide has done is he has armed the gangs of Port-au-Prince. So \nthere are arms everywhere in Port-au-Prince. They are the ones who \nwould be there to ``defend'' Port-au-Prince.\n  So you would have certainly the potential of the gangs of Port-au-\nPrince with their guns versus the insurgents coming in, and the people \nwho would be the victims would be the children, the women, and the \nelderly would be caught in that tragic crossfire. That very well could \nbe the scene that we will see unfold in front of us on CNN, on the \nnetwork news.\n  Those are things we need to contemplate in the days ahead as we think \nabout what our reaction might have to be. I believe our administration \nhas taken the right steps. Mr. Roger Noriega, representing the \nadministration, went to Haiti and made this proposal. It was the right \nthing to do. It was a good proposal.\n  Haiti is out of time. I, again, urge the opposition leaders, the \nlegitimate political opposition leaders to accept the administration's \nproposal. It is clearly in Haiti's national interest. If the opposition \ndoesn't accept the proposal without question, the situation will spiral \nout of control very quickly. It may, in fact, spiral out of control \nanyway, but clearly it will spiral out of control if it is not \naccepted. If it does spiral out of control, the United States needs to \nbe prepared to act in our own national self-interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, our Nation's medical litigation system is \nbroken and we need to start working to fix it. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for cloture on the Gregg-Ensign bill. It is time to stop \nfilibustering and to start working.\n  I just got back from Wyoming. They are having this same debate there. \nThey don't trust us to finish it here. They are trying to finish it on \na local basis. They are having a debate on a constitutional amendment \nto be able to do medical tort reform.\n  I tell you, that is a very difficult thing. Litigation reform \nrequires a constitutional amendment in Wyoming. That means there may be \na vote of the people, but that can't happen until at least November and \nwe are in a crisis in Wyoming right now. We are not the only State in a \ncrisis.\n\n  Last year, we brought a medical litigation reform bill to the Senate. \nThe legislation would have placed reasonable limits on the amount of \nmoney attorneys can take from a verdict or a settlement in an injured \npatient's favor. The bill also would have limited awards for punitive \ndamages and noneconomic damages. In other words, the pain and suffering \nawards.\n  The bill would not have limited awards to compensate patients for \neconomic losses. This is an important point for everyone to keep in \nmind. If a judge and jury were to decide a person suffered an injury \ndue to a doctor's mistake or a hospital's negligence, that person would \nbe entitled to receive full compensation for their economic loss, \nincluding everything from rehabilitation to lost wages resulting from \ntheir injury. I cannot stress this point enough. The bill would not \nhave limited awards for any part of economic losses.\n  What the bill would have done is place a ceiling on noneconomic \ndamages. The bill would have limited the maximum award for noneconomic \ndamages to $250,000 in States that do not have their own limits on such \nawards.\n  In Wyoming, we do not currently have limits on noneconomic damage \nawards. We do not have limits despite evidence which shows limits on \nnoneconomic damage awards have helped control the cost of medical \nliability insurance premiums in other States.\n  As a result, people in Wyoming are losing access to affordable health \ncare in their communities. The rising cost of medical liability \ninsurance in my State of Wyoming is forcing doctors to curtail their \npractices or close them entirely. We have a shortage of doctors in \nWyoming as it is and the cost of medical liability insurance is making \na bad problem even worse.\n  To address this problem, I cosponsored the medical litigation reform \nbill we offered for debate last year. We needed 60 Members in this body \nto vote in favor of working on the bill to get past a filibuster, but \nonly 49 voted in favor. So it was back to the drawing board.\n  Here we are again, 9 months later, with a new bill. It is ironic we \nare here 9 months later because this bill focuses on mothers and \nbabies.\n  Medical liability crisis affects many patients and doctors. Those it \naffects most are the expectant mothers and their obstetricians.\n  Doctors who deliver babies have a dubious honor when it comes to \nmedical liability insurance. The typical obstetrician pays more in \nannual premiums for professional liability insurance than almost any \nother type of doctor. Part of the reason is that in some states the \nchild has the right to sue when they get to adulthood. That is a pretty \nlong tail on the liability. If the parent fails to sue, the child can \nsue.\n  Some of my colleagues have pointed out the statistics and numbers on \nthis crisis, so instead I will tell a short story about an obstetrician \nin Wyoming. I told this story in July so I apologize if you have heard \nit before, but it is worth retelling.\n  There was an article in the Washington Post about a year ago about \nthe medical liability crisis. The reporter for the Post had gone to \nWyoming to\n\n[[Page S1433]]\n\nsee how the crisis affected a State already struggling to keep enough \ndoctors as it is.\n  According to the article in the Washington Post, the doctor in \nWheatland, WY, went to a high school basketball game between the \nWheatland Bulldogs and the nearby Douglas Bearcats.\n  Here is Wheatland on a map; here is Douglas. Wyoming is a pretty big \nState. This map shows about a quarter of the State. Each of the \ncounties on this map is bigger than Delaware, and the distance between \nWheatland and Cheyenne is pretty close to the length of Delaware. We \nare talking about a lot of distance, but not many people. One of these \ncounties the size of Delaware has 2,500 people living in it total, so \nwe have a lot of land, few people, and consequently not many doctors. \nWheatland and Douglas are 60 miles apart. That qualifies as nearby in \nmy State.\n  Now the doctor had just announced he would not be delivering any more \nbabies in Wheatland or Douglas because of the cost of liability \ninsurance. The irony is he delivered just about every player on both \nteams at that basketball game.\n\n  I would like to read a section of this story. The name of the doctor \nis Willard Woods:\n\n       The national malpractice insurance crisis . . . hit home \n     for Wheatland this winter when Woods' insurance company \n     joined a number of national malpractice carriers in declaring \n     bankruptcy.\n\n  I emphasize that last part. Malpractice carriers are declaring \nbankruptcy. Some people say these companies are making out like bandits \non medical liability insurance. If they are, they would not be \ndeclaring bankruptcy. These insurance companies are in crisis. They are \nraising their rates to cover the costs from legal cases and \nsettlements.\n  Back to the quote.\n\n       That left only two firms selling malpractice insurance in \n     Wyoming, and neither one was willing to take on a new \n     obstetrical coverage. Woods did get insurance for his \n     gynecological practice--a branch of medicine that spawns far \n     fewer lawsuits than delivering babies--but the annual premium \n     cost him $116,000, three times what he paid the year before.\n       In this wheat-growing region of eastern Wyoming, where \n     medical services are sparse and scattered, the impact is \n     acute. Platte County, with a population of less than 9,000, \n     has five doctors, equal to the number of veterinarians.\n       Women with normal pregnancies can still have their babies \n     delivered in the hospital; Woods's two partners, both general \n     practitioners, share the delivery duties.\n       ``But if you have any kind of problem like I did,'' said \n     Wheatland mother Kori Wilhelm, who has a genetic blood \n     mutation that makes pregnancy dangerous, ``you have to go to \n     Cheyenne now''--and that's a 140-mile round trip--``to get \n     the specialized treatment we used to get right down the \n     street at Dr. Woods's clinic.''\n\n  Put yourself in that woman's shoes. Until the cost of medical \nliability insurance drove Dr. Woods out of obstetrics, a woman \nexperiencing a difficult pregnancy in Wheatland could get specialized \ncare in her own community. Now that woman has to drive 140 miles round \ntrip for proper prenatal care and to have a specialist deliver her \nbaby.\n  Madam President, 140 miles is a long way for anyone to travel to see \na doctor. It is even a longer 140 miles for a pregnant woman. And it is \ntruly a long 140 miles for a pregnant woman in the middle of winter \nwhen high winds and blowing snow often force the highway department to \nclose the interstate between Wheatland and Cheyenne.\n  I wish this were the only story I could tell about the crisis in \nWyoming, but it is not.\n  I could talk about Dr. Jack Richard, an OB/GYN who reluctantly \nretired last year due to his high cost of medical liability insurance. \nDr. Richard served the people of Casper, WY, for more than 30 years, \nbut he was not ready to retire at the age of 61. Dr. Richard had \nalready stopped providing routine obstetrical care in 2000, but even as \na part-time physician, his premiums had doubled since then.\n  I could talk about Lisa Minge, an OB/GYN who left my hometown of \nGillette in November and moved her practice to Boise, Idaho. She cited \nthe high cost of liability insurance as one of the factors in her move \nto Idaho, which has a $250,000 limit on noneconomic damage awards.\n  I could talk about Dr. Bert Wagner, an OB/GYN in Cheyenne who stopped \ndelivering babies this year to avoid the high cost of insurance for the \nobstetrical side of his practice.\n  Or I could talk about a group of family practice doctors in Cheyenne \nwho are trying to decide whether they can keep delivering babies. The \nfour doctors in this group saw their premiums go from $65,000 in 2003 \nto $110,000 in 2004. This is despite the fact they had already limited \nthe number of babies they would deliver to 30 per doctor per year to \navoid having to pay the full obstetrical rate. I don't know what you do \nif you are the mom who needs the 31st baby delivered.\n\n  I have more stories I could tell, but I am not sure what good it \nwould do. I am an optimist by nature, but I am afraid I am pessimistic \nabout the outcome of this vote.\n  Nevertheless, I commend Senators Gregg and Ensign and our majority \nleader, Dr. Frist, for trying again. They have developed a bill that is \nfocused on one of the most critical parts of this nationwide crisis--\nthe plight of expectant mothers who depend on obstetricians to provide \na safe and healthy delivery for their babies.\n  What Senators Gregg and Ensign have proposed is a modest approach \nthat will provide some measure of relief to doctors who are squeezed by \nthe high cost of medical liability insurance. The bill puts reasonable \nlimits in place on the amount of money attorneys can take from \nsettlements and verdicts awarded to injured mothers and babies.\n  The bill does not limit the amount of money juries and judges can \naward to cover lost wages, rehabilitation, special services, and other \neconomic losses an injured mother or child might face. It simply puts a \nreasonable limit on what judges and juries can award for punitive and \nnoneconomic damages, which are the types of unpredictable awards that \nare contributing to this health care access crisis.\n  I have noticed something interesting during our debates on this \nissue. While we have been debating the pros and cons of reform, no one \nis standing up to defend our current system of medical litigation. No \none is standing up to defend our current system. We are talking about \nlimits on noneconomic damages, or the role of the insurance industry, \nand Senators are saying: Yes, there is a problem, but the bill before \nus doesn't solve it.\n  One thing I have not heard is a rousing defense of our medical \nlitigation system. Even some of the lawyers in this body have agreed \nfrivolous lawsuits are a problem and our medical litigation system \nneeds reform.\n  Why aren't we hearing anyone defend the merits of our current medical \nlitigation system? It is because it is indefensible. Our system does \nnot work. It simply does not work for the patients or for the health \ncare providers.\n  The bill we are debating today is a good bill for mothers and babies \nand the doctors who serve them. But even the sponsors would probably \nadmit it is a short-term measure that does not address the fundamental \nproblems with our medical litigation system. This is an important bill, \nbut it is just a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. It is not going to \nheal our broken system.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues a brief analysis of our \nmedical litigation system. It comes from this book, ``Fostering Rapid \nAdvances in Health Care, Learning From System Demonstrations,'' \npublished by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of \nSciences.\n  Let me quote a section of this book:\n\n       There is widespread agreement that the current system of \n     tort liability is a poor way to prevent and redress injury \n     resulting from medical error.\n       Most instances of negligence do not give rise to lawsuits, \n     and most legal claims do not relate to negligent care. Many \n     injured patients do not know they have suffered an injury \n     resulting from error, and those who go through the legal \n     process often do not even recover the cost of their continued \n     health care.\n       A few plaintiffs and their attorneys, however, win large \n     sums that may be disproportionate to their injuries or \n     unrelated to the defendant's conduct. Prolonged, adversarial \n     haggling over claims by plaintiffs' attorneys and liability \n     insurers alienates both providers and patients, and generates \n     legal fees and administrative expenses that consume more than \n     half the cost of liability insurance premiums.\n       The apparent randomness and delay associated with this \n     pattern of accountability not only prevent severely injured \n     patients from receiving prompt, fair compensation, but \n     destabilize liability insurance markets and attenuate the \n     signal that liability is supposed\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\n     to send health care providers regarding the need for quality \n     improvement. Fear and distrust breed inefficient ``defensive \n     medicine,'' and lead to missed opportunities for information \n     exchange and apology that might avoid lawsuits in the first \n     place.\n       The shortcomings of the current malpractice system \n     therefore come from three directions, all of which have \n     contributed to the present crisis: inefficient and \n     inequitable legal processes for resolving disputes, \n     problematic responses by clinicians to the threat and cost of \n     liability, and volatile markets for liability insurance. \n     Although some states face greater insurance instability than \n     others as the result of different legal standards, public \n     expectations, and professional cultures, no state is immune \n     to the threat of service interruptions affecting physicians, \n     hospitals, and other health care providers.\n\n  These are not my words. They are not the words of personal injury \nlawyers. They are not the words of tort reform advocates either. As I \npointed out earlier, these words are from the National Academy of \nSciences, specifically the Institute of Medicine. This organization was \ncreated by the Federal Government and chartered by Congress to provide \nunbiased and evidence-based advice on health policy.\n  This congressionally chartered body issued a report in 2002 that \ncalled upon the Federal Government to support demonstration projects in \nthe States to evaluate alternatives to current medical tort litigation. \nIn response, I have introduced a bill in the spirit of this report.\n  This bill, the Reliable Medical Justice Act, would authorize funding \nfor States to create alternatives to current tort litigation. The \nfunding would cover the costs of planning and initiating proposals \nbased on models outlined in the bill or other innovative ideas.\n  My bill would require participating States and the Federal Government \nto work together in evaluating the results of the alternatives as \ncompared to traditional tort litigation. This way, all States and the \nFederal Government could learn from new approaches.\n  As I speak, some States are already looking into alternatives to \nmedical litigation as we know it. My home State of Wyoming is one of \nthem. Another is Massachusetts, where Governor Romney is working with \nHarvard University on an innovative project. Another is Florida, where \nthe Governor's task force recommended the implementation of projects \nalong the lines of those suggested in my bill. We should encourage and \nsupport these States and others that are considering similar ideas.\n  Believe it or not, both Newt Gingrich and the editors of the New York \nTimes have endorsed the idea of creating and evaluating alternatives to \nmedical litigation. If Newt Gingrich and the New York Times are in the \nsame tent on an issue, maybe there is room in that tent for most of my \nfellow Senators to support it as well.\n  I support the Gregg-Ensign bill. It provides some short-term relief \nfor mothers and babies and their doctors. A lot of my colleagues will \nbe voting with me, and a lot will probably vote against me. Regardless \nof how we vote on this legislation before us, we must acknowledge there \nis a medical liability crisis, and we must work together to find a \nsolution.\n  Our medical litigation system is failing us. Medical lawsuits are \nsupposed to compensate people fairly and deter future errors. But most \npatients do not get fair and timely compensation, and there is nothing \nto show the lawsuits are deterring medical errors or making patients \nsafer.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of providing mothers, babies, \nand their doctors with some immediate relief through the Gregg-Ensign \nbill. I also hope they will look seriously at my legislation, S. 1518, \nwhich would put us on the road to replacing medical lawsuits with \nbetter and fairer systems for compensating and protecting patients. We \nneed to pass both of these bills before we can say we have begun to \nsolve this medical liability crisis.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, for years America has enjoyed world class \nhealth care. We have led the way in cures and treatments. We have \ndeveloped the latest and the best technologies, and we have ensured our \ndoctors are trained in groundbreaking procedures. Indeed, our Nation \nhas accomplished much in the area of health care.\n  But today, the future of our world-renowned health care system is at \nrisk. Some trial lawyers have nearly crippled the system by filing \nhundreds of frivolous lawsuits each year and defeating efforts to place \nlimits on these lawsuits and the big-money fees lawyers earn off of \nthem.\n  Nineteen of our States are in a full-blown medical liability crisis, \naccording to the American Medical Association. North Carolina is among \nthe hardest hit, particularly our OB/GYNs, who face constantly rising, \nastronomical premiums just to stay in business. Many have been forced \nto move or quit their practices. This problem is particularly evident \nin our rural areas where some women have had to drive for miles just to \nfind someone to deliver their baby. This is unacceptable.\n\n  It is understandable why doctors are leaving their practices, when \nthe State's top five jury awards in 2001 ranged from $4.5 million to \n$15 million. The annual number of settlements greater than $1 million \nfor medical liability cases has more than tripled between 1993 and \n2002.\n  Meanwhile, women in our States are struggling.\n  Consider these facts: Obstetricians in western North Carolina are \nseeing their insurance premiums increase from 50 to 100 percent. \nWomen's Care, P.A., the largest OB/GYN physician group in North \nCarolina saw its premiums increase 30 percent last year--for 3 times \nless coverage. One of its obstetricians will soon stop delivering \nbabies. Others may join him.\n  And there are more stories. Dr. Mary-Emma Beres of Sparta, NC, a \nsmall town in the northwestern part of the State with a population just \nunder 2,000, had to stop delivering babies after facing a 300 percent \nincrease in her malpractice premiums. Her departure left only one \nobstetrician to handle high-risk cases. And it meant some women who \nneeded C-sections had to endure a 40-minute ambulance ride to another \nhospital to deliver their baby.\n  Then there is Dr. John Schmitt. He is an OB/GYN who left his practice \nin Raleigh after seeing his insurance premiums triple from $17,000 to \n$46,000. He decided instead to join the medical school faculty at the \nUniversity of Virginia. One of his patients, Laurie Peel, highlighted \nthis dilemma best when she said, ``When you are a woman, you try to \nfind a gynecologist who will take you through lots of things in life. \nYou develop a relationship with your doctor. To lose someone like that \nis very hard.''\n  It is time to stop this deplorable situation that leaves the most \nvulnerable and sickest among us as the real victims. No one in this \ncountry should have to struggle like this for health care. The America \nI know is better than that.\n  Doctors who do remain in business are forced to practice defensive \nmedicine and order an excessive amount of tests and procedures to \nprotect themselves from lawsuits. Dr. Steve Turner of Garner estimates \nthat internists like him prescribe close to $5,000 a day in defensive \nmedical practices or $1.2 million a year per doctor.\n  The legislation before us offers a solution that works. It is modeled \nafter California's law which has been in place since 1975 and has kept \npremiums down in that State. This legislation does not cap damages. As \nyou know, there are cases where compensation is absolutely justified \nand deserved. Under S. 2061, victims who suffer from a doctor's \nmalpractice will be able to recover every penny of their actual \neconomic damages. It does limit noneconomic damages, like pain and \nsuffering. Punitive damages would be limited. But the legislation \nallows patients to collect for medical bills, funeral expenses and \nother costs. And States would still have the option of setting higher \nor lower caps than these in the bill.\n  Each week in North Carolina, nearly 2,200 babies are born and 300 of \nthose babies are born early.\n  This legislation deals with the immediate crisis facing OB/GYNs, so \nthat at the very least women can have the best health care available to \nthem when they deliver their babies.\n  Today we have a choice. We can vote with those trial lawyers who file \nendless lawsuits and watch our health care system spiral into decay. Or \nwe can put an end to this debate, and protect our\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\nhealth care system, by casting a vote for our patients and the medical \nprofessionals who so tirelessly care for them. I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of cloture. Let's pass this bill for our patients who \nneed it most.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I join my partner from Wyoming in \nsupporting what is one of most important bills we will have before us; \nthat is, medical liability, the opportunity for us to do something \nabout the cost of health care.\n  As I go about town meetings in my State of Wyoming, the topic I hear \nthe most about is the cost of health insurance. Obviously, health \ninsurance costs are driven by the cost of health care; in this case, of \ncourse, some directly as a matter of the kinds of payments that have to \nbe made for protection under medical malpractice liability insurance.\n  I am very pleased to join my colleagues to talk a little about an \nissue that has had a severe impact on health care. It is not the total \nanswer, but it is a step in the right direction. We are finding \nourselves in a situation where we have very good health care, excellent \nhealth care, which we all want. We all know it is going to be \nexpensive, but we find ourselves in a position where we are almost \ncutting off access to health care because of the cost.\n  We have 43 million people who do not carry insurance because of the \ncost. Obviously, we help take care of those people when they have \nsomething without the ability to pay, and the insurance goes up for \nthose who do pay. The insurance goes up for the hospitals and the \ndoctors who don't get paid for all their patients. So it is a broad \nproblem but one we can handle. And one of the issues that is right \nbefore us is the idea of doing something on comprehensive medical \nliability which, by the way, our friends on the other side of the aisle \nfilibustered last year. I hope they will not do it again this year.\n  I come from a small State which also has some impact. We have fewer \ninsurance carriers in our State because there isn't the kind of market \nto bring people in. We have many communities where there are only one \nor two practitioners and some where there are none. When we lose a \npractitioner, it makes it very difficult for that community.\n  Wyoming is one of the 19 crisis States for medical liability \ndesignated by the American Medical Association. A recent op-ed by Wendy \nCurran, executive director of our Wyoming Medical Society, I think \ndescribed some of the issues regarding the need for liability relief in \nour State. I think she laid it out quite well:\n\n       Wyoming is losing OB/GYNs, emergency trauma surgeons and \n     general practitioners because of high malpractice insurance \n     premiums.\n\n  It is interesting because Cheyenne, WY, is in the corner of our State \nnext to the front range in Colorado and we have physicians living in \nCheyenne and practicing in Colorado because they have this kind of \nprotection and this kind of limitation on malpractice suits.\n\n       Wyoming physicians pay higher malpractice premiums than any \n     of the surrounding States, which have all enacted liability \n     reform.\n\n  It is kind of interesting that in our small State we are in the \nprocess of talking about that now. Whether it will be done in our \nlegislature, which is meeting now, I don't know. The fact is, it is a \nbudget session of 20 days and it takes two-thirds votes to get it in. \nIt is going to be difficult to do.\n\n       Because of the fear of being sued, money is unnecessarily \n     spent on defensive medicine each year, which we all pay for--\n     $70 billion to $126 billion a year.\n\n  I had the real opportunity a while back in one of our rural areas to \ntalk to a physician, who I think was pretty much retired but had been \nin Africa and had written books, and he had an interesting observation. \nWe think about the lawsuits or the settlements that are very costly. He \nmentioned another aspect of this that is costly. In years past, when \nyou hurt your arm, you could go in to your family practitioner and he \nor she would look at it, fix it, and send you home or put a cast on if \nhe had to. Now, because of the possibilities of being sued, they have \nto send you to a specialist first and take a few more tests. So medical \ncare is much more expensive notwithstanding the idea of the suits.\n\n       A recent survey indicates that 71 percent of Wyoming voters \n     support liability reforms.\n\n  So I think most people do believe it is not the full answer to the \ncost of health care, but it is a movement we can make, a step we can \ntake that will indeed make a difference. So I support, as my friend \nfrom Wyoming and the Senator from North Carolina do, the approach taken \nby Senators Gregg and Ensign in this bill.\n  OB/GYNs have probably been affected the most, and it is impacting \naccess to the care for pregnant women. We have had bills before that \nwent clear across the medical spectrum, and I think that is probably \nthe appropriate way. But this singles out those issues that are so \nprevalent and difficult. Rural areas are disproportionately impacted, \nas there is often no other provider available, or where an OB/GYN is \nforced to close up shop. We have had that very thing happen in small \ntowns, where there is only one OB/GYN. On the other hand, in some towns \nthere are none and the general practitioners are concerned about \ndelivering the babies.\n  We had one physician leave a little town called Wheatland, WY. He \ndelivered babies in three counties. His malpractice premiums rose to \nover $100,000 a year in a little community, in addition to what he had \npaid before. Pregnant women in Newcastle and Weston County have to \ntravel 80 miles for babies because high medical malpractice premiums \nhave forced three local physicians to abandon their practices.\n\n  Dr. Hugh DePalo, a practicing OB/GYN in Casper, WY, indicates that \nhis premiums have increased by 300 percent in the past year. It is \namazing.\n  According to the Wyoming Health Care Commission, for every dollar \nmalpractice insurance companies make in premiums in Wyoming, they must \npay $1.25 on suits and settlements. Also according to the Wyoming \nHealth Care Commission, some of our hospitals are paying medical \nmalpractice premiums of $1,000 to $3,000 per birth, which makes \ndelivering babies very unprofitable. Of course, they still do it, but \nsomebody else has to pick up the tab.\n  It is interesting that these practitioners in Wyoming pay $20,000 to \n$30,000 more a year in malpractice insurance than those in Colorado, \nwhich has a cap of $250,000.\n  Since all the States around us have passed liability reforms, we have \na tough time recruiting all types of practitioners. We have underserved \nareas. I am chairman of the caucus here on rural health care, and we \nhave been pleased with some of our accomplishments, but rural health \ncare is different. For a long time, we had different fees paid to rural \nthan to urban hospitals. The fact is, because of low volume, it could \nwell be that the cost per case for rural hospitals is even higher.\n  One of the big costs of health care, of course, is the new equipment. \nWe all want to have ``Cadillac'' health service, but when you have \nsmall volumes, you cannot do that. In our State, we have to have a \nsystem because you are not going to have all practitioners, specialists \nin every community. Something has to be set up so that it is available. \nSo it is a difficult thing. We make it much more difficult by having \nthese very high premiums. So we need to do something to protect, in \nthis instance, our OB/GYN service for women and their babies and to set \na reasonable limit on noneconomic damages. Keep in mind that if \nsomebody has damages that are economic--this is not a limit on that; \nthis is noneconomic damages. We have to provide for a quicker review of \nliability claims so they don't go on for years. We need to assure that \nclaims are filed within a reasonable time. We need to educate people \nthat frivolous lawsuits only add to the overall costs of health care \nfor everyone.\n  Sometimes we say there haven't been many lawsuits. The fact is there \nmay not be a lawsuit but there is a settlement, which also, because of \nthe predicted outcome of the lawsuit, is a very high settlement and the \ncosts are still there.\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\n  So I think the Senate should act on this important legislation that \ncontains provisions that allow injured patients to recover economic \ndamages--that is fair and legal--such as future medical expenses and \nloss of future earnings. Punitive damages are reasonably limited to the \ngreater of two times the amount of the economic damages or $250,000. It \nauthorizes periodic payments to injured parties rather than one lump \npayment. It preempts State law unless such law imposes greater \nprotections for the health care providers and organizations.\n  So I believe it does allow doctors to practice responsibility without \nthe excessive testing, in reference to specialists, which is part of \nthe growing costs of health care. I think this is a step in the right \ndirection. But we have spent a great deal of time talking about \nMedicare and Medicaid, and we always talk about VA. We are going to \nhave to look at the broad view of health care now.\n  Again, we all want great health care. That ought to be what we go \nfor. But it becomes so expensive that it precludes lots of families \nfrom participating. That is something we don't want to have happen. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for cloture on S. 2061. I think it could be \none of the most important votes in this legislative year.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Flawed Intelligence Assessments\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, there is now confirmation from the \nadministration's own leading weapons inspector that the intelligence \ncommunity produced greatly flawed assessments about Iraq's weapons of \nmass destruction in the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq. It \nis my opinion that flawed intelligence and the administration's \nexaggerations concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction resulted \nfrom an effort to make the threat appear more imminent and the case for \nmilitary action against Iraq appear more urgent than they were.\n  However, regardless of whether one thought the threat was imminent or \nnot to proceed as unilaterally as we did, our intelligence was so far \noff the mark and the descriptions of that intelligence by the \nadministration were even further off the mark that for the sake of the \nfuture security of this Nation, there needs to be an independent \nassessment not just of the intelligence but also the characterization \nby the administration of that intelligence.\n  Today, I want to raise a related issue: how the Director of Central \nIntelligence, George Tenet, misled the American people before the war \nabout the status of our sharing of U.S. intelligence information with \nthe United Nations inspectors.\n  Director Tenet, after 12 months of indefensible stonewalling, \nrecently relented and declassified the material that I requested, which \nmakes clear that his public testimony before the Congress on the extent \nto which the United States shared intelligence with the United Nations \non Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs was false.\n  Prior to the war, the CIA identified 550 sites in Iraq as possibly \nhaving weapons of mass destruction or prohibited WMD materials or \nequipment. They were called ``suspect sites.'' Madam President, 150 of \nthose sites were so-called ``top suspect'' sites where the CIA believed \nit would be more likely to find such items. The 150 top suspect sites \nwere, in turn, divided into three categories: High priority, medium \npriority, and low priority.\n  At two public hearings shortly before the war on February 11 and \nFebruary 12, 2003, I pressed Director Tenet on the issue of how many \nsuspect WMD sites were shared with the United Nations. On February 12, \nDirector Tenet said the following:\n\n       When the inspections began, we drew up a list of suspect \n     sites which we believe may have a continuing association with \n     Iraq's WMD programs. The list is dynamic. It changes \n     according to available intelligence or other information that \n     we receive.\n       Of this set number of suspect sites, we identified a \n     specific number as being highest interest, highest value, or \n     moderate value because of recent activities suggesting \n     ongoing WMD association or other intelligence information \n     that we received.\n\n  And here is his bottom line:\n\n       As I said yesterday, we have briefed all of these high \n     value and moderate value sites to UNMOVIC and the IAEA.\n\n  Mr. Tenet did not say ``some;'' he did not say ``most;'' he said \n``all.'' We have briefed ``all'' of these high value and moderate value \nsites to the U.N.\n  I told Director Tenet at the time in two public hearings that he was \nwrong and that classified numbers told a different story. On March 6, \n2003, Director Tenet again stated in writing that:\n\n       We have now provided detailed information on all of the \n     high value and moderate value sites to UNMOVIC and the IAEA.\n\n  National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice made the same \nrepresentation in a letter to me on March 6, 2003, in which she said:\n\n       United Nations inspectors have been briefed on every high \n     or medium priority weapons of mass destruction, missile, and \n     UAV-related site the U.S. intelligence community has \n     identified.\n\n  On January 20, 2004, the CIA, after a year of resistance, finally \ndeclassified the number of ``high and medium priority 'top suspect' WMD \nsites'' where the CIA shared information with the U.N. inspectors prior \nto the war in Iraq.\n  In doing so, they finally acknowledged that 21 of the 105 high and \nmedium priority top suspect sites on the CIA list were not shared with \nthe United Nations before the war. So the record is now clear that \nDirector Tenet twice gave false information on this matter to the \npublic and to the Congress shortly before the war.\n  The January 20, 2004, letter from the CIA states their position. The \nposition of the CIA is that it provided the United Nations ``with the \nintelligence that we judged would be fruitful in their search.'' \nHistory will, and a thorough investigation would, determine the \naccuracy of that statement. But the public can now judge the accuracy \nof Director Tenet's public statements before the war that all high and \nmedium priority top suspect sites were shared with the United Nations. \nAll such sites were not shared and Mr. Tenet's repeated statements were \nfalse.\n  Last February, Director Tenet could have answered honestly and said: \nWe have not given the U.N. inspectors all the high and medium priority \ntop suspect sites and this is why, Senator.\n  Instead, he chose a different path, one of misstating the facts. I \ncan only speculate as to Director Tenet's motive. If he had answered \nhonestly and said that there were 21 high and medium priority top \nsuspect sites that we had not yet shared with the United Nations, it \nwould have put an obstacle in the path of the administration's move to \nend U.N. inspections and proceed to war. It would have been more \ndifficult for the administration to proceed to war without first having \nshared with the U.N. our intelligence on all high and medium priority \ntop suspect WMD sites and it would have reinforced widely held public \nand international sentiment that we should allow the U.N. to complete \ntheir inspections before going to war.\n  In other words, honest answers by Director Tenet might have \nundermined the false sense of urgency for proceeding to war and could \nhave contributed to delay, neither of which fit the administration's \npolicy goals. For the last year, I have attempted to have declassified \nthe number of high and medium priority top suspect sites that the U.S. \ndid not share with the United Nations. The CIA stonewalled doing that \nfor no reason that I can think of except that the facts are \nembarrassing to them. Surely, that is no reason to withhold information \nfrom the American people and to give inaccurate information repeatedly \nto Congress in public testimony. We rely on our intelligence agencies \nto give us the facts, not to give us the spin on the facts.\n  The accuracy and objectivity of intelligence should never be tainted \nor slanted to support a particular policy. What is badly needed and \nwhat is lacking so far is candor about how we were so far off in the \nassessments of Iraq's possession of WMD. The lack of candor is one of \nthe many reasons an independent commission should be appointed by \nCongress, not just by the President, to look at not just how the \nintelligence came to be so flawed but\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\nhow that flawed intelligence came to be further exaggerated by the \nadministration in order to support its decision to initiate military \naction.\n  One small part of this picture is this recent letter from the CIA \nthat finally makes clear the truth. The CIA did not share all of the \ntop suspect WMD sites in Iraq that Director Tenet said twice publicly \nbefore the war that it had shared with U.N. inspectors. It is more \nevidence of the shaping of intelligence to fit the administration's \npolicy objectives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the CIA that I have \nreferred to on this matter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Central Intelligence Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 20, 2004.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am responding to your letters of 23 \n     October 2003 and 8 January 2004 regarding declassification of \n     specific information concerning the Intelligence Community's \n     (IC's) sharing of information on Iraqi suspect weapons of \n     mass destruction (WMD) sites with the United Nations (UN) \n     inspectors.\n       I want to begin by ensuring that there is a mutual \n     understanding of what has been declassified thus far with \n     respect to Iraqi suspect WMD site numbers and the sharing of \n     this information with the UN inspectors.\n       In our 23 May 2003 letter, we provided the number of \n     approximate Iraqi suspect WMD sites identified by Central \n     Intelligence Agency, 550; and, the number of suspect sites \n     where inspectors were more likely to find something than at \n     other sites, 150.\n       In our 11 July 2003 letter, we provided the number of \n     suspect WMD site packages provided to the UN inspectors, 67.\n       In our 9 and 13 May briefings to the SSCI staff, we \n     explained that this number represented the number of site \n     packages shared with the UN inspectors at the IC initiative. \n     The 67 number does not include site packages provided \n     pursuant to UN inspectors' requests,\n       Your most recent letters concern three specific requests:\n       The number of high and medium priority sites on the IC's \n     150-site top suspect site list. Answer: High: 37; Medium: 68.\n       The number of high and medium priority sites where the IC \n     shared information with the UN, including briefing packages. \n     Answer: High: 33; Medium: 51.\n       The number of high and medium priority sites where the IC \n     shared briefing packages with the UN. Answer: High: 21; \n     Medium: 30.\n       The 21 high and 30 medium site packages provided to the UN \n     inspectors represent site packages provided at the IC's \n     initiative and pursuant to UN inspectors' requests. The \n     number of high and medium site packages provided to the UN \n     inspectors solely at the IC's initiative are 20 and 25, \n     respectively.\n       These numbers have been declassified. However, in order to \n     ensure that the numbers are accurately characterized, it is \n     important to reiterate what has been previously provided in \n     earlier correspondence to you regarding the suspect WMD site \n     information shared with the UN inspectors. I specifically \n     call your attention to the Director of Central Intelligence's \n     11 July 2003 letter, signed by the Deputy Director of Central \n     Intelligence, which states:\n       ``. . . CIA provided UNMOVIC with the intelligence that we \n     judged would be fruitful in their search for prohibited \n     material and activities in Iraq. We did not have and we never \n     claimed to have, smoking-gun information that would lead the \n     inspectors to a quick find. We selected the best sites we had \n     that we judged would have the best chance of finding \n     something. It is important to remember that we had given the \n     UN a vast amount of data in the 10-plus years we cooperated \n     with them on inspections, including data on many of the sites \n     long suspected of containing illicit activity. Thus, when \n     inspections resumed last year, we wanted to focus our effort \n     on giving the UN new data that we had not told them \n     previously. We started by considering about 150 sites that \n     seemed promising--we further refined that list because many \n     of these sites were already known to the UN inspectors, had \n     been the subject of previous discussions by CIA and those \n     organizations, and on which we had no new information. By the \n     time inspections stopped, we had developed site packages for \n     67 sites. These included the sites on which we had the best \n     intelligence--on which we had pertinent and possible \n     `actionable' information. We would not have helped the UN \n     inspectors by giving them large volumes of data they already \n     had. The UN relied on us to prioritize the information rather \n     than simply to give them everything we had on every possible \n     site in Iraq.''\n       We ask that the numbers and text be used in tandem when \n     discussing Iraqi WMD suspect sites and site packages provided \n     to the UN inspectors.\n       I believe that with this response all your requests for \n     declassification of Iraqi suspect site numbers have been \n     addressed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Stanley M. Moskowitz,\n                                Director of Congressional Affairs.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, today I rise to spend a few minutes \ntalking about the need for medical malpractice reform in my State, \nalong with the bill before us, S. 2061, the Healthy Mothers and Healthy \nBabies Access to Care Act.\n  First, I commend the Senate leadership for bringing up this bill for \nconsideration this week. It sends a signal to the American people that \nthis is a high health care priority this year and that we have not \ngiven up the fight for real reform. As a father of 9 and a grandfather \nof 35, I believe there are very few things more important than \nproviding mothers with the safest and healthiest environment to deliver \ntheir children.\n  Unfortunately, because of the medical liability crisis in Kentucky, \nthe health and safety of both mothers and their babies are being \njeopardized. Personally, I believe the most effective approach to \nmedical liability insurance reform is a comprehensive approach covering \nall health care providers.\n  I hear all the time from doctors and hospitals across Kentucky about \nhow they struggle to pay their skyrocketing premiums. Last May, the \nJoint Economic Committee found that total premiums for medical \nliability insurance doubled from 1992 to 2001, to reach $21 billion. I \nknow hospitals and doctors are struggling under these increases. Last \nyear, we had an opportunity to pass a comprehensive reform bill. \nUnfortunately, our opponents did not even give us a chance to fully \nconsider the bill or have an up-or-down vote on it. Today we are \nattempting to fix the problem for just one of the specialities that has \nbeen the most severely affected by the increase in malpractice \ninsurance premiums. Those are the OB/GYN doctors.\n  Specifically, this bill would improve access to care for pregnant \nwomen by placing some reasonable limits on lawsuits against their \nhealth care provider. The bill provides unlimited awards for economic \ndamages and places a $250,000 cap on damages for pain and suffering.\n  The bill also ensures that health care providers will only be liable \nfor their share of any damages in a lawsuit brought against an OB/GYN \ndoctor, along with limited attorney's fees.\n  All of these are steps in the right direction and the right thing to \ndo. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture tomorrow. The liability \nsystem we have now is badly flawed and broken and must be fixed. It \nencourages lawsuits and defensive medicine and forces doctors to become \nmore worried about going to court than properly caring for their \npatients. This, in turn, leads to higher insurance premiums and gaps in \ncare. Under our current liability system everyone loses, doctors and \npatients--everyone, that is, except the personal injury lawyers.\n  It is obvious people are beginning to understand the impact that \nsoaring medical malpractice premiums are having on their communities. \nIn fact, a recent poll showed that 68 percent of Kentuckians support \nputting limits on medical malpractice awards. That is right, 68 percent \nof Kentuckians. That is an overwhelming number of Kentuckians \nsupporting reform.\n  I hear all of the time about how premiums rise, squeezing physicians \nfinancially, and affecting Kentuckians' access to quality health care. \nLast year, the American Medical Association added Kentucky to its list \nof crisis States. This means the current liability system is seriously \neroding patient care. In Kentucky, physicians are choosing to close \ntheir offices or retire early. Others are packing up and moving to \nother States with more sensible insurance regulations.\n  A study conducted by the Kentucky Medical Association shows that over \na 3-year period, Kentucky had a net loss of 819 physicians. According \nto the study, over 1,200 physicians moved out of the State to more \nfriendly communities, and 281 retired. Even worse, we are losing young \ndoctors. In that time, 500 residents packed their bags and left\n\n[[Page S1438]]\n\nKentucky. That means 58 percent of the residents who trained in the \nState moved elsewhere to practice. My State cannot continue to bleed \nphysicians like this. It takes a toll on our communities and our \npatients.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also \nconducted a survey back in 2002 and found that 71 percent of the \nKentucky physicians who responded to their survey have actually changed \ntheir practice--changed their practice from what they did because of \nthe medical liability reform crisis that we are having. In my book that \nis completely unacceptable.\n  They also estimate that 3,240 pregnant women in Kentucky are without \nOB/GYN care. If that is not a crisis, I don't know what is.\n  The medical liability crisis not only affects physicians in private \npractice, it affects our hospitals as well. Last year, two hospitals in \neastern Kentucky--Our Lady of Bellfonte Hospital in Russell and the \nKnox County Hospital in Barbourville--both completely stopped \ndelivering babies. This puts mothers in rural areas at a much greater \nrisk of complications. No expectant mother should have to drive past \nthe hospital she has trusted for years to find one that will deliver \nher child. It doesn't make any sense. It just is not common sense.\n\n  While the liability crisis clearly must be addressed for the entire \ncountry, individual States are trying to pass legislation to help the \ndoctors within their own borders. I commend them for this effort. In \nKentucky, the State senate recently passed a bill by a vote of 23 to 14 \nthat would allow Kentuckians to vote whether they want to amend the \nState constitution to allow for medical malpractice reform. Now it is \nup to the Kentucky House of Representatives to pass similar \nlegislation. I believe the general assembly should pass a \nconstitutional referendum and let Kentuckians vote on this issue since \nthe crisis is threatening their access to care and ultimately costing \nthem more in health care costs.\n  I have consistently supported medical malpractice reform since I came \nto this Congress in 1986, and I will support S. 2061 this week. It is \nthe right thing to do, and it is the right thing to do for my State.\n  It is important that my colleagues take a stand and decide if they \nare with the mothers and children or if they are with the personal \ninjury lawyers. Personally, I will be supporting the mothers and \nchildren in my State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                            Jobs In America\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I would like to take a few moments of \nthe time of the Senate to review one of the compelling issues facing \nthe Nation, all across our country, and that is the state of our \neconomy translated in ways that working families understand it--the \nstate of jobs in America. How are people doing with the jobs they have? \nAre they working longer? Are they working harder? What has happened to \nthe millions of Americans who are on the unemployment lines? What about \nthe millions of Americans who have lost any hope?\n  It seems to me, as I have said on many other occasions, that we have \nan administration that looks at the state of our economy from the \nposition of Wall Street but not Main Street. The reason I say that is \nbecause I look at the remarks of the President of the United States \nthat he made today. I will include the relevant parts of the speech. I \nam now quoting.\n\n       At home, obviously, the economy and jobs are on my mind. I \n     know they're on yours, as well. I am pleased that the economy \n     is growing. . . . My view of Government is to create an \n     environment that is good for the entrepreneur. . . . And that \n     we ought to keep on with the tax cuts.\n\n  That is his recommendation in terms of his statement that he made at \nthe National Governors Association.\n  The rhetoric fails to match the realities of most Americans' lives. I \nknow the President and his economic advisers have been touring the \ncountry claiming that the tax cuts for the wealthy have led to an \neconomic recovery. A closer look at the States they have been visiting \nmakes it clear this President and this White House are out of touch \nwith the real needs and everyday concerns of average American families.\n\n  The President told small businesses in Tampa, FL, last week that tax \nrelief was a vital part of the economic recovery and failed to mention \n52,000 jobs have been lost in Tampa, FL, since he took office and that \nthe jobs being created in the State pay 15 percent less than the jobs \nthat have been lost. He did not mention Tropical Sportswear, an apparel \nmaker in Tampa which shipped more than half of its cutting room jobs \noverseas.\n  And in a minute I will talk about the new Time magazine just out on \nthe market and its cover story about too many jobs going abroad. I fail \nto see much in the President's comments to the Governors and to the \nAmerican people showing the sensitivity that families are feeling all \nacross this country about outsourcing.\n  Two weeks ago the President touted his economic policies in \nHarrisburg, PA, where 14,000 jobs have been lost since January 2001. \nThe jobs being created in Pennsylvania pay 23 percent less than the \njobs that were lost. In the same week, the President told businesses in \nSpringfield, MO, the growth is good and jobs are being created. Yet \n5,300 jobs have been lost in Springfield, MO, since President Bush took \noffice, and the jobs being created in Missouri pay 25 percent less than \nthe jobs that have been lost.\n  Every day it is becoming more and more clear the current Bush \neconomic policy is in disarray. Last week, President Bush and his \neconomic team backed away from the promise to create an average of 2.6 \nmillion new jobs this year. The President made the promise in his \neconomic report just the week before last and now no one in the White \nHouse or the Cabinet will endorse the 2.6 million number. It is just \nbroken promise after broken promise.\n  President Bush promised his first tax bill would create 800,000 \nadditional jobs by the end of 2002, but we lost 1.9 million jobs \ninstead. His 2002 economic report promised 3 million more jobs in 2003; \ninstead, more than 300,000 were lost. His economic report last year \nprojected 1.7 million new jobs for 2003, and we suffered a loss of \n400,000 jobs. He promised the latest round of tax breaks would create \n510,000 additional jobs by the end of 2003, but we lost 53,000 jobs \nlast year. President Bush says it is a good idea to send jobs overseas, \nas if we had not lost enough jobs already.\n  This chart is a pretty clear indication about what has been happening \nto the American economy in terms of jobs and the impact the economic \npolicies of this administration are having regarding employment. This \nshows 5.2 million jobs short of the administration promises for 2002. \nIn 2002, we are 2.5 million jobs short of the promises of 2003. The \nreality is nearly 2 million jobs have been lost in the first 2 years \nunder President Bush.\n  The administration talks about how the economy is growing and how \nwell the economy is doing. In his speech to the National Governors \nAssociation today, we can see words that are similar to what the \nPresident used in the State of the Union Address. In the State of the \nUnion Address the President talks about the pace of economic growth in \nthe third quarter being the fastest in nearly 20 years. Productivity is \nhigh and jobs are on the rise. He continued along in that speech, \ntalking about his support for the elimination of overtime in an effort \nto help small business. That is the regulation the administration \nreferred to as ``the needless Federal regulation,'' a regulation that \nhas been in effect since we adopted the 40-hour week that provides \novertime protections for millions of Americans. This administration is \ncommitted to overturning that regulation. That would affect 8 million \nAmericans who work more than 40 hours a week.\n  This is the projection of this administration in terms of the jobs \ncreated and the actual record of the administration over recent years. \nWhether it is a speech to the National Governors Association or the \nState of the Union, when we hear from the President the state of the \neconomy is getting stronger and stronger, it is important to understand \nwhat the facts are.\n  We can ask ourselves whether this is the responsibility of workers in \nthis country. This chart shows Americans work more hours than workers \nin other industrialized nations. This chart, from the Organization for \nEconomic Development and Cooperation, shows Americans work 100 hours \neach year more\n\n[[Page S1439]]\n\nthan any other industrial nation and considerably more than most of the \nother European nations. A few hundred hours more than France, Italy, \nand Germany. American workers are working longer. They are working \nharder just to try to stay in place.\n  If we look at the job market in terms of women in our society, what \nis happening to middle-income mothers who work 55 percent more hours \ntoday than 20 years ago? In 1979, it was 895 hours annually. Look at \nthis figure: 1,388 hours now, almost double the amount in 2000.\n  So American workers are working longer and harder than any other \nindustrial society. Not only that, we have also seen that the families \nare working longer and harder. Both men and women, husbands and wives \nare working longer and harder than any other country in the world. So \nfamilies are working almost longer and harder, and the jobs gained do \nnot pay as much as jobs lost.\n  The administration talks about the creation of new jobs, they talk \nabout the unemployment figures, but it is important to understand what \nthose jobs are and what they are in terms of pay. In 48 of the 50 \nStates, the new jobs are paying less than the old jobs. There are only \ntwo States where they pay more. They average 23 percent less. Workers \nare working longer and harder. The jobs are paying less.\n  We will look at what is happening to the national average wage. For \nworkers in 2001, the average wage was $44,000. The average wage now is \n$35,410, a 21-percent reduction in the average wage for workers today.\n  We read the statement of the President today talking about the state \nof our economy, that everything is good and getting better, and when we \nread the State of the Union talking about how positive all the economy \nis, we ought to be able to look at what is happening out there on Main \nStreet. Workers are working longer and harder. Both men and women are \nworking longer and harder, and their total income is going down. That \nis what is happening on Main Street across this country.\n  This chart demonstrates these points. In 48 States the Bush \n``recovery'' has replaced high-paying jobs with low-paying jobs, with \nthe exception of Nebraska and Nevada. That is a national phenomenon in \nStates across this country, and the outsourcing issue is one of the \nprincipal contributors. That is why there is national attention given \nin this magazine today talking about the challenges we are facing with \noutsourcing.\n  I will read a couple parts of the article about outsourcing, and I \nwill include the relevant paragraphs so they will be in complete \ncontext.\n\n       That's why outsourcing to India has exploded during the \n     recovery.\n\n  I will come back to the ``recovery'' in just a minute.\n\n       That is why outsourcing to India has exploded during the \n     recovery. It jumped 60% in 2003--\n\n  That is 60 percent in 2003--\n\n     compared with the year before, according to the research \n     magazine Dataquest, as corporations used some of their \n     profits (not to mention [their] tax breaks)--\n\n  Not to mention their tax breaks--do you want to know where a great \nchunk of those tax breaks are going? It has been used to organize and \nshift American jobs overseas. This is the conclusion in this magazine \ntoday. It goes on:\n  That translates to 140,000 jobs outsourced to India last year. And \nwhat is the human aspect? Here is one of the individuals who has been \naffected. His name is:\n\n       Vince Kosmac of Orlando, Fla., has lived both sad chapters \n     of outsourcing--the blue-collar and white-collar versions. He \n     was a trucker in the 1970s and '80s, delivering steel to \n     plants in Johnstown, Pa. When steel melted down to lower-cost \n     competitors in Brazil and China, he used the G.I. Bill to get \n     a degree in computer science. ``The conventional wisdom was \n     `Nobody can take your education away from you,' '' he said \n     bitterly. ``Guess what? They took my education away.'' For \n     nearly 20 years, he worked as a programmer and saved enough \n     for a comfortable life. But programming jobs went missing two \n     years ago, and he is impatient with anyone who suggests that \n     he ``retrain'' again.\n\n  ``Retrain'' again--remember that picture with the President out there \ntalking about new training programs that were tied into the community \ncolleges? The principal problem with that is he said he was going to \nrequest I guess $250 million, but of course they cut over $600 million \nin the last 3 years out of the training programs.\n  But this is what is happening here--the fact that this individual got \nthe training and programming jobs went missing 2 years ago.\n\n     . . . he is impatient with anyone who suggests that he \n     ``retrain'' again. ``Here I am, 47 years old. I've got a \n     house. I've got a child with cerebral palsy. I've got two \n     cars. What do I do--push the pause button on my life? I'm not \n     a statistic.''\n\n  That is it. These families are not statistics. They are real people \nwho are working hard, working longer, and making less. That is one of \nthe prime concerns many of us have; that is, if we have a problem, the \nfirst thing we have to do is understand it. The first thing the \nPresident of the United States has to say is: We have a problem. Let's \ndeal with it. If he just keeps on going as he did with the State of the \nUnion and as he has today to the Governors, that everything is hunky-\ndory, everything is getting better, that there is no problem, then you \nare failing to understand what is happening on the main streets across \nthis country.\n  This next item is from the Lou Dobbs show on CNN last Friday night. \nThese are all publications from today, the speech made by the President \ntoday, the impact on the wages today. All of this has been in the last \nfew days. We are not going back a year or 2 years ago as to what is \nhappening; we are talking about what is happening across this country \ntoday and what the President of the United States said today and how \nout of touch he is on these issues.\n  This is from last Friday night. I think these two comments said it \nall on the Lou Dobbs show last Friday night. This is Glenn of Oxford, \nMI:\n\n       If General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler can take \n     supplier parts and send them to China to be mass produced at \n     a third of the cost, then why doesn't the cost of the vehicle \n     ever go down? Labor is cheaper, parts are cheaper, but CEO \n     pay increases.\n\n  There it is. That is what is happening. That is the real economy. \nThat is what is happening. When you are talking about outsourcing, you \nare not only talking about families who have worked hard, played by the \nrules, and are being outsourced; a decision is being made over which \nthey have no control. But you would think at the end of the day, if the \nparts are cheaper, if everything is cheaper, then at least the vehicle \nor some other part would be cheaper; but, no, the same cost, but the \nprofits go to the CEOs.\n\n  That was Glenn of Oxford, MI, last Friday night on the CNN show.\n  Here is Walter, of Gary, IL:\n\n       When did the American dream become buying goods and \n     services as cheap as possible?\n\n  That is a pretty good question: ``When did the American dream become \nbuying goods and services as cheap as possible?''\n\n       It used to be to have a good job, buy an affordable home, \n     raise our children and hope that our children will be able to \n     do the same if not better in the future.\n\n  That is the definition of the American dream. That is the dream that \nis being trampled on every single day, and we need to have national \nleadership that understands what is happening out across this country.\n  It is stunning to me--absolutely stunning to me--that we cannot have \na recognition about what is happening in terms of the current \nsituation. These are the facts.\n  In the Bush economy, corporate profits ballooned compared to workers' \nwages. On this chart is shown the change in the share of corporate-\nsector income, profits, and workers' wages, which is in the dark tan. \nAnd what is shown on the chart is for the early 1990s recovery--the \nearly 1990s recovery--compared to today's recovery that this President \nis talking about. He talked about it today. He talked about it in the \nState of the Union. He said everything is hunky-dory. Yet we have \nspelled out what is happening to real working families. This chart \ntells the story. And they must have this chart down at the Council of \nEconomic Advisers. They must have this chart down in the White House. \nSomeone ought to put this one on the desk of the President. Here it is.\n  In the early 1990s, the share of the recovery was 60.29 percent for \nworkers' wages, and for corporate profits it was 39 percent.\n\n[[Page S1440]]\n\n  What about today? Well, here it is. Eighty-six percent of today's \n``recovery'' goes to corporate profits and 13 percent is going to the \nwages of workers.\n  This tells it all as to what is happening in terms of the American \neconomy. The workers are getting short shrift across this country. You \ncan take all of the statistics, and the President can make all the \nspeeches--as he did in the State of the Union and as he did today--but \nit is not telling the full story. This tells the full story. This tells \nwhat is happening to workers in this country. It is told in the lost \nhopes and dreams of workers who have seen their jobs go overseas, but \nit is also told in these other facts.\n  I will just show you this chart about the Bush economy creating low-\npaying jobs. Let's take the late 1990s--1998 to 2000--the fourth \nquarter. This is the quarter of the growth period out of the recession. \nAnd here are comparable periods of time out of the recession between \nthe 1990s and the year 2000 and the current recovery and what has \nhappened with low-paying wages.\n  This is what we were talking about before, the loss of income, jobs \nbeing lost and the new jobs paying less and less and less, both men and \nwomen working harder, working longer, corporate profits booming, \nworkers working harder and making a good deal less, with the average \nincome for those working families going down.\n  Here is a chart that shows the recovery is the worst for workers \nsince the Great Depression. This is the comparison for the month the \nrecession ended about what happened to workers' salaries. In 1961, when \nwe had a period of economic growth and price stability, the longest \nperiod of economic growth and price stability with the exception of \nPresident Clinton, until the time of the ballooning of the spending in \nthe Vietnam war. But the wages went up 10.7 percent. In the 1970s, it \ncame in at 12 percent; in 1975, 9 percent; November of 1982, 11 \npercent; March of 1991, 3.6 percent--not very much. This is the period \nof time President Clinton turned this country around, creating 21 \nmillion jobs. And then the first increase was 3.6 percent. Now it is \nfour-tenths of 1 percent.\n  How many more indicators do we need?\n  The fact is, we are facing a serious economic crisis in workplaces \nacross the Nation. This administration appears not to understand it. In \na statement of the President to the National Governors Association, he \ntalked again about how well the economy is doing, how pleased he is \nwith the progress we are making.\n  That is not what is happening on Main Street, USA. All across this \nNation, in 48 out of the 50 States, too many jobs are going abroad. We \nhear about it in our States and all across the Nation. Everyone appears \nto know about it except the administration. Their only answer to any of \nour problems is providing additional tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, is the Senator from Massachusetts aware of \nwhat happened last week regarding one of the President's chief economic \nadvisors, N. Gregory Mankiw, Chairman of the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisors? Recognizing that the country has lost 2.8 million \nmanufacturing jobs during the time he has been President, is the \nSenator aware that this man recommends that in an effort to bolster \nmanufacturing jobs, he wants to have people who work at McDonald's \nreclassified as manufacturers? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  I will read exactly what the man said, in case the Senator missed \nthat. The plan is to simply reclassify existing jobs in the fast food \nindustry and declare they are now manufacturing jobs. He said:\n\n       When a fast-food restaurant sells a hamburger, for example, \n     is it providing a ``service'' or is it combining inputs to \n     ``manufacture'' a product?\n\n  Is the Senator aware of this statement which I would consider \nridiculous?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am. We want to reference it because it is so \nstartling. It is in chapter 2, page 73--what is manufacturing. The \nSenator has read it correctly. It is startling to me. We just read the \npapers in the last few days, if we look at what the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services has to do now in terms of correcting a record with \nregard to the disparities on health care because people over in the \nDepartment were cooking the books to give it more favorable statements \nand comments and facts with regard to the problems we are facing with \nminorities.\n  Then, of course, in the last day or so we read the comments of our \nfriend and colleague Senator Levin where he said the CIA had not been \nfrank and candid and honest with him in terms of providing information \nabout what sites had actually been given to the inspectors and whether \nthey had been given the most accurate sites in terms of the weapons of \nmass destruction. There was representation that they had, and we find \nout in the newspapers that they had not.\n  Then we are troubled today by the statement of the Secretary of \nEducation--who is my friend, although I differ with him--when he said \nthe NEA organization that represents the teachers is a terrorist \norganization. I was absolutely baffled by that comment. I will read the \nAP wire:\n\n       Education Secretary Rod Paige called the nation's largest \n     teachers union a ``terrorist organization'' during a private \n     White House meeting with governors on Monday. Democratic and \n     Republican governors confirmed the education secretary's \n     remarks about the [NEA]. ``Those were the words, `the NEA is \n     a terrorist organization,' '' said Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle \n     of Wisconsin. Several Democratic governors called the remarks \n     inappropriate.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the AP wire in its entirety in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Associated Press]\n\n  Paige Tells Governors Education Union Is ``Terrorist Organization''\n\n                           (By Robert Tanner)\n\n       WASHINGTON.--Education Secretary Rod Paige called the \n     nation's largest teachers union a ``terrorist organization'' \n     during a private White House meeting with governors on \n     Monday.\n       Democratic and Republican governors confirmed the \n     education's secretary's remarks about the National Education \n     Association.\n       ``These were the words, `The NEA is a terrorist \n     organization,' '' said Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle of \n     Wisconsin.\n       Several Democratic governors called the remarks \n     inappropriate.\n       ``He was making a joke, probably not a very good one,'' \n     said Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania. ``Of course he \n     immediately divorced the NEA from ordinary teachers, who he \n     said he supports.''\n       ``I don't think the NEA is a terrorist organization,'' said \n     Rendell, who has butted heads with the group as well. \n     ``They're not a terrorist organization any more than the \n     National Business Organization is a terrorist organization.\n       Neither the Education Department nor NEA had an immediate \n     comment on Paige's comments. Both indicated the statements \n     were forthcoming.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I am stunned by the statement of Secretary Paige. I have \nthe greatest respect for Governor Doyle. I know if he said he said it, \nhe said it. But with regard to the NEA, for example, someone I went to \nhigh school with spent much of his adult life working for the NEA, \norganizing all over the West. That is a terrible thing to say about my \nfriend Rinaldo Martinez, that he is part of a terrorist organization. \nThat is stunning.\n  Back to the loss of 2.8 million manufacturing jobs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I may make a quick comment, since we are on that \nsubject, on the statement by the Secretary, whether it was said \nseriously or in jest, this illustrates in crystal-clear terms the \nmisplaced values of the administration when they roll out the red \ncarpet for the big drug companies, the HMOs, the insurance companies in \nrecent Medicare legislation, and then slap our Nation's teachers in the \nface with unacceptable language. I say they are wrong. I believe \nSecretary Paige owes the Nation's teachers and the people an \nexplanation and a full apology.\n  Mr. REID. The President's people want to reclassify people who work \nat McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's as manufacturing so that the \nloss of manufacturing jobs appears less. But would the Senator comment \non the fact that it seems it may be better for the President's folks to \ndwell on people who work in those places not having a\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\nraise in the minimum wage for as long as they have? People are working \ntwo and three jobs to make ends meet just barely. We don't hear a word \nfrom the administration, not a single word on increasing the minimum \nwage for these people who work in these places that they want to \nreclassify as manufacturing jobs, where they now make $5.15 an hour. \nAnd we have been stymied procedurally from raising even an up-or-down \nvote on the minimum wage that will allow us to do that. Yet they want \nto reclassify people who work in those places as manufacturers. Is this \nthe height of nonsense?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. Here we have the \nadministration effectively misleading the country in terms of where we \nare going in terms of the economy and the numbers of jobs and the types \nof jobs. But at the same time, as the Senator correctly points out, we \nhave not seen an increase in the minimum wage for 7 years. The \npurchasing power of the minimum wage now is close to the lowest it has \never been.\n  We know there is a majority in the Senate that is for an increase in \nthe minimum wage, but we are being blocked in this body and in the \nHouse of Representatives by the fact that the President and this \nadministration are opposed to an increase in the minimum wage, as they \nare opposed to an extension of unemployment compensation so that we \nhave some 90,000 workers a week, men and women who have contributed \ninto the unemployment compensation fund that is in a surplus of $17 \nbillion, and we find that the administration has opposed the request of \nour friend and colleague from Washington, Senator Cantwell, who along \nwith others, has a dozen times requested that we take up a temporary \nextension of the unemployment compensation for workers.\n  Not only that, as the Senator well knows, we have an administration \nthat is opposed to overtime for 8 million workers in this country, of \nwhom many are policemen, firefighters, and nurses, who are the backbone \nof our homeland security.\n  People say, what could you do right away? They ask Senator Kerry, \nwhat can you do now? Well, you could do something today if you had \ndifferent leadership that would make a significant and important impact \non the lives of 7 million Americans with regard to the minimum wage, \nhundreds of thousand of workers regarding unemployment, and 8 million \nAmericans with regard to overtime. That is what you can do today with \ndifferent leadership, let alone what you could do if you had a \nPresident who was prepared to help eliminate the tax loopholes that \nsend our jobs overseas; or they can try to bring in American companies \nand try to work with them to find ways of stabilizing this whole issue \nabout the export of jobs and find ways of keeping them. There are many \nways this can be done, but you will not get it done when you have a \nPresident who at noontime today said to the Governors: Everything is \nfine, the economy is growing, don't worry, we are just doing fine; \neverything is going along in a very positive way.\n  I am troubled the message is not getting through.\n  Mr. REID. We have heard a lot about the loss of manufacturing jobs in \nour country.\n  There are traditionally very good jobs, the kind that can really \nsupport a family--decent hourly wages, good health care coverage, and \npaid vacations. They provide an honest day's pay for an honest day's \nwork because these jobs aren't easy.\n  It takes concentration, skill and stamina to stand on an assembly \nline making automobiles, or aircraft, or televisions, or dungarees. And \nmost important of all, it requires pride in a job well done.\n  When I grew up, you saw the ``made in the USA label'' on almost \neverything you bought. It was an assurance that a product was of the \nhighest quality because it had been manufactured by American workers.\n  Today it's hard to find that label on many products because fewer and \nfewer things are being ``made in the USA.''\n  Over the last 42 months, our Nation has lost manufacturing jobs every \nsingle month--a total of 2.8 million jobs.\n  These are the statistics, and behind these statistics are 2.8 million \ngrim stories.\n  Every time a job is lost, a family's world is torn apart.\n  A worker loses the self-esteem of supporting a family, and also loses \nthe sense of pride in a job well done. The family will probably lose \ntheir health coverage. Maybe they'll have to give up their dream of \nowning a home, or their children will have to forget about attending \ncollege.\n  This is why the loss of manufacturing jobs is such a crisis in our \ncountry.\n  For months now, we have wondered whether the administration has a \nplan to revive our manufacturing sector, and help create new \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Mr. President, I believe in giving credit where credit is due. It now \nappears that the administration might in fact have a plan to create \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Unfortunately, that plan is simply to reclassify existing jobs in the \nfast food industry and declare that they are now ``manufacturing'' \njobs!\n  This idea was suggested in the Economic Report of the President which \nwas sent to Congress last week, and by N. Gregory Mankiw, the chairman \nof the President's Council of Economic Advisers.\n  To reiterate, in a speech to economists, Mr. Mankiw said that \nreclassifying fast food jobs as manufacturing was ``an important \nconsideration'' in setting economic policy. And the White House drew a \nbox around this part of the Economic Report:\n\n       When a fast-food restaurant sells a hamburger, for example, \n     is it providing a ``service'' or is it combining inputs to \n     ``manufacture'' a product?\n       Sometimes, seemingly subtle differences can determine \n     whether an industry is classified as manufacturing. For \n     example, mixing water and concentrate to produce soft drinks \n     is classified as manufacturing. However, if that activity is \n     performed at a snack bar, it is considered a service.\n\n  According to an article in last Friday's New York Times, some \neconomists in the administration want to count flipping hamburgers as \nmanufacturing so they can claim more jobs in that sector of the \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, if this idea wasn't such a cruel mockery of American \nworkers and their families, it would be funny.\n  I have nothing against people who work in the food service industry. \nHere in the Senate I have fought to protect these workers. I have tried \nto get a vote on increasing the minimum wage. And I have fought to \nprotect overtime pay.\n  But it is a fact that very few food service jobs can compete with \ngood manufacturing jobs in terms of supporting a family.\n  I suppose the food service workers could organize themselves into \nunions, as many factory workers have done. Maybe they could call \nthemselves the Amalgamated Hamburger Assembly Workers or the \nBrotherhood of French Fry Baggers.\n  They could call themselves that, but they would still be food service \nworkers, not factory workers. And their jobs would still be service \njobs, not manufacturing jobs.\n  You can change all the terminology you want, but you can't change the \nfact that our country desperately needs a real plan to boost our \nmanufacturing sector.\n  We need to look at tax credits for businesses to create manufacturing \njobs; we need to cut health care costs; and we need to enforce our \ntrade agreements so they will be fair to American workers.\n  We need a plan that recognizes what the loss of manufacturing jobs \nhas meant to almost three million American families.\n  This is a serious problem. But this suggestion by the administration \ncan't be taken seriously.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this is an insult to Lucille Rocket of \nDurfee High School in Fall River. She works hard to bring smaller \nlearning communities to school to help kids learn. She mentors \nteachers. She is an enormously constructive and positive person in the \nhigh school system as a member of the NEA in my State.\n  Cathy Moriarty teaches at-risk second grade children in Springfield's \ngymnasium because they don't have enough classrooms. She believes the \nNo Child Left Behind Act doesn't fund the needed support for smaller \nclass size and better trained teachers. She is a member of an \norganization that speaks\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\nto that issue. She is proud of it. I am proud of her.\n  Amanda Pellerin-Duck, who is in Springfield's Commerce High School, \nbrought new curriculum on global issues to school. She cares about the \nquality of education and she has spoken out about the importance of \nmaking sure we are going to get it right with the No Child Left Behind.\n  Ellen Peterson is a first grade teacher who helped new teachers on \nher own time. These teachers give of themselves every day. They are \ndevoted to the children and they care deeply about the quality of \neducation, and they are members of an organization that was insulted.\n  Cindy Douglas teaches kindergarten in Franklin with limited supplies \nand does an extraordinary job. She believes this administration and \nthis Nation should put funding of education at a higher priority.\n  Those are real people who are members of this organization. We have \nnot always agreed, the NEA and myself, on education issues. But I \nadmire their work in my own State, and I admire the work they have done \nhistorically on education. I have been a member of that committee for \n42 years. It is absolutely startling, Madam President. Probably for the \ntime I have been on the committee, for 20 years, we never voted on any \nissue. Everything was bipartisan--all the education issues. We had it \nunder a Republican, Senator Stafford, who is still alive, a wonderful \nelderly Senator from Vermont, and Senator Pell, a dear and valued \nfriend of mine and my family, who is from Rhode Island. We never voted \non education issues. They were bipartisan for 20-odd years. Most of \nus--at least I did--thought we had a bipartisan effort with this \nadministration on the No Child Left Behind. We had extraordinary \noverwhelming support in this body and in the House of Representatives \ntrying to get this job done. We were going to have reform, but with \nthat, we have to have investment. We got the reform, but not the \ninvestment. We have left children, I believe, hanging high and dry.\n  It is not just the Senator from Massachusetts saying it. It is also \neducation leadership in the State of Utah, in Republican States alike \nthat are talking about this. That is why, as we are trying to deal with \nan issue of such high importance and priority, we should be beyond and \nfar away from the inappropriate use of terms in characterizing an \norganization that has worked so long and hard to improve the quality of \neducation for the children in this country.\n  This legislation, S. 2061, is not a serious attempt to address a \nsignificant problem being faced by physicians in some States. It is the \nproduct of a party caucus rather than the bipartisan deliberations of a \nSenate committee. It was designed to score political points, not to \nachieve the bipartisan consensus which is needed to enact major \nlegislation.\n  This bill contains most of the same arbitrary and unreasonable \nprovisions which were decisively rejected by a bipartisan majority of \nthe Senate last year. The only difference is that last year's bill took \nbasic rights away from all patients, while this bill takes those rights \naway only from women and newborn babies who are the victims of \nnegligent obstetric and gynecological care. That change does not make \nthe legislation more acceptable. On the contrary, it adds a new element \nof unfairness.\n  The proponents argue that they are somehow doing these women and \ntheir babies a favor by depriving them of the right to fair \ncompensation when they are seriously injured. It is an Alice in \nWonderland argument which they are making. Under their proposal, a \nwoman whose gynecologist negligently failed to diagnose her cervical \ncancer until it had spread and become incurable would be denied the \nsame legal rights as a man whose doctor negligently failed to diagnose \nhis prostate cancer until it was too late. Is that fair? By what \nconvoluted logic would that woman be better off? Both the woman and the \nman were condemned to suffer a painful and premature death as a result \nof their doctors' malpractice, but her compensation would be severely \nlimited while his would not. She would be denied the right to introduce \nthe same evidence of medical negligence which he could. She would be \ndenied the same freedom to select the lawyer of her choice which he \nhad. She would be denied the right to have her case tried under the \nsame judicial rules which he could. That hardly sounds like equal \nprotection of the law to me. Yet, that is what the advocates of this \nlegislation are proposing.\n  Of course, this bill does not only take rights away from women. It \ntakes them away from newborn babies who sustain devastating prenatal or \ndelivery injuries as well. These children face a lifetime with severe \nmental and physical impairments all because of an obstetrician's \nmalpractice or a defective drug or medical device. This legislation \nwould limit the compensation they can receive for lost quality of life \nto $250,000--$250,000 for an entire lifetime! What could be more \nunjust?\n  This is not a better bill because it applies only to patients injured \nby obstetrical and gynecological malpractice. That just makes it even \nmore arbitrary.\n  We must reject the simplistic and ineffective responses proposed by \nthose who contend that the only way to help doctors is to further hurt \nseriously injured patients. Unfortunately, as we saw in the Patients' \nBill of Rights debate, the Bush administration and Congressional \nRepublicans are again advocating a policy which will benefit neither \ndoctors nor patients, only insurance companies. Caps on compensatory \ndamages and other extreme ``tort reforms'' are not only unfair to the \nvictims of malpractice, they do not result in a reduction of \nmalpractice insurance premiums.\n  While those across the aisle like to talk about doctors, the real \nbeneficiaries will be insurance companies and large health care \ncorporations. This legislation would enrich them at the expense of the \nmost seriously injured patients; women and children whose entire lives \nhave been devastated by medical neglect and corporate abuse.\n\n  This proposal would shield HMOs that refuse to provide needed care, \ndrug companies whose medicine has toxic side effects, and manufacturers \nof defective medical devices. This legislation is attempting to use the \nsympathetic family doctor as a Trojan horse concealing an enormous \narray of special legal privileges for every corporation which makes a \nhealth care product, provides a health care service, or insures the \npayment of a medical bill. Every provision of this bill is carefully \ndesigned to take existing rights away from those who have been harmed \nby medical neglect and corporate greed.\n  It would drastically limit the financial responsibility of the entire \nhealth care industry to compensate injured patients for the harm they \nhave suffered. When will the Republican party start worrying about \ninjured patients and stop trying to shield big business from the \nconsequences of its wrongdoing?\n  This legislation would deprive seriously injured patients of the \nright to recover fair compensation for their injuries by placing \narbitrary caps on compensation for non-economic loss in all obstetrical \nand gynecological cases. These caps only serve to hurt those patients \nwho have suffered the most severe, life-altering injuries and who have \nproven their cases in court.\n  They are the children who suffered serious brain injuries at birth \nand will never be able to lead normal lives. They are the women who \nlost organs, reproductive capacity, and in some cases even years of \nlife. These are life-altering conditions. It would be terribly wrong to \ntake their rights away. The Bush administration talks about deterring \nfrivolous cases, but caps by their nature apply only to the most \nserious cases which have been proven in court. These badly injured \npatients are the last ones we should be depriving of fair compensation.\n  In addition to imposing caps, this legislation would place other \nmajor restrictions on seriously injured patients seeking to recover \nfair compensation. At every stage of the judicial process, it would \nchange long-established judicial rules to disadvantage patients and \nshield defendants from the consequences of their actions.\n  If we were to arbitrarily restrict the rights of seriously injured \npatients as the sponsors of this legislation propose, what benefits \nwould result? Certainly less accountability for health care providers \nwill never improve the quality of health care. It will not even result \nin less costly care. The cost of medical malpractice premiums \nconstitutes less\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\nthan two-thirds of 1 percent--0.66 percent--of the Nation's health care \nexpenditures each year. Malpractice premiums are not the cause of the \nhigh rate of medical inflation.\n  Over the last 15 years, medical costs increased by 113 percent. The \ntotal amount spent on medical malpractice insurance rose just 52 \npercent over that period, less than half the rate of inflation for \nhealth care services.\n  Data from the National Practitioners Data Bank shows the number of \npayouts by Ob/Gyns in medical malpractice cases is not increasing. It \nhas been relatively stable over the last twelve years. In fact, there \nwere 13 percent fewer payouts in 2002 than in 1991. Similarly, the \ntotal amount paid to settle malpractice claims against Ob/Gyns has \nremained flat over the past twelve years when adjusted for medical \ninflation. The evidence shows that contrary to the claims of those \npromoting this legislation, malpractice payouts are not causing the \ncost of health care to rise.\n\n  The White House and other supporters of caps have argued that \nrestricting an injured patient's right to recover fair compensation \nwill reduce malpractice premiums. But, there is scant evidence to \nsupport their claim. In fact, there is substantial evidence to refute \nit. In the past few years, there have been dramatic increases in the \ncost of medical malpractice insurance in States that already have \ndamage caps and other restrictive tort reforms on the statute books, as \nwell as in states that do not.\n  Caps are not only unfair to patients, they are also an ineffective \nway to control medical malpractice premiums. Comprehensive national \nstudies show that medical malpractice premiums are not significantly \nlower on average in States that have enacted damage caps and other \nrestrictions on patient rights than in States without these \nrestrictions. Insurance companies are merely pocketing the dollars \nwhich patients no longer receive when ``tort reform'' is enacted.\n  If a Federal cap on non-economic compensatory damages were to pass, \nit would sacrifice fair compensation for injured patients in a vain \nattempt to reduce medical malpractice premiums. Doctors will not get \nthe relief they are seeking. Only the insurance companies, which \ncreated the recent market instability, will benefit.\n  Doctors, especially those in high risk specialties, whose malpractice \npremiums have increased dramatically over the past few years do deserve \npremium relief. That relief will only come as the result of tougher \nregulation of the insurance industry. When insurance companies lose \nmoney on their investments, they should not be able to recover those \nlosses from the doctors they insure. Unfortunately, that is what is \nhappening now.\n  Doctors and patients are both victims of the insurance industry. \nExcess profits from the boom years should be used to keep premiums \nstable when investment earnings drop. However, the insurance industry \nwill never do that voluntarily. Only by recognizing the real problem \ncan we begin to structure an effective solution that will bring an end \nto unreasonably high medical malpractice premiums.\n  Finally, I understand we will be voting on cloture tomorrow. We just \nhad this legislation offered. We are here on a Monday. We are prepared \nfor action and discussion, but we are being required to vote tomorrow. \nI intend to vote no on the cloture motion. This is an important issue \naffecting the quality of health and fairness and justice for millions \nof women and babies. It does not deserve to be rushed through the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Outsourcing Jobs\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, last week the Senate was not in session \nand most of us in the Senate were in our home States. I spent most of \nthe week in North Dakota visiting with people about the economy, jobs, \nhealth care, and a wide range of issues. I had meetings on the issue of \nNo Child Left Behind, on the significant problem in rural States with \nmethamphetamine and the scourge this deadly new drug poses to young \npeople and to law enforcement. A lot of us were doing a lot of \nactivities last week. I wish to talk about a couple of issues that \nhappened since we left town.\n  Last week, there was a lot of discussion about the Economic Report of \nthe President that was sent to the Congress just prior to our leaving \ntown.\n  This week's BusinessWeek, March 1, 2004, says:\n\n       Will Outsourcing Hurt America's Supremacy?\n\n  That is similar to the front cover of BusinessWeek a year ago:\n\n       Is your job next? A new round of globalization is sending \n     upscale jobs offshore. They include chip design, engineering, \n     basic research--even financial analysis. Can America lose \n     these jobs and still prosper?\n\n  So BusinessWeek, in front covers, now and exactly 1 year ago from \nnow, asks the same questions: Will outsourcing hurt America's \nsupremacy?\n  The issue of outsourcing of jobs has been raised in the President's \nEconomic Report, and there has been a lot of discussion about it. I \nthought it would be helpful perhaps to read it because it gets back to \nthe question of international trade and its impact on our economy.\n  On page 25 of the Economic Report of the President, it says: \nOutsourcing of professional services is a prominent example of the new \ntype of trade. The gains from trade that take place over the Internet \nor telephone lines are no different than the gains from trade in \nphysical goods transported by ship or by plane. When a good or service \nis produced at a lower cost in another country, it makes sense to \nimport it rather than to produce it domestically.\n  Let me read that last sentence again. When a good or service is \nproduced at a lower cost in another country, it makes sense to import \nit rather than produce it domestically.\n  So that created a significant debate. This is a booklet, the Economic \nReport of the President, that is extolling the virtues of outsourcing \nof American jobs. It is safe to say, perhaps, that no economist who \nworked on this booklet has ever had their job outsourced. In fact, I \nknow of no American economist who has lost his or her job because of \noutsourcing. I also know of no politician in this country who has lost \nhis or her job because the job was outsourced to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, \nChina, or Indonesia.\n  So it is easy then for politicians and economists to thumb their \nsuspenders, smoke their cigars, ruminate, cogitate about these things, \nand come up with this goofy idea that somehow when a good or service is \nproduced at a lower cost in another country, it makes sense to import \nit rather than produce it domestically.\n  I will take this point just for a moment and see if I can dissect it \nby talking about bicycles. I know I have spoken about this before, but \nrepetition is the hallmark of good policy, so let me do it again. When \nit can be produced less expensively overseas, the President's economic \nadvisers and the President's report say do it. Well, Huffy bicycles are \na good example. The company that made Huffy bicycles had 20 percent of \nthe domestic market. People can buy these bicycles from Sears, Wal-\nMart, and Kmart. Most people know about Huffy bicycles. They used to be \nmade in this country. They were made in Ohio by American workers. Those \nAmerican workers made $11 an hour making bicycles.\n  I did not know one of the workers but I am sure they were proud of \ntheir jobs and proud of their product. They made Huffy bicycles. In \nfact, on Huffy bicycles the decal on the front between the front fender \nand the handlebars was an American flag decal made by American workers. \nSo Huffy bicycles moved to China. Why? Because it costs $11 to hire an \nAmerican to work to make a Huffy bicycle and a Chinese worker can be \nhired for 33 cents an hour.\n  Huffy left Ohio and went to China. The last job that was done by the \nworkers in Ohio was to replace the little flag decal with a decal of \nthe globe. They removed the flag and put a globe on the front of Huffy \nbicycles.\n  The last bicycle that was boxed up and left the plant in Celina, OH, \nwas at 10:15 in the morning when a red 20-inch\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\nHuffy model was put in a box for shipment, and then Huffy changed its \nnationality. Huffy bikes are now Chinese.\n  Now, bicycles do not speak, so there was no visible sign of this \nchange of nationality when the Huffy showed up at Wal-Mart or Kmart or \nSears. They are now for sale as a Chinese bicycle rather than an \nAmerican bicycle.\n  Question: Does anybody think that when Huffy decided to send its \nbicycle production to China, those bicycles ended up on the showroom \nfloor of Wal-Mart or Kmart at a much lower price because instead of \npaying $11 an hour for workers constructing these bicycles, they were \nnow paying 33 cents an hour?\n  Instead of having safe workplaces, there are none of those OSHA \nproblems in China. Instead of having a manufacturing plant where they \ncannot put chemicals in the water and put chemicals into the air, there \nare none of those restrictions in China. Instead of having child labor \nlaws where 12-year-olds cannot be hired to work 14 hours a day, there \nare none of those restrictions in China.\n\n  So is it less expensive to produce Huffy bicycles in China? Darn \nright it is. Does the consumer benefit from that? Do my colleagues \nthink Huffy bicycles that showed up on the showroom floor of Kmart and \nWal-Mart are less expensive bicycles after they cut manufacturing costs \nof workers from $11 an hour to 33 cents an hour? The answer is no, of \ncourse they aren't.\n  This has nothing to do with advantaging consumers. It has to do with \ncorporate profits. It has to do with laying off Americans and fattening \nprofits.\n  So going to page 25 of the Economic Report of the President, his \neconomic advisers say: When a good or service is produced at lower cost \nin another country, it makes sense to import it rather than produce it \ndomestically. The keyword here is cost. They know the cost of \neverything and the value of nothing, as the old saying goes.\n  I will tell my colleagues where things can be produced at less cost: \nMexico, Indonesia, Bangladesh, China. I can name a dozen countries. But \nis that the only criterion? Is that the judgment we are going to make \nin this country: If it costs less somewhere, then there is an advantage \nto producing it there and shipping it back here and there is some sort \nof inherent advantage to our consumers? It is simply not true.\n  I do not understand whether it is being hard headed or soft headed to \nfail to understand the basic truths about international trade. I am not \nsomeone who believes we should build a fence around our country but I \ndo believe there ought to be some fairness with respect to the rules of \nthis globalization.\n  I will describe for a moment something I did just before the break. I \ncame to the Senate floor and I listed--which, incidentally, is on my \nWeb site as well at http://Dorgan.Senate.gov for those who might be \ninterested--the top 100 companies that basically moved jobs to Mexico \nafter the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  Now these 100 companies--this is not conjecture from me--these are \ncompanies that certified to the Department of Labor that these jobs \nwere no longer going to exist because of the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. Why did they certify it? Because they wanted to make \neligible the workers who were being laid off for this transitional \ntrade adjustment assistance. What a wonderful, remarkable term: \nTransitional trade adjustment assistance. That means, for somebody out \nthere who is losing their job, they are going to be transitioned and \nthey are going to get some assistance in the short term. Guess what. \nOne loses their job, they get transitioned, we give them some money, \nand then go away, please.\n  So in order to get that transitional assistance, one had to have a \ncertification from their company. So here is a certification. Levi \nStrauss, 15,676 jobs, mostly moved to Mexico; they certified that. I am \nnot accusing them of it. I am just saying they certified that to the \nDepartment of Labor. Levi's, now that is all American; right? Everybody \nwears Levi's, but Levi's are not American anymore. They are made \nelsewhere. Fruit of the Loom used to be in Texas. They certified 5,352 \njobs gone, T-shirts, shorts, underwear; Fruit of the Loom, not \nAmerican, gone.\n  Do my colleagues want to order some Mexican food? Well, they do not \nhave to say: Give me a chalupa, give me an enchilada. What they can say \nis: Give me some Fig Newtons, because Fig Newtons left America and went \nto Mexico. They are gone. Do my colleagues think Fig Newtons are made \nat home? No, they are not. Fig Newtons are on this list, certified as \nleaving America. Why? Because they can make them less expensively \nelsewhere.\n  How many Americans know that Fig Newtons now come from Mexico? So we \nlose our Fruit of the Loom, we lose our Levi's, we lose our Fig \nNewtons.\n  I am mentioning some things that are not high tech. I should mention \nsome high tech--Motorola telephones. Let me give an interesting \nstatistic that most people would not believe.\n  Do you know that after NAFTA, when we were told that what would be \nshipped to this country from Mexico would largely be the result of low-\nskilled, low-wage labor, they said that is what this is going to be. We \nare accessing the Mexican marketplace for low-skilled, low-wage labor \nwhich will ship jobs into this country and it will not displace those \nin this manufacturing sector who have good jobs, making good money, \nbecause they have high-skilled, high-wage jobs. Wrong. The three \nlargest categories of manufactured items coming into the United States \nfrom Mexico are automobiles, electronics, and automobile parts.\n  Did you know in a recent year we imported more automobiles into the \nUnited States from the country of Mexico than we exported to all the \nrest of the world? I am going to say that again. The United States \nimported more automobiles from Mexico than we exported to all of the \nrest of the world. That describes to you what happened with NAFTA--a \nsubstantial flight of U.S. jobs, good manufacturing jobs, good-paying \njobs to Mexico.\n  It is all about wages. I understand that. So you go to page 25 and \nthe issue here is not about values. It is not about the American \neconomy. It is not about caring whether this world-class economy of \nours retains a strong manufacturing base--which I think is essential to \nbe a country with a strong world-class economy. It is not about that. \nIt is about cost.\n  When a good or service is produced at a lower cost in another country \nit makes sense to import it.\n  So you say, ``So long to American jobs.'' There are no tears shed for \nthat with these economists.\n  Of course they sit there without worrying about their jobs because no \neconomists I know have lost their jobs. No economists lost their jobs \nto NAFTA. No politician lost his or her job. Despite the fact that \neverybody was wrong.\n  This describes what happened. This happens to be the 100 top \ncompanies that certify job loss: Only with respect to Mexico; only with \nrespect to NAFTA.\n  We were told. The best economists said: Pass this North American \nFree-Trade Agreement because if you do we will produce substantial new \njobs. Guess what. We had a small trade surplus with Mexico. We passed \nNAFTA, the North American Free-Trade Agreement, and that small surplus \nturned into a giant deficit. Ross Perot called it a giant sucking \nsound, and those jobs have gone to Mexico wholesale.\n  We had a modest deficit, a relatively modest deficit with Canada, \nwhich is the other country that is the participant in the North \nAmerican Free-Trade Agreement, and that has become a very large \ndeficit.\n  In both cases with Mexico and Canada, all the experts were wrong and \nwe have dramatically increased the Federal trade deficit with respect \nto both countries.\n  Let me also say in the Economic Report of the President there has \nbeen a discussion in recent days about what is manufacturing, because \nthey pose the question on page 73. They ask a question.\n  The definition of a manufactured product, however, is not \nstraightforward. When a fast food restaurant sells a hamburger, for \nexample, is it providing a service? Or is it combining inputs to \nmanufacture a product?\n  I don't know exactly which economist might have written page 73, but \nwhen a fast food restaurant sells a hamburger, is it providing a \nservice or is it combining inputs to manufacture a product? This rather \nserious economist poses one of the questions of our\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n\nera: Should a hamburger be considered part of our manufacturing base? \nShould the making of a hamburger be considered part of our \nmanufacturing base?\n  How about the person who hangs out the window and says, Do you want \nfries with that? Is that a key part of the manufacturing base? Where \ndoes this go?\n  What would your mom, or my late mother, think if you came home and \nsaid what you had been doing and you told her you had been \nmanufacturing chocolate pie? I don't think so.\n  Sometimes in this town language becomes such a barrier to \nunderstanding. This is so fundamentally absurd on its face. Is making a \nhamburger part of America's manufacturing base? The answer is of course \nnot. Of course not.\n  We have lost a massive number of manufacturing jobs in this country \nin recent years. I suppose some of the same economists who have sold us \non this economic strategy may want to make it appear as if we have lost \nfewer jobs by counting those who construct a hamburger--two all-beef \npatties, special sauce, lettuce, whatever it is--as part of our \nmanufacturing sector. But of course on its face that is nuts and this \nought not be part of any significant or serious discussion.\n  There are a lot of questions being raised these days about jobs. Let \nme say I don't think, with all the discussion we have about social \nprograms in the Congress, there is not a social program in this country \nthat is as important as a good job that pays well. Because that is what \nhelps provide the security for America's families.\n  We are going through a time when we face the loss of a lot of jobs. \nWe face the restructuring of an economy. We did have a recession, \nrelatively short. We are now a year and a half past that recession and \nthe fact is we are still not producing any significant number of new \njobs. So the question for all of us is, Is this economic strategy a \nstrategy that produces new growth without new jobs?\n  Paul Craig Roberts, who was one of the top economists for the Reagan \nadministration, recently wrote a piece suggesting that perhaps this is \nan economic recovery without new jobs. If that is the case, we have \nsome serious problems ahead of us. He says maybe this new economy, this \nnew growth, does create jobs but not in the United States; jobs in \nChina, jobs elsewhere, just not jobs here. If that is the case, we face \nsignificant challenges.\n  We are going to have an agenda in this Senate that will move very \nquickly between now and the first Tuesday of November, which is \nelection day. I understand all that. We are going to be working on a \nlot of extraneous issues, some because one side or the other wants to \nhave a political wedge issue someplace. We on our side don't schedule \nthis place. The majority schedules it at this point so they will \ndetermine what is on the floor of the Senate.\n  But for me, I believe there is not a more important issue that we \nneed to deal with than the question, are we going to have an economic \nengine that creates jobs so the American families, as they talk about \ntheir lot in life, have a chance to visit about progress? How will \nAmerican families answer the questions: Do I have a good job? Does it \npay well? Do I have job security? Am I going to be outsourced?\n  And then answering the other questions that come from the ability to \nhave a decent job, Do we send our kids to schools we are proud of? Do \nGrandpa and Grandma have access to good health care? Do we live in a \nsafe neighborhood? Do we keep this country safe from terrorist attacks?\n  There are so many issues that confront us, but I think the issue of \njobs is critically important and we spend far too little time working \non it in the Senate.\n  I want to say this: Those who think it is a good thing to send \nAmerica's jobs overseas, those who think this is a new economic \napproach that is good for America, don't understand. Because they have \nnot been in that place. They have never been a part of a family where \nthey know about secondhand things, second jobs, second shifts, and \nsecond mortgages. They have never been a part of that. They think it is \njust fine to construct some economic theory, some model that says if we \ncan produce Huffy bicycles less expensively in China, good for us, \nlet's do it. Except the consumer doesn't benefit from that, it is just \nthe American workers who lose their jobs.\n  The questions these economists need to answer--and the politicians, \nincidentally, who support this, and there are plenty--is: Who will be \nthe purchasers and consumers in an economy in which you diminish and \nthen finally ship good jobs overseas? Who is going to purchase all of \nthese things you are producing overseas?\n  I have given a number of trade speeches. I come to the floor of the \nSenate and talk about this repeatedly and nobody seems to care very \nmuch. That is lamenting. I should not say it quite that way. It does \nnot result in dramatic change in public policy.\n\n  We can talk about the most recent trade agreement with China. We have \nroughly a $130 billion trade deficit with China right now. It has been \ngrowing leaps and bounds. Our negotiators negotiate an agreement with \nChina and say on the bilateral trade with respect to automobiles: We \nwill agree with this, China; you can ship any Chinese automobile you \nmay wish to manufacture to the United States, and we will charge a \ntariff of only 2\\1/2\\ percent. And we agree any U.S. cars we try to \nship to China are charged a tariff 10 times higher of 25 percent.\n  Stupid? Sure. On its face it is a stupid provision. We say to China, \nwhich has a $130 billion trade surplus with us, by the way, we will \nmake a deal. We want to have bilateral automobile trade, and we will \nlet you charge a tariff 10 times higher than we will.\n  I would love to find the negotiator who did that and see if we could \nnot find a way to prevent them from ever having a public sector job \nonce again. That makes no sense. Yet we see this time after time after \ntime.\n  As I speak today, every single pound of American beef that is sent to \nJapan has a 50-percent tariff on it. We have a huge trade deficit with \nJapan. Every pound of American beef sent to Japan has a 50-percent \ntariff. That is 15 years after our trade negotiators reached a beef \nagreement with Japan.\n  This country needs to get a backbone and stand up for its economic \ninterest. Yes, I am talking about ranchers. I am talking about \nmanufacturers. I am talking about business owners who do business in \nthis country and have to compete. We need a spine, backbone, some \nwillingness to stand up for the economic interests of this country, not \nbeing protectionists but just saying there needs to be some basic \nrules.\n  If, in fact, we are a global economy--and, indeed, we are--then the \nrules with respect to that global economy need to keep pace with \nglobalization.\n  We had people killed in the streets of this country in the last \ncentury. They gave their life fighting for some basic rights: The right \nto organize, basic rights for workers to organize. We had people fight \non the issue of child labor to prohibit the sending of 12-year-old \nchildren down into the coal mines and into manufacturing plants. We \nwaged fights over the issue of minimum wage and safe workplaces and the \nenvironmental laws that prohibit a plant from dumping its chemicals \ninto the air and water.\n  Now we are told forget all that because if you are a global company, \nyou pole-vault over that and go someplace where you do not have to \nworry about environmental or labor rules. That is a nuisance. Child \nlabor, minimum wage, the right to organize, that is a nuisance.\n  This is what we have dealt with for 100 years in order to create a \nmore perfect opportunity for business and labor. There is something \nfundamentally wrong.\n  I hope we can have a discussion about jobs in the Senate. I intend to \noffer a series of amendments at the next opportunity dealing with the \nissue of jobs and dealing with the issue of trade. The President has \njust finished a Central American Free-Trade Agreement. I believe we \nought to have that debate in the Senate. He has just completed the \nAustralian Free-Trade Agreement. We ought to have that debate in the \nSenate. I intend to be in the Senate opposing both. I will describe why \nlater. Neither, in my judgment, represents the best interests of this \ncountry. I want trade pacts to be mutually beneficial. That means they \nneed to benefit this country, as well.\n  What prompted me to speak were a couple things: One, this discussion\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\nabout outsourcing. The economists who wrote this--this is the \nPresident's book, actually signed by the President, but the fact is, I \nunderstand it is written by the President's economic advisers. He, in \nsome ways, began to do a U-turn and lost the steering wheel and turned \nback again. My hope is the President certainly does not believe this \nnonsense. Outsourcing of good jobs in this country, outsourcing of \nmanufacturing jobs, outsourcing of service jobs is not in this \ncountry's best interest. They say in the long run it will even out \nbecause the other countries will raise themselves up.\n\n  John Maynard Keynes said in the long run, we are all dead. I am \ninterested in the next year, the next 5 years, the next 20 years. I am \nrelatively uninterested in the realignment of the economies 100 years \nfrom now.\n  I want very much for this country to succeed. I want this country to \nremain a world economic power. It will not be a world economic power if \nit is deep in debt, up to its neck in fiscal policy deficits and up to \nits neck in trade deficits. We have fiscal policy deficits this year \nalone of about $660 billion. I know the numbers that are advertised are \n$530 billion, but that is if you take the Social Security revenue, \nwhich is a dishonest thing to do. So $660 billion in Federal budget \ndeficits, and add to that the highest trade deficits in human history, \nvery close to $480 billion, and it is appropriate to look at this \ncountry's fiscal policy and trade policy and ask: Where is the \nleadership? Where does the leadership come from to address these \nissues?\n  My hope is that I and others who care a great deal about this can \nprovide some of that leadership. We invite the President and people \nfrom both political parties to join us. This President needs to speak \nforcefully in response to this ``Economic Report of the President.'' He \nneeds to say: This is not what I mean. The economists may have written \nit, but I don't believe outsourcing strengthens our country. I don't \nbelieve moving American jobs overseas strengthens the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \nmedical liability reform and the bill pending before the Senate. This \nlegislation is a narrowed-down version of what myself and Senator Gregg \nintroduced last year, which in contrast was a broad-based medical \nliability reform bill. Today we pared it down to limit it just to OB/\nGYNs, nurse midwives, and any other provider involved in the delivery \nof babies.\n  The reason we have done this is fairly typified in my State and in \nmany other States around the country by this picture. It is a real life \npicture taken only days ago: the building moniker reads ``OBGYN,'' and \nnext to it, a sign now hangs that reads ``For Lease,'' and call a \nparticular number. This sign indicates how OB/GYNs are leaving practice \nin my State and in other States across the country because they can no \nlonger afford their medical liability premiums.\n  This is a problem that some describe as not that big a deal. But if \nyou talk to the women who cannot get obstetrical and gynecological \nservices, it is a crisis to them.\n  Southern Nevada is the fastest growing population center in the \ncountry. We have 6,000 new people moving in a month and are we not \ngetting as many new OB/GYNs as we need. We need a lot of new doctors \ncoming to our State. But instead of new doctors arriving to practice in \nNevada, we have doctors limiting their practices and stopping either \nthe practice of obstetrics or leaving our State altogether.\n  The American Medical Association has identified 19 States that are in \ncrisis, and all but 5 States are showing signs the crisis is building \nin their State.\n  Some people have said: Well, this is about rich doctors versus rich \nlawyers. This is not about doctors versus lawyers. This is about access \nto care. This is about a woman who is thinking: ``I want to have the \nbest possible care for my baby,'' and she cannot find a doctor.\n  I have a good friend who lives in Las Vegas. He delivers high-risk \npregnancies. These are the people you want to have as your best \ndoctors. However, because of the huge increases in rates, his insurance \ncompany has limited him on the number of deliveries he can make during \nthe year.\n  That is not what we want to be doing. We want to have the best people \ndelivering babies, especially for high-risk pregnancies which require \nthe most skill.\n  It is our legal system that is out of control. Unfortunately, we have \ntrial lawyers out there who are taking advantage of our broken civil \njustice system. They are even advertising on TV. I am sure many people, \nwhen they watch TV, have seen these 1-800 numbers you can call to find \nsomebody to sue. It is basically: Bring your Rolodex and we will figure \nout who you are going to sue. That goes for almost anything today, but \nit is especially prevalent in the field of medicine.\n  Across America the crisis is happening not just with OB/GYNs. As a \nresult, in this bill, we have decided to focus also on nurse-midwives, \nthe overall practice of delivering babies, and providing gynecological \ncare because it is the most acute problem we are seeing across the \ncountry.\n  In my State, we did pass a medical liability reform bill in August of \n2002, but the only reason that it was able to pass was because our \ntrauma center closed. It was the only level I trauma center for a \nregion of 10,000 square miles, and it closed because of the medical \nliability crisis. The only way that trauma center was able to open \nagain was because the State decided to step in and put its liability \ncap on anybody who provided care through the level I trauma center. \nPeople have been arguing that $250,000 is not enough. Well, the State \nof Nevada's cap on damages is $50,000 for anyone who chooses to sue a \nhealthcare professional that provided care at the trauma center. That \nalone allowed the level I trauma center to open.\n  This is the same level I trauma center where Roy Horn, the famous \nperson from the duo of Siegfried and Roy, was treated when he was \nattacked by a tiger. If it was not for the State of Nevada applying its \n$50,000 damage cap, that trauma center would not have been available \nfor Roy. He certainly would be in much worse shape today if that had \nnot been the case, and maybe he would not have made it at all if that \nkind of care was not available. This example indicates the politics of \nwhat can happen when a crisis gets so great that the trial lawyers \ncannot stand up and keep their stranglehold on our legislatures around \nthe country.\n  Today, we need to have the same thing happen in the Senate where \npeople around the country call their Senators and say the crisis is too \nsevere. We need to have special interests, especially trial lawyers' \nspecial interests, put aside, and we need to put the practice of \nmedicine first. We need to put first access to quality care for women \nand those new babies coming into the world. We need to put their \ncare above all else.\n\n  Last year, the University of Nevada School of Medicine had the lowest \nnumber of students entering obstetrics and gynecology it has had since \n1999. And, equally disturbing, each year since 2000, that number has \ncontinued to go down and down and down.\n  This chart shows the very clear contrast of what has happened in my \nState and other States versus California. Why do I put California up \nversus the rest of the States in the country? The reason is because \nCalifornia enacted what is known as MICRA. MICRA is their medical \nliability reform law which they enacted in 1975. After withstanding \neleven years of court challenges, it has now been in effect for about \neighteen years and we know it is working.\n  By the way, the people in lawsuits are getting plenty of compensation \nin California. But the difference in premium increases--California \ncompared to the rest of the country--is stark. In California, from 1976 \nto today, there has been a 167-percent increase. For the rest of the \ncountry, however, it is over 500 percent. Moreover, these percentages \ndo not reflect the last couple of years. If the last couple years were\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\nshown, this red line showing the 500 percent would almost be spiking \nbecause it is going up so rapidly.\n  To put this in real dollar terms, so you can get a comparison between \ndifferent States, here are some really good examples. This is 2002 \npremium survey data for selected specialties. We are comparing the \ncities of Los Angeles--once again, California has the MICRA law it \nenacted--and Denver, which is in another State that has enacted very \nsimilar legislation. The laws in California and Colorado are the ones \nSenator Gregg and I based our legislation on. These two States have \nstrong medical liability reform in their States. These other States \nshown on the chart do not. Let's see the difference. Let's go down on \nthe lower portion of the chart because we are talking about OB/GYNs. \nLet's talk about the difference in the States. For Los Angeles, $54,000 \na year--still a lot of money, but $54,000. In Denver, it is around \n$31,000. In New York, it is $90,000. In Las Vegas, where I live, it was \n$108,000 in 2002, and you cannot get it for $108,000 anymore. \nCurrently, it is closer to $140,000 or $170,000 in my State, and even \nhigher. In Chicago, it is $102,000. In Miami, it is over $200,000 a \nyear.\n  Is there any doubt in anybody's mind these laws are working when you \nlook at the comparisons? Like I said, this is data from 2002. If you \nhad 2003 data, the numbers would be even more stark. Consequently, I \nthink we need to call on our Senate colleagues to at least allow us to \ndebate this bill.\n  We are going to have what is called a cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed tomorrow. All that is is a parliamentary term here in the \nSenate as to whether we can proceed to the bill. The other side of the \naisle is blocking us from even proceeding to the bill, blocking us from \nhaving a reasonable debate on whether we are going to allow women to \nhave access to their OB/GYNs and to their nurse-midwife practitioners.\n  I have talked to so many people in my State, including patients, \ndoctors, nurses and other people throughout the healthcare system, \nhealthcare industry, and they know it is a crisis. But I have also \nvisited with people from around the country. My State is not the only \none that is in this type of a crisis. We are seeing severe problems \nfrom Pennsylvania to Mississippi to West Virginia to Washington State \nto Oregon, and all across the country. State after State after State \nhas a serious problem today. When debating whether to debate this \nbill--that is all we are doing today, debating whether to debate this \nbill--we need people to step up to do the right thing. We have a \nPresidential election coming up this year. I think the candidates need \nto explain where they are on this bill. Some of them are going to be \nout running for office and may not be able to vote on this, but they \nought to at least take a position on this bill to let people know where \nthey stand. Do they stand with the trial lawyers? Or do they stand with \npregnant mothers and unborn babies who need to come into this world?\n  I think it is clear where we should stand as a body. This body \nshould, in no uncertain terms, stand with protecting the patients of \nAmerica, with making sure when a woman needs care, whether it is \nobstetrics or gynecology, that the healthcare provider will be there. \nToo many of these providers are leaving practice today because of the \nhigh cost of liability premiums.\n\n  I want to respond to a couple points the other side always brings up. \nThey say the reason is not because of jury verdicts; rather, the reason \nfor these premium differences is because of investments in the stock \nmarket the insurance companies made and then they went bad.\n  The stock market went crazy last year. It went way back up. So if the \ninsurance companies were investing in the stock market, they would be \ndoing fine, and we would not see these types of increases. The \ninsurance companies in California and Colorado were invested in the \nstock market, just as the insurance companies in New York and Nevada \nand Illinois and in Florida. Yet there is this difference.\n  The only thing you can point to for the difference--and these are \ncities with similar population bases--is the reform laws that have been \npassed. They all invested in the same stock market. It was not the \nstock market that caused the premium increases. It was and is runaway \njury awards. Our country, unfortunately, has become too litigious. It \nis not about personal responsibility anymore. Jury awards are just out \nof control.\n  People say: Injured patients deserve their just compensation. Well, \nthey get just compensation in Colorado and California. I don't think \none could look at California and ask: Do they discriminate against \nwomen? That is one of the arguments you hear: Because women don't make \nas much money, that they are being discriminated against. Are we saying \nthe whole State of California discriminates against women? It is a \nludicrous argument.\n  We have to have reasonable reform. That is what we have put forward \ntoday, reasonable reform, so that access to care is there. If access to \ncare is not there, that is when discrimination against women will \nhappen. The OB/GYNs, which is what this bill addresses, are the part of \nthe medical profession that is in crisis the most. Of all of the \nvarious specialties, this is the one that is in the most severe crisis. \nObviously, it affects women more than it affects men. So in effect, if \nwe are not allowing women to have access to the OB/GYN care, not \npassing this bill will discriminate against women. People not voting \nfor this will be discriminating against women. That is why we need to \npass this legislation.\n  If you are opposed to the final version of the bill, at least let us \ngo to the bill, debate it, and amend it. But it seems the other side of \nthe aisle, the Democrats in the Senate, don't want to have any part of \nthis debate. The American people need to stand up to that. They need to \nstand up and make their voices heard, because this debate is too \ncritical. We are having, and we will continue to have, babies not \ndelivered with the kind of care they need. High-risk pregnancies need \nthe absolute finest modern medicine can bring them. If those people are \nlimiting their practices, and OB/GYNs are having to limit the number of \ndeliveries they make, then those high-risk pregnancies will not have \nthe kind of highly qualified medical care they need and deserve.\n  I could go into a lot of other statistics. I could talk about various \nanecdotes of people I have met. I would rather just sum up with this: \nIn a day and age where America has the finest health care system in the \nworld, where we have the finest quality, the best doctors, the best \nresearch institutions, the best hospitals, and where people from all \nover the world who can afford it come to America because of the high \nquality of care, if we want to keep the highest quality of care, we \nmust enact medical liability reform. This bill that is limited down to \njust affecting the practice of obstetrics and gynecology, we at least \nmust start here. I want to go much further than this, but let's at \nleast start here so American mothers who are having babies or American \nwomen who are seeking gynecological care can have access to that type \nof care.\n  One last point has to do with the uninsured. I have heard in the \nDemocratic debates talk about the 43 million uninsured. They want to do \nsomething about it. The main thing they could do to make healthcare \ninsurance more affordable would be to enact reasonable medical \nliability reform. That is what we have before us today. So for those \nwho are trying to make this a political issue, let's make it an issue \nthat we actually do something about instead of just talking about it on \nthe campaign trail.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a short time ago Congress debated \nlegislation to make the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a \nnational holiday. The floor leader for that legislation was a fellow \nname Bob Dole. And during the final debate, I had the privilege of \nsitting in the gallery with Coretta Scott\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\nKing, as we heard Bob deliver these words:\n\n       A nation defines itself in many ways; in the promises it \n     makes and the programs it enacts, the dreams it enshrines, or \n     the doors it slams shut. Thanks to Dr. King, America wrote \n     new laws to strike down old barriers. She built bridges \n     instead of walls . . . there is nothing partisan about \n     justice. It is conservative as the Constitution, as liberal \n     as Lincoln, as radical as Jefferson's sweeping assertion that \n     all of God's creation is equal in His eyes.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  I am very proud of the rich and vibrant African American Heritage in \nmy home state of North Carolina. Indeed, Mr. President, our history is \nfull of trailblazers, including, Franklin McCain, Joseph McNeil, Ezell \nBlair, Jr., and David Richmond, known as the Greensboro Four because of \ntheir February 1960 sit-in at a Woolworth Store counter in Greensboro, \nNorth Carolina. They, along with others, laid the foundation for the \nAmerica we strive to be, where all people are given an opportunity \nregardless of the color of their skin.\n\n  We have come a long way since then. Today, African Americans and \nminorities serve in every aspect of business, politics, and the legal \nprofession. They're represented in judgeships throughout the country. \nJohn Wesley Winters, Sr., who died just a few weeks ago at the age of \n84, was the first black Raleigh, NC, City Council member and one of the \nfirst black state senators of the 20th century. He was known as a \nbridge-builder between the races. And in 1992, my good friend Eva \nClayton became the first African American woman to represent North \nCarolina in Congress. And just last year, Mr. President, I was \nprivileged to support Allyson Duncan, confirmed as the first African \nAmerican woman to serve on the 4th Circuit Court.\n  Higher education is another area where strides have been made. North \nCarolina is home to 11 historically black colleges and universities, \nincluding Shaw University in Raleigh, founded in 1865 and the oldest \nH.B.C.U. in the South. And I was honored to give the commencement \naddress and receive an honorary degree several years ago from \nLivingstone College, another outstanding historically black college in \nmy hometown of Salisbury, NC, where Dr. Algeania Freeman currently \nserves as the first woman president. And I am so very proud that my \nhusband Bob is serving as chairman of a $50 million dollar fundraising \ncampaign at Bennett College in Greensboro, one of only two historically \nblack women's colleges in America. In fact, Bennett's president, Dr. \nJohnetta Cole, currently serves as national chair of the United Way, \nand in that capacity has worked with Hillary Clinton and me on \nlegislation to create a nationwide 2-1-1 line, a one-stop community \nservice referral system.\n  This month we honor the steadfast commitment of so many people, many \nof whom gave their lives so that African Americans could have the same \nopportunities as any other citizen in our Nation.\n  Today, as the Nation continues to celebrate Black History Month, I \nsalute this heritage and the fine citizens who have contributed to \nNorth Carolina's greatness. May we continue their work on behalf of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the days go by, I think it is more and \nmore important to recognize that Senators have friends on both sides of \nthis aisle. One of my great friends is Senator John Glenn and his wife \nAnnie. They have been very important people in my life. I have great \nmemories of times I spent with John Glenn privately.\n  For instance, I distinctly remember the time John and Annie asked my \nwife Catherine, my daughter Lilly, and me to go on their boat. It is \ncalled the SENIRAM. Few people, other than the occupant of the Chair, \nwould recognize that name, but if you spell it backwards, you will get \nthe point. We had a wonderful day with them. I have had wonderful times \nthroughout the years we have known each other since John and Annie came \nto the Senate.\n  Recently, I had the occasion to attend a dinner in his honor. Our \ndistinguished minority leader Tom Daschle was the keynote speaker. I \nthink the remarks Senator Daschle made about John Glenn and his career \nwere most appropriate and some of the finest I have heard.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of the distinguished \nDemocratic\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\nleader at the dinner honoring Senator John Glenn, an American hero, on \nthe 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first flight, Friday, \nDecember 12, 2003, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks by Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle Honoring Senator John \n                                 Glenn\n\n       From all accounts, Wilbur and Orville Wright were both \n     deeply shy. Once, at a big dinner in their honor, the host \n     gave an effusive introduction and then called on Wilbur to \n     make a speech. Poor Wilbur rose to his feet and after a long \n     stammer said, ``There must be a mistake. I think you want my \n     brother''--and quickly sat down. The host then called on \n     Orville, who replied, ``Wilbur just made the speech.'' I know \n     the feeling. What in the world do you say when you open for \n     John Travolta and John Glenn?\n       This is a thrill and an honor. I want to thank Spencer \n     Dickerson, president of the Aero Club of Washington, for \n     inviting me to be a part of this incredible evening. I also \n     want to thank FAA Administrator Marian Blakey, my partner in \n     this warm-up act and a truly outstanding public servant; \n     Admiral Wesley McDonald, chairman of the National Aeronautic \n     Association, sponsors of the Wright Trophy; and Don Koranda, \n     president of NAA. And to any Ohioans who are here, thank you, \n     too. There is something amazing about a state that gives the \n     world Wilbur and Orville Wright, Neil Armstrong and John \n     Glenn.\n       We are here tonight to pay tribute to a genuine, old-\n     fashioned American hero--a man with whom I was privileged to \n     serve for 12 years in the U.S. Senate and who I am honored, \n     and still a little amazed, to be able to call my friend.\n       We are also here to thank Annie Glenn. In his memoir, John \n     tells a great story about how hard Annie worked to overcome \n     her lifelong habit of stuttering. When she succeeded, about \n     20 years ago, she told him, ``John, I've wanted to tell you \n     this for years. Pick up your socks''--which makes Annie Glenn \n     possibly the only person on Earth who is not awed by John \n     Glenn. John may have been the one who strapped himself into \n     those rockets, but it was Annie's love, courage, and \n     unshakable faith in him that made John's space missions and \n     virtually everything else he has done possible. Thank you, \n     Annie Glenn.\n       A few months ago, Linda and I got a sneak preview of the \n     incredible exhibit on the centennial of flight that's now at \n     the Library of Congress. Of all the treasures in that \n     exhibit, what fascinated us most was a letter that you'll \n     find reprinted in tonight's program. It was written in 1908 \n     by Gutzon Borglum, the visionary sculptor who carved Mount \n     Rushmore out of the Black Hills of South Dakota. Linda and I \n     were surprised to learn that, in 1908, Borglum was also \n     president of the Aero Club of America--the forerunner of NAA.\n       He wrote this letter late on a September night. He was in \n     Washington--still awe-struck by something he had witnessed \n     hours earlier. For the first time in his life, he had seen a \n     man fly an airplane. That man was Orville Wright.\n       This is a small portion of what Borglum wrote: ``My dear \n     Ned, Well, hell's popping, the gasoline motor is in the air, \n     and man with outspread wings is astride of it! Orville Wright \n     has broken all previous records. He flew 67 minutes in a 16-\n     mile wind, handled his pair of planes like a chauffeur, and \n     rode the air as deliberately as if he were passing over a \n     solid . . . road. Nothing I have ever seen is comparable in \n     action to this gliding bird, save the ice-boat.'' He goes on \n     to say, ``This is not an experiment. Man has put, safely and \n     forever, his shod heel into the blue heavens, and glides \n     about as if on ice. ``Flight,'' he predicted, ``will rub out \n     the boundaries of the world.''\n       Someone said that, in that first flight at Kitty Hawk, the \n     Wright Brothers ``flew through the smokescreen of \n     impossibility.'' It's fitting that John Glenn receive the \n     Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy. And it is especially fitting \n     that he receive it tonight, just days short of the 100th \n     anniversary of the Wright Brothers' first flight--because \n     isn't that what John Glenn has done all his life--fly through \n     ``the smokescreen of impossibility'' and show us that we can \n     achieve more than we ever imagined?\n       We all have John Glenn stories we plan to tell our \n     grandchildren. One of mine is from about eight years ago when \n     Linda and I traveled to China with several other Senators and \n     their spouses, including John and Annie. On our flight home, \n     we persuaded John to tell us about the Friendship 7 flight. \n     He told us about the wonder and majesty of space--about the \n     beauty of the light particles that seemed to hang in space \n     like fireflies frozen in place. He told us about the joy he \n     felt when he flew over Perth, Australia at midnight and saw \n     that the entire city had left its lights on to help guide his \n     voyage. He told us about those moments when the world held \n     its breath--when the skin of the spacecraft caught fire from \n     the friction of re-entry and began to peel off in flaming \n     pieces--and those terrible 2\\1/2\\ minutes when he lost all \n     radio contact with the ground.\n       We all huddled around him, wide-eyed, on that flight. No \n     one moved. No one said a word.\n       Another story I will tell my grandchildren took place in \n     September 1998. It was just before John left the Senate to \n     begin his last, grueling month of training at NASA for his \n     return to space. The members of the Senate held a dinner for \n     him at the National Air and Space Museum. Not only were John \n     and Annie there, so was John's entire Discovery crew.\n       Before dinner, John and Annie graciously agreed to pose for \n     pictures with Senators--right next to the Friendship 7 \n     capsule! Now, you may not know this, but U.S. Senators are \n     not exactly famous for their willingness to wait in lines. \n     But that night, we all stood in line and waited--happily--to \n     have our pictures taken with our hero. It's not unusual for \n     Senators to like and admire their colleagues. But John Glenn \n     is that rare Senator who inspires in other Senators feelings \n     of sheer awe.\n       In his 24 years in the Senate, John's extrodinary knowledge \n     of aviation served America well. Over and over, it enabled \n     him to see essential issues instantly. I saw that ability \n     again on the morning of September 11, 2001.\n       John and I were in my office in the Capitol when someone \n     told us that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. We \n     turned on the TV just in time to see the second plane hit the \n     tower. In that first, terrible moment, when the whole world \n     seemed stunned and confused, John understood the nature of \n     the horror instantly. His eyes narrowed and he said simply, \n     ``Pilots don't fly into buildings.''\n       John's influence in the Senate extended far beyond \n     aviation.\n       People who've been there say you see the world differently \n     from space. You see how small and fragile our world is, and \n     you are forever changed by that knowledge. That is certainly \n     true of John Glenn. He fought to protect our fragile \n     environment. And no Senator ever worked harder to prevent the \n     spread of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear \n     weapons. For that, we owe him our undying gratitude.\n       One of the most remarkable things about John is that he \n     wears his heroism with such extraordinary modesty. Partly \n     because he'd already had enough fame and tickertape parades \n     before he came to the Senate--but mostly, I suspect, just \n     because of who he is--Senator Glenn never worried about \n     grabbing headlines. He worked quietly and diligently--with \n     Democrats and Republicans--to solve difficult problems. He \n     immersed himself in complicated but important issues--like \n     troop readiness, government ethics and campaign finance \n     reform.\n       He was willing to take on what he called the ``grunt work'' \n     of government. He looked at government with the eyes of an \n     engineer and tried to imagine ways it could work better. He \n     used his position on the Government Affairs Committee to \n     fight for efficiency in government. He was the author of the \n     Paperwork Reduction Act and the lead sponsor of laws \n     requiring inspectors general and chief financial officers in \n     all federal agencies.\n       He used his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee to \n     keep America's military strong, and to advocate for our men \n     and women in uniform, and for veterans.\n       He was a very good Senator. He was also a very popular one. \n     In 1974, the year he was elected to the Senate, he carried \n     all 88 counties in Ohio. In 1980, he was re-elected with the \n     largest margin in his state's history. The last time he ran, \n     in 1992, he became the first Ohio Senator ever to win four \n     terms.\n       In 1985, he responded to a magazine survey of Senators. \n     Next to ``favorite book,'' he wrote, ``In election years, the \n     Cuyahoga County voter registration rolls; in all other years, \n     the Bible.'' Next to ``aspirations after the Senate,'' he \n     wrote, ``retire gracefully.'' Back then, probably not even \n     Annie imagined what he had in mind.\n       Five centuries ago, Leonardo DaVinci wrote, ``Once you have \n     tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes \n     turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will \n     always long to return.'' Francis Gary Powers, the U2 pilot, \n     described the pull to return to the heavens differently. \n     After this first flight, at the age of 14, he told his \n     father, ``Dad, I left my heart up there.''\n       In 1996, at the age of 75, John set yet another speed \n     record by flying his Beechcraft Baron from Dayton, Ohio to \n     Washington, DC in 96 minutes.\n       In retrospect, we should have known then that something was \n     up.\n       I was among a group of Senators who went to Florida that \n     day to witness our friend's return to space. Our friend, \n     Senator Stevens, was there, too.\n       So much had changed in the 36 years since John's Friendship \n     7 orbit. Yet, some things were the same. Walter Cronkite came \n     out of retirement to cover the Discovery mission. The people \n     of Perth again turned on their lights to guide his voyage. \n     And we all learned once again, because of the extraordinary \n     courage of this man, that we can achieve more than we ever \n     imagined.\n       Some people think there are two John Glenns: Lt. Colonel \n     John Glenn, the astronaut-hero, and Senator John Glenn. In \n     truth, there is only one John Glenn--the patriot. Love for \n     his country is what motivated John Glenn to risk his life in \n     two wars. It's what kept him in the United States Senate for \n     24 years and what prompted him, in 1984, to run for \n     President. It is what sent him into space the first time and \n     what sent him back at the age of 77. Love for his country is \n     also why he is working today on a challenge that may be as \n     hard as the putting a man in space was in 1962: teaching \n     young people to understand and respect public service. He \n     believes in his\n\n[[Page S1450]]\n\n     bones what he said when he announced his retirement from the \n     Senate. ``Despite all our problems--despite our sometimes \n     inefficient bureaucracies . . . and all of the other problems \n     we love to complain about--this is still the greatest nation \n     in the history of the world, and still a shining beacon of \n     hope and opportunity.''\n       In July 1969, as the crew of the Apollo 11 prepared for \n     lift-off, Esther Goddard was speaking to an AP reporter. She \n     read these words from the diary of her late husband, Robert \n     Goddard, ``the father of American rocketry.'' ``When old \n     dreams die, new ones come to take their place. God pity a \n     one-dream man.'' Tonight, I thank God for giving us John \n     Glenn. By having the courage to live his many dreams, he \n     gives us the courage to live our own. Thank you, John. Thank \n     you, Annie. Godspeed to you both.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1450-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONFERENCE DELIBERATIONS ON H.R. 3108\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on Thursday, February 12, 2004, the Senate \nappointed conferees on the pension bill, H.R. 3108.\n  The legislation, as amended, passed on January 28 on an overwhelming \n86-9 vote.\n  Of course, the regular order on a bill of this type would have been \nto insist on the Senate position and appoint conferees to begin \nnegotiations with the House over the contents of this bill. Normally, \nthis would have occurred without comment immediately after passage of \nthe legislation.\n  Sadly, that was not the case.\n  Instead, the Senate was diverted into an argument over past patterns \nand practices--how many times a bill has gone to conference, or been \npreconferenced, or simply agreed to by the other body or who has been \nat what meeting, when, or where. This argument may mean much to a few, \nbut it stood in the way of the many.\n  The Senate and the House are different institutions, with different \nrules, different pressures, different Members, and different outlooks. \nThe most reasonable way for them to blend these differences is \ntogether, with representatives from both bodies sitting down at a \ntable, reconciling legislation that each House has endorsed as its best \nidea to resolve pressing national problems.\n  The pension legislation passed both the House and the Senate with \nlarge bipartisan majorities. In the Senate, the legislation was \ndeveloped over 3 months with bipartisan input from across the \nideological and party spectrum. Both leaders, as well as the chairmen \nand ranking members of the HELP and the Finance Committee, wrote the \nbill, negotiated with multiple interested members, and spearheaded the \nlegislation to passage.\n  When it came to the pension legislation, I listened carefully to what \nthe minority leader said in various statements. I was gratified by the \nleader's assurance, given on the floor February 4, that he was ``not \nasking for any predetermined outcome,'' and that he was ``not asking \nfor a certain set of expectations with regard to the legislation \nitself.'' Such an expectation on the part of any Member would have been \nanother sharp departure about how we do our work here.\n  It was the regular order that we go to conference on this \nlegislation. I also believe it is the regular order that Senate \nconferees, majority and minority, participate in conference \ndeliberations as compromise between the House and Senate is developed.\n  I will work with my Senate majority colleagues to validate this \ncommitment. We should not stymie over process when there is so much \nsubstance for us to work on, together, as the year progresses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1450-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1450-S1451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE POLITICIZATION OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's \nattention a speech given by Ambassador Thomas Pickering in which he \naddressed some important issues concerning the Foreign Service.\n  I had the privilege of hearing this speech during an event at the \nSmithsonian last year, and I know of no one better qualified to talk \nabout the Foreign Service than Ambassador Pickering. In over 41 years \nin the Foreign Service, Thomas Pickering served as ambassador to a \ndizzying number of important countries and international organizations, \nincluding Russia, India, Israel, Nigeria, and the United Nations. He \nalso happens to speak 5 foreign languages.\n  In his speech, Ambassador Pickering warns of the increasing \npoliticization of the Foreign Service. He points out that after \ndisastrous experiences in the Civil War and Spanish-American War, the \nUnited States military professionalized its officer corps. Today, with \nthe rise of international terrorism and the proliferation of other \ncomplex international problems, we should be thinking along the same \nlines.\n  However, we seem to be going in the wrong direction. Increasingly, \nindividuals who have done little more than donate to a political \ncampaign are being placed into key positions within the State \nDepartment. Ambassador Pickering appropriately points out that certain \npolitical appointees have and will continue to play an important role \nin pursuing U.S. diplomatic efforts overseas. Bringing individuals like \nHoward Baker and Felix Rohatyn, who possess unique skills, to the State \nDepartment is essential.\n  But the world is becoming more interconnected and more dangerous. \nInternational crises no longer confine themselves to remote corners of \nthe world. For example, the outbreak of a deadly disease in Africa is \nonly a plane ride away from the United States. We need seasoned, \ntalented individuals capable of effectively advancing U.S. interests in \nkey positions in Washington and abroad--not individuals whose primary \ntalent is digging into their pockets to donate to a political campaign.\n  I urge all Senators to heed Ambassador Pickering's address and ask \nunanimous consent that the entire speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n National Portrait Gallery's Paul Peck Presidential Award--Acceptance \n                Speech by Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering\n\n       Thank you very much for the kind introduction. I am \n     grateful to Strobe Talbott for his very kind remarks. Thank \n     you too for this extremely generous and most unexpected \n     award. I want to extend my warmest congratulations to Diana \n     Walker, my co-recipient tonight, for her great contribution \n     to portraying the presidency. I look forward to doing more \n     television shows together.\n       I am even more grateful for this award, given my \n     distinguished predecessors in receiving it, one of whom, \n     General Brent Scowcroft, is here tonight, and the high \n     respect I have for the members of the selection committee.\n       Let me also thank Mr. Peck for his unstinting generosity to \n     the Portrait Gallery, the Presidency and to the pursuit of \n     educational opportunities for disadvantaged Americans, \n     including African Americans and Hispanics and many others. \n     Your willingness to support so generously such worthy and \n     deserving causes is more than admirable. Were I not a \n     recipient of the award tonight, I would say with equal vigor \n     ``thank you for doing this for your country and its future.'' \n     I want too to thank all the cooperating foundations and \n     organizations that made the award and the evening possible.\n       I would be remiss in my own understanding of reality were I \n     not to say immediately that it has been my family who have \n     been my strongest supporters throughout my career in \n     government. I'm happy to have with me tonight my son Timothy \n     and members of his family, my daughter Margaret and members \n     of her family and most especially my wife Alice. To all of \n     them, but most especially to Alice, my firmest friend and \n     toughest critic through many fascinating assignments, I owe \n     the most, and they too should be receiving the award with me \n     in every sense of the word--they surely deserve it.\n       I have had the honor of serving every president since Harry \n     Truman, when I worked as a clerk in the U.S. Post Office and \n     for the U.S. Weather Bureau as a summer intern in the Arctic. \n     Since leaving the Foreign Service at the end of 2000, I have \n     also served on a number of official advisory committees to \n     U.S. departments and agencies.\n       My Foreign Service career was highly rewarding and in some \n     respects, very unusual. I've had the pleasure of serving on \n     all continents except Australia. But then too, I went to \n     university there under the Fulbright program. I also spent \n     three and one-half years in the U.S. Navy and over 41\\1/2\\ in \n     the Foreign Service.\n       I wallowed in diversity, both ethnic and religious. I had \n     the pleasure of being Ambassador to the world's only Jewish \n     state (Israel); to a Muslim country (Jordan); to the world's \n     largest Hindu state where Buddhism was born and where 150 \n     million are Muslims, which makes it the world's second-\n     largest Muslim state (India); to the largest Orthodox \n     Christian country in the world (Russia); to a predominantly \n     Roman Catholic republic (El Salvador); and to two countries, \n     while still both Christian and Muslim, contain very large \n     populations which practice traditional African religions \n     (Nigeria and Tanzania). It's been a wonderful career, even \n     though my mother often wondered why I kept moving around and \n     couldn't keep a steady job.\n\n[[Page S1451]]\n\n       Paul Peck is truly right. Public service, and we all serve \n     the President in that regard, is essential for our country's \n     survival and prosperity.\n       Last year, Mr. Peck encouraged us all to think about change \n     and improvements--about ways to make our service to the \n     Presidency and through the Presidency to all of the people \n     more effective and more valuable.\n       Tonight, I want to talk about two aspects of that service \n     and provide you some thoughts on improvement.\n       I do so in the certain knowledge that the Civil Service, \n     the military service and the Foreign Service of the United \n     States have made numerous sacrifices and provided enormous \n     opportunities for us all as citizens. We are lucky that for \n     the size of our population, we have one of the smallest \n     public services in numbers, both at the Federal and State \n     level, when we compare it with other countries around the \n     world.\n       Also, I see it as one which is generally dedicated, \n     intelligent and hard-working. Indeed, our public found out \n     how essential was our public service when just a few years \n     ago in a budget battle, there were selective shutdowns of \n     activities of the Federal Service and the public uproar was \n     immediate, vigorous and sustained.\n       However, I must tell you I am troubled by the fact that in \n     our presidential elections there has been an increasing \n     tendency for presidential candidates to run against our \n     public service. It's not just the talk of ``clean up the mess \n     in Washington'', but that plays a role in it. There have been \n     implications that the public service hasn't been faithful or \n     it has been lazy and self-indulgent, or that it has not met \n     the needs of the people. And the candidate of course will not \n     only throw out the rascals from the opposing party, but go \n     down to Washington and clean up ``that mess'' for once and \n     for all.\n       This has hurt the reputation of our career public servants \n     and I am concerned that in another oncoming electoral season, \n     we will see much of the same rhetoric repeated. I hope I am \n     wrong. I will keep my fingers crossed. But on the very off-\n     chance that any candidates are listening tonight, I ask them \n     to consider this issue carefully.\n       Secondly, I am concerned by the increasing, what I can only \n     call, politicization of our Civil and Foreign Service.\n       We all know that over the years, Congressional legislation \n     has sought to draw a clear bright line between public service \n     and the elected political leadership. Indeed, that is as it \n     should be.\n       As a public servant, I have understood the necessity for \n     loyalty to the President and his policies. That too is as it \n     should be. Our system has always provided a remedy if there \n     was conflict or confusion--resignation.\n       But let me mention that during recent administrations, in \n     the department that I know best, the Department of State, \n     there has been a general replacement in jobs, some well down \n     in the bureaucracy, of career appointments with political \n     appointments.\n       Let me also note that the plumb book which lists these jobs \n     has grown several fold over the last two decades, yet again \n     another indication of the pressure of politics on the public \n     service.\n       And then, let me mention something that I perhaps know even \n     more about--Ambassadors.\n       As an Ambassador who served coming from the Career Service, \n     I appreciate what my colleagues from outside the Career \n     Service have often brought to the job. There have been, and \n     continue to be, outstanding appointments to those jobs. Stu \n     Eizenstat and Howard Baker, and might I add Nancy Kassebaum \n     Baker in Japan, and Felix Rohatyn in France are but a few \n     fine examples, and there are many others--Max Kampelman and \n     Sol Linowitz among others.\n       What disturbs me is the large number of such appointments \n     for whom one cannot say they bring special knowledge, \n     background, experience or wisdom to the job. We must be frank \n     that they are there because they are being rewarded in the \n     main for their financial contributions to the winning \n     political party. At a time of war on terrorism that should \n     not be the standard for such service!\n       The spoils system went out in the 1880s, but this remnant \n     is not one that speaks well of our Presidency or indeed of \n     our needs at a time when we are the undoubted leader of the \n     world community in such a war.\n       One wag has remarked that the first job that was truly \n     professionalized by popular acclaim was brain surgery. And \n     after disastrous experiences in the Civil and Spanish-\n     American war, we professionalized our Military Officer Corps.\n       Right now, by tradition more than anything else, about 70% \n     of our Ambassadors are from the Career Service and 30% from \n     the outside. Not too long ago, a distinguished American \n     senator, who has gone on to serve at a high post in the \n     Executive Branch, led the fight for reducing that number to \n     10%. He was unsuccessful, but I don't believe the project \n     should be abandoned.\n       Where knowledge, experience and good training can make a \n     difference, America deserves the best. The Career Service is \n     organized to do that, and I would hope that this important \n     improvement, in what I believe is the spirit of Paul Peck's \n     Award, can be picked up and implemented in the future, \n     despite my full understanding of all the difficulties in \n     doing so. And I say that in full knowledge of the fact that \n     the Career Service needs to send its best men and women to \n     this assignment.\n       For me and for all of my colleagues in the Foreign Service \n     and with all of those with whom I worked in the Civil and \n     Military Service, it was and is always a privilege to serve \n     this country.\n       Every day was a day of new challenges and new \n     opportunities.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to SPEC \nJoshua L. Knowles of Sheffield, IA who courageously gave his life for \nhis country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He is the 10th Iowan to be \nkilled since the start of hostilities in Iraq. My deepest sympathy goes \nout to his parents, Sandy and Les, and his two sisters, Breanna and \nMichelle, as they deal with their loss. SPEC Joshua Knowles graduated \nfrom Sheffield-Chapin/Meservey-Thornton High School in 1999 where he \nplayed football. He enlisted in the Iowa National Guard 1133rd \nTransportation Company out of Mason City, IA, on February 18, 1999 and \nserved as a motor transport operator. Specialist Knowles was killed on \nThursday, February 5, 2004, when the cab of the military cargo truck he \nwas riding in was hit by mortar fire as the convoy passed through \nCheckpoint 6 at the Baghdad International Airport. He was in the cab \nwith fellow Iowan, SPEC Peter Bieber of Nora Springs, who was also \ninjured in the attack. Specialist Knowles will be honored posthumously \nfor his patriotic service to his country with the Purple Heart as well \nas the Bronze Star, which is awarded for members of the military who \ndistinguish themselves ``by heroic or meritorious achievement or \nservice while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United \nStates''. In a press statement, Specialist Knowles' family recalled a \nshirt that he had sent them from Iraq. The shirt says, ``U.S. Soldiers \nNever Die, They Just Take Cover Until the Next Mission'' which they \nsaid exemplified his attitude toward military service. We can all be \nproud of this exceptional Iowan and I know he will be greatly missed by \nall those who knew him. In giving the ultimate sacrifice for his \ncountry, Specialist Knowles showed himself to be a true hero and \npatriot. I again want to express my sympathy for his family and my \ngratitude for his courageous service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1451-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1451-S1453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CBO COST ESTIMATE ON S. 1072\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that a cost \nestimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office to accompany \nSenate Report 108-222, the committee report to S. 1072, the Safe, \nAccountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act, be \nprinted in the Record. The estimate was not available when the report \nwas filed by the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE\n\n     S. 1072--Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \n         Transportation Equity Act of 2003\n       Summary: Assuming appropriation action consistent with the \n     funding levels specified in the bill, and assuming the \n     appropriation of amounts necessary to complete highway and \n     environmental studies and regulations required by the bill, \n     CBO estimates that implementing S. 1072 would cost $172 \n     billion over the 2004-2009 period and about $48 billion after \n     2009.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 1072 would reduce direct \n     spending by about $1.7 billion over the 2004-2009 period and \n     by about $3.4 billion over the 2004-2013 period. Finally, the \n     Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enacting S. \n     1072 would reduce revenue collections by $52 million over the \n     2004-2009 period and by $130 million over the 2004-2013 \n     period.\n       S. 1072 would extend the authority for the Federal-Aid \n     Highway program. For this program, the bill would provide \n     about $218 billion of contract authority over the 2004-2009\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\n     period, and it would authorize the appropriation of about \n     $2.6 billion over the same period. S. 1072 also would require \n     the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) to complete certain studies and \n     regulations concerning highway construction and air quality.\n       Consistent with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act, CBO assumes for this estimate that the contract \n     authority for the Federal-Aid Highway program would continue \n     at the same rate provided immediately before the program \n     would expire at the end of 2009. Hence, this estimate \n     includes an additional $4.9 billion in contract authority in \n     each year over the 2010-2013 period.\n       S. 1072 would make several changes to current law that \n     would affect direct spending. The legislation would end \n     funding for DOT's Minimum Guarantee program, increase funding \n     for the Emergency Relief program, provide DOT the authority \n     to spend certain fees, and provide DOT the authority to share \n     monetary judgments pertaining to fraud in the federal highway \n     and transit programs with state and local agencies.\n       JCT estimates that enacting S. 1072 would result in lower \n     revenue collections by expanding the State Infrastructure \n     Banks program and by changing the eligibility requirements of \n     the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act \n     (TIFIA) program. Under current law, five states can use \n     grants from the Federal-Aid Highway program to fund a state \n     infrastructure bank. S. 1072 would extend that authority to \n     all states. S. 1072 would change the TIFIA program by making \n     smaller projects eligible for credit assistance. Both \n     provisions would decrease revenue collections by increasing \n     the use of tax-exempt bonds.\n       S. 1072 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA); any costs to state or local governments would result \n     from complying with conditions of federal assistance. In \n     general, the bill would benefit states by reauthorizing \n     federal highway programs for the next six years.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 1072 is shown in Table 1. The costs of \n     this legislation fall within budget function 400 \n     (transportation).\n       Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that S. \n     1072 will be enacted this spring. We also assume \n     appropriation action consistent with the authorization and \n     contract authority levels in the bill. Estimates of outlays \n     are based on historical spending patterns of the Federal-Aid \n     Highway program. CBO estimates that implementing S. 1072 \n     would cost almost $172 billion over the 2004-2009 period and \n     that enacting S. 1072 would lower direct spending by about \n     $3.4 billion over the 2004-2013 period. JCT estimates that \n     enacting S. 1072 would lower revenues by $130 million over \n     the 2004-2013 period.\n\n                                TABLE 1.--SUMMARY OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF S. 1072\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        2004         2005         2006         2007         2008         2009\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEstimated Authorization Level \\1\\.          392          417          431          440          450          464\nEstimated Outlays.................        4,192       25,005       32,571       35,645       37,273       37,765\n \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority........        6,232        5,523        6,806        6,404        6,503        5,098\nEstimated Outlays.................          -32         -161         -314         -376         -400         -415\n \n                                               CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nEstimated Revenues \\2\\............           -1           -3           -7          -10          -14          -17\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Under current law, most budget authority for the Federal-Aid Highway program is provided as contract\n  authority, a mandatory form of budget authority. Most outlays that result from the contract authority,\n  however, are subject to obligation limitations contained in appropriation acts and are therefore\n  discretionary. S. 1072 would provide contract authority for the Federal-Aid Highway program. CBO assumes\n  appropriation action will continue to limit outlays from the portions of the Federal-Aid Highway program that\n  are subject to limitations under current law as well as new components of the program that would be authorized\n  by S. 1072.\n\\2\\ Estimate provided by Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       Over the 2004-2009 period, S. 1072 would provide about $218 \n     billion of contract authority and authorize the appropriation \n     of about $2.6 billion for the Federal-Aid Highway program. \n     The bill also would require DOT and EPA to complete certain \n     studies and regulations. Assuming appropriation action \n     consistent with the contract authority and authorizations \n     specified in the bill, and assuming the appropriation of \n     amounts necessary to cover the studies and regulations, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 1072 would cost almost $172 \n     billion over the 2004-2009 period.\n       Under current law, most spending from the Federal-Aid \n     Highway program is considered discretionary because it is \n     controlled by annual limitations on obligations set in \n     appropriations acts. For this estimate, CBO assumes \n     appropriation action will continue to limit outlays from the \n     Federal-Aid Highway program.\n       S. 1072 would require DOT and EPA to complete certain \n     studies and regulations concerning highway construction and \n     air quality. The bill would require DOT to assess the \n     condition of the surface transportation system and develop a \n     plan to ensure this system will continue to meet the nation's \n     transportation needs, and it would require EPA to improve the \n     methodology for measuring air particles. The bill also would \n     require DOT to issue regulations to improve worker injury \n     rates and traffic flow during road construction, and it would \n     require EPA to issue regulations for the management of air \n     quality data during disasters. Based on information from DOT \n     and EPA, CBO estimates that completing these studies and \n     regulations would cost $7 million over the 2004-2009 period, \n     subject to appropriation of the necessary amounts.\n     Direct spending and revenues\n       The legislation would end funding for DOT's Minimum \n     Guarantee program, increase funding for the Emergency Relief \n     program, provide the authority to spend certain fees, and \n     provide the authority to share certain monetary judgments. \n     CBO estimates these changes would lower direct spending by \n     about $3.4 billion over the 2004-2013 period and reduce \n     revenues by $130 million over the same period. The bill's \n     changes in direct spending and revenues are detailed in Table \n     2.\n       Minimum Guarantee Program. Of the total amount of contract \n     authority for the Minimum Guarantee program, current law \n     exempts $266 million of contract authority for fiscal year \n     2004 from any limitation on obligations. Consistent with the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, CBO \n     assumes this program continues at the same rate through \n     fiscal year 2004 and in each of the following years. Under \n     this baseline assumption, $639 million of contract authority \n     for the Minimum Guarantee program is exempt from annual \n     limits on obligations set in appropriation acts, and the \n     resulting outlays are therefore considered mandatory. S. 1072 \n     would eliminate funding for this program. CBO assumes that \n     eliminating funding for the Minimum Guarantee program would \n     lower direct spending by $5.2 billion over the 2004-2013 \n     period relative to the current baseline.\n       Emergency Relief Program. Current law provides permanent \n     authority for the Emergency Relief program and limits the \n     program's obligations to $100 million each year. Because \n     appropriation acts do not control spending from the program, \n     its outlays are considered mandatory. S. 1072 would raise the \n     limit on obligations to $300 million each year. CBO estimates \n     that this provision would increase direct spending by $1.7 \n     billion over the 2004-2013 period.\n\n                                                             TABLE

S. 1072 would provide DOT the \n     authority to spend the fees without further appropriation. \n     Based on information from DOT, CBO estimates the department \n     will collect--beginning in 2005--$4 million each year from \n     participants in classes held by the National Highway \n     Institute and $1 million each year from participants in the \n     TIFIA program. CBO estimates that this provision would \n     increase direct spending by about $45 million over the 2005-\n     2013 period.\n       Monetary Judgments. S. 1072 would provide DOT the authority \n     to share monetary judgments pertaining to fraud in the \n     federal highway and transit programs with state and local \n     agencies. This provision would apply to judgments in criminal \n     prosecutions as well as civil judgments. Under current law, \n     monetary judgments that result from criminal prosecutions are \n     deposited in the Crime Victims Fund and later spent. Civil \n     judgments, however, are not spent under current law. The \n     federal government received an average of $18 million each \n     year in monetary judgments from civil cases over the 1999-\n     2003 period. Because the federal government pays most costs \n     associated with fraud investigations and generally requires \n     states to provide only 20 percent of the total cost for most \n     surface transportation projects, we expect that DOT would \n     share 20 percent of such judgments with the states. Hence, \n     CBO estimates that this provision would increase direct \n     spending by $4 million each year, beginning in 2005, and by \n     $36 million over the 2005-2013 period.\n       Revenues. Enacting S. 1072 would lower revenue collections \n     by expanding the State Infrastructure Banks (SIBS) and the \n     TIFIA programs. JCT estimates that enhancing both provisions \n     would lower revenues by $52 million over the 2004-2009 period \n     and $130 million over the 2004-2013 period.\n       Under current law, five states can use grants from the \n     Federal-Aid Highway program to fund a state infrastructure \n     bank. States use infrastructure banks to finance \n     transportation projects by providing loans to local \n     governments or repaying bonds. S. 1072 would extend that \n     authority to all states. JCT estimates that this provision \n     would increase the use of tax-exempt bonds and therefore \n     decrease federal revenues by $73 million over the 2004-2013 \n     period.\n       For a project to receive credit assistance under the TIFIA \n     program, current law requires the projects' total cost to \n     equal or exceed the lower of the following two amounts: $100 \n     million, or 50 percent of the states' grants from certain \n     highway programs in the previous fiscal year. S. 1072 would \n     change those two amounts to $50 million and 20 percent of the \n     states' highway grants. Credit assistance under the TIFIA \n     program can cover a portion of the remaining cost with tax-\n     exempt bonds. JCT estimates that enacting S. 1072 would \n     increase the number of projects that receive credit \n     assistance under TIFIA and, therefore, increase the use of \n     tax-exempt bonds, reducing revenue collections by $57 million \n     over the 2004-2013 period.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1072 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA. Any additional costs to state or local \n     governments to comply with grant conditions would be incurred \n     voluntarily. In general, the bill would benefit states by \n     reauthorizing federal highway programs for the next six \n     years.\n       Subtitle E, Environmental Planning and Review, would \n     clarify and expand existing conditions of aid by requiring \n     Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and states to \n     consider additional environmental factors during the planning \n     process and to update long-range transportation plans more \n     frequently. MPOs and states have to comply with various \n     transportation planning requirements in order to receive \n     federal assistance. According to MPO representatives, the \n     provisions of the bill may require smaller organizations to \n     hire additional staff, however, CBO does not expect those \n     costs to be significant. Furthermore, states and MPOs receive \n     various forms of funding under title 23 and title 49 that \n     would cover planning-related expenses. S. 1072 would increase \n     the amount of title 23 funds set aside for MPOs.\n       States would benefit from other provisions of the bill, \n     including funding to establish or update systems to report \n     incidents more quickly, to develop intermodal passenger \n     facilities, and to encourage the collection of tolls on \n     certain interstate highways and high-occupancy-vehicle lanes.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Spending: Rachel Milberg and \n     Deborah Reis.

Mr. President, the Hawaii State Legislature took a \nhistoric step on January 28, 2004, and invited education Superintendent \nPatricia Hamamoto to address a joint session of the house and senate, \nunderscoring the priority public education will be accorded during \ntheir legislative session.\n  As a teacher first, then principal and now superintendent, her words \nwere\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\nprogressive, and at times, provocative. She was honest about the \nsystem's shortcomings, clear on the improvements that need to be made, \nand focused on increasing student achievement by enhancing and \nsupporting the relationship between teacher and student.\n  Hawaii Superintendent Hamamoto's words are worthy of both local \naction and national consideration. I ask that the full text of her \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows.\n\n                    Superintendent Patricia Hamamoto\n\n                     THE STATE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION\n\n                            January 28, 2004\n\n       President Bunda, Speaker Say, members of the Legislature, \n     Lieutenant Governor Aiona, Congressman Abercrombie, \n     distinguished guests from our business, labor, military and \n     education communities, fellow citizens of Hawai`i, good \n     morning.\n       My name is Pat Hamamoto and I am a teacher, a principal, \n     and an educator. I believe teaching is one of our greatest \n     callings, and I spent 12 happy and productive years teaching \n     at Ilima Intermediate, Highlands Intermediate and Pearl City \n     High School.\n       As a classroom teacher, I was often frustrated with the DOE \n     bureaucracy. My 7th graders at Ilima struggled with math. I \n     wanted to make math ``real'' by relating it to something they \n     cared about, namely, money. So I set up a little in-class \n     economics lesson. When my students turned in work that was \n     acceptable, they got tokens they could use to buy classroom \n     supplies like pencils, rulers and notebooks. I'll tell you--\n     the lesson worked. The students saw the connection between \n     math and money and buying things, and they did enough good \n     work to empty out my supply closet. Now technically, I was \n     supposed to just give out those supplies, no strings \n     attached. So before I embarked on this program, I asked my \n     principal for permission. He said, ``Don't tell me! If I \n     don't know, I can't tell you no. Just do it.'' And so I \n     learned to work around the system. But teachers shouldn't \n     have to work around a system; the system should work for \n     them.\n       As principal of McKinley High School, I thought things \n     would get easier within the system. When we were renovating \n     McKinley's historic administration building, the whole campus \n     was dug up to put in new wiring. Since the trenches were dug \n     anyway, I thought it would be a perfect time to put in \n     conduit pipes to wire our campus for computer technology. I \n     was told no. The reason? It wasn't on the blueprints. \n     Finally, in frustration, I called the head of the Department \n     of Accounting & General Services, and asked for help. And he \n     helped. McKinley's students now have a school fully wired for \n     fiber optics. But principals shouldn't have to work around a \n     system or use personal connections; the system should work \n     for them.\n       As Superintendent of Schools, I recognize that a lot of \n     people consider me, and the people who work with me in the \n     DOE offices nearby, to be symbolic of the problem and \n     unwilling to change. Nothing could be further from the truth. \n     We have been changing this bureaucracy since the day I was \n     named Superintendent two years ago. Before I talk about how \n     we have changed and will continue to change, let me talk for \n     a moment about something that hasn't changed--our principals, \n     teachers and students who represent the best of what we are.\n       Our teachers work long hours, and pay for classroom \n     supplies out of their own pockets. Our principals are \n     dedicated to ``finding a way around the system'' to make \n     their schools rich learning environments. Our students are \n     excellent scholars, future scientists, inventors and CEOs, \n     future legislators and perhaps a Governor or two. They have \n     come from across the state to be here this morning, to remind \n     us of why we are here, and why public education deserves \n     every ounce of attention and support we can give it. \n     Principals, teachers, and students of Hawaii's public school \n     system, will you please rise and receive the acknowledgement \n     you deserve!\n       Despite the many achievements of our public education \n     system, I come before you today to report that Hawaii's \n     public education is simply not working as it should. It is, \n     in fact, obsolete. And in my view, this is the single biggest \n     problem we face as a state. Why? Because we are not properly \n     preparing Hawaii's citizens of the future, our workforce of \n     the future, our business and civic leaders of the future.\n       Too many of our teenagers fail basic eighth grade English \n     and math tests. They cannot qualify for journeyman \n     apprenticeships in the building trades. They have little hope \n     of decent-paying jobs that will allow them to raise and care \n     for their families. We are failing them, the next generation. \n     And that is not acceptable. I am not here to defend the \n     status quo. I am here to tell you we must all work together, \n     to transform public education in these Islands we call home.\n       I feel very fortunate to be standing here today because I \n     have never seen so much focus on public education in the news \n     media, on the fifth floor of this building and in these \n     legislative chambers. That attention is an opportunity for \n     all of us. It shows that the leaders in this state want the \n     best possible education for the boys and girls of these \n     islands. It shouts loud and clear that the opportunity for \n     change is upon us, and we must embrace it!\n       In everything we do from this day forward as we go about \n     the business of ``reinventing'' our education system, we need \n     to focus not on school boards or superintendents or labor \n     unions, not on Republicans or Democrats, but on the 184,000 \n     students in our charge. The question isn't who is right, but \n     what is right. I ask you to listen this morning with open \n     minds and open hearts, so that collectively we can make \n     informed decisions on what is best for our children.\n       Yes, the system of education governance is important. But \n     it is a political decision, to be made by you. So I won't \n     spend any of my time debating that issue. I will tell you \n     that I believe education reform in Hawai`i is only going to \n     happen at the most basic level--at the school and in the \n     classroom. I am opposed to additional Boards of Education \n     that add more layers of bureaucracy between our state school \n     board and the schools. More school boards will not improve \n     student achievement. I will forever champion the most direct \n     and unfettered route from that state governing board to that \n     individual school and ultimately the child in the classroom.\n       I couldn't agree more with Consultant William Ouchi's \n     conclusion from his book, ``Making Schools Work'', page 17, \n     which reads ``If you focus only on decentralization, you'll \n     get a decentralized district, but with low student \n     achievement.'' That is, obviously, not our goal!\n       Differences over school board structure have received a lot \n     of media and community attention, but it's encouraging to me \n     that there is consensus on so many issues that will make more \n     of a difference in the classroom.\n       Just look at areas where we already seem to be on the same \n     page:\n       One: Empowering principals and school communities by \n     providing more lump-sum funding directly to the schools and \n     giving them the authority and the flexibility to decide how \n     school funds are spent.\n       Two: Adopting the ``weighted student formula'' funding \n     plan. Hawai`i is known for equity in public education. Our \n     statewide funding system has provided that. Keiki in the \n     poorest communities are guaranteed the same level of \n     resources as those in wealthy neighborhoods. That's not true \n     in other states, where local property taxes finance \n     education. Hawai`i should be proud of having equalized \n     resources at the school level. But not all students are \n     created equal. Some have physical or psychological needs that \n     require special education. Others speak no English, come from \n     broken families or live with foster parents, and go home to \n     drugs and drug users. The ``Weighted Student Formula'' plan \n     allocates money based on the unique needs of each student. \n     That funding follows that student wherever he or she goes to \n     school, and equalizes opportunity at the student level. I \n     applaud everyone, from the Board, the Legislature, and the \n     Governor's CARE group, for their general agreement to adopt \n     this plan. It is the right thing to do, and I hope we do it \n     this year!\n       Three: Giving principals more training in finance and \n     administration so that they can, in fact, become true CEO-\n     educators on their own campuses. The Board of Education has \n     now made this a priority for DOE implementation.\n       Four: Providing parents a choice to send their children to \n     any public school that has room for them. Along with that \n     choice comes the responsibility to get your child to and from \n     school safely. Therefore, I believe in the long run, most \n     parents will go to the quality schools with quality programs \n     in their neighborhoods precisely because they are in their \n     neighborhoods, easy to get to, and part of the fabric of \n     their community. A logical extension of that belief is that \n     parents will do what they can to make their own neighborhood \n     schools better.\n       The new Board of Education, its leadership and members who \n     sit behind me on this dais, are to be commended for the many \n     hours of unselfish service they give to Hawaii's children. \n     They have indicated by their words and their actions that \n     they are committed to reinventing Hawaii's Public Education \n     System. This is an endeavor that must be undertaken jointly \n     by the Board, which sets policy, and by the Superintendent \n     and her team, who implement that policy. I am invigorated by \n     the leadership and courage I have seen coming from this \n     Board, and I look forward to working together in this \n     challenging and noble pursuit.\n       So, the Board and the Department are calling for help as we \n     reinvent our schools.\n       First: We must empower schools and principals in the way I \n     spoke of earlier, and accountability must go with the power. \n     That means requiring principals and teachers to make sure \n     that students meet standards. For example, by the end of \n     Grade 3, every student must read.\n       Second: Parents must know how their child is doing. We will \n     give parents and children user-friendly feedback--report \n     cards that parents and students can understand easily. \n     Parents are responsible to get their kids to school ready to \n     learn, and students need to be responsible for their own \n     learning.\n       Third: We will overhaul SCBM--School/Community-Based \n     Management. In its current form, it simply doesn't work the \n     way the framers of this policy had originally intended and \n     that was to improve student achievement. Therefore, as we \n     empower individual schools, we must arm School-Community \n     Councils with shared decision-making power, and give them \n     meaningful responsibilities over spending, and through \n     weighted student funding, insure student achievement. This \n     will mean training participants\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\n     to make these important choices and then trusting them to do \n     the right thing. A nameless worker in an office in Honolulu \n     should not be telling a principal in Honoka'a how to best \n     spend his or her school's budget. Therefore, I envision a \n     Board of Directors for each school, much like the models we \n     see in the business world, in churches, or at our private \n     schools. This Board would be made up of school and community \n     members, elected by the parents, staff, teachers, principals, \n     and even students in the older grades. They would have two \n     main responsibilities: develop their academic plan for \n     success which will get the educational results they desire \n     for their children and decide how best to spend their own \n     school's budgets! That, my friends, is local school \n     governance at the most basic and important level--every \n     school, with the parents, principals, teachers, staff and \n     students making their own decisions!\n       Fourth: We expect quality, and we need to pay for \n     performance. Principals should be put on performance \n     contracts so we can reward the top performers with \n     incentives, pay raises, time off, paid training or \n     sabbaticals, and move non-performers to another line of work. \n     Our professionals need to know that hard work and success pay \n     off. We must do this while respecting collective bargaining \n     and in cooperation with our partners in organized labor.\n       Fifth: As we empower principals, we need to have them on \n     the job for 12 months and pay them for it. CEOs in private \n     business don't work 10-month years. Every sector of our \n     society operates on a year-round basis. If business, \n     government, tourism, transportation, and utilities do it, \n     then principals, as CEOs of their schools, need to be on \n     the job year round. Teachers should be treated similarly \n     and have a financial incentive for professional \n     development. Teachers should be put on 11-month \n     contracts--10 months of teaching, plus an additional month \n     for 20 days of paid training.\n       Sixth: In order to make these ideas work, we need a common \n     public school calendar. Our current calendar, which has long \n     summer breaks, reflects a different age when parents needed \n     their children free to harvest the crops and support the \n     family. But we're in the technology and information age now. \n     A common year-round school calendar would include more \n     frequent breaks and vacation time for families and much-\n     needed opportunities to train teachers so that they may serve \n     your children better. And, it's more efficient.\n       Seventh and most important: If we are to truly reinvent our \n     system and make deep structural changes, it is time to \n     unshackle the DOE from other state departments that have so \n     much control over the quality of life in our schools in the \n     following ways:\n       In budgeting: Principals can never be sure how much \n     appropriated money will be released for their use and when it \n     comes, it comes too late. It's almost impossible to plan for \n     educational excellence that way. We envision a law that \n     requires that the Department of Budget and Finance release at \n     least 80% of a fiscal year's appropriation to the schools, \n     once that law is passed and signed by the governor, and early \n     enough for school councils to have the time to plan.\n       In the area of hiring: If the State Department of Human \n     Resources Development doesn't have a specific job description \n     in its civil service system that meets our needs, we cannot \n     hire for that job, even if we have identified the need and \n     have the money to do so. That makes no sense whatsoever, and \n     it's wrong. We want the authority and resources to set up our \n     own employment system to meet the unique needs of education. \n     The State Judiciary can do it now. Why not the Department of \n     Education?\n       With regard to construction and repairs: The current \n     process for school construction, repair and maintenance is \n     obsolete--just like the toilets, windows and doors in so many \n     public schools. The system, if you call something that \n     dysfunctional a ``system'', makes our kids wait too long for \n     decent basic facilities. We are at the mercy of the \n     Department of Accounting & General Services and Budget & \n     Finance for capital improvement projects and to repair \n     bathrooms. That's not right. Give us both the money and the \n     authority to do the capital projects, and the repair and \n     maintenance we know we need for better, safer and more \n     efficient campuses.\n       Finally, a word about centralized services: The DOE spends \n     1.7 billion tax dollars each year and we need to be managed. \n     If teachers are to be free to teach, and principals free to \n     lead that teaching, a lot of support work has to be done by \n     somebody--bus routes, custodial service, school lunch \n     programs, textbook purchases, compliance with the law and \n     union contracts. Services like this do lend themselves to the \n     efficiency of centralization. Schools will always need a \n     central administration to take care of these necessities, or \n     else the educators on campus will have to take time away to \n     do it. Our pledge to you is that we will continue to \n     aggressively look for ways of managing our needs cost-\n     effectively and responsibly.\n       The CARE committee's report rightly stated: ``So long as \n     responsibility is diffused, no one can be held accountable.'' \n     That's true. Hold me accountable and expect results.\n       But first, you must give me the tools and the space to do \n     the job. And you must give the Board the authority it needs \n     to do its job as well. While we need the help of the \n     Legislature and Governor Lingle and her Administration to \n     empower the schools so they can prepare our children for \n     success, we also need to be able to do the job without \n     interference or being told what our job is and how to do our \n     job. Don't tie our hands!\n       Now let's talk about what these changes I've proposed could \n     mean for the future. I see greater involvement in our public \n     school system by every sector of our economy. Not every child \n     is suited for or wants to attend college. We could benefit \n     greatly from smaller schools within schools dedicated to \n     teaching our young people trades and professions they can \n     pursue after graduation. I invite our partners in \n     organized labor unions, with their fine apprenticeship \n     programs, to expand their role in preparing our youth at \n     the high school level. I invite our business and \n     professional communities to allow us to place more \n     students in their businesses, to be ``learning labs'' for \n     the future.\n       The private school system in the state can help us, too. \n     Our gifted and talented teachers, the finest we have, would \n     love to have the opportunity to exchange ideas with some of \n     your finest minds. I know there are other partnerships toward \n     which we could work.\n       We are already partnering in several ways with one of the \n     most valuable and influential educational organizations in \n     our state . . . The Kamehameha Schools. Our State Department \n     of Education is proud of our own Hawaiian Language Immersion \n     Program--the Kula Kaiapuni, along with the Aha Punana Leo and \n     the many Hawaiian Immersion Charter schools. These schools \n     are known around the world as the model for indigenous \n     education. A partnership between Kamehameha Schools, Aha \n     Punana Leo and the DOE in sustaining this program seems a \n     natural extension to improve this important and unique aspect \n     of life in Hawai`i.\n       And think for a moment. In every one of the instances I \n     just mentioned, when you partner with the Department of \n     Education, you free up resources and funding that can go to \n     those who are truly the most needy in our system which allows \n     for the flexibility for us to do our job. I ask you as you \n     leave here to think about how you can support your \n     neighborhood public school.\n       I said at the beginning of my remarks that public education \n     is the concern of all of us; that one person cannot find all \n     the solutions to all our problems. Therefore I ask every one \n     of you here today, and every one of you listening from your \n     homes or your places of work, to link arms with us, to help \n     us along the road of change to our destiny of a free, first-\n     class public education for every child of Hawai`i. I am \n     announcing today that on March 27, 2004, less than two months \n     from now, the Board of Education and the Superintendent will \n     convene the first-ever statewide Education Summit to be held \n     here in Honolulu. It will consist of representatives from \n     every walk of life, from business and labor, from public and \n     private sectors, from the early education/pre-school \n     community, the University System and from our distinguished \n     private schools. I invite representatives from the Hawaiian \n     Community to join us in this effort. I invite teachers, \n     parents, principals, students, graduates, members of our \n     military community, whose children attend our public schools. \n     We will come together, we will come with our own ideas and we \n     will come prepared to listen to others' ideas. And we--we \n     will collectively decide what we need to do to reinvent our \n     public school system.\n       Let me conclude by saying the initiatives I've proposed \n     here, and the ones that will come out of the Education Summit \n     in March, will require new thinking, courage, a willingness \n     to take risk, and it will require change in the entire \n     government system, not just the Department of Education. I \n     challenge you to stand with me, to take the risk, to embrace \n     the change that is coming our way, and above all, to live up \n     to our obligation to the young people of our islands. We CAN \n     do it . . . and WE WILL!\n       Thank you and aloha.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1455-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In January 1999, Frank Breton, age 47, was convicted of hate crime \nassault for assaulting his neighbor in March because he believed the \nman was gay.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1455-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1455-S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DUANE HALVERSON\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, is my great honor and pleasure to \nbe acquainted with Duane Halverson. In his 33-year career with Land \nO'Lakes, he has helped sustain agriculture, independent producers, and \nlocal economies through his dedication and commitment to rural America \nand the cooperative way of doing business.\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\n  Through his leadership, farmers across America now control a \npowerhouse supplier of agricultural inputs--feed, seed, crop nutrients, \nand protection products as well as state-of-the art technical advice \nand expertise.\n  Duane learned his love of agriculture and the people who work in it \nfrom growing up on a family farm near Eagle Grove, IA. Like most farm \nkids, Duane was active in 4-H and FFA. He earned a bushel full of \nribbons from showing pigs and calves, and his 4-H projects focused on \nhelping improve his dad's hog operation.\n  Through 4-H and school, Duane also began honing his leadership \nskills. He was elected president of the Webster County Boys' 4-H Clubs, \nand during his senior year at Eagle Grove High School he was chosen Mr. \nFuture Business Executive of 1963 by the Future Business Leaders of \nAmerica.\n  It was in High school that he met his future wife Mary Voigt. They \nnow have two sons, Christian and Nicholas, and grandson, Jon.\n  After high school, he headed to Iowa State University where he earned \nhis bachelor's and master's degrees in agricultural economics.\n  In 1970, Duane was hired by Land O'Lakes as a corporate planner. It \nwas there where his illustrious career began. In 1978, he was named \nvice president of the petroleum division--the youngest vice president \nin the company's history. He rose through the ranks, heading up feed, \nseed, agronomy, international development and member services. By 1993, \nhe was executive vice president and managing Land O'Lakes combined ag. \nservices and dairy foods businesses. During his 5 years at the helm, \ntotal sales of Land O'Lakes doubled.\n  By the time he retired in December last year, Duane had helped build \none of the most dynamic cooperative business systems in the world.\n  Duane has dedicated his life and his career to the agriculture \nindustry. His legacy is a strong ag-supply cooperative system owned and \ncontrolled by those who do business with Land O'Lakes. Through his \nleadership, America will continue to be the bread basket of the world.\n  All of this is why it has been an honor for me to share his \naccomplishments today. We thank Duane Halverson. He deserves \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1456-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF ISIDORE NEWMAN SCHOOL\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Isidore \nNewman School as it celebrates 100 years of educating the children of \nNew Orleans.\n  When the school opened its doors on October 3, 1904, it was in a \nclass by itself. Then called Isidore Newman Manual Training School, it \nadopted a philosophy, in vogue at the time, that teaching children \nskills such as sewing and woodworking would enhance their minds. It was \nthe only school of its kind in New Orleans. On Newman's opening day, \nthe principal, James Edwin Addicott, explained the little-understood \nteaching concept to The New Orleans Times-Democrat: ``The manual \ntraining school does not attempt to teach any particular art or trade. \nWhat it does attempt is to educate the hand as an invaluable and \nnecessary aid in the development of the brain.''\n  The school was unique for another reason: its unusual assortment of \npupils. On that historic first day, the young Mr. Addicott stood at the \ndoors of his brandnew school and waited for 102 children to arrive from \na Jewish orphanage a few blocks away. It was for them that Isidore \nNewman, a German-Jewish, rags-to-riches immigrant, had endowed the \nschool. But Mr. Addicott also waited for 23 children from private \nhomes, Jewish and non-Jewish. For Mr. Newman had specified that this \nschool be open to all children, regardless of religion.\n  The school's reputation for academic excellence and top-notch \nfacilities spread, and within a few years, children from private homes \noutnumbered those from the orphanage. Gathered together in this unique \nenvironment--for New Orleans society was quite segregated at the time--\nthe children did just what the founders dreamed they would do: they got \nalong. The school became a haven of inclusiveness, and friendships \nformed on the playground lasted a lifetime.\n  By the 1930s, Newman had become a college preparatory school, no \nlonger offering courses in the manual arts. By the 1940s, the orphanage \nhad closed. But Newman continued to be the most religiously mixed prep \nschool in the city.\n  Newman's first century has been filled with triumphs, tragedies, and \nlots of laughs. The school has always felt like a large, extended \nfamily, where the development of the individual and the individual's \ndevotion to the whole are stressed equally. Newman instills in its \nstudents the value of service to one's community, while at the same \ntime encouraging the personal growth, intellectual and otherwise, of \neach child. The results have been remarkable. In 1985, Newman was \nrecognized as 1 of 281 exemplary schools in the United States by the \nU.S. Secretary of Education. It was one of only seventeen private, \nnonsectarian schools chosen. And Newman has been a model of diversity. \nIn 1968, Newman became the first private, nonparochial school in New \nOrleans to desegregate.\n  Today, Newman is an accredited, independent, coeducational school \nserving more than 1,100 students from prekindergarten through 12th \ngrade. The school's record of academic excellence is on a par with the \nbest prep schools in the Nation. Its graduates have gone on to the \nfinest colleges and universities. They have presided over Federal \ncourts. They counsel Presidents. They write bestsellers. They are \nRhodes scholars. They play professional sports. They run large media \nconglomerates and Fortune 500 companies, and they have been generous, \nimportant philanthropists and civic leaders in New Orleans and beyond.\n  I congratulate the school on reaching this important milestone, and I \nwish Newman all the best for another century of excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1456-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR HIGH SCHOOL VARSITY CHEERLEADING SQUAD\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in the Senate to pay \ntribute to the Paul Laurence Dunbar High School Varsity Cheerleading \nSquad from Lexington, KY. On February 8, the Paul Laurence Dunbar High \nSchool Varsity Cheerleading Squad won the Universal Cheerleading \nAssociation's National Championship in Orlando, FL.\n  For the young women on this squad this is not just a trophy, it is an \naffirmation that with hard work and determination, anything is \npossible. To accomplish this goal the members not only have to juggle \nlong practices and games, but they continue to achieve academic \nexcellence. Not only are these young women excellent athletes and \nstudents but they pride themselves in giving back to their community \nfor all the support they have received by doing community service, \nfundraising, and school public relations. The citizens of Lexington, \nKY, are fortunate to have the 2004 National Champions living and \nlearning in their community. Their example of hard work and \ndetermination should be followed by all in the Commonwealth.\n  I am very proud of the accomplishments these young women have made. I \nwould like to congratulate the members of the Paul Laurence Dunbar High \nSchool Varsity Cheerleading Squad for their success. But also, I want \nto congratulate their peers, coaches, teachers, administrators, and \nparents for the support and sacrifices they've made to help the Paul \nLaurence Dunbar High School Varsity Cheerleading Squad make their \ndreams a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1456-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1456-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1456-S1457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a treaty and a withdrawal which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1456-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1456-S1457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a treaty and a withdrawal which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/23/senate-section/article/S1457-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of February 12, 2004, the \nSecretary of the Senate, during the adjournment of the Senate, received \na message from the House of Representatives announcing that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 523.

A bill to promote a free press and open media through the \nNational Endowment for Democracy and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the International \nFree Press and Open Media Act of 2004.\n  This legislation will provide greater focus on, and more coordination \nof, initiatives to develop free, fair, legally protected, and self-\nsustaining press and media in the world.\n  A free press is enshrined as a cornerstone of democracy in the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. The Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights, passed by the United Nations in 1948, also proscribes \nfree press and media.\n  The United States government through various agencies and programs \nhas long been involved in helping to train journalists around the \nworld, and establish newspapers, magazines, and radio and television \nstations.\n  These programs, however, are not centralized in one bureau or agency. \nMany are orphans to other assistance programs. They are effective in \ntraining journalists, but they stop short of ensuring that the media in \na developing country has the necessary legal protections, follows basic \nrules of fairness and equal access, and can sustain itself financially.\n  In addition, these existing media programs are not established in \nways to leverage federal government spending with the assistance of \nAmerica's vibrant media sector. There is a strong desire by our finest \njournalism schools, newspapers, broadcasters, and marketing and \nadvertising enterprises to help build free press and open media in the \nworld. We also need to engage all the new media, like Internet \ncompanies and wireless forms of communications.\n  To better organize and focus these efforts, this legislation directs \nthe Secretary of State to provide funding to the National Endowment for \nDemocracy for the work a free press institute. For more than 20 years \nthe National Endowment for Democracy has been leading American efforts \nto help build the required democratic institutions of a free society. \nThe President's proposed 2005 budget wisely doubles the funding for the \nwork of the Endowment.\n  It is important to note that the National Endowment for Democracy and \nits four existing institutes--representing the two major political \nparties, business, and labor--have established a reputation in the \nworld for integrity and transparency. They are ambassadors of the best \ntraditions of American democracy, and they have provided continuity to \ndemocratization efforts, even as administrations and policies have \nchanged.\n  Having served on the board of the Endowment for a number of years, as \nhave some of my colleagues, I can attest that the independence of the \nNED is central to the success of its initiatives to help develop a free \npress in the world. This bill seeks to employ the uniquely independent \norganization of the NED to accomplish a mission that complements public \ndiplomacy, but is separate from it. The U.S. government maintains \nimportant public diplomacy programs, where the goal is to communicate \nAmerican views to the world. But developing a free press in emerging \ndemocracies goes beyond advocacy of American views. It requires us to \nhave a tolerance for criticism, to take into account cultural \ndifferences, and to commit to long-term projects. The NED is suited to \nthis mission.\n  A fully successful U.S. foreign policy requires that we make progress \nin building democratic institutions internationally, especially free \nand open media. Societies that are built on the foundation of a free \npress are far less likely to abuse human rights or threaten American \nsecurity.\n  I look forward to the support of my colleagues on this legislation, \nand hope for speedy consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2096\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Free Press and \n     Open Media Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is in the national interest of the United States to \n     promote the development of free press and open media around \n     the world, as such development increases the national \n     security of the United States.\n       (2) A free press and open media, including traditional \n     forms of communications such as print media, television, and \n     radio programming, and films and entertainment media, as well \n     as emerging forms of communication such as media transmitted \n     on the Internet and by wireless transmissions, are among the \n     foundations of democratic institutions in an open society \n     that respects human rights.\n       (3) A free press and open media can best be achieved if the \n     press and media--\n       (A) are located in a country that--\n       (i) has legal protections to ensure that the press and \n     media are independent of government control or subversion and \n     are able to deliver information without impediment; and\n       (ii) has journalists, editors, publishers, producers, and \n     business executives who are practiced in the basic concepts \n     of fairness and equal access in a civil society; and\n       (B) are able to be financially self-sufficient through \n     subscription fees, advertising revenues, donations, or other \n     funding mechanisms.\n       (4) Private sector groups in the United States, including \n     businesses and nongovernmental organizations, have carried \n     out a variety of activities to promote free press and open \n     media in foreign countries.\n       (5) There is a need to establish an entity--\n       (A) to address issues related to the development of a free \n     press and open media; and\n       (B) to bring together individuals and institutions to \n     organize and focus greater attention on the establishment of \n     new, and the enhancement of existing, free media programs \n     throughout the world.\n       (6) The National Endowment for Democracy (in this section \n     referred to as the ``NED'') is a nonprofit, federally funded, \n     grantmaking, nongovernmental organization recognized by \n     Congress in the National Endowment for Democracy Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 4411 et seq.).\n       (7) The NED has historically provided support and \n     coordination of the activities of private sector groups and \n     nongovernmental organizations that promote democratic \n     institutions.\n       (8) The NED has received strong bipartisan support from \n     Presidents and Congress since it was established in 1983.\n\n[[Page S1460]]\n\n       (9) The NED is the appropriate entity--\n       (A) to address issues related to the development of a free \n     press and open media; and\n       (B) to bring together individuals and institutions to \n     organize and focus greater attention on the establishment of \n     new, and enhancement of existing, free media programs \n     throughout the world.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) Purposes of the Endowment.--Section 502(b) of the \n     National Endowment for Democracy Act (22 U.S.C. 4411(b)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``rights)'' and inserting \n     ``rights and freedom of the press and other media)'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and business;'' and \n     inserting ``business, and media;'';\n       (3) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``media,'' after \n     ``business,''; and\n       (4) in paragraph (5), by inserting ``media,'' after \n     ``business,''.\n       (b) Funds To Promote Freedom of the Press.--Section 503 of \n     the National Endowment for Democracy Act (22 U.S.C. 4412) is \n     amended by striking subsection (e) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(e) Not less than 10 percent of the amounts made \n     available to the Endowment for fiscal year 2005 should be \n     made available for programs to promote freedom of the press \n     and other media.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 2097. A bill to establish formally the United States Military \nCancer Institute, to require the Institute to promote the health of \nmembers of the Armed Forces and their dependents by enhancing cancer \nresearch and treatment, to provide for a study of the epidemiological \ncauses of cancer among various ethnic groups for cancer prevention and \nearly detection efforts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the U.S. Military Cancer \nInstitute Research Collaborative Act of 2004. This legislation would \nformally establish the U.S. Military Cancer Institute (USMCI), and \nsupport the collaborative augmentation of research efforts in cancer \nepidemiology, prevention and control. Although the USMCI already exists \nas an informal collaborative effort, this bill will formally establish \nthe institution with a mission of providing for the maintenance of \nhealth in the military by enhancing cancer research and treatment, and \nstudying the epidemiological causes of cancer among various ethnic \ngroups. By formally establishing the USMCI, it will be in a better \nposition to unite military research efforts with other cancer research \ncenters.\n  Cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment are significant \nissues for the military population, thus the USMCI was organized to \ncoordinate the existing military cancer assets. The USMCI has a \ncomprehensive database of its beneficiary population of 9 million \npeople. The military's nationwide tumor registry, the Automated Central \nTumor Registry, has acquired more than 180,000 cases in the last 14 \nyears, and a serum repository of 30 million specimens from military \npersonnel collected sequentially since 1987. This population is \npredominantly Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic.\n  The Director of the USMCI, Dr. John Potter, is a professor of surgery \nat the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). A \nhighly talented cancer epidemiologist, Dr. Kangmin Zhu, has also been \nrecruited to lead the USMCI Prevention and Control Programs.\n  The USMCI currently resides in the Washington, DC area, and its \ncomponents are located at the National Naval Medical Center, the \nMalcolm Grow Medical Center, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, \nand the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute. There are more \nthan 70 research workers, both active duty and Department of Defense \ncivilian scientists, working in the USMCI.\n  The USMCI intends to expand its research activities to military \nmedical centers across the Nation.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide 100 percent reimbursement for medical assistance provided to a \nNative Hawaiian through a federally-qualified health center or a Native \nHawaiian care system; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Native Hawaiian \nMedicaid Coverage Act of 2004. This legislation would authorize a \nFederal Medicaid Assistance Percent (FMAP) of 100 percent for the \npayment of health care costs of Native Hawaiians who receive health \ncare from Federally Qualified Health Centers or the Native Hawaiian \nHealth Care System.\n  This bill was originally a provision within the Medicare Prescription \nDrug Bill, which the Senate passed by an overwhelming majority of 76 to \n21, but was dropped from the final Medicare Prescription Drug \nConference Report.\n  This bill is modeled on the Native Alaskan Health Care Act, which \nprovides for a Federal Medicaid Assistance Percent (FMAP) of 100 \npercent for payment of health care costs for Native Alaskans by the \nIndian Health Service, an Indian tribe, or a tribal organization.\n  Community health centers serve as the ``safety net'' for uninsured \nand medically underserved native Hawaiians and other United States \ncitizens, providing comprehensive primary and preventive health \nservices to the entire community. Outpatient services offered to the \nentire family include comprehensive primary care, preventive health \nmaintenance, and education outreach in the local community. Community \nhealth centers, with their multi-disciplinary approach, offer cost \neffective integration of health promotion and wellness with chronic \ndisease management and primary care focused on serving vulnerable \npopulations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 2098\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent the \ninjunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted \nto the Senate on February 23, 2004, by the President of the United \nStates, U.N. Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, Treaty \nDocument 108-16.\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred with the accompanying papers to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the United Nations Convention Against \nTransnational Organized Crime (the ``Convention''), as well as two \nsupplementary protocols: (1) the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and \nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, and (2) \nthe Protocol Against Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, which \nwere adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 15, \n2000. The Convention and Protocols were signed by the United States on \nDecember 13, 2000, at Palermo, Italy.\n  Accompanying the Convention and Protocols are interpretative notes \nfor the official records (or ``travaux preparatoires'') that were \nprepared by the Secretariat of the Ad Hoc Committee that conducted the \nnegotiations, based on discussions that took place throughout the \nprocess of negotiations. These notes are being submitted to the Senate \nfor information purposes. I also transmit the report of the Department \nof State with respect to the Convention and Protocols.\n  The Convention and Protocols are the first multilateral treaties to \naddress the phenomenon of transnational organized crime. Their \nprovisions are explained in the accompanying report of the Department \nof State. The report also sets forth proposed reservations and \nunderstandings that would be deposited by the United States with its \ninstruments of ratification. With these reservations and \nunderstandings, the Convention and Protocols will not require \nimplementing legislation for the United States.\n  The Convention and Protocols will be effective tools to assist in the \nglobal effort to combat transnational organized crime in its many \nforms, such as trafficking and smuggling of persons. They provide for a \nbroad range of cooperation, including extradition, mutual legal \nassistance, and measures regarding property, in relation to serious \ncrimes committed by an organized group that has a transnational \nelement.\n  The Convention also imposes on the States Parties an obligation to \ncriminalize, if they have not already done so, certain types of conduct \ncharacteristic of transnational organized\n\n[[Page S1463]]\n\ncrime. For the Convention, these are: participation in an organized \ncriminal group (i.e., conspiracy), money laundering, bribery of \ndomestic public officials, and obstruction of justice. The Protocols \nrequire parties to criminalize trafficking in persons and smuggling of \nmigrants. These provisions will serve to create a global criminal law \nstandard for these offenses, several of which (e.g., trafficking in \npersons) currently are not criminal in many countries. The Trafficking \nProtocol also includes important provisions regarding assistance to and \nprotection of victims of trafficking.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Convention and Protocols, and that it give its advice and consent \nto ratification, subject to the reservations and understandings \ndescribed in the accompanying report of the Department of State.\n                                                      George W.

While I did not want to \nhave to file cloture, it became apparent that our Democratic colleagues \nwould not let us move forward with this legislation either. The cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to the gun liability bill will occur on \nWednesday.\n  I inform my colleagues that the cloture vote on the medical \nmalpractice bill will be the first vote of the day tomorrow.
